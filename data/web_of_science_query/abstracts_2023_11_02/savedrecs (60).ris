TI  - Detailed Mapping of Urban Land Use Based on Multi-Source Data: A Case Study of Lanzhou
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed urban land use information is the prerequisite and foundation for implementing urban land policies and urban land development, and is of great importance for solving urban problems, assisting scientific and rational urban planning. The existing results of urban land use mapping have shortcomings in terms of accuracy or recognition scale, and it is difficult to meet the needs of fine urban management and smart city construction. This study aims to explore approaches that mapping urban land use based on multi-source data, to meet the needs of obtaining detailed land use information and, taking Lanzhou as an example, based on the previous study, we proposed a process of urban land use classification based on multi-source data. A combination road network dataset of Gaode and OpenStreetMap (OSM) was synthetically applied to divide urban parcels, while multi-source features using Sentinel-2A images, Sentinel-1A polarization data, night light data, point of interest (POI) data and other data. Simultaneously, a set of comparative experiments were designed to evaluate the contribution and impact of different features. The results showed that: (1) the combination utilization of Gaode and OSM road network could improve the classification results effectively. Specifically, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient are 83.75% and 0.77 separately for level I and the accuracy of each type reaches more than 70% for level II; (2) the synthetic application of multi-source features is conducive to the improvement of urban land use classification; (3) Internet data, such as point of interest (POI) information and multi-time population information, contribute the most to urban land use mapping. Compared with single-moment population information, the multi-time population distribution makes more contributions to urban land use. The framework developed herein and the results derived therefrom may assist other cities in the detailed mapping and refined management of urban land use.

TI  - Influences of Prescribed Burning on Regional Forest Burning Probability
T2  - Forest Research
M3  - Article
AB  - [Objective] Burning probability model was used to simulate fire burning on the landscape scale and the impacts of prescribed burning on forest flammability were assessed quantitatively. [Method] The data about fuel conditions of some areas of Daxing 'anling after prescribed burning before the fire season of 2016 were extracted from SPOT6 satellite data. The daily weather indices in the fire season were calculated with the weather observation data near the study area by using R-software. The burning probability and fire behavior indices of the forest were simulated with BURN-P3 model for the scenarios with and without prescribed burning. [Result] The areas treated with prescribed burning in 2016 were 44,931 hm(2), accounting for 20.8% of the total area. The average burning probability was 0.0164 and 0.0124 for the scenarios with and without prescribed burning. The average burning probability for each fuel type respectively decreased by 4.2% for deciduous coniferous forest, 3.5% for evergreen coniferous forest, 5.9% for coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, 2.3%for grass, and 0.6% for broad-leaved forest after prescribed burning. The average fire intensity and spread speed were 548.9 kW/m(2) and 2.2 m/min under the scenario with prescribed burning. The average fire intensity and spread rate decreased by 17.9% and 24.3% due to prescribed burning. Deciduous coniferous forests and mixed forest showed high fire intensity and spread speed, and are easy to occur crown fires. The proportion of crown fire reduced by 11.7% after prescribed burning. [Conclusion] The prescribed burning could decrease the distribution areas of grass fuel and fuel loadings. The burn probability, fire intensity, rate of spread and crown fire fraction of the region decrease after prescribed burning. The burning probability will drop obviously in the buffer areas with 2500 m wide around the prescribed burning regions.

TI  - Video surveillance reveals a community of largely nocturnal <i>Danaus plexippus</i> (L.) egg predators
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus L.) declines in eastern North America have prompted milkweed host plant restoration efforts in non-agricultural grasslands. However, grasslands harbor predator communities that exert high predation pressure on monarch eggs and larvae. While diurnal monarch predators are relatively well known, no studies have investigated the contribution of nocturnal monarch predators. We used video cameras to monitor sentinel monarch eggs and fourth instars on milkweed in southern Michigan to identify predators and determine if nocturnally-active species impose significant predation pressure. We observed ten arthropod taxa consuming monarch eggs and larvae, with 74% of egg predation events occurring nocturnally. Taxa observed attacking monarch eggs included European earwigs (Forficula auricularia L.), tree crickets (Oecanthus sp.), lacewing larvae (Neuroptera), plant bugs (Miridae), small milkweed bugs (Lygaeus kalmii Stal), ants (Formicidae), spiders (Araneae: Salticidae and other spp.), harvestmen (Opiliones), and velvet mites (Trombidiformes: Trombidiidae). Larvae were attacked by ground beetles (Calleida sp.), jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae), and spined soldier bugs (Podisus maculiventris Say). Our findings provide important information about monarch predator-prey interactions that could be used to develop strategies to conserve monarchs through reducing predation on early life stages.

TI  - A SYMBOLIC LIMIT OF FRONTIER: "THE GENE POOL OF PEOPLE" AND MIGRATION, PAST AND PRESENT
T2  - ZHURNAL FRONTIRNYKH ISSLEDOVANII-JOURNAL OF FRONTIER STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The author considers the problem of contemporary symbolic restrictions of the frontier of migration flows. The role of ethnogenetics in the design of imaginary boundaries between representatives of ethnic groups, migrants and the local population is determined. Social and political features of the society are revealed, which make the narratives about biological differences of peoples prestigious and relevant. The hypothesis about the important role of myths about blood relationship in the mobilization of population is proposed. The prevalence of ideas about the biological component of ethnic identity is explained by the presence of elements of (post) traditional culture in the modernizing society. The Soviet and contemporary stages of formation and development of ethnogenetics are analyzed. An attempt is made to characterize the worldview of the leaders of ethnogenetics using available sources. It is stated that the ethnogeneticists have traditional conservative views with a religious component. The characteristics of the methodological foundations of the work of leading ethnogeneticists are given. The conclusion is made about the serious theoretical contradictions in the constructions of ethnogeneticists: the physiological parameters of the composite urbanized and mobile population are placed on a par with the similar indicators of endogamous small populations (often isolates), which creates the illusion of a stable structure of the gene pool. The author indicates the direct identification of the population and the people ("ethnos") in the dissertational works and articles of Russian ethnogeneticists in the leading profile journal "Genetics". An imaginary obstacle to the migration frontier postulated by the scholars as necessity to "preserve the structure of the gene pool" and "genetic security of the people" can be included in the arsenal of anti-migrant rhetoric and criticism of mixed marriages.

TI  - The role of multiple stressors in a dwarf red mangrove (<i>Rhizophora mangle</i>) dieback
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are habitat-forming foundation species that provide the framework for entire coastal communities. Unfortunately, mangrove forests are declining globally, often due to multiple stressors. We report a recent mangrove dieback on Abaco Island, The Bahamas, that appears to be the result of multiple stressors. First, we investigated the role of hurricane and drought events in relation to green vegetation in the dieback area, as measured using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We used historical Landsat imagery of the dieback region from 1989 to 2013 to identify changes in green vegetation and to determine when the dieback likely began. We determined that the dieback began around 2008, but found little evidence of a relationship between NDVI and hurricane or drought events, particularly in relation to the estimated start of the dieback. Preliminary observations in the dieback area suggested grazing by leaf-chewing organisms and disease were both present at high levels. We surveyed individual mangrove trees to determine the intensity of leaf-chewing herbivory and foliar disease on mangroves in the dieback area. We found leaf-chewing herbivory ranged from 0 to 79%, with a mean of 29% of leaves chewed per tree and disease incidence ranged from 0% to 97% with a mean of 47%. Finally, we conducted a simulated grazing experiment to test if experimental opening mimicking grazing could facilitate disease infection in mangroves. Experimental opening of plant tissues showed that grazing can increase disease. Our results suggest that drought and hurricanes did not initiate this dieback, but that herbivory likely facilitated the spread of disease thereby contributing to the dieback.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy versus elective neck dissection in early-stage oral cancer: a systematic review
T2  - EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose To provide a summary of the evidence on the comparative effectiveness of two surgical treatment strategies, sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and elective neck dissection (END), in patients with T1-T2 oral cancer and clinically negative (cN0) neck, in terms of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and neck recurrence rates (NRRs). Methods A systematic review was performed by including studies published up to April 2019. Meta-analysis was performed to compare NRRs between SNB and END. A narrative summary of the results was generated for OS, DFS and morbidity outcomes. The certainty of evidence was assessed according to the GRADE methodology. Results No randomized studies were retrieved. Five observational studies were included in the comparative effectiveness analysis and four observational studies were included in the comparative morbidity analysis. The pooled risk ratio showed no differences in NRRs between SNB and END (10.5% vs 11.6%; pooled RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.67-1.76). No differences in OS or DFS between the two treatments were found. SNB appears to be associated with a lower rate of postoperative complications and lower shoulder dysfunction than END. Conversely, the results of the quality of life (QoL) questionnaires are not sufficient to advocate a particular strategy. Conclusion Our review highlights the lack of well conducted and randomized studies comparing SNB to END, leading to poor clinical evidence. Although our findings suggest no significant differences in OS, DFS and NRR between the two strategies, the certainty of our evidence is too low to make it useful for clinical decision making.

TI  - Detrimental environmental impact of large scale land use through deforestation and deterioration of carbon balance in Istanbul Northern Forest Area
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored the environmental impact of the large-scale projects, the 3rd Bridge across the Bosphorus and 3rd Airport, carried out in the last decade leading to the massive deterioration of the northern forest area in Istanbul. Destroyed forest area was assessed through relevant changes in land classification detected by multi-temporal Landsat data of Istanbul between 2009 and 2016. The magnitude of destroyed carbon stocks and related CO2 emission together with the reduction in the CO2 absorption potential inflicted by massive land-use change were also calculated. Observed results indicated that approximately 15,000 ha of forest area was destroyed in 7 years, corresponding to a 7% ultimate loss in the total forest area. The total land cover change for the same period was determined as 11.5% of the study area. The extent of land cover changes indicated that more than 4.4 million tons of CO2 were additionally emitted to the atmosphere, due to observed reduction of carbon stocks between 2009 and 2016. More than 70% of the total C/CO2 emission associated with land cover changes could be attributed to the loss of forest land. In addition, destroyed forestland corresponded to a CO2 absorption loss of 0.3 million tons CO2/year equivalent to the emission of 830,000 people in Istanbul.

TI  - Mapping snow cover using landsat data: toward a fine-resolution water-resistant snow index
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is of significant importance to freshwater supplies and influences the hydrology of different altitudes in mountainous regions. The monitoring of snow cover over the Mediterranean region of Turkey is of high priority due to its rapid irregularities experienced during the past decades. These irregularities in snow cover might especially lead to severe risks for the local ecosystems, such as rivers, and irrigated agriculture. Water-Resistant Snow Index (WSI) is a new and powerful spectral index for mapping snow cover using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. There still exists a large knowledge gap about how to improve the finer resolution applications of WSI. This study aimed to explore the applicability of WSI using Landsat TM and OLI images with a better spatial resolution to a complex catchment in the eastern Mediterranean region of Turkey. The WSI maps derived from both MODIS/Terra-MOD09A1 and Landsat images from 2005 to 2018 were compared with the high-resolution Sentinel-2A data. The comparative analysis of the MODIS and Landsat WSI maps for the snowy areas was also presented with error distribution patterns. The baseline snow cover led to the coefficient of determination values of 0.77 with the MODIS data and 0.78 with the Landsat data. The results indicated that Landsat images offered a suitable spatial resolution for the snow cover mapping using the WSI approach in regional studies. A finer resolution mapping of snow cover with the Landsat data can provide essential insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics at the local and regional scales.

TI  - Impact of Land use Land cover change on Storm Runoff Generation: A case study of suburban catchments of Pune, Maharashtra, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has evolved as one of the key factors responsible for the environmental health not only for the urban centres, but also for the suburban regions. In the recent years, most of the suburban regions in India are experiencing flash floods during the high intensity low duration rainfall condition. Such situations of flash floods in the urban and suburban areas are referred to as storm runoff. This paper deals with the computation of storm runoff in the suburban catchments of the Pune City. Five catchments, known for flash floods in the recent years, are identified for the present work. Storm runoff estimations in these catchments have been done using LandsatTM data of 1989 and 2011. Population-calibrated impervious surfaces (IS) were extracted for these catchments, and runoff has been calculated using the Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number method. Major changes in the land use land cover pattern in these 22 years have been detected, with a net growth in built-up area of almost 10 times from 1989 to 2011, leading to the increase in IS in the catchment. The impact of increase in built-up area and IS has augmented storm runoff in the catchment. Estimated runoff values increased from 461.8 m(3) to 1068.52 m(3) (Baner), 2026.4 m(3) to 3638.73 m(3) (Kharadi), 2947.5 m(3) to 4736.46 m(3) (Kondhwa Ghorpadi ), 1021.1 m(3) to 2039.57 m(3) (Wadgaon Sheri) and 1176.89 m(3) to 3691.18 m(3) (Wadgaon Budruk) from 1989 to 2011. Thus, it is quite evident that the growth in built-up area and impervious surfaces has enhanced the capacity of suburban basins to generate more runoff.

TI  - An improved FAHP based methodology for groundwater potential zones in Longchuan River basin, Yunnan Province, China
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Longchuan River Basin is located in Chuxiong (central Yunnan province, China) that is subject to severe drought. Agriculture is critical to local economy, which can lead to intense agricultural activity. Accordingly, delineating groundwater potential zones and developing usable groundwater resources are required to meet potable and irrigating water demands in the zone. Remote sensing (RS), geographic information system (GIS) and improved fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) were adopted to delineate the groundwater potential zones to assess the groundwater availability in Longchuan River Basin. The surveys of China geological map, Landsat 8 OLI and GDEM Aster satellite images were employed to generate eight thematic layers, i.e., lithology, land use/land cover (LULC), lineaments density, rainfall, slope, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), drainage density and elevation; subsequently, the mentioned layers were converted into raster data in ArcGIS. According to the ability of thematic layer to impact groundwater potential, the mentioned criteria were weighted differently by improved FAHP. Next, a map based on weighted linear combination (WLC) model was generated. Lastly, the groundwater potential zones of study area fell into 'poor' zone, 'moderate' zone and 'good' zone. As revealed from the results of the study, nearly 31.22% of the area exhibited 'good' groundwater potential, approximately 36.46% was terrain exhibiting 'moderate' groundwater potential, and the residual 32.23% were considered to exhibit 'poor' groundwater potential. The results provide more insights, and the groundwater potential zones map can be exploited by local governments for groundwater resources management and exploitation.

TI  - Chemical characteristics of particulate matters and their emission sources over Varanasi during winter season
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The chemical composition of particulate matter impacts both human health and climate. In this study, the chemical characteristics of particulate matter was measured for four months (November 2016-February 2017) at Varanasi, which is located in the middle of the Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB). The daily observed mean values of PM10 and PM2.5 are 134 +/- 48 and 213 +/- 80 mu g/m(3), respectively, which exceeds both national and international standards. The average value of PM2.5/PM10 ratio is 0.64 +/- 0.16 which indicates a relatively higher fraction of fine particles that are attributed to anthropogenic emission sources (biomass/post-harvest burning) as corroborated by MODIS fire counts and back trajectory analysis. Ion chromatographic measurements showed that SO42-, Cl-, K+, NO3-, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ are the major ionic species present in the aerosol. Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray (SEM-EDX) analysis shows the prevalence of carbon-rich particles at Varanasi which is likely due to biomass burning and other anthropogenic sources.

TI  - Indian Ocean wave forecasting system for wind waves: development and its validation
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Present study aims at the development of the Indian Ocean wave forecasting system for wind waves using WAVEWATCH-III wave model and a detailed validation of the same to ensure the model reliability for operational use. WAVEWATCH-III model has a multi-grid approach with resolution varying from 100 km (global grid) to 4 km (coastal grid), and is driven by the 10 m wind, produced by the ECMWF meteorological model. Two different observation data sets, provided by a network of buoys and Jason-2 altimeter, have been used for the evaluationof the model skill. The reliability of the wave model is tested separately for deep and for coastal waters, and reliable (correlation > 0.8 and Scatter Index < 30%) performance is found for both areas for the year 2016. A spatial validation using the satellite data also supported the reliability of the forecast in the IO. Verification during the extreme conditions also showed an accurate performance of the model in predicting the wave heights with correlation >0.9 and Scatter Index < 20%. The overall analysis endorses the model reliability over the IO, making this model very suitable, and hence it could be used for the operational forecasting purpose and other maritime services.

TI  - Accuracy of CEUS-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: a study review and meta-analysis
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective To investigate whether preoperative localization of sentinel lymph node (SLN) by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can further improve the accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Method Collect published literatures or conference reports by searching electronic databases. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) evaluation method is used to evaluate the quality of the screened literatures. The pooled risk ratio of cancer metastasis of SLN identified by CEUS (CE-SLN) compared with SLN not identified by CEUS (nonCE-SLN) is calculated, and the pooled diagnostic accuracy of CE-SLN for pathological status of all SLNs is also evaluated. Result Through search and screening, a total of 16 studies were included, of which five and seven studies, respectively, entered the meta-analysis of metastatic risk ratio and diagnostic accuracy. The localization rate of preoperative CEUS for sentinel lymph nodes was 70 to 100%. The meta-analysis shows that the risk of metastasis of SLN identified by CEUS is significantly higher than that not identified by CEUS, 26.0% vs 4.6%, and risk ratio (RR) is 6.08 (95% CI 4.17-8.85). In early-stage breast cancer, the pathological status of CE-SLN is a good representative of all SLNs, with a pooled sensitivity of 98% (95% CI 0.94-1.00), pooled specificity of 100% (95% CI 0.99-1.00), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 2153.18 (95% CI 476.53-9729.06), and area under the subject receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve of 0.9968. Conclusion In early-stage breast cancer, preoperative localization of SLN by CEUS is expected to further improve the accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).

TI  - Could climate trends disrupt the contact rates between <i>lxodes ricinus</i> (Acari, Ixodidae) and the reservoirs of <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> s.I.?
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study addresses the modifications that future climate conditions could impose on the transmission cycles of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. by the tick Ixodes ricinus in Europe. Tracking the distribution of foci of a zoonotic agent transmitted by vectors as climate change shapes its spatial niche is necessary to issue self-protection measures for the human population. We modeled the current distribution of the tick and its predicted contact rates with 18 species of vertebrates known to act as reservoirs of the pathogen. We approached an innovative way for estimating the possibility of permanent foci of Borrelia afzelii or Borrelia garinii tracking separately the expected spatial overlap among ticks and reservoirs for these pathogens in Europe. Environmental traits were obtained from MODIS satellite images for the years 2002-2017 (baseline) and projected on scenarios for the years 2030 and 2050. The ratio between MODIS baseline/current interpolated climatologies (WorldClim), and the ratio between MODIS-projected year 2050 with five climate change scenarios for that year (WorldClim) revealed no significant differences, meaning that projections from MODIS are reliable. Models predict that contact rates between the tick and reservoirs of either B. garinii or B. afzeliiare spatially different because those have different habitats overlap. This is expected to promote different distribution patterns because of the different responses of both groups of reservoirs to environmental variables. Models for 2030 predict an increase in latitude, mainly in the circulation of B. garinii, with large areas of expected permanent contact between vector and reservoirs in Nordic countries and central Europe. However, climate projections for the year 2050 predict an unexpected scenario of contact disruption. Though large areas in Europe would be suitable for circulation of the pathogens, the predicted lack of niche overlap among ticks and reservoirs could promote a decrease in permanent foci. This development represents a proof-of-concept for the power of jointly modeling both the vector and reservoirs in a common framework. A deeper understanding of the unanticipated result regarding the year 2050 is needed.

TI  - Inter-annual variability of the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic drivers affecting West Nile virus vector <i>Culex pipiens</i> population dynamics in northeastern Italy
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Vector-borne infectious diseases (VBDs) represent a major public health concern worldwide. Among VBDs, West Nile virus (WNV) showed an increasingly wider spread in temperate regions of Europe, including Italy. During the last decade, WNV outbreaks have been recurrently reported in mosquitoes, horses, wild birds, and humans, showing great variability in the temporal and spatial distribution pattern. Due to the complexity of the environment-host-vector-pathogen interaction and the incomplete understanding of the epidemiological pattern of the disease, WNV occurrences can be difficult to predict. The analyses of ecological drivers responsible for the earlier WNV reactivation and transmission are pivotal; in particular, variations in the vector population dynamics may represent a key point of the recent success of WNV and, more in general, of the VBDs. Methods We investigated the variations of Culex pipiens population abundance using environmental, climatic and trapping data obtained over nine years (2010 to 2018) through the WNV entomological surveillance programme implemented in northeastern Italy. An information theoretic approach (IT-AIC(c)) and model-averaging algorithms were implemented to examine the relationship between the seasonal mosquito population growth rates and both intrinsic (e.g. intraspecific competition) and extrinsic (e.g. environmental and climatic variables) predictors, to identify the most significant combinations of variables outlining the Cx. pipiens population dynamics. Results Population abundance (proxy for intraspecific competition) and length of daylight were the predominant factors regulating the mosquito population dynamics; however, other drivers encompassing environmental and climatic variables also had a significant impact, although sometimes counterintuitive and not univocal. The analyses of the single-year datasets, and the comparison with the results obtained from the overall model (all data available from 2010 to 2018), highlighted remarkable differences in coefficients magnitude, sign and significance. These outcomes indicate that different combinations of factors might have distinctive, and sometimes divergent, effects on mosquito population dynamics. Conclusions A more realistic acquaintance of the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of mosquito population fluctuations in relation to continuous changes in environmental and climatic conditions is paramount to properly reinforce VBDs risk-based surveillance activities, to plan targeted density control measures and to implement effective early detection programmes.

TI  - Estimating Nitrogen Runoff From Agriculture to Coastal Zones by a Rapid GIS and Remote Sensing-Based Method for a Case Study From the Irrigation District Rio Mayo, Gulf of California, Mexico
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal eutrophication due to agricultural runoff is one of the main ecological problems for coastal zones around the world. The increase in nutrients has created multiple consequences on marine ecosystems, such as harmful algal blooms, zones of hypoxia or anoxia, and loss of biodiversity. The coastal areas of Mexico are no exception. In the scientific community, there has been a great effort to estimate the amount of nutrients that enter marine ecosystems. However, a rapid method to make this estimation without field data is still required. In this study, the cultivated area and the entrance of nutrients to the coastal marine environment were determined for one of the main irrigation districts located in the state of Sonora, which drains into the Gulf of California, Mexico. We used an elevation model combined with the digitization of drain canal maps to delimitate sub-basins and allocate the coastal runoff entry points. Landsat 8 satellite data were classified and validated for the period of two agrarian cycles (2015-2016) to obtain the agriculture parcels by sub-basins. The quantity of the nutrient runoff was estimated using the cultivation area and nitrogen runoff percentage, according to values found in published reports. As a result, we identified eight sub-basins, two of which stand out for the amount of nitrogen that drains both into a coastal lagoon and directly to the sea. We confirmed this information by correlation analysis using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm K-d(490) detected around the coastal runoff entry points. We concluded that there is a high input in the coastal zones and lagoons of nutrients and other pollutants from the agricultural zones of the Rio Mayo irrigation district. We also concluded that the performance of the method applied to estimate the volume of the nitrogen runoff is useful, rapid, and can be improved with in situ data.

TI  - Application of remote-sensing techniques in geological and structural mapping of Atalla Shear Zone and Environs, Central Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atalla Shear Zone (ASZ) is one of the crucial megashears which are geometrically and kinematically akin to the Najd-Shear Corridor in the central Eastern Desert of Egypt. The Landsat-8 and ASTER-based mapping techniques integrated with extensive petrographic and structural-field investigations enhanced the geological and structural maps of the study area. The Neoproterozoic basement complex in the study area discriminated into ditinctive rock suites: Meatiq Group, ophiolitic melange, arc assemblage, syn- to late-tectonic granitoids, Dokhan Volcanics, Hammamat Sediments, post-Hammamat Felsites and post-tectonic granitoids. The true color composites (TCC) (4 3 2 for Landsat-8; 3 2 1 for ASTER), false color composites (FCC) (1 6 4, 1 6 7 and 7 5 1 for Landsat-8; 5 4 3 and 9 6 4 for ASTER), principal component analysis (PCA) (1 2 3, 3 2 1 and 6 4 2 for Landsat-8; 1 2 3 and 5 4 2 for ASTER), minimum noise fraction (MNF) (1 2 3 and 3 5 1 for Landsat-8; 1 2 4 and 3 2 1 for ASTER) and band ratios (BR) (6/2, 6/7, 6/5*4/3 and 7/6, 7/5, 5/3 for Landsat-8; 2/6, 7/5, 7/6 and 4/7, 3/4, 2/1 for ASTER besides the new created ratio 2/6, 7/5, 7/6) are the best combinations that demonstrate efficiency in discrimination of lithologic contacts and structural elements, using the spectral signature of different rock units. Moreover, the BR b7/b5, b5/b7 and b6/b4 of grey scale for Landsat-8 are used as a tool for mineral detection along with the spectral indices created to detect muscovite (b7/b6), ferrous silicates b5/b4 (biotite, chlorite and amphiboles) and ferrous iron b5/b3 (mafic minerals). The automatic lineament extraction utilizing the SRTM data advocated the role of NE- to NNE-trending lineaments in the tectonic framework of the study area. The structural fabric of the study area is evaluated in three main structural domains: Meatiq (MD), Atalla Shear Zone (ASZD) and Wadi Hammamat (WHD). The pronounced structural implication is the transposition of NE-oriented fabric in MD into NW-oriented penetrative shear-related fabric, fully in the ASZD and partly in WHD. The combination of transcurrent shearing with ENE-directed shortening along the ASZ that was resulted in noteworthy transpressive structures resemble in many respects those observed in the Ajjaj Shear Belt in Western Arabia. Among these structures are shear zone-related folds, imbricated thrust sheets, antiformal stacks and thrust duplexes. The deformation history of the investigated area proposed four phases of deformation (D-1-D-4). It depicts a long lasted deformational event covering the main accretion-collision phases concurrent with the E-W assembly of Gondwana, and the subsequent post-collision Najd-related transpressional phase which resulted in several major left-lateral transcurrent shear zones along with the exhumation of gneissic core complexes in the Arabian-Nubian Shield.

TI  - The influence of man-induced land-use change on the upper forest limit in the Romanian Carpathians
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Romanian Carpathians are an important part of Europe's mountain areas, the actual pattern of forest cover reflecting a long history of land-use practices and management. In the present work, we analyse the recent changes (1945-2018) in the upper forest cover along the 37 mountain units using old topographic maps and Sentinel-2A high-resolution satellite images in order to quantify several spatial indicators related to the upper forest cover and upper forest limit changes. In order to understand the regional variation, we have tested the correlations between the location of the upper forest limit, the local topography and the geographical position. Furthermore, with a view to evaluate the upper forest limit change according to its potential climatic limit, the 10 degrees C July isotherm was estimated based on WorldClim climate data. In addition, the situations inside and outside the major protected areas were also analysed and discussed so as to assess the possible regional differences as related to human effects. The results revealed a continued downward shift in the mountain areas located below the 1600 m a.l.s., but significant advancement above these values, indicating regional differences in land-use intensity and land management. This study is aimed to increase further knowledge as to the upper forest limit in the European mountains and to provide a baseline for modelling future potential change according to the environmental and anthropogenic variability in the area.

TI  - The spatiotemporal changes of marshland and the driving forces in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China from 1980 to 2016
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWetland loss is a global concern due to its enormous ecosystem services. Marshland, a typical natural wetland, which is concentrated in the Sanjiang Plain, has undergone dramatic loss in the last several decades. The spatiotemporal changes in marshland were studied based on Landsat images of the Sanjiang Plain from 1980 to 2016 with the land use maps in 1980, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2016 using land use dynamic degree and landscape indices. The driving forces of marshland loss, including biophysical factors, socio-economic factors, and land management, were analyzed with boosted regression trees (BRTs) methods.ResultsThe area of marshland loss was 7372km(2), which accounted for 65.7% of the area of marshland in 1980; however, the paddy field area was expanded by 22,313km(2). The lost marshland was mainly converted to dry farmland (47.5%) and paddy field (47.2%) during 1980-2016. Both the landscape pattern of the study area and marshland became increasingly fragmented. The relatively important factors responsible for marshland loss were biophysical factors, socio-economic factors, and land management, which accounted for 65.2%, 25.5%, and 8.4%, respectively. The most important driving forces with high "relative influence" were "distance to river," which accounted for 20.6% of the total variance explained. The "relative influence" of potential crop yield and ditch density reached 20.2% and 8.4%, respectively.ConclusionSignificant land use changes have occurred in the Sanjiang Plain over the past 37years, with characteristics of rapid paddy field expansion and drastic marshland loss. Meanwhile, marshland fragmentation continued to increase. Reclamation was the main reason for the large-scale marshland loss. Biophysical factors influenced the decisions regarding the locations of marshland loss. Moreover, climate factors (i.e., average annual precipitation and average annual temperature) also played an important role in marshland loss. These results can provide helpful knowledge for understanding the patterns and reasons for marshland loss and protecting and managing strategies for wetlands restoration.

TI  - Surfactant Protein D Recognizes Multiple Fungal Ligands: A Key Step to Initiate and Intensify the Anti-fungal Host Defense
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - With limited therapeutic options and associated severe adverse effects, fungal infections are a serious threat to human health. Innate immune response mediated by pattern recognition proteins is integral to host defense against fungi. A soluble pattern recognition protein, Surfactant protein D (SP-D), plays an important role in immune surveillance to detect and eliminate human pathogens. SP-D exerts its immunomodulatory activity via direct interaction with several receptors on the epithelial cells lining the mucosal tracts, as well as on innate and adaptive immune cells. Being a C-type lectin, SP-D shows calcium- and sugar-dependent interactions with several glycosylated ligands present on fungal cell walls. The interactome includes cell wall polysaccharides such as 1,3-beta-D-glucan, 1,6-beta-D-glucan, Galactosaminogalactan Galactomannan, Glucuronoxylomannan, Mannoprotein 1, and glycosylated proteins such as gp45, gp55, major surface glycoprotein complex (gpA). Recently, binding of a recombinant fragment of human SP-D to melanin on the dormant conidia ofAspergillus fumigatuswas demonstrated that was not inhibited by sugars, suggesting a likely protein-protein interaction. Interactions of the ligands on the fungal spores with the oligomeric forms of full-length SP-D resulted in formation of spore-aggregates, increased uptake by phagocytes and rapid clearance besides a direct fungicidal effect againstC. albicans. Exogenous administration of SP-D showed significant therapeutic potential in murine models of allergic and invasive mycoses. Altered susceptibility of SP-D gene-deficient mice to various fungal infections emphasized relevance of SP-D as an important sentinel of anti-fungal immunity. Levels of SP-D in the serum or lung lavage were significantly altered in the murine models and patients of fungal infections and allergies. Here, we review the cell wall ligands of clinically relevant fungal pathogens and allergens that are recognized by SP-D and their impact on the host defense. Elucidation of the molecular interactions between innate immune humoral such as SP-D and fungal pathogens would facilitate the development of novel therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Aptamer-Based Biosensors for Environmental Monitoring
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Due to their relative synthetic and chemical simplicity compared to antibodies, aptamers afford enhanced stability and functionality for the detection of environmental contaminants and for use in environmental monitoring. Furthermore, nucleic acid aptamers can be selected for toxic targets which may prove difficult for antibody development. Of particular relevance, aptamers have been selected and used to develop biosensors for environmental contaminants such as heavy metals, small-molecule agricultural toxins, and water-borne bacterial pathogens. This review will focus on recent aptamer-based developments for the detection of diverse environmental contaminants. Within this domain, aptamers have been combined with other technologies to develop biosensors with various signal outputs. The goal of much of this work is to develop cost-effective, user-friendly detection methods that can complement or replace traditional environmental monitoring strategies. This review will highlight recent examples in this area. Additionally, with innovative developments such as wearable devices, sentinel materials, and lab-on-a-chip designs, there exists significant potential for the development of multifunctional aptamer-based biosensors for environmental monitoring. Examples of these technologies will also be highlighted. Finally, a critical perspective on the field, and thoughts on future research directions will be offered.

TI  - Improved water quality mapping based on cross-fusion of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imageries
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposed methods based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 cross-fusion for improving water quality mapping (WQM). Therefore, four traditional fusion methods including intensity-hue-saturation, Gram-Schmidt transform, wavelet transform and Brovey transform and different scenarios of cross-fusion have been implemented. The proposed cross-fusion methods highly improved the correlation coefficient (CR) between the images and the water quality parameter (WQP). Considering the higher CR values, the created WQP maps showed very good accuracy, in which the root-mean-square error values were 0.03, 0.59, 0.96, 0.26 and 279.76 for potential hydrogen (PH), dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and electrical conductivity (EC) maps, respectively. Also, the effect of considering 1 px value or the mean of a 3x3 window of the input images for calculating the regression models on the accuracy of the final maps was tested. Only the best outputs for mapping PH and DO parameters were based on applying the mean of a 3x3 window. The results also showed that increasing the window size could increase the computational complexity and decrease the WQM accuracy. Comparing the output maps with the traditional maps confirmed the higher accuracy of the proposed methods.

TI  - A diagnostic challenge of primary Central nervous system lymphoma: from the eyes to the brain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Being a subtype of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL) is a rare and fatal intraocular malignancy manifesting as blurred vision and floaters, and is usually combined with, or eventually progresses to, central nervous system lesions. The diagnosis of PVRL/PCNSL remains challenging because of the nonspecific clinical features and diagnostic dependency on biopsy. Case presentation:In this paper, we present the clinical, imaging, laboratory, brain biopsy, and vitreous biopsy findings of a 56-year-old immunocompetent woman who presented with blurred vision of the left eye, but which rapidly evolved into lesions of the central nervous system. The dramatic changes on brain imaging and the undiagnostic brain and vitreous biopsy results presented great challenges for the diagnosis. PCNSL was eventually presumed according to comprehensive consideration of the disease progression pattern, the characteristic neuroimaging, and molecular hints. Conclusions:PCNSL is a highly invasive tumor, and timely diagnosis is the key point in clinical practice. However, the requirement for biopsy and the existence of sentinel lesions impedes the diagnosis. Therefore, follow-up and repeated biopsy is always necessary for a definitive diagnosis. This case indicates that a complete evaluation of neuroimaging, ophthalmic testing, cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid, diagnostic vitrectomy, and brain biopsy are essential for diagnosis of PCNSL. Moreover, molecular and cytokine analyses are useful adjuncts to the diagnostic cytology. Of note, the analysis of cytokine levels (IL-10/IL-6) is an important auxiliary diagnostic strategy in the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

TI  - Radiometric consistency between GOES-16 ABI and VIIRS on Suomi NPP and NOAA-20
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - NOAA has both geostationary (GEO) and polar orbiting (LEO) satellites that are procured through different vendors. For long-term environmental studies, it is essential to establish consistent radiometric calibration among satellite instruments irrespective of the satellite platforms. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) and NOAA-20 satellites has been providing critical weather and climate-related data. With the launch of NOAA-20 in November 2017, the global coverage of VIIRS has doubled. With more than 7 years in space, S-NPP VIIRS has been rigorously calibrated and validated. We aim to quantify the radiometric consistency between the two VIIRS instruments through double differencing using GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) as a reference instrument. We also provide insight into the temporal radiometric consistency between VIIRS and ABI. Since no direct simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNOs) exist between SNPP and NOAA-20 for intercomparison, GEO-LEO intercalibration is performed using SNOs between ABI and VIIRS instruments. We show that the NOAA-20 VIIRS measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance is consistently lower than that of the S-NPP, mostly on the order of 2% to 3%, consistent with the past studies. GOES-16 ABI-observed reflectance is higher than both VIIRS instruments. SNOs over the all-sky tropical ocean are analyzed to quantify the bias for both NOAA-20 and S-NPP VIIRS relative to ABI. The impact on bias due to spectral differences is accounted for using spectral band adjustment factors estimated using hyperspectral measurements from SCIAMACHY. Uncertainties exist mainly due to calibration uncertainties in VIIRS and ABI, the time difference between the VIIRS and ABI observations, differences in cloud contamination, spectral response function differences, and lack of in-situ hyperspectral data to account for the spectral bias.

TI  - A Single Amino Acid Substitution in the Matrix Protein (M51R) of Vesicular Stomatitis New Jersey Virus Impairs Replication in Cultured Porcine Macrophages and Results in Significant Attenuation in Pigs
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we explore the virulence of vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSNJV) in pigs and its potential relationship with the virus's ability to modulate innate responses. For this purpose, we developed a mutant of the highly virulent strain NJ0612NME6, containing a single amino acid substitution in the matrix protein (M51R). The M51R mutant of NJ0612NME6 was unable to suppress the transcription of genes associated with the innate immune response both in primary fetal porcine kidney cells and porcine primary macrophage cultures. Impaired viral growth was observed only in porcine macrophage cultures, indicating that the M51 residue is required for efficient replication of VSNJV in these cells. Furthermore, when inoculated in pigs by intradermal scarification of the snout, M51R infection was characterized by decreased clinical signs including reduced fever and development of less and smaller secondary vesicular lesions. Pigs infected with M51R had decreased levels of viral shedding and absence of RNAemia compared to the parental virus. The ability of the mutant virus to infect pigs by direct contact remained intact, indicating that the M51R mutation resulted in a partially attenuated phenotype capable of causing primary lesions and transmitting to sentinel pigs. Collectively, our results show a positive correlation between the ability of VSNJV to counteract the innate immune response in swine macrophage cultures and the level of virulence in pigs, a natural host of this virus. More studies are encouraged to evaluate the interaction of VSNJV with macrophages and other components of the immune response in pigs.

TI  - Evaluation of Arctic sea ice drift and its dependency on near-surface wind and sea ice conditions in the coupled regional climate model HIRHAM-NAOSIM
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine the simulated Arctic sea ice drift speed for the period 2003-2014 in the coupled Arctic regional climate model HIRHAM-NAOSIM 2.0. In particular, we evaluate the dependency of the drift speed on the near-surface wind speed and sea ice conditions. Considering the seasonal cycle of the Arctic basin averaged drift speed, the model reproduces the summer-autumn drift speed well but significantly overestimates the winter-spring drift speed, compared to satellite-derived observations. Also, the model does not capture the observed seasonal phase lag between drift and wind speed, but the simulated drift speed is more in phase with the near-surface wind. The model calculates a realistic negative correlation between drift speed and ice thickness and between drift speed and ice concentration during summer-autumn when the ice concentration is relatively low, but the correlation is weaker than observed. A daily grid-scale diagnostic indicates that the model reproduces the observed positive correlation between drift and wind speed. The strongest impact of wind changes on drift speed occurs for high and moderate wind speeds, with a low impact for rather calm conditions. The correlation under low-wind conditions is overestimated in the simulations compared to observation/reanalysis data. A sensitivity experiment demonstrates the significant effects of sea ice form drag from floe edges included by an improved parameterization of the transfer coefficients for momentum and heat over sea ice. However, this does not improve the agreement of the modeled drift speed/ wind speed ratio with observations based on reanalysis data for wind and remote sensing data for sea ice drift. An improvement might be achieved by tuning parameters that are not well established by observations.

TI  - Total column water vapour retrieval from S-5P/TROPOMI in the visible blue spectral range
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Total column water vapour has been retrieved from TROPOMI measurements in the visible blue spectral range and compared to a variety of different reference data sets for clear-sky conditions during boreal summer and winter. The retrieval consists of the common two-step DOAS approach: first the spectral analysis is performed within a linearized scheme and then the retrieved slant column densities are converted to vertical columns using an iterative scheme for the water vapour a priori profile shape, which is based on an empirical parameterization of the water vapour scale height. Moreover, a modified albedo map was used combining the OMI LER albedo and scaled MODIS albedo map. The use of the alternative albedo is especially important over regions with very low albedo and high probability of clouds like the Amazon region.The errors of the total column water vapour (TCWV) retrieval have been theoretically estimated considering the contribution of a variety of different uncertainty sources. For observations during clear-sky conditions, over ocean surface, and at low solar zenith angles the error typically is around values of 10 %-20 %, and during cloudy-sky conditions, over land surface, and at high solar zenith angles it reaches values around 20 %-50 %.In the framework of a validation study the retrieval demonstrates that it can well capture the global water vapour distribution: the retrieved H2O vertical column densities (VCDs) show very good agreement with the reference data sets over ocean for boreal summer and winter whereby the modified albedo map substantially improves the retrieval's consistency to the reference data sets, in particular over tropical land masses. However, over land the retrieval underestimates the VCD by about 10 %, particularly during summertime. Our investigations show that this underestimation is likely caused by uncertainties within the surface albedo and the cloud input data: low-level clouds cause an underestimation, but for mid- to high-level clouds good agreement is found. In addition, our investigations indicate that these biases can probably be further reduced by the use of improved cloud input data. For the general purpose we recommend only using VCDs with cloud fraction <20 % and AMF >0.1, which represents a good compromise between spatial coverage and retrieval accuracy.The TCWV retrieval can be easily applied to further satellite sensors (e.g. GOME-2 or OMI) for creating uniform, long-term measurement data sets, which is particularly interesting for climate and trend studies of water vapour.

TI  - Predicting cold-water bleaching in corals: role of temperature, and potential integration of light exposure
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Warm-water growth and survival of corals are constrained by a set of environmental conditions such as temperature, light, nutrient levels and salinity. Water temperatures of 1 to 2 degrees C above the usual summer maximum can trigger a phenomenon known as coral bleaching, whereby disruption of the symbiosis between coral and dinoflagellate micro-algae, living within the coral tissue, reveals the white skeleton of coral. Anomalously cold water can also lead to coral bleaching but has been the subject of limited research. Although cold-water bleaching events are less common, they can produce similar impacts on coral reefs as warm-water events. In this study, we explored the effect of temperature and light on the likelihood of cold-water coral bleaching from 1998-2017 using available bleaching observations from the Eastern Tropical Pacific and the Florida Keys. Using satellite-derived sea surface temperature, photosynthetically available radiation and light attenuation data, cold temperature and light exposure metrics were developed and then tested against the bleaching observations using logistic regression. The results show that cold-water bleaching can be best predicted with an accumulated cold-temperature metric, i.e. 'degree cooling weeks', analogous to the heat stress metric 'degree heating weeks', with high accuracy (90%) and fewer Type I and Type II errors in comparison with other models. Although light, when also considered, improved prediction accuracy, we found that the most reliable framework for cold-water bleaching prediction may be based solely on cold-temperature exposure.

TI  - Intracystic papillary carcinoma: clinical presentation, patterns of practice, and oncological outcomes
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Intracystic/encapsulated papillary carcinoma remains a poorly understood disease of the breast with a little amount of reports that describe it. It shares features with DCIS and IDC and predominantly affects postmenopausal women. This study aims to evaluate the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes in IPC patients managed at our institution. Methods We retrospectively pooled twenty-eight IPC patients' medical records at our institution. Descriptive analysis of clinicopathological characteristics, approach, and outcomes was done along with a quantitative statistical analysis. Results Cases were divided into three groups: isolated IPC, IPC associated with DCIS, and IPC associated with Invasive Carcinoma. Treatment modalities varied according to the IPC type and its associated components. All patients presented with a palpable mass. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that all isolated IPCs were ER and PR positive and HER2 negative. Lymph node dissection proved necessary only in IPC associated invasive carcinoma. Irregular borders and lobulations, among others, were found on non-invasive core biopsies that turned out to be associated with invasion on surgical pathology. All patients were alive after a median follow-up time of 23 months when the study was over with no reports of recurrence. Conclusion IPC cases and treatment approaches at our institution appear similar to the available literature and confirm the excellent prognosis among IPC. Even more, further studies into the key features such as BMI, family history, and radiological findings are necessary for a potential algorithm that could assess for risk of finding invasion in surgical pathology and subsequently the need for axillary/sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - A Retrospective Mapping of Pelvic Lymph Node Metastasis Distribution in Patients with Endometrial Carcinoma
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Systematic removal of pelvic lymph node for endometrial carcinoma has high morbidity. We performed a retrospective analysis of 216 patients with endometrial carcinoma in Peking University First Hospital between January 2001 and March 2017, in order to evaluate the metastasis distribution of pelvic lymph node in patients with endometrial carcinoma. A total of 21 (9.7%) cases had lymph node metastases with an average positive lymph node number of 31.5 per cases. Among the positive group, 10 were obturator vein lymph nodes, 5 were internal iliac lymph nodes, and 5 were external iliac lymph nodes. Three cases of deep inguinal lymph nodes and 1 case of common iliac lymph node metastasis were accompanied by other pelvic lymph node metastases. No independent metastasis of deep inguinal lymph nodes and common iliac lymph node metastasis were detected. We conclude that obturator vein lymph node might be the most common metastasis site of pelvic lymph node with endometrial carcinoma patients.

TI  - A Municipal PM2.5 Forecasting Method Based on Random Forest and WRF Model
T2  - ENGINEERING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent years, air pollution is a very serious problem in China and elsewhere, and it is a factor that significantly affects the quality of human health. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is considered to be the culprit of haze weather. Therefore, research affects the quality of human life on PM2.5 forecasting has received increasing attention. Knowing this information in advance is very important to protect humans from health problems. This paper proposes a new prediction method, using the predicted value of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model as input data, increasing the atmospheric inversion factor as an additional input factor and constructing a municipal atmospheric pollutant response model through a random forest algorithm. we use 3-fold cross-validation (CV) to evaluate model performance. The result of the experiment shows, compared with the traditional atmospheric simulation method, this method has practical application significance. The simulation results have improved timeliness and accuracy. It provides a simple and effective method for PM2.5 prediction.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Understanding influenza seasonality is necessary for determining policies for influenza control. Aim: We characterised transmissibility during seasonal influenza epidemics, including one influenza pandemic, in Spain during the 21th century by using the moving epidemic method (MEM) to calculate intensity levels and estimate differences across seasons and age groups. Methods: We applied the MEM to Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System data from influenza seasons 2001/02 to 2017/18. A modified version of Goldstein's proxy was used as an epidemiological-virological parameter. We calculated the average starting week and peak, the length of the epidemic period and the length from the starting week to the peak of the epidemic, by age group and according to seasonal virus circulation. Results: Individuals under 15 years of age presented higher transmissibility, especially in the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. Seasons with dominance/co-dominance of influenza A(H3N2) virus presented high intensities in older adults. The 2004/05 influenza season showed the highest influenza-intensity level for all age groups. In 12 seasons, the epidemic started between week 50 and week 3. Epidemics started earlier in individuals under 15 years of age (- 1.8 weeks; 95% confidence interval (CI):-2.8 to -0.7) than in those over 64 years when influenza B virus circulated as dominant/co- dominant. The average time from start to peak was 4.3 weeks (95% CI: 3.6-5.0) and the average epidemic length was 8.7 weeks (95% CI: 7.9-9.6). Conclusions: These findings provide evidence for intensity differences across seasons and age groups, and can be used guide public health actions to diminish influenza-related morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Evaluation of WorldView-3 VNIR and SWIR Data for Hydrothermal Alteration Mapping for Mineral Exploration: Case Study from Northeastern Isfahan, Iran
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This research evaluated the capability of WorldView-3 (WV-3) data in discriminating targets related to porphyry copper mineralization at the Tameh district in the Saveh-Yazd belt, northeastern Isfahan, Iran. The few known porphyry copper deposits in this district were formed in association with Oligo-Miocene intrusive bodies. Hydrothermal alteration zones are characterized by iron oxide/hydroxide, sericite, illite, kaolinite, montmorillonite, chlorite, and epidote minerals. The band rationing method and the mixture-tuned matched filtering (MTMF) algorithm were utilized to map and identify targets. The results of band rationing showed that WV-3 VNIR-SWIR data can map and differentiate corchlorite and epidote as well as kaolinite and montmorillonite because of its superior spatial and spectral resolutions in SWIR region, as compared to ASTER data. Considering the similarity of five SWIR bands of WV-3 to the ASTER bands, both datasets help to enhance sericite-illite in similar patterns; however, areas mapped using WV-3 matched well with field evidence. Implementing the MTMF algorithm on the WV-3 VNIR and SWIR data successfully mapped areas with the highest abundances of desired minerals. Microscopic studies of thin sections, spectral investigations, and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the occurrence of alteration minerals, which also corresponded well to surface exposures of alterations in the field. Results showed that WV-3 data, with higher spectral and spatial resolutions, provide capability to map and identify hydrothermal alteration minerals and to produce more detailed mineralogical maps, which are valuable in semi-detailed district-scale exploration stages; in contrast, ASTER data yielded information on hydrothermally alteration zones mainly in regional scale.

TI  - Crop classification in cloudy and rainy areas based on the optical-synthetic aperture radar response mechanism
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the agricultural field, optical remote sensing technology plays an important role in crop monitoring or production estimation. However, the widespread distribution of clouds and rain limits the application of optical remote sensing. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used for studies of oceans, atmosphere, land, and space exploration, as well as by the military due to its all-weather nature, penetration to surface and cloud layers, and diversity of information carriers. However, it is difficult to classify ground objects with high accuracy based on SAR data. Considering the features of these two datasets, we proposed a framework to improve crop classifications in cloudy and rainy areas based on the optical-SAR response mechanism. Specifically, this method is designed to train a parametric analytic model in the area using both kinds of datasets and applied in the area with only SAR data to obtain the optical time-series features. Then crops from the second area were classified by the long-short-term memory network. As an example, the parametric analytic model in Lixian County was studied and was applied to Xifeng County to classify the crops with the OA of 61%, which had proved the robustness of the method.

TI  - Voxel area sculpturing-based 3D scene reconstruction from single-pass CSAR data
T2  - ELECTRONICS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - 3D scene reconstruction from single-pass circular synthetic aperture radar (CSAR) data has been a research hot spot in various remote sensing applications. Among existing literature, radargrammetry techniques and model assistant methods are two dominant approaches. However, the performance of these methods is limited in practical applications: radargrammetry techniques obtain merely one height value along vertical; model assistant approaches only work when valid models are given. A single-pass CSAR 3D scene point cloud reconstruction method is proposed. First, the connection between an object and its projections in multi-aspect SAR images is established with no auxiliary model. On the basis of the connection, voxels are classified into inner voxels (voxels beneath the target profile) and outside voxels (voxels outside of the target profile). Discarded all the outside voxels, the remained inner voxels are combined to form the 3D point cloud of the target. It is similar to the sculpturing process from a raw material to a piece of craft. Finally, a 3D scene is retrieved through assembling all reconstructed targets into a unified coordinate system. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated by the Gotcha Volumetric SAR Data Set.

TI  - The Applicability of the Extended Markov Chain Model to the Land Use Dynamics in Lebanon
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study validates the applicability of the extended Markov chain modeling for predicting the dynamics of land use in Lebanon by using (i) the current available population density maps, (ii) Landsat satellite images, (iii) ArcGIS software and (iv) TerrSet software. An extended Markov chain model was developed to predict future land use dynamics by integrating the built-up area into three categories as per the development density based on population density maps for years 2000, 2009 and 2018. Land use classification maps were generated by integrating medium-resolution Landsat images of 30 meters into ArcGIS. The population density maps were combined with the classified land use maps in order to divide the built-up land use areas into three categories: high-, medium- and low-density urban development. The observed transition matrices were computed using TerrSet software. A Markov chain projection of land use for year 2018 was generated based on the actual transition matrix and compared to the observed land use. A Pearson's chi-square test was conducted to validate the proposed model. Then, a projection of land use for 2036 was conducted based on the actual transition matrix between 2000 and 2018. Finally, insights and recommendations were proposed to address future Lebanese land use dynamics.

An extensive increase in UES demand (grey) patches (187.95%) was observed during 1992-2016 in contrast to significant decline (47.94%) in UES supply (blue-green) patches, primarily in the northern and south-western directions. Also, a drastic rise in area under thermally highly uncomfortable zone (35-40 degrees C) from 0.005 to 56.68 km(2)and a decrease in area of thermally comfortable zone (<= 26 degrees C) from 0.46 km(2)to zero during 1992-2016 exhibiting deteriorating natural urban living condition. Although, the land surface temperature (LST) was remained higher in urban areas, the peri-urban and neighbouring rural areas (27.31-33.98 degrees C) of Bhubaneswar city recorded a high increase in mean LST as compared to the urban areas (31.19-34.69 degrees C). In both the cases, UHI intensities were less as compared to other growing cities of India. The MODIS based time series analysis depicted similar trends with minor increase in LST (30.55-30.76 degrees C) during 2000-16. The study proves the intrinsic linkages of UES with thermal comfort and necessitates to adopt sustainable measures to make the city green and habitable.

TI  - Adoption of image surface parameters under moving edge computing in the construction of mountain fire warning method
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to cope with the problems of high frequency and multiple causes of mountain fires, it is very important to adopt appropriate technologies to monitor and warn mountain fires through a few surface parameters. At the same time, the existing mobile terminal equipment is insufficient in image processing and storage capacity, and the energy consumption is high in the data transmission process, which requires calculation unloading. For this circumstance, first, a hierarchical discriminant analysis algorithm based on image feature extraction is introduced, and the image acquisition software in the mobile edge computing environment in the android system is designed and installed. Based on the remote sensing data, the land surface parameters of mountain fire are obtained, and the application of image recognition optimization algorithm in the mobile edge computing (MEC) environment is realized to solve the problem of transmission delay caused by traditional mobile cloud computing (MCC). Then, according to the forest fire sensitivity index, a forest fire early warning model based on MEC is designed. Finally, the image recognition response time and bandwidth consumption of the algorithm are studied, and the occurrence probability of mountain fire in Muli county, Liangshan prefecture, Sichuan is predicted. The results show that, compared with the MCC architecture, the algorithm presented in this study has shorter recognition and response time to different images in WiFi network environment; compared with MCC, MEC architecture can identify close users and transmit less data, which can effectively reduce the bandwidth pressure of the network. In most areas of Muli county, Liangshan prefecture, the probability of mountain fire is relatively low, the probability of mountain fire caused by non-surface environment is about 8 times that of the surface environment, and the influence of non-surface environment in the period of high incidence of mountain fire is lower than that in the period of low incidence. In conclusion, the surface parameters of MEC can be used to effectively predict the mountain fire and provide preventive measures in time.

TI  - Temporal and phenological profiles of open and dense Caatinga using remote sensing: response to precipitation and its irregularities
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Caatinga is a typical biome of Brazil's semiarid regions and subject to climate changes. Research is needed on the relation of its features to climate events. This study analyzed the influence of rainfall and its irregularities in open and dense woody Caatinga vegetation. Phenological curves were generated by means of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time profiles in the Grota do Angico Conservation Unit study area in Sergipe State. Rainfall data from 2000 to 2018 were collected and phenological curves generated using various estimate methods that produced the following variables: [start of season, end of season, peak of season position, length of season, mean growing season and maximum seasonal]. Rainfall showed a standard intra-annual behavior, with inter-annual variations related to irregularities influencing Caatinga response. Dense Caatinga vegetation had higher values of NDVI in all periods, even in anomalous years compared to open Caatinga, in addition to having longer leaf coverage over the year, with an anticipated start and a more extended seasonal end. The analysis of the rainfall regime made it possible to assess its influence on the Caatinga and phenological profiles proved to be fundamental to understand periods of physiological change of open and dense Caatinga. These results indicate that dense Caatinga maintains physiological activity longer, which may be associated with greater moisture maintenance in a semiarid region. In addition, because it has a greater leaf cover for longer periods, the soil may be preserved and maintain its characteristics longer, reducing the effects of desertification. The results may be associated with the type of forest management and conservation in this region. The total or partial suppression of individual remnants of Caatinga should be avoided, since the most open areas have lower photosynthetic capacity, affected to a considerable extent from the effects of adverse climatic conditions. Additionally, open Caatinga has a reduced capacity for regenerating naturally and its use by communities in this semiarid region should be limited.

TI  - Deglacierization of a Marginal Basin and Implications for Outburst Floods, Mendenhall Glacier, Alaska
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Suicide Basin is a partly glacierized marginal basin of Mendenhall Glacier, Alaska, that has released glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) annually since 2011. The floods cause inundation and erosion in the Mendenhall Valley, impacting homes and other infrastructure. Here, we utilize in-situ and remote sensing data to assess the recent evolution and current state of Suicide Basin. We focus on the 2018 and 2019 melt seasons, during which we collected most of our data, partly using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To provide longer-term context, we analyze DEMs collected since 2006 and model glacier surface mass balance over the 2006-2019 period. During the 2018 and 2019 outburst flood events, Suicide Basin released similar to 30 x 10(6) m(3) of water within approximately 4-5 days. Since lake drainage was partial in both years, these similar to 30 x 10(6) m(3) represent only a fraction (similar to 60%) of the basin's total storage capacity. In contrast to previous years, subglacial drainage was preceded by supraglacial outflow over the ice dam, which lasted similar to 1 day in 2018 and 6 days in 2019. Two large calving events occurred in 2018 and 2019, with submerged ice breaking off the main glacier during lake filling, thereby increasing the basin's storage capacity. In 2018, the floating ice in the basin was 36 m thick on average. In 2019, ice thickness was 29 m, suggesting rapid decay of the ice tongue despite increasing ice inflow from Mendenhall Glacier. The ice dam at the basin entrance thinned by more than 5 m a(-1) from 2018 to 2019, which is approximately double the rate of the reference period 2006-2018. While ice-dam thinning reduces water storage capacity in the basin, that capacity is increased by declining ice volume in the basin and longitudinal lake expansion, with the latter process challenging to predict. The potential for premature drainage onset (i.e., drainage before the lake's storage capacity is reached), intermittent drainage decelerations, and early drainage termination further complicates prediction of future GLOF events.

TI  - Moving a neodymium magnet promotes the migration of a magnetic tracer and increases the monitoring counts on the skin surface of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer
T2  - BMC MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We suspected that moving a small neodymium magnet would promote migration of the magnetic tracer to the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Higher monitoring counts on the skin surface before making an incision help us detect SLNs easily and successfully. The present study evaluated the enhancement of the monitoring count on the skin surface in SLN detection based on the magnet movement in a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) using superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles. Methods After induction of general anesthesia, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were injected sub-dermally into the subareolar area or peritumorally. The neodymium magnet was moved over the skin from the injection site to the axilla to promote migration of the magnetic tracer without massage. A total of 62 patients were enrolled from February 2018 to November 2018: 13 cases were subjected to magnet movement 20 times (Group A), 8 were subjected to 1-min magnet movement (Group B), 26 were given a short (about 5 min) interval from injection to 1-min magnet movement (Group C), and 15 were given a long (about 25 min) interval before 1-min magnet movement using the magnetometer's head (Group D). In all cases, an SNB was conducted using both the radioisotope (RI) and SPIO methods. The monitoring counts on the skin surface were measured by a handheld magnetometer and compared among the four groups. Changes in the monitoring count by the interval and magnet movement were evaluated. Results The identification rates of the SPIO and RI methods were 100 and 95.2%, respectively. The mean monitoring counts of Group A, B, C, and D were 2.39 mu T, 2.73 mu T, 3.15 mu T, and 3.92 mu T, respectively (p < 0.0001; Kruskal-Wallis test). The monitoring counts were higher with longer magnet movement and with the insertion of an interval. Although there were no relationships between the monitoring count on the skin surface and clinicopathologic factors, magnet movement strongly influenced the monitoring count on the skin surface. Conclusion Moving a small neodymium magnet is effective for promoting migration of a magnetic tracer and increasing monitoring counts on the skin surface.

TI  - Seasonal Observations at 79°N Glacier (Greenland) From Remote Sensing and<i>in situ</i>Measurements
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates seasonal ice dynamics of Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden or 79 degrees N Glacier, one of the major outlet glaciers of the North East Greenland Ice Stream. Based on remote sensing data andin-situGPS measurements we show that surface melt water is quickly routed to the ice-bed interface with a direct response on ice velocities measured at the surface. From the temporally highly resolved GPS time series we found summer peak velocities of up to 22% faster than their winter baseline. These average out to 9% above winter velocities when relying on temporally lower resolved velocity estimates from TerraSAR-X intensity offset tracking. From our GPS time series we also found short term ice acceleration after the melt season. By utilizing optical satellite imagery and interferometrically derived digital elevation models we were able to link the post melt season speed-up to a rapid lake drainage event (<24 h) with an estimated drainage volume of 28 x 10(6)m(3). We further highlight that GPS measurements are needed to resolve short term velocity fluctuations with low amplitudes, whereas remote sensing estimates are rather useful for the calculation of general trends in velocity behavior.

TI  - Exploring the utility of Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI in burned area mapping for a heterogenous savannah landscape
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - When wildfires are controlled, they are integral to the existence of savannah ecosystems and play an intrinsic role in maintaining their structure and function. Ample studies on wildfire detection and severity mapping are available but what remains a challenge is the accurate mapping of burnt areas in heterogenous landscapes. In this study, we tested which spectral bands contributed most to burnt area detection when using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 multi-spectral sensors in two study sites. Post-fire Sentinel 2A and Landsat 8 images were classified using the Random Forest (RF) classifier. We found out that, the NIR, Red, Red-edge and Blue spectral bands contributed most to burned area detection when using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A. We found out that, Landsat 8 had a higher classification accuracy (OA = 0.92, Kappa = 0.85 and TSS = 0.84)) in study site 1 as compared to Sentinel-2 (OA = 0.86, Kappa = 0.74 and TSS = 0.76). In study site 2, Sentinel-2 had a slightly higher classification accuracy (OA = 0.89, Kappa = 0.67 and TSS = 0.64) which was comparable to that of Landsat 8 (OA = 0.85, Kappa = 0.50 and TSS = 0.41). Our study adds rudimentary knowledge on the most reliable sensor allowing reliable estimation of burnt areas and improved post-fire ecological evaluations on ecosystem damage and carbon emission.

TI  - Validation of flood risk maps using open source optical and radar satellite imagery
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood risk maps delineate areas potentially at risk of flooding and are thus a crucial tool in flood risk management. In Spain, such maps are provided as open geospatial data. This article compares the flood-prone areas according to those maps for floods of different return periods with the spatial extent of two floods that severely affected southwestern Spain using open source optical and radar satellite imagery. Results using the recall metric were found to be very good and are the most relevant to emergency preparedness services as this metric focuses on the correctly predicted flooded areas. It was also found that the 500-year flood risk map was the one with the best precision and accuracy for both flood events. The results confirm the accuracy of the flood risk maps based on open source remote sensing imagery and hence demonstrate the potential of publicly available and freely distributed remote sensing data in their development.

T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) has changed dramatically in the peri-urban area (PUA) of greater Cairo (GC) since the Egyptian revolution of 2011. This study analyzes LULC change in the PUA of GC using two Landsat images from 2010 and 2018. The spatial trends of LULC change and visualizations of the gains and losses in LULC were analyzed using TerrSet software. The driving forces of LULC change from 2010-2018 were quantified using the logistic regression model (LRM). The results revealed that the processes of LULC change and urban sprawl have directly impacted the natural resources, particularly agricultural land. In addition, the study showed that the population growth and land value have the highest regression coefficients, 0.660 and 0.292, respectively, and were the most significant driving forces of LULC from 2010-2018. The outcomes of this study are important for decision-makers to adopt appropriate strategies for sustainable land use in this area.

TI  - Management of the Axilla after Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Opinion statementAs the use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) increases, the optimal management of the axilla has become increasingly complex. Consensus among professional organizations is that those patients with clinically negative axillary nodes who are being considered for NAST should undergo a sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy following NAST. If a positive SLN is subsequently identified, an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is the current standard of care. For patients with clinically node-positive disease, SLN biopsy is a reasonable option for those with a good response to NAST. Patients should undergo SLN mapping with a dual dye technique. Additionally, at least 2 lymph nodes should be removed, including the previously biopsied and marked lymph node with cancer. In this setting, the identification and false negative rates are acceptable. Patients found to have a negative SLN at this time may be spared the morbidity associated with ALND. Patients found to have persistently positive lymph nodes following NAST, either clinically or pathologically, should undergo a complete ALND.

TI  - Rare malignancies of the breast: melanoma and metastases
T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Rare breast tumors account for <2% of breast malignancies and are primarily metastases of primary tumors from other locations, primary malignant melanomas of the breast, sarcomas and lymphomas. Aim Review of the literature and overview of the epidemiology, diagnostics, and management of breast metastases, extramammary primary tumors and primary malignant melanomas of the breast. Material and methods This overview article is based on a PubMed literature search in December 2019. Results Breast metastases from extramammary primary tumors are rare and account for 0.5-2% of malignant breast tumors. The most frequent primary tumors are lymphomas, melanomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. In up to 50% of cases, breast metastases are the first manifestation of the primary tumor. Tumor morphology is diverse and an immunohistochemical marker panel is the most important tool for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of breast metastases from primary breast tumors. The prognosis depends on the biology of the primary tumor but is poor with a mean survival time of 12-15 months. Whether a local resection of breast metastases is prognostically meaningful is unclear; however, data from cohort studies indicate that a resection favorably influences the duration of survival. Breast melanomas account for 0.5% of malignant breast tumors and can occur as metastases of a cutaneous extramammary melanoma or as primary malignant melanomas of the breast. The histopathological diagnosis of primary malignant melanomas of the breast is complex. The treatment of choice for primary malignant melanomas of the breast is local excision to healthy tissue and axillary sentinel lymphadenectomy as well as adjuvant treatment corresponding to the German S3 guidelines on diagnostics, treatment and follow-up treatment of melanoma. Conclusion This article summarizes and discusses the current knowledge on the epidemiology, diagnostics, and management of breast metastases and primary malignant melanomas of the breast.

TI  - Satellite-derived leaf area index and roughness length information for surface-atmosphere exchange modelling: a case study for reactive nitrogen deposition in north-western Europe using LOTOS-EUROS v2.0
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The nitrogen cycle has been continuously disrupted by human activity over the past century, resulting in almost a tripling of the total reactive nitrogen fixation in Europe. Consequently, excessive amounts of reactive nitrogen (N-r) have manifested in the environment, leading to a cascade of adverse effects, such as acidification and eutrophication of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and particulate matter formation. Chemistry transport models (CTMs) are frequently used as tools to simulate the complex chain of processes that determine atmospheric N-r flows. In these models, the parameterization of the atmosphere-biosphere exchange of N-r is largely based on few surface exchange measurement and is therefore known to be highly uncertain. In addition to this, the input parameters that are used here are often fixed values, only linked to specific land use classes. In an attempt to improve this, a combination of multiple satellite products is used to derive updated, time-variant leaf area index (LAI) and roughness length (z(0)) input maps. As LAI, we use the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD15A2H product. The monthly z(0) input maps presented in this paper are a function of satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values (MYD13A3 product) for short vegetation types (such as grass and arable land) and a combination of satellite-derived forest canopy height and LAI for forests. The use of these growth-dependent satellite products allows us to represent the growing season more realistically. For urban areas, the z(0) values are updated, too, and linked to a population density map. The approach to derive these dynamic z(0) estimates can be linked to any land use map and is as such transferable to other models. We evaluated the sensitivity of the modelled N-r deposition fields in LOng Term Ozone Simulation - EURopean Operational Smog (LOTOS-EUROS) v2.0 to the abovementioned changes in LAI and z(0) inputs, focusing on Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. We computed z(0) values from FLUXNET sites and compared these to the default and updated z(0) values in LOTOS-EUROS. The root mean square difference (RMSD) for both short vegetation and forest sites improved. Comparing all sites, the RMSD decreased from 0.76 (default z(0)) to 0.60 (updated z(0)). The implementation of these updated LAI and z(0) input maps led to local changes in the total N-r deposition of up to similar to 30% and a general shift from wet to dry deposition. The most distinct changes are observed in land-use-specific deposition fluxes. These fluxes may show relatively large deviations, locally affecting estimated critical load exceedances for specific natural ecosystems.

TI  - North Pacific Gyre Oscillation Closely Associated With Spring Arctic Sea Ice Loss During 1998-2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The relative importance of the factors contributing to Arctic spring sea ice decline remains an open question. Here we suggest a new major factor. In spring the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) shows a significantly increasing trend during 1998-2016, in contrast to the insignificant trend of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index. Nearly 40% of Arctic springtime sea ice concentration trend is statistically related to the increase of the NPGO index but only 4% to the PDO trend. Through the destructive linear interference with climatological Aleutian low, the increasing NPGO index tends to weaken the upward propagation of planetary waves, which enhances the strength of the stratospheric Arctic vortex and the Arctic Oscillation (AO). The positive AO anomalies influence the surface wind field and temperature pattern anomalies, contributing to negative sea ice anomalies in the Arctic.

TI  - Distinguishing between early- and late-covering crops in the land surface model Noah-MP: impact on simulated surface energy fluxes and temperature
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface models are essential parts of climate and weather models. The widely used Noah-MP land surface model requires information on the leaf area index (LAI) and green vegetation fraction (GVF) as key inputs of its evapotranspiration scheme. The model aggregates all agricultural areas into a land use class termed "cropland and pasture". In a previous study we showed that, on a regional scale, the GVF has a bimodal distribution formed by two crop groups differing in phenology and growth dynamics: early-covering crops (ECC; e.g., winter wheat, winter rapeseed, winter barley) and late-covering crops (LCC; e.g., corn, silage maize, sugar beet). That result can be generalized for central Europe. The present study quantifies the effect of splitting the land use class cropland and pasture of Noah-MP into ECC and LCC on surface energy fluxes and temperature. We further studied the influence of increasing the LCC share, which in the study area (the Kraichgau region, southwest Germany) is mainly the result of heavily subsidized biomass production, on energy partitioning at the land surface. We used the GVF dynamics derived from high-resolution (5m x 5 m) RapidEye satellite data and measured LAI data for the simulations. Our results confirm that the GVF and LAI strongly influence the partitioning of surface energy fluxes, resulting in pronounced differences between simulations of ECC and LCC. Splitting up the generic crop into ECC and LCC had the strongest effect on land surface exchange processes in July-August. During this period, ECC are at the senescence growth stage or already harvested, while LCC have a well-developed ground-covering canopy. The generic crop resulted in humid bias, i.e., an increase in evapotranspiration by +0.5 mm d(-1) (latent heat flux is 1.3 MJ m(-2) d(-1)), decrease in sensible heat flux (H) by 1.2 MJ m(-2) d(-1) and decrease in surface temperature by -1 degrees C. The bias increased as the shares of ECC and LCC became similar. The observed differences will impact the simulations of processes in the planetary boundary layer. Increasing the LCC share from 28% to 38% in the Kraichgau region led to a decrease in latent heat flux (LE) and a heating up of the land surface in the early growing season. Over the second part of the season, LE increased and the land surface cooled down by up to 1 ffiC.

TI  - New capabilities of Sentinel-2A/B satellites combined with <i>in situ</i> data for monitoring small harmful algal blooms in complex coastal waters
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increased frequency of harmful algal blooms (HABs) is a major environmental concern worldwide, resulting not only in increased treatment costs for drinking water but also in impacts on tourism, commercial fishing and aquaculture and risks to human and animal health. Traditional strategies with ship-based approaches based on field sampling and laboratory analysis have been adopted to assess HABs. However, these methods are labour intensive and costly and do not provide synoptic views of the bloom conditions. Here, we show that the Sentinel-2 twin satellite mission of the Copernicus programme, in combination with in situ data, is a powerful tool that can offer valuable spatiotemporal information about a bloom of the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedra that occurred on the SW Iberian Peninsula. Using the robust ACOLITE atmospheric correction processor combined with the normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI), the enhanced mapping of small blooms can be performed at a 10 m spatial resolution, revealing surface patches and a heterogeneous distribution. This research also demonstrates the improved capabilities of Sentinel-2 compared to those of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-3 for continuous monitoring. The Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 missions provide ecosystem observations that allow the environmental community and water managers to evaluate changes in water quality and bloom distribution and that facilitate field-based measurements. Therefore, the value added by the Copernicus products in terms of frequency and synoptic observations is of paramount importance for ecological and management purposes at regional and national scales.

TI  - Multidimensional analysis of landscape dynamics in a Central African forest-savannah mosaic
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most landscape cover assessments for conservation programmes rely largely on remote sensing analyses. These analyses, however, neglect how people inhabiting protected zones perceive and structure land cover. Using socio-ecological systems (SES) analysis in a forest-savannah mosaic on the Congo Basin forest edge (Democratic Republic of Congo), we investigated how human practices, landscape perceptions and land use patterns affected forest cover. We conducted remote sensing analysis using a Sentinel-2 satellite image and 187 GPS landmarks, producing a land cover map with 11 classes. Our results yielded an 81.85% correspondence with additional 164 GPS landmarks, a robust score in tropical areas. We conducted 40 individual interviews, eighteen focus group discussion workshops and nine months of participant observation of human practices to identify 19 land units and elaborate a granular SES system structuring the landscape. Integrating local knowledge and practices with general ecological and agronomic processes, we developed a landscape dynamics model revealing progressive forest colonisation of savannahs. Our methods demonstrate that a forest-edge landscape cover evaluation through remote sensing and local knowledge can contribute to finer-grained assessment of land cover and ecosystem services. This assessment can assist conservation efforts by considering local populations' practices on and perceptions of landscape change.

TI  - Combining TerraSAR-X and time-lapse photography for seasonal sea ice monitoring: the case of Deception Bay, Nunavik
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a case study for the combined use of TerraSAR-X and time-lapse photography time series in order to monitor seasonal sea ice processes in Nunavik's Deception Bay. This area is at the confluence of land use by local Inuit, ice-breaking transport by the mining industry, and climate change. Indeed, Inuit have reported greater interannual variability in seasonal sea ice conditions, including later freeze-up and earlier breakup. Time series covering 2015 to 2018 were acquired for each data source: TerraSAR-X images were acquired every 11 d, and photographs were acquired hourly during the day. We used the combination of the two time series to document spatiotemporal aspects of freeze-up and breakup processes. We also report new X-band backscattering values over newly formed sea ice types. The TerraSAR-X time series further show potential for melt and pond onset.

TI  - Evaluation of the trophic state predicted from lab and Landsat data of western coastal water of Suez Bay, Egypt
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to compare the trophic status assessments of the western coastal waters of Suez Bay, Gulf of Suez, Egypt. The Trophic Index (TRIX) that depends on the lab-based water quality measurements of nutrients, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and dissolved oxygen, was compared with the Carlson trophic state index that integrates lab-based data such as NH(4)or PO(4)concentration with Landsat data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. The physicochemical properties were determined, which indicated that Suez Bay was in an eutrophication state limited by both N and Si. It was suggested that the most influential activities be the industrial and domestic drains that raised the TRIX value to 5.59 with a mesotrophic state on average. Likewise, phosphorus trophic status mapping applying Carlson trophic state index showed high activity nearby drain outlets, especially at the Cabanon drain. The regression statistical model indicated a relationship between lab data of nutrients and band values extracted from Landsat images. Accordingly, the integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques with laboratory data is useful for predicting the state of water quality in the coastal areas with a single lab-based water quality parameter.

TI  - Estimating food resource availability in arid environments with Sentinel 2 satellite imagery
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. In arid environments, plant primary productivity is generally low and highly variable both spatially and temporally. Resources are not evenly distributed in space and time (e.g., soil nutrients, water), and depend on global (El Nino/Southern Oscillation) and local climate parameters. The launch of the Sentinel2-satellite, part of the European Copernicus program, has led to the provision of freely available data with a high spatial resolution (10 m per pixel). Here, we aimed to test whether Sentinel2-imagery can be used to quantify the spatial variability of a minor tussock grass (Enneapogon spp.) in an Australian arid area and whether we can identify different vegetation cover (e.g., grass from shrubs) along different temporal scenarios. Although short-lasting, the Enneapogon grassland has been identified as a key primary food source to animals in the arid environment. If we are able to identify and monitor the productivity of this species remotely, it will provide an important new tool for examining food resource dynamics and subsequent animal responses to them in arid habitat.Methods. We combined field vegetation surveys and Sentinel2-imagery to test if satellite spectral data can predict the spatial variability of Enneapogon over time, through GLMMs. Additionally, a cluster analysis ('gower' distance, 'complete' method), based on Enneapogon seed-productivity, and total vegetation cover in October 2016, identified three clusters: bare ground, grass dominated and shrub dominated. We compared the vegetation indices between these different clusters from October 2016 to January 2017.Results. We found that MSAVI(2) and NDVI correlated with the proportion of Enneapogon with seeds across the landscape and this relationship changed over time. Both vegetation indices (MSAVI(2) and NDVI) were higher in patches with high seed-productivity of Enneapogon than in bare soil, but only in October, a climatically-favorable period during which this dominant grass reached peak seed-productivity.Discussion. MSAVI(2) and NDVI provided reliable estimates of the heterogeneity of vegetation type across the landscape only when measured in the Austral spring. This means that grass cover is related to seed-productivity and it is possible to remotely and reliably predict food resource availability in arid habitat, but only in certain conditions. The lack of significant differences between clusters in the summer was likely driven by the short-lasting nature of the vegetation in the study and the sparseness of the grass-dominated vegetation, in contrast to the shrub vegetation cluster that was particularly well measured by the NDVI.Conclusions. Overall, our study highlights the potential for Sentinel2-imagery to estimate and monitor the change in grass seed availability remotely in arid environments. However, heterogeneity in grassland cover is not as reliably measured as other types of vegetation and may only be well detected during periods of peak productivity (e.g., October 2016).

TI  - Developing a novel hybrid model for the estimation of surface 8 h ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) across the remote Tibetan Plateau during 2005-2018
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a two-stage model called the random-forest-generalised additive model (RF-GAM), based on satellite data, meteorological factors, and other geographical covariates, to predict the surface 8 h O-3 concentrations across the remote Tibetan Plateau. The 10-fold cross-validation result suggested that RF-GAM showed excellent performance, with the highest R-2 value (0.76) and lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) (14.41 mu g m(-3)), compared with other seven machine-learning models. The predictive performance of RF-GAM showed significant seasonal discrepancy, with the highest R-2 value observed in summer (0.74), followed by winter (0.69) and autumn (0.67), and the lowest one in spring (0.64). Additionally, the unlearning ground-observed O-3 data collected from open-access websites were applied to test the transferring ability of the novel model and confirmed that the model was robust in predicting the surface 8 h O-3 concentration during other periods (R-2=0.67, RMSE = 25.68 mu g m(-3)). RF-GAM was then used to predict the daily 8 h O-3 level over the Tibetan Plateau during 2005-2018 for the first time. It was found that the estimated O-3 concentration displayed a slow increase, from 64.74 +/- 8.30 mu g m(-3) to 66.45 +/- 8.67 mu g m(-3) from 2005 to 2015, whereas it decreased from the peak to 65.87 +/- 8.52 mu g m(-3) during 2015-2018. Besides this, the estimated 8 h O-3 concentrations exhibited notable spatial variation, with the highest values in some cities of the northern Tibetan Plateau, such as Huangnan (73.48 +/- 4.53 mu g m(-3)) and Hainan (72.24 +/- 5.34 mu g m(-3)), followed by the cities in the central region, including Lhasa (65.99 +/- 7.24 mu g m(-3)) and Shigatse (65.15 +/- 6.14 mu g m(-3)), and the lowest O-3 concentration occurred in a city of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau called Aba (55.17 +/- 12.77 mu g m(-3)). Based on the 8 h O-3 critical value (100 mu g m(-3)) provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), we further estimated the annual mean nonattainment days over the Tibetan Plateau. It should be noted that most of the cities on the Tibetan Plateau had excellent air quality, while several cities (e.g. Huangnan, Haidong, and Guoluo) still suffered from more than 40 nonattainment days each year, which should be given more attention in order to alleviate local O-3 pollution. The results shown herein confirm that the novel hybrid model improves the prediction accuracy and can be applied to assess the potential health risk, particularly in remote regions with few monitoring sites.

TI  - Spatial distribution and livelihood effects of debris cones at the western Afar Rift Valley margin, northern Ethiopia
T2  - NORSK GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-NORWEGIAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the study on which the article is based was to investigate the distribution, characteristics and livelihood effects of debris cones in the Aba'ala and Raya grabens in Ethiopia. The characteristics of the debris cones and their upper catchment areas were obtained from Google Earth Pro and Landsat images. Questionnaires were used to understand the livelihood effects of the debris cones. In addition, transect studies, interviews and observations were used to supplement the data. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics, a regression model and coupled criteria. The results showed that the debris cones differed in their physical characteristics and distribution, and their volumes were larger in the Raya graben than in the Aba'ala graben. The average flow lengths of the upper catchments was the major predictor of debris cone volume. The expansion of debris cones devastated farmlands, resulting in crop yield loss. Moreover, deposited debris damaged dwellings and pasture, and led to smallholder farmers' displacement. However, the cones remained attractive for settlement and spate irrigation. The authors conclude that despite the benefits of debris cones, catchment rehabilitation measures should be implemented in the upper catchments to reduce the expansion of debris cones in the studied grabens.

TI  - A diabetes perception study among rural and urban individuals of West Bengal, India: are we ready for the pandemic?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIABETES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Type 2 diabetes is a pandemic in India, yet studies regarding knowledge, attitude, and practices in diabetes in various Indian communities are limited. It is essential to understand the current gaps in knowledge and problems with attitude and perceptions of the general population regarding diabetes to effectively plan public health policies. Method In this study, 2163 subjects (1079 urban, 1084 rural) from West Bengal, India, with no exposure to any formal diabetes awareness including through familial experience or by virtue of their profession, participated in a structured response cross-sectional knowledge-attitude practice (KAP) survey focusing on perception about diabetes, its diagnosis, and management during FY 2013-2014. Result Both rural and urban communities lacked complete knowledge of diabetes. Forty-nine percent of rural responders were not aware of the term "diabetes" itself. Also, among the rural responders who were familiar with the term lacked knowledge related to blood glucose monitoring and role of insulin in diabetes management. Though 74% of urban respondents were aware of insulin's use in diabetes management, 39% had misconception regarding its extended use. Responders from both urban and rural communities showed higher awareness towards general health practices like, benefits of exercise or demerits of junk food, in comparison with diabetes-specific questions. Conclusion The study reveals the need for effective diabetes-specific health awareness campaigns to address the rise of diabetes pandemic in resource-limited country like India. There is an urgent need to address unfounded fear of adverse reaction of insulin over extended use.

TI  - The improvement of ecological environment index model RSEI
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Protecting the ecological environment is an important goal of the world sustainable development. Rapid and quantitative evaluation of regional ecological environment is the technical support and necessary condition for this goal. The ecological environment index model (RSEI) which used to assess ecological environment is the most popular now. But it changed into two completely opposite models in the application. Most researchers choose which model to use based on the desired results. This article concludes the reason by studying the operating mechanism of the model and finds that it is the eigenvector direction in the principal component analysis causes this to happen. Taking Pingyu County as an example, this article calculates RSEI with Landsat 8 images in different periods in Google Earth Engine using the two existing models respectively and finds that two models show two opposite result trends in spatial distribution. Using any model to calculate the same image, the results are also opposite if changing the input order of the indicators. It is the eigenvector direction determines the spatial distribution by comparing and analyzing the eigenvector of each image and its corresponding RSEI. Then, this paper improves the model by fixing the eigenvector direction based on the actual effects on ecological environment of the four indicators, taking absolute values of the eigenvectors of NDVI and Wet which have a positive effect on the ecological environment and the opposite of absolute values of the eigenvectors of LST and NDSI which have a negative effect on the ecological environment, in order to improve the RSEI model. Using the improved model calculate each image, the results are consistently accurate. Furthermore, this paper also proposed a model for users who calculating the principal components through software where the eigenvector direction cannot be altered artificially. This paper proposes the improved model which is suitable for all users whether using software or conducting programming. The improved model is suitable for all images of any input order of the indicators. It provides the possibility of applying remote sensing big data to the ecological environment. At the same time, the study of the mechanism of the model provides a scientific basis for future scholars to calculate in batches.

TI  - Impacts of anthropogenic and climate variation on spatiotemporal pattern of water resources: a case study of Lake Babati, Tanzania
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources such as lakes are important for sustaining human life and aquatic ecosystems, but a lack of understanding of pressures from anthropogenic activities and recurring floods and droughts can cause problems for communities and ecosystems because of their impact on lake size and water quality. This study aims to assess the impacts of anthropogenic and climate variation on the spatiotemporal pattern of Lake Babati in Tanzania by establishing physical trends over a period of more than four decades, and evaluate how land use/cover change and climatic variation influenced the pattern. The assessment was made using Landsat images acquired from the United States Geological Survey for the years 1973, 1986, 1991, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018; daily precipitation and temperature data spanning 1973-2018 sourced from the African Flood and Drought Monitor database, and augmented by field surveys of anthropogenic activities around Lake Babati Basin. Findings from this study revealed a fluctuation of lake surface area between 10.90 and 14.19 km(2) over 45 years, partly attributed to rapid urbanization, agriculture and climate variation around the lake. The largest lake areal extent decrease of 2.72 km(2) and largest increase of 3.29 km(2) were experienced between 2000 and 2005 and 1995-2000, respectively. Enhanced understanding of lake size trends from these results and associated environmental threats can guide the implementation of community programs in the Lake Babati Basin. We recommend water resource management policy options that include awareness raising, diversification of income generating activities and enforcement of environmental laws.

TI  - InSAR time series analysis of seasonal surface displacement dynamics on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and the associated rise in air temperature have affected the Tibetan Plateau to a significantly stronger degree than the global average over the past decades. This has caused deglaciation, increased precipitation and permafrost degradation. The latter in particular is associated with increased slope instability and an increase in mass-wasting processes, which pose a danger to infrastructure in the vicinity. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis is well suited to study the displacement patterns driven by permafrost processes, as they are on the order of millimeters to decimeters. The Nyainqentanglha range on the Tibetan Plateau lacks high vegetation and features relatively thin snow cover in winter, allowing for continuous monitoring of those displacements throughout the year. The short revisit time of the Sentinel-1 constellation further reduces the risk of temporal decorrelation, making it possible to produce surface displacement models with good spatial coverage. We created three different surface displacement models to study heave and subsidence in the valleys, seasonally accelerated sliding and linear creep on the slopes. Flat regions at Nam Co are mostly stable on a multiannual scale but some experience subsidence. We observe a clear cycle of heave and subsidence in the valleys, where freezing of the active layer followed by subsequent thawing cause a vertical oscillation of the ground of up to a few centimeters, especially near streams and other water bodies. Most slopes of the area are unstable, with velocities of 8 to 17 mm yr(-1). During the summer months surface displacement velocities more than double on most unstable slopes due to freeze-thaw processes driven by higher temperatures and increased precipitation. Specific landforms, most of which have been identified as rock glaciers, protalus ramparts or frozen moraines, reach velocities of up to 18 cm yr(-1). Their movement shows little seasonal variation but a linear pattern indicating that their displacement is predominantly gravity-driven.

TI  - The Diagnostic Accuracy of an Intraoperative Frozen Section Analysis and Imprint Cytology of Sentinel Node Biopsy Specimens from Patients with Uterine Cervical and Endometrial Cancer: a Retrospective Observational Study
T2  - PATHOLOGY & ONCOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) may be a decision-making tool for function preservation surgery, including radical trachelectomy and ovary preservation in the treatment of cervical and endometrial cancer. The intraoperative diagnosis is important for guiding treatment decisions for patients with these conditions. Three hundred seventy-one patients with cervical and endometrial cancer received SNB with an intraoperative frozen section analysis and imprint cytology. The sentinel node was cut in half, parallel to the longest axis, to obtain the maximum section area. After performing imprint cytology, one half was used to create a frozen section. The specimen was cut at 2-mm intervals into 5-mu m-thick sections, which were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining. The diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative frozen section analyses and imprint cytology was compared to the final pathological diagnosis. Among 951 detected sentinel nodes, 51 nodes were found to be positive in the final pathological diagnosis. The sensitivity of a frozen section analysis, imprint cytology and the combination of the two modalities was 76.5%, 72.6%, and 92.2%, respectively. The specificity of a frozen section analysis and imprint cytology was 100%. The negative predictive value of a frozen section analysis and imprint cytology was 98.7% and 98.5%, respectively. In these settings, the accuracy of the frozen section analysis and imprint cytology in the evaluation of SNB specimens was considered acceptable; however, the sensitivity of the combined approach was higher in comparison to when a frozen section analysis or imprint cytology was performed alone.

TI  - Current and Future Remote Sensing of Harmful Algal Blooms in the Chesapeake Bay to Support the Shellfish Industry
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal bloom (HAB) species in the Chesapeake Bay can negatively impact fish, shellfish, and human health via the production of toxins and the degradation of water quality. Due to the deleterious effects of HAB species on economically and environmentally important resources, such as oyster reef systems, Bay area resource managers are seeking ways to monitor HABs and water quality at large spatial and fine temporal scales. The use of satellite ocean color imagery has proven to be a beneficial tool for resource management in other locations around the world where high-biomass, nearly monospecific HABs occur. However, remotely monitoring HABs in the Chesapeake Bay is complicated by the presence of multiple, often co-occurring, species and optically complex waters. Here we present a summary of common marine and estuarine HAB species found in the Chesapeake Bay, Alexandrium monilatum, Karlodinium veneficum, Margalefidinium polykrikoides, and Prorocentrum minimum, that have been detected from space using multispectral data products from the Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) sensor on the Sentinel-3 satellites and identified based on in situ phytoplankton data and ecological associations. We review how future hyperspectral instruments will improve discrimination of potentially harmful species from other phytoplankton communities and present a framework in which satellite data products could aid Chesapeake Bay resource managers with monitoring water quality and protecting shellfish resources.

TI  - A generative adversarial network with structural enhancement and spectral supplement for pan-sharpening
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening aims to obtain high-resolution multi-spectral images by fusing panchromatic images and low-resolution multi-spectral images though reasonable rules. This paper proposed a novel generative adversarial network for pan-sharpening, which utilizes the supplemented spectral information from low-resolution multi-spectral images and the enhanced structural information from panchromatic images to generate high-resolution multi-spectral images. Firstly, the forward differential operator is used to extract the spatial structural information of the panchromatic image both in the horizontal and vertical directions. Secondly, an architecture of generative adversarial network is designed. The enhanced structural information generated by the accumulation of the structural information of the two directions is added to the image fusion process in generator and the discriminating process in discriminator, and a new optimization objective is designed accordingly. What is more, the low-resolution multi-spectral image is added to the convolution process in the generator as a supplement to the spectral information. Finally, in order to obtain better image generation effect, a special objective function of the generator is designed, which adds a unique relationship to reduce the loss of spatial structural information and spectral information of fused images. Experiments on QuickBird and WorldView-3 satellites datasets show that the proposed method can generate high quality fused images and is better than most advanced methods in both objective indicators and intuitive observations.

TI  - Field data for satellite validation and forest structure modeling in a pure and sparse forest of <i>Picea glehnii</i> in northern Hokkaido
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To validate and to improve ecological products obtained from satellites, such as a leaf area index (LAI), above-ground biomass (AGB), and a fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), in-situ accurate data are indispensable. They must be not a single point-data but an areal data representing the satellite footprint. Their accuracy needs to be much higher than the required accuracy for the satellite products. The quantitative assessment of their error is necessary for evaluating the satellite products' error from the discrepancy between the satellite products and the in-situ data. However, such data had not been available. In particular, there had been few data of LAI in a sparse evergreen needle-leaved forest, because of difficulty of accuracy control of in-situ observation in such a forest. To overcome the difficulty and to obtain the representative LAI, we made an allometric equation to estimate the leaf mass of Picea glehnii in northern Hokkaido. We report the allometric equations of leaf mass and AGB of P. glehnii, its leaf mass per area (LMA), its leaf life span, its leaf distribution, its crown shapes, its wood specific gravity, and tree locations. We also report LAI, AGB, and fAPAR within the 500 m x 500 m area, which is the footprint scale of the Global Change Observation Mission-Climate satellite, in a pure and sparse forest of P. glehnii in northern Hokkaido. These precise data are useful for validation of other satellite data, especially with higher spatial resolution, and forest structure modeling.

TI  - Impact of Observational Environment Change on Air Temperature Based on High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking Nanjing as an example, using the geo-social data combined with optical remote sensing information from the Landsat8 and nighttime light satellites, we design the characterization parameters of the local detection environment within the 2 km buffer around the observation site, such as the anthropogenic factors (population density and anthropogenic heat flux), geometric parameters (area ratio of land use type and altitude), and physical optical parameters (area ratio of impervious surface and vegetation index), and investigate their impacts on the air temperature (AT) observations. The results indicate that under the same weather background, when the vegetation index and area ratio of water body increase and the area ratio of impervious surface decreases, the AT decreases. The quantitative regression model between the vegetation index, area ratio of impervious surface, and area ratio of water body around the observation site and AT is given, and passes over the 99. 9% significance level. The proposed method can be used to quantitatively evaluate the air temperature distribution at some region with high resolution.

TI  - Monoculture of ♀ channel (<i>Ictalurus punctatus</i>) x ♂ blue (<i>I. furcatus</i>) hybrid catfish mitigates proliferative gill disease caused by <i>Henneguya ictaluri</i> (Cnidaria: Myxobolidae) in catfish aquaculture ponds
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Proliferative gill disease (PGD) caused by the myxozoan Henneguya ictaluri is one of the most damaging diseases affecting U.S. catfish aquaculture. In channel and hybrid catfish, continuous exposure to the actinospore stage of the parasite elicits a destructive branchitis, impairing osmoregulatory and respiratory function. Mortality can reach 100% in severe outbreaks. Despite similarities during acute stages of infection, research indicates arrested development in hybrid catfish, evinced by reduced H. ictaluri sporogenesis and comparably less parasite DNA in hybrid tissues across the developmental timeline. To assess these findings at the pond level, 18, 0.4-ha ponds were stocked (3,000 fish/pond) with channel (n = 9) or hybrid (n = 9) catfish fingerlings and maintained as monoculture systems for three production cycles, with clean harvests and restocking as warranted. Water was collected monthly for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) estimations of H. ictaluri DNA, and sentinel fish were utilized to estimate PGD severity. By the second year, H. ictaluri DNA in hybrid systems was significantly reduced, and PGD lesions in sentinel fish were negligible. Assessment of parasite loads in fish harvested at the termination of the study revealed H. ictaluri DNA in channel catfish to be an order of magnitude higher than hybrid catfish. These results support previous work suggesting that the production of hybrid catfish may reduce PGD incidence in U.S. catfish aquaculture.

TI  - Emergence of a Zoonotic Pathogen in a Coastal Marine Sentinel: <i>Capillaria hepatica</i> (syn. <i>Calodium hepaticum</i>)-Associated Hepatitis in Southern Sea Otters (<i>Enhydra lutris nereis</i>)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Capillaria hepatica is a globally distributed zoonotic nematode parasite that most commonly infects feral and native rats. Soil contact, pica, and living in close proximity to rat populations are risk factors for human infection. Larval nematodes and eggs that were morphologically consistent with C. hepatica were observed microscopically in livers of stranded southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) from California. Large (90-100 x 45-55 mu m), barrel-shaped non-embryonated parasite eggs with large polar prominences and a roughened or striated surface, or 105-120 mu m diameter larval aphasmid nematode profiles with a prominent stichosome and hypodermal bands were observed in the livers of three otters. The liver of a fourth animal exhibited serpiginous tracts of necrosis, micro-cavitation and pleocellular inflammation, with intralesional linear eosinophilic material that resembled cuticle from degenerating metazoan parasites. Capillaria hepatica-associated hepatitis and capsular adhesions were the cause of death for one otter, and parasite-associated liver lesions were observed in all cases. All infected otters were adult females that stranded from 2006 through 2016 at multiple sites along the central California coast. All cases stranded from December through May; during and soon after peak seasonal precipitation and land-sea runoff in California. This same seasonal pattern has been reported for other land-based parasites infecting southern sea otters. Neither C. hepatica, nor any similar nematodes have been reported from marine mammals, and southern sea otters are not typical hosts for C. hepatica or any other nematode parasites. The most likely route of exposure was via freshwater runoff containing embryonated eggs liberated from predated or decomposing terrestrial hosts, especially rats. Similar to the land-based parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis neurona, C. hepatica eggs may be concentrated and transmitted through filter-feeding marine invertebrates that serve as southern sea otter prey, which may also pose an unrecognized public health risk for people who consume these species.

TI  - Genome-wide association studies of lactation yields of milk, fat, protein and somatic cell score in New Zealand dairy goats
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Identifying associations between genetic markers and traits of economic importance will provide practical benefits for the dairy goat industry, enabling genomic prediction of the breeding value of individuals, and facilitating discovery of the underlying genes and mutations. Genome-wide association studies were implemented to detect genetic regions that are significantly associated with effects on lactation yields of milk (MY), fat (FY), protein (PY) and somatic cell score (SCS) in New Zealand dairy goats. Methods A total of 4,840 goats were genotyped with the Caprine 50 K SNP chip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). After quality filtering, 3,732 animals and 41,989 SNPs were analysed assuming an additive linear model. Four GWAS models were performed, a single-SNP additive linear model and three multi-SNP BayesC models. For the single-SNP GWAS, SNPs were fitted individually as fixed covariates, while the BayesC models fit all SNPs simultaneously as random effects. A cluster of significant SNPs were used to define a haplotype block whose alleles were fitted as covariates in a Bayesian model. The corresponding diplotypes of the haplotype block were then fit as class variables in another Bayesian model. Results Across all four traits, a total of 43 genome-wide significant SNPs were detected from the SNP GWAS. At a genome-wide significance level, the single-SNP analysis identified a cluster of variants on chromosome 19 associated with MY, FY, PY, and another cluster on chromosome 29 associated with SCS. Significant SNPs mapped in introns of candidate genes (45%), in intergenic regions (36%), were 0-5 kb upstream or downstream of the closest gene (14%) or were synonymous substitutions (5%). The most significant genomic window was located on chromosome 19 explaining up to 9.6% of the phenotypic variation for MY, 8.1% for FY, 9.1% for PY and 1% for SCS. Conclusions The quantitative trait loci for yield traits on chromosome 19 confirms reported findings in other dairy goat populations. There is benefit to be gained from using these results for genomic selection to improve milk production in New Zealand dairy goats.

TI  - Habitat Quality of Farming-pastoral Ecotone in Bairin Right Banner, Inner Mongolia Based on Land Use Change and InVEST Model From 2005 to 2015
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological effects of land-use changes have emerged as a hot topic within research on global environmental changes. The findings of studies on changes in habitat quality resulting from land-use changes provide important basis for policy-making regarding ecological protection and land management. In this study, GIS technology was used in conjunction with the InVEST model to analyze remote sensing data compiled for the period 2005-2015 to assess changes in the quality of habitat in Bairin Right Banner in Inner Mongolia. The results of the analysis indicated that grassland, woodland, and farmland were the dominant types of land use in this region, accounting for more than 85% of the total land area. During the period 2005-2015, areas of wetland, construction land, and woodland increased by 335. 01, 298. 29, and 258. 67 km(2), evidencing corresponding growth rates of 91. 80%, 301. 85%, and 12. 07%, respectively. Conversely, the areas of farmland, grassland, and unused land decreased by 533. 98, 279. 28, and 78. 71 km2, with associated reduction rates of 28. 34%, 5. 63%, and 15. 40%, respectively. In the decade, large areas of grassland, woodland, dryland, and sandy land had undergone conversion. Of these areas, 948. 70 and 303. 53 km(2) of dryland and sandy land, respectively, had been converted into land-use types of ecological importance (forestland, grassland, and wetland). The habitat quality index applied in the study show distinct spatial differentiation characteristics. Whereas areas of land of lower habitat quality were predominant in 2005, areas of land of higher habitat quality were predominant in 2010 and 2015. During this 10-year period, land areas with habitat quality of high, higher, and low grades in the index increased, with marked increases in areas with high-grade habitat quality (a change rate of 39. 65%) and decreases in areas of lower-grade habitat quality (a change rate of 37. 55%). The average habitat quality index increased from 0. 457 to 0. 528, indicating an improvement in the overall habitat quality in this region. Thus, the implementation of the project of returning farmland to forest and grassland has evidently been effective, contributing to ecological recovery in this region.

TI  - On-Orbit Detection and Correction of Crosstalk Effect of FY-3D MERSI-II Signals
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Signal crosstalk can produce significant fringing effects on the observed images in a focal plane channel. Based on the earth and lunar observation data, the on-orbit detection of the crosstalk effects of all bands of the medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI-II) as FY-3D core load, and the preliminary correction tests also clone. The detection results indicate that there arc significant signal crosstalk phenomena of bands in some MERS1-11 focal planes, among which the band 5 and band 6 of short-wave infrared focal plane and the bands 20, 21, 22, and 23 of mid and long wave infrared focal plane arc suffered most obviously, manifested as inter-band and inter-detector characteristics, respectively. Based on the lunar point source imaging characteristics, the crosstalk coefficient is calculated using the linear approximation correction algorithm. Moreover, this correction algorithm is preliminarily verified through band 20. The results show that crosstalk correction can effectively remove the crosstalk signals of lunar images and significantly improve the fringe phenomena of earth observation images, implying that the proposed algorithm has good applicability.

TI  - Resolving time-varying attitude jitter of an optical remote sensing satellite based on a time-frequency analysis
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Attitude jitter is a crucial factor that limits the imaging quality and geo-positioning accuracy of high-resolution optical satellites, which has attracted significant research interests in recent years. However, few researchers have attempted to retrieve the dynamic characteristics and time-varying trends of a satellite attitude jitter. This paper presents a novel processing framework for detecting, estimating, and investigating time-varying attitude jitter in long strips based on a time-frequency analysis with the input from either an attitude sensor or an optical imaging sensor. Attitude angle signals containing attitude jitter information are detected from attitude data through generating the Euler angles relative to the orbit coordinate system, or from image data through high-accuracy dense matching between parallax observations, correction of integration time variation and frequency domain-based deconvolution. Variational mode decomposition is adopted to extract the separate band-limited periodic components, and Hilbert spectral analysis is integrated to estimate the instantaneous attributes for each time sample and the varying trends for the entire duration. Experiments with three sets of ZiYuan-3 long-strip datasets were carried out to test the novel processing framework of attitude jitter. The experimental results indicate that the processing framework could reveal the dynamic jitter characteristics, and the mutual validations of different data sources demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Using Megha-Tropiques satellite data to constrain humidity in regional convective simulations: A northern Australian test case
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Convective initiation and growth are sensitive to atmospheric conditions, especially humidity, in ways that need to be understood and quantified. It is not clear, however, how well current observations and modelling systems can serve to test this understanding. We simulate multiple cases of convergent cloud lines observed during January 2016 over northeastern Australia using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (version 3.7.1), initialized by and nudged to reanalysis data. Overall, WRF appears to skilfully simulate the convergence lines. However, the associated convective clouds as seen by satellite were not properly captured by the model. The model humidity was tested against the current version (V3-00) of the Megha-Tropiques satellite, which although up to 30% too moist in the lowest retrieved layer over the dry continental interior compared to radiosondes, is usually accurate to within +/- 10% near the cloud lines. Unperturbed WRF simulations were found to be 10-20% too dry in this region. Compensating for this humidity bias via the model initialization produced more realistic simulations of clouds and convection, and this had a comparable or larger impact than changing model physics. This result highlights the importance of observations of water vapour that are accurate and have good spatial coverage, especially in the lower troposphere, for properly constraining simulations of convective environments and for model evaluation of moist processes.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of landscape transformation due to coal mining activity using earth observation satellite data in Jharsuguda coal mining region, Odisha, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Opencast (coal) mining activities significantly affect the society and environment in several aspects, including land-useland-cover (LULC) alteration. The present study aims to quantify the alteration in LULC patterns in every 4 year from 2006 to 2018 in the Jharsuguda coal mining region in Odisha, India. The study has used the multitemporal Landsat series satellite data for LULC classification. A support vector machine algorithm was designed for LULC classifications into five broad classes, viz. water body, mining area, forest/vegetation area, bare land, and built-up area. The key findings of the study indicated that the coverage of mining area was gradually increased from 2006 to 2018 with an annual change rate of + 0.03%. On the other hand, a significant loss in the forest cover/vegetation was observed with the annual change rate of - 0.04% from 2006 to 2018. The remarkable increment in the coverage of bare land area was also noted during the study period. The mining activity has posed a serious threat to the forest resources over the study region. Hence, a proper management policy for mine reclamation should be practised over the Jharsuguda coal mining region to protect the forest, environment, and society.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of China's cold chain logistics resources and agricultural product using remote sensing perspective
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The cold chain logistics is a special distribution process with respect to agricultural products that are sensitive to temperature. In this approach, remote sensing data and spatial analysis are the main components of china's cold chain logistics capabilities, particularly on agricultural products. Therefore, The Cold Chain Logistics analysis on agricultural products in various provinces is evaluated using a Spatial Exploratory Data Analysis and Geo-detector approach. Hence, The characteristically Remote Sensing Spatio-Temporal Logistical Regression (RS-STLR) model has been developed to characterize both the cold chain's logistic resource and provincial differences. This paper provides a perspective on the growth and variations in Chinese logistics services for cold chain logistics. The research has been conducted at a lab-scale which established an alternate interpretation between different regional variations in logistic capital of the ecological features of the cold chain logistics. The aim of this analysis is to validate the condition of the cold chain market based on the quantitative system of risk assessment on agricultural produces.

TI  - Do Environmental Worldviews and Distrust Influence Action for Adaptation to Environmental Change Among Small-Scale Woodland Managers?
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest and woodland owners and managers are generally perceived to be acting slowly in addressing environmental change by adapting their forestry practice. Diversification of tree species composition and stand structure is widely promoted as one adaptive approach to increasing the resilience of forests to climate change and other threats. Land manager behaviour is known to be affected by structural and psychological barriers to action. This study used data from a national survey and qualitative interviews among different types of forest owners and managers in the UK, including large- and small-scale woodland managers, to explore their intention to make changes to their forest management and the uptake of species diversification as an adaptation practice. The revised New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) was applied as a measure of worldview, which helped to explain some aspects of their decisions to take up diversification as an action to increase resilience. There were significant interactions between NEP and discredence-i.e. distrust in science or policy recommendations-and woodland size and the uptake of diversification. Many small-scale woodland managers hold strong ecological worldviews which can act against active adaptation because of a belief in the power of nature to adapt, or a mistrust of applying recommendations which might represent "doing the wrong thing". Research and policy processes that involve owners and managers are more likely to incorporate these climate change rationalities and adaptation logics. The framing, salience and robustness of climate change adaptation information emerges as important for all forest owners and managers and requires additional attention by scientists and policy makers.

TI  - Driving factors and impact of land-use change in a fragile rainfed lowland rice-sugar palm cultural agroforestry system in southern Thailand
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The multi-functional agroforestry system associating rainfed lowland rice and sugar palm (RLR-SP) hedges has been sustaining emblematic cultural landscapes in the Indianized countries of Southeast Asia for centuries. Often established in areas facing very constrained soil-water conditions, it played a crucial role in the agro-ecological, social and economic resilience of these agrarian systems. Recent changes in communication infrastructure, commercialization, urbanization, state interventions and private initiatives have driven the transformations of these iconic cultural landscapes, but analyses of their socio-ecological impacts on household livelihoods and landscapes features are lacking. In this study, we quantified and analysed the transformations of a coastal RLR-SP cultural landscape in Southeast Thailand. We used remote sensing data to characterize and quantify land-use change during 1983-2015, and interviews with diverse stakeholders to understand the impacts of the driving factors of change on livelihood systems. After the mid-1980s, market integration facilitated by the construction of bridges and all-weather roads led to the diversification of farming and off-farm activities, increasing the mobility of farm labourers sizing wage-earning opportunities in neighbouring urban centres. In the 1990s, the RLR-SP system faced the introduction of an irrigation canal, shrimp farming, tree plantations, and the partial conversion of deep-water rice areas into mixed gardens. More recently, the demand for sugar palm fruits by the caning industry has revived an interest in sugar palm groves. A policy to raise the farm incomes associated with palm oil companies supported the conversion of paddy fields into small oil palm plantations, which is the most important recent land-use change and future threat to the survival of the RLRSP system. Like in other Southeast Asian coastal areas, the increased frequency of extreme climatic events is another major threat faced by this emblematic but increasingly vulnerable cultural agroecosystem. The profitable and land/water resource efficient association of the RLR-SP system with commercial vegetable production on diversified smallholdings is a promising way towards a more sustainable landscape management that could be supported by improving on-farm water storage.

TI  - Surface roughness signatures of summer arctic snow-covered sea ice in X-band dual-polarimetric SAR
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface roughness of sea ice is primary information for understanding sea ice dynamics and air-ice-ocean interactions. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful tool for investigating sea ice surface roughness owing to the high sensitivity of its signal to surface structures. In this study, we explored the surface roughness signatures of the summer Arctic snow-covered first-year sea ice in X-band dual-polarimetric SAR in terms of the root mean square (RMS) height. Two ice campaigns were conducted for the first-year sea ice with dry snow cover in the marginal ice zone of the Chukchi Sea in August 2017 and August 2018, from which high-resolution (4 cm) digital surface models (DSMs) of the sea ice were derived with the help of a terrestrial laser scanner to obtain the in situ RMS height. X-band dual-polarimetric (HH and VV) SAR data (3 m spatial resolution) were obtained for the 2017 campaign, at a high incidence angle (49.5 degrees) of TerraSAR-X, and for the 2018 campaign, at a mid-incidence angle (36.1 degrees) of TanDEM-X 1-2 days after the acquisition of the DSMs. The sea ice drifted during the time between the SAR and DSM acquisitions. As it is difficult to directly co-register the DSM to SAR owing to the difference in spatial resolution, the two datasets were geometrically matched using unmanned aerial vehicle (4 cm resolution) and helicopter-borne (30 cm resolution) photographs acquired as part of the ice campaigns. A total of five dual-polarimetric SAR features?backscattering coefficients at HH and VV polarizations, co-polarization ratio, co-polarization phase difference, and co-polarization correlation coefficient ?were computed from the dual-polarimetric SAR data and compared to the RMS height of the sea ice, which showed macroscale surface roughness. All the SAR features obtained at the high incidence angle were statistically weakly correlated with the RMS height of the sea ice, possibly influenced by the low backscattering close to the noise level that is attributed to the high incidence angle. The SAR features at the mid-incidence angle showed a statistically significant correlation with the RMS height of the sea ice, with Spearman's correlation coefficient being higher than 0.7, except for the co-polarization ratio. Among the intensity-based and polarimetry-based SAR features, HH-polarized backscattering and co-polarization phase difference were analyzed to be the most sensitive to the macroscale RMS height of the sea ice. Our results show that the X-band dual-polarimetric SAR at mid-incidence angle exhibits potential for estimation of the macroscale surface roughness of the first-year sea ice with dry snow cover in summer.

TI  - Cytosolic and Metallothionein-Bound Hepatic Metals and Detoxification in a Sentinel Teleost, <i>Dules auriga</i>, from Southern Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dules auriga, a native Brazilian teleost, was applied as a sentinel species regarding metal contamination at Ilha Grande Bay, previously considered a reference site in Southeastern Brazil. Cytosolic (S50) and metallothionein-bound (HTS50) hepatic iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), cadmium (Cd), and silver (Ag) were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), while metallothionein (MT) concentrations were determined by polarography. Ag concentrations in both cytosolic fractions were below the limit of detection. All other HTS50 metal contents were significantly lower than S50 contents. No significant associations were found for MT. Fe and Mn S50 were positively and moderately correlated to total length, as well as HTS50 Mn, while total weight was correlated to both Mn fractions, suggesting that environmental Mn and Fe concentrations may influence fish growth. A moderate correlation between the condition factor and the S50 Cu fraction was observed, also indicating that Cu may affect fish growth. Inter-element correlations were observed, including between Cd, a toxic element, and Mn and Zn, both essential elements. Calculated molar ratios indicate that both Mn and Zn are in molar excesses compared with Cd, corroborating literature assessments regarding protective Mn and Zn effects against Cd. Lack of MT correlations suggests that metal concentrations may not be high enough to reach an MT induction threshold and that MT variability is probably linked to environmental metal concentrations. Therefore, the increased environmental contaminant levels observed in the study area indicate the need for biomonitoring efforts aiming at the application of efficient mitigation measures.

TI  - Quantitative monitoring of changes in forest habitat connectivity following the great eastern Japan earthquake and tsunami
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context In March of 2011 a huge tsunami devastated forest habitats along the coast of Sendai Bay in northeastern Japan. Evaluation and monitoring of the changes in habitat connectivity caused by this disaster are essential for managing the recovery of ecosystems and biodiversity. Objectives This research is designed to clarify changes in habitat connectivity caused by the tsunami, as well as subsequent changes due to the process of recovery and restoration. Methods Forest patch distribution maps were constructed from remote sensing data for 2010, just before the tsunami, 2011, immediately after the tsunami, and 2012 and 2016. A binary connection model was employed to generate forest patch network maps for each of the target years, for connectivity distances of 100 m, 800 m and 2500 m. Also, two quantitative connectivity indices, the Integral Index of Connectivity and Class Coincidence Probability were used to assess the changes in continuity. Results The forest patch network map and quantitative indices analysis both showed that not only had the forest habitats been reduced and fragmented by the tsunami, but that continuity kept declining in the following year. By 2016, however, newly established forest patches connected with extant ones, resulting in a slight recovery in habitat connectivity. Conclusions The network maps allowed clear visualization of changes in connectivity over the study period, and were backed up by quantitative results from the indices. This method is relevant for conservation of species with diverse mobility and habitat continuity needs, and for management and restoration of coastal ecosystems.

TI  - The full-length genome characterization and diversity of faba bean necrotic stunt virus in Iran
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Faba bean necrotic stunt virus (FBNSV) (genus Nanovirus; family Nanoviridae) is a multipartite virus comprising eight circular single-stranded DNA components, each about 1 kb in length. Also, two alphasatellites have often been reported to be associated with FBNSV infection. The only full-length genome sequence of an Iranian FBNSV isolate, FBNSV-[IR;Ka:FB], so far reported is one infecting faba bean (Vicia faba L.). To obtain more information about Iranian isolates of FBNSV (FBNSV-IRs) and their diversity, the full-length genome of four FBNSV isolates and associated alphasatellites obtained from faba bean (two isolates), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L., one isolate) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L., one isolate) were characterized. All genomic components except U4 had the expected size in accordance with the FBNSV genomic sequences published in the GenBank. The component U4 had an additional stretch of 16 nucleotides (nts 765-780) in its non-coding region (NCR). Alphasatellites of the aforementioned isolates showed 98-100% sequence identity. Intra-component sequence analyses of FBNSV-IRs indicated a range of 98 to 100% nt identity between each single FBNSV-IRs component or between their associated alphasatellites. DNA-M and DNA-U2 exhibited the highest value of diversity, sharing 98-99% identity. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that FBNSV-IRs were clustered with a Moroccan isolate and some Azerbaijani isolates of FBNSV forming a clade distinct from Ethiopian isolates. Inter-component sequence analyses of NCRs revealed the DNA-S and DNA-U4 subgrouped together in all FBNSV-IRs isolates except the chickpea isolate in which NCRs of DNA-S and DNA-U4 formed separate subgroups.

TI  - Mitochondrial stress-activated cGAS-STING pathway inhibits thermogenic program and contributes to overnutrition-induced obesity in mice
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Obesity is a global epidemic that is caused by excessive energy intake or inefficient energy expenditure. Brown or beige fat dissipates energy as heat through non-shivering thermogenesis by their high density of mitochondria. However, how the mitochondrial stress-induced signal is coupled to the cellular thermogenic program remains elusive. Here, we show that mitochondrial DNA escape-induced activation of the cGAS-STING pathway negatively regulates thermogenesis in fat-specific DsbA-L knockout mice, a model of adipose tissue mitochondrial stress. Conversely, fat-specific overexpression of DsbA-L or knockout of STING protects mice against high-fat diet-induced obesity. Mechanistically, activation of the cGAS-STING pathway in adipocytes activated phosphodiesterase PDE3B/PDE4, leading to decreased cAMP levels and PKA signaling, thus reduced thermogenesis. Our study demonstrates that mitochondrial stress-activated cGAS-STING pathway functions as a sentinel signal that suppresses thermogenesis in adipose tissue. Targeting adipose cGAS-STING pathway may thus be a potential therapeutic strategy to counteract overnutrition-induced obesity and its associated metabolic diseases. Juli Bai et al. demonstrate that overexpression of DsbA-L or knockout of STING in adipocytes protects mice against high-fat diet-induced obesity. They find that inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway in adipocytes activates thermogenesis. This study presents the cGAS-STING pathway as a potential target for anti-obesity therapeutics.

TI  - Impact of aerosols on deep convective clouds using integrated remote sensing techniques
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques were used to study the impact of aerosols on deep convective clouds and their abilities to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) that formed on 21 May 2011 over Gandhi college region, India. Analysis using MODIS images and AERONET data indicated that dust particles were advected into the atmosphere during the dust storm. angstrom ngstrom values of 0.7 to 0.8 and refractive index values of 1.43 to 1.47 obtained from AERONET indicate the presence of dust particles that got coated with sulfate. These sulfate-coated dust particles enhanced its ability to act as CCN by permitting the hygroscopic growth in subsaturated condition. The hygroscopic growth of dust particles was seen from an increase in fine particles in aerosol optical depth (AOD). Under the subsaturated condition, the water vapor froze and initiated ice formation. Thus, the aerosol-induced convection enhancement was a combination of delayed warm rain and enhanced mixed-phase processes within the clouds. The present study indicates that the impact of aerosols on clouds is location specific and satellite data along with ground-based measurements could be used to determine factors influencing the formation of deep convective clouds leading to heavy rainfall.

TI  - Changes in South American hydroclimate under projected Amazonian deforestation
T2  - ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Continued deforestation in the Amazon forest can alter the subsurface/surface and atmospheric branches of the hydrologic cycle. The sign and magnitude of these changes depend on the complex interactions between the water, energy, and momentum budgets. To understand these changes, we use the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model with improved representation of groundwater dynamics and the added feature of Amazonian moisture tracers. The control simulation uses moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) based observations of land use, and the deforestation simulations use a "business-as-usual" scenario projected for 2040-2050. Our results show that deforestation leads to changes that are seasonally very different. During the dry season, deforestation results in increased albedo and less available net radiation. This change, together with reduced leaf area, results in decreased evapotranspiration (ET), less atmospheric moisture of Amazonian origin, and an increase in temperature. However, we find no changes in precipitation over the basin. Conversely, during the wet season, surface winds increase significantly due to decreased surface roughness. Vapor transport increases throughout the deforested region and leads to an increase in easterly moisture export, and significant decrease in precipitation within the deforested regions of Eastern Amazon. Contrary to expectations, the moisture tracers in WRF show no evidence that precipitation decreases are due to recycling or changes in stability.

TI  - An effective approach for mapping permafrost in a large area using subregion maps and satellite data
T2  - PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost distribution maps are of importance for environmental assessment, climate system modeling, and practical engineering applications. The scarcity of forcing data and parameters often limits the uses of permafrost models over large areas. However, detailed data are often available in a few subregions through field investigations. In this study, we propose a novel approach for mapping permafrost distribution in a large and data-scarce area using an empirical model with subregion permafrost maps and satellite data as inputs. The surface frost number model (FROSTNUM) was re-inferred to include an extra soil parameter to represent the thermal and moisture conditions in soils. The optimal soil parameters were determined from the subregion maps of permafrost distribution through spatial clustering, parameter optimization, and the decision tree method. FROSTNUM was fed with satellite-derived ground surface freezing and thawing indices to map the permafrost distribution over the study area. The proposed approach was evaluated in the Gaize area on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where intensive field studies have been done. The simulated permafrost distribution is consistent with a map of permafrost distribution made from borehole observations and field surveys in Gaize. Due to excellent accuracy, the approach is effective and can be used in large areas with limited data.

TI  - Applications in Remote Sensing to Forest Ecology and Management
T2  - ONE EARTH
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Remote sensing provides valuable insights into pressing environmental challenges and is a critical tool for driving solutions. In this Primer, we briefly introduce the important role of remote sensing in forest ecology and management, which includes applications as diverse as mapping the distribution of forest ecosystems and characterizing the three-dimensional structure of forests. We describe six key reasons why remote sensing has become an important data source and introduce the different types of sensors (e.g., multispectral and synthetic aperture radar) and platforms (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites) that have been used for mapping a diversity of forest variables. The rapid advancement in remote-sensing technology, techniques, and platforms is likely to result in a greater democratization of remote-sensing data to support forest management and conservation in parts of the world where environmental issues are the most urgent.

TI  - Mapping erosion risk for saline rangelands of the Mancos Shale using the rangeland hydrology erosion model
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research used the rangeland hydrology and erosion model (RHEM) to map erosion risks affecting water quality of the Colorado River that originate on the Mancos Shale formation in Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. The Mancos Shale is a significant source of salinity to the river, and a portion of that salt load derives from erosion of rangeland soils. Here we demonstrate that the hillslope-scale RHEM model can effectively characterize erosion risk across this large, discontinuous region. Inputs to RHEM included digital elevation data, maps of soil properties, the LANDFIRE vegetation map, Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery, field data from the Rangeland National Resource Inventory program of the US Natural Resources Conservation Service, and rainfall data from Atlas 14 of the U.S. National Atmospheric and Oceanographic Administration. RHEM predicted sediment yield at a 30-m spatial resolution for storms with 30- and 60-min durations whose intensities corresponded to 10- and 25-year return frequencies. Results corresponded reasonably with prior field experiments that used the Walnut Gulch Rainfall Simulator (WGRS), with a Spearman's rank-order correlation of .76 for cumulative sediment yield after 20 min of rainfall. Issues of input map accuracy were identified for rainfall intensity and estimates for sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of soils. Correction of erroneous SAR at WGRS sites in one location improved rank-order correlation to .93, indicating very good model performance where map inputs are accurate. The high-resolution map of erosion risk developed from RHEM can help to prioritize specific areas for more intensive study and action.

TI  - Monitoring of phenological stage and yield estimation of sunflower plant using Sentinel-2 satellite images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increase of the world's population, while urbanization is increasing, agricultural lands are decreasing. Therefore, monitoring of up-to-date agricultural lands is important for agricultural product estimation. The study investigates suitability of Sentinel-2 data for the phenological stage analysis and yield estimation of sunflower plant. To this aim, fieldworks was conducted and sunflower parcels were identified in Zile district of Tokat province, Turkey which has dense sunflower production. In this study, ten Vegetation Indices (VIs) were performed by using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data obtained during the growth stages of sunflower plant and yield estimation was obtained. As a result, the indices obtained on 30 June, at the stage of inflorescence emergence, provided coefficient of determination (R-2) higher than 0.67 and The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) lower than 13 kg/da. Among the VIs, the best forecast obtained by NDVI (R-2 = 0.74 and RMSE = 10.80 kg/da) approximately three months before the harvest of sunflower.

TI  - Investigation of WRF's ability to simulate the monsoon-related seasonal variability in the thermodynamics and precipitation over southern peninsular India
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of the state-of-the-art, higher-resolution, convection-permitting, weather research forecasting (WRF) model in predicting the changes in precipitation regimes which come in response to the seasonal changes in the large-scale environmental forcing. The simulation days are selected in the year 2009 and according to four environmental regimes defined by the daily flow direction (Ragi et al. (IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens 55:3466-3474, 2017)) using QuikSCAT scatterometer and the comparison of the same with National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) final analysis (FNL) data. The observations used for analysis are from Indian Meteorological Department, Wyoming, TRMM satellite data, and NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data. This study finds that WRF is capable of reproducing the season-specific differences in the precipitating patterns that reflect the different phases of the monsoon. Extensive comparisons to observations point out that the model simulates reasonably well the temperature and the humidity fields, including their diurnal variability and vertical structure. However, the model-produced precipitation and winds do not compare so well, especially the winds. The simulated large-scale monsoon circulation and rainfall patterns indicate a wet bias in the model rainfall simulations than the TRMM rainfall observations over the selected region. In particular, WRF overestimates the rain. The base variables such as outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), latent and sensible heat fluxes, and convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition energy (CIN) are nearly in agreement with the observations. In effect, WRF is skilled to represent the variability in different seasons and its spatial distribution, an important characteristic of the precipitation, especially concerning prediction of the monsoon onset. The disagreements between the observed and the model precipitation and winds can be due to the WRF model physics which generates different dynamics and different precipitating systems and initial conditions.

TI  - Can science literacy help individuals identify misinformation in everyday life?
T2  - SCIENCE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Certain science-related topics elicit persistent public controversy, such as routine childhood vaccinations and anthropogenic climate change. Many people are misinformed about the scientific facts underlying these issues. In response, science educators have called for improvements in the public's science literacy, but it is not clear which components of science literacy would help individuals identify misinformation. In this position paper, we examine this issue and make two arguments. First, we unpack the construct of science literacy to the seven components identified by the National Academies, and argue that four of these components are most likely to help individuals identify misinformation in everyday life: (a) Understanding of scientific practices; (b) Identifying and judging appropriate scientific expertise, (c) Epistemic knowledge, and (d) Dispositions and habits of mind, for example, inquisitiveness and open-mindedness. We also show that three of these four components are not commonly used in definitions of science literacy. Second, we posit that two opposite reasons explain why misinformation is so intractable: on the one hand, that individuals uncritically accept most information, even if it is false, and on the other hand, that they reject information that contradicts their worldview, even if it is true. Consequently, we argue that inculcating intellectual virtues, such as open-mindedness, should be central to imparting science literacy and propose some implications for educational practice. Lastly, we point out some limitations of our arguments and offer recommendations for further research.

T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines antisemitism on the Norwegian far-right from the first wave of politically organized neo-Nazism in the late 1960s to the present. Two sets of questions form the core of the analysis. First, the ideological content of antisemitism is analysed. Which motifs, images, and narratives have circulated in Norwegian far-right antisemitism from the 1960s to the present, and what has their function been? Second, the article focuses on the relationships between antisemitism and other group constructions. To what extent has antisemitism on the Norwegian far-right been supplemented with or replaced by other enemy images? One main conclusion is that anti-Jewish expressions often signal a total worldview. Here, not only immigration or multiculturalism but the prevailing systemin totois rejected as the 'tool' for an alleged 'Jewish conspiracy'. In this sense, antisemitism often marks a revolutionary ideological position and militant political strategies.

TI  - Detection and mapping of snow avalanche debris from Western Himalaya, India using remote sensing satellite images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Release of snow avalanche from a mountain slope depends on various parameters such as snow cover, terrain and meteorological conditions of the region. The precise information of avalanche occurrence in terms of its location and extent is essentially important for hazard mapping and for avalanche occurrence feedback. In the present study, various techniques have been explored for automatic detection and mapping of snow avalanche debris for a part of Western Himalayan region using Sentinel-2 satellite data. Spectral signatures of avalanche and non-avalanche snow collected from the field spectroradiometer survey are used for identifying suitable spectral bands of Sentinel-2 for avalanche debris detection. Techniques such as Ratio Method, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix, a new proposed index, i.e. Avalanche Debris Index and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) are applied on satellite images to retrieve the avalanche debris. Retrieved avalanche debris are further compared with the manually digitized avalanche occurred boundaries. The OBIA method has been found the most suitable for avalanche debris detection and mapping using the medium resolution satellite data.

TI  - Knowledge discovery from remote sensing images: A review
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY
M3  - Review
AB  - The development of Earth observation (EO) technology has made the volume of remote sensing data archiving continually larger, but the knowledge hidden in massive remote sensing images has not been fully exploited. Through in-depth research on the artificial intelligence (AI)-based knowledge discovery approaches from remote sensing images, we divided them into four typical types according to their development stage, including rule-based approaches, data-driven approaches, reinforcement learning approaches, and ensemble methods. The basic principles, typical applications, advantages, and disadvantages have been detailed for commonly used algorithms within each category. Conclusions include the following: (a) Rule-based, data-driven and reinforcement learning algorithms form a trilogy from knowledge to data, and to capabilities. (b) Rule-based data mining algorithms can provide prior knowledge for data-driven approaches, the knowledge discovered by data-driven models can be as an important complement to expert knowledge and rule sets, and reinforcement learning approaches can effectively make up for the lack of training samples or small training sample in data-driven models. (c) The traditional data-driven machine learning approaches and their ensemble methods are the current and may be the future mainstream methods for large regional and even global scale long time series remote sensing data mining and analysis, and improving their computing efficiency is the key research direction. (d) Deep learning, deep reinforcement learning, transfer learning, and an ensemble approach of the three may be the main means for small-area scope, short time series, and key geoscience information extraction from remote sensing images within a long time of the future.This article is categorized under:Algorithmic Development > Spatial and Temporal Data MiningFundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge > Big Data MiningTechnologies > Artificial Intelligence

M3  - Article
AB  - The utilisation of solar resources has become of utmost importance for the transition of the global, carbon intensive economy. In New Zealand the uptake of solar energy has increased substantially, but the relative contribution to the overall energy mix is still small. Previous research efforts on the solar resource across the country are revisited with improved satellite-modelled data from Solargis to derive a solar atlas for the country. A comparison is made with NIWA data, which shows that the modelled data are at an adequate level of accuracy and improves our understanding of the solar resource at an appropriate spatial and temporal resolution. The solar atlas makes available a commercial satellite data source and informs further investigations into how solar can, and will, play a more meaningful role in our transition to a low carbon future.

TI  - Causes and consequences of environmental degradation along the Shatt Al-Arab River: a coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) perspective
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Shatt Al-Arab River region (SARR) in Iraq was an economically important area for food production. By the 1970s the environment of this region had begun to deteriorate, and since then the SARR has suffered from severe human- and natural-induced problems. In this study we use a coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) perspective to identify these problems, their interconnections, and the degree to which human or natural systems have contributed to environmental degradation. We used several measures of ecological, economic and social systems to quantify the problems and document changes over the past five decades. The SARR has experienced significant climatological changes from 1975 to 2017, including lower precipitation and humidity, and increases in temperature and sea level, which affected the salinity of groundwater and river water. Human systems in the SARR also experienced tremendous stresses, including war and economic sanctions. We calculated and analyzed changes in vegetation via NDVI classification of Landsat imagery for five dates between 1975 and 2017 to understand how the environment has been affected. Changes in climatological variables were associated with lower NDVI throughout the region. However, vegetation decreased on the Iraqi side of the river, while it increased slightly on the Iranian side. This drop appears related to higher salinity in both surface and groundwater in Iraq, while irrigation from less saline water has maintained more consistent vegetation in Iran, suggesting that hydrologic diversion may be driving distinct trajectories for land use and vegetation on either side of the Shatt Al-Arab River.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - South Texas has experienced local transmission of Zika virus and of other mosquito-borne viruses such as chikungunya virus and dengue virus in the last decades. Using a mosquito surveillance program in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) and San Antonio, TX, from 2016 to 2018, we detected the presence of an insect-specific virus, cell fusing agent virus (CFAV), in the Aedes aegypti mosquito population. We tested 6,326 females and 1,249 males from the LRGV and 659 females from San Antonio for CFAV by RT-PCR using specific primers. Infection rates varied from 0 to 261 per 1,000 mosquitoes in the LRGV and 115 to 208 per 1,000 in San Antonio depending on the month of collection. Infection rates per 1,000 individuals appeared higher in females collected from BG Sentinel 2 traps compared to Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps, but the ratio of the percentage of infected pools did not differ by trap type. The natural viral load in individual males ranged from 1.25 x 10(2) to 5.50 x 10(6) RNA copies and in unfed females from 5.42 x 10(3) to 8.70 x 10(6) RNA copies. Gravid females were found to harbor fewer viral particles than males and unfed females.

TI  - Mangrove forest classification and aboveground biomass estimation using an atom search algorithm and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAdvances in earth observation and machine learning techniques have created new options for forest monitoring, primarily because of the various possibilities that they provide for classifying forest cover and estimating aboveground biomass (AGB).MethodsThis study aimed to introduce a novel model that incorporates the atom search algorithm (ASO) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) into mangrove forest classification and AGB estimation. The Ca Mau coastal area was selected as a case study since it has been considered the most preserved mangrove forest area in Vietnam and is being investigated for the impacts of land-use change on forest quality. The model was trained and validated with a set of Sentinel-1A imagery with VH and VV polarizations, and multispectral information from the SPOT image. In addition, feature selection was also carried out to choose the optimal combination of predictor variables. The model performance was benchmarked against conventional methods, such as support vector regression, multilayer perceptron, random subspace, and random forest, by using statistical indicators, namely, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R-2).ResultsThe results showed that all three indicators of the proposed model were statistically better than those from the benchmarked methods. Specifically, the hybrid model ended up at RMSE = 70.882, MAE = 55.458, R-2 = 0.577 for AGB estimation.ConclusionFrom the experiments, such hybrid integration can be recommended for use as an alternative solution for biomass estimation. In a broader context, the fast growth of metaheuristic search algorithms has created new scientifically sound solutions for better analysis of forest cover.

TI  - Integrating finite-element-model and remote-sensing data into SWAT to estimate transit times of nitrate in groundwater
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study integrates a water-table estimator into the hydrologic model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) to simulate transit times of nitrate in groundwater for Fish River basin in Alabama, USA. Three water-table estimators were developed using 3D finite-element-modeling data and spatiotemporally dynamic remotely sensed data. Initially, the study estimates spatiodynamic groundwater levels by coupling the spatial percolation from SWAT with a finite element model. The study then improved the spatial resolution of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) remote sensing data by the inverse distance weighted technique and generated the spatial groundwater levels. Next, empirical equations describing the relationship between the soil moisture and groundwater levels were obtained based on the SWAT-modeled groundwater levels and remotely sensed soil moisture contents. The results showed that the correlations of the groundwater levels between real stationed data and those obtained from the finite element method, GRACE approximations and the soil-moisture function were 0.691, 0.335 and 0.652 respectively. The spatiodynamic-groundwater-level estimates obtained from the best performing integrated model (SWAT and finite element model) were used to predict transit times of nitrate in groundwater with the aid of remotely sensed data. The result indicates that the transit time increases progressively from 1 year at 0.2-m depth of soil layer to 23 years at 0.80-m depth of soil layer in the Fish River basin. The transit times were positively related to the amount of spatially contributed nitrate in the groundwater that flows into river reaches in the basin.

AB  - For patients who were first discovered and initially diagnosed with advanced melanoma, it is worthwhile to consider whether primary site surgery (PSS) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can also improve the prognosis of patients. This study aimed to assess the effect of PSS and SLNB on the prognosis of patients with advanced melanoma at first diagnosis and to evaluate whether both can improve the overall survival of patients. The survival and disease information of patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma were downloaded from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify risk factors for overall survival (OS) and melanoma-specific survival (MSS). To reduce the possibility of bias, 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was used to match age, race, marital status, sex, and tumor size to AJCC stage III and IV patients. A total of 918 patients were included in the study, of which the most were white, accounting for 94.9%, and the average age was 63.9 years. There were 311 females (33.9%) and 607 males (66.1%). Most of the patients with metastasis were gathered in the nonsurgical intervention group, and a few were in the PSS group. Patients with stage III who underwent "SLNB + PSS" (HR = 0.316, 95% CI 0.038-0.801, P = 0.009), PSS (HR = 0.511, 95% CI 0.323-0.874, P = 0.013), and lymphadenectomy (HR = 0.240, 95% CI 0.009-0.853, P = 0.027) had significantly reduced risk of melanoma-specific survival. In stage IV patients, PSS significantly improved patients' OS (HR = 0.589, 95% CI 0.351-0.987, P = 0.045) and MSS (HR = 0.507 95% CI 0.321-0.849, P = 0.025). "SLNB + PSS" significantly improved OS (HR = 0.877, 95% CI 0.414-0.935, P = 0.043) and MSS (HR = 0.717 95% CI 0.315-0.854, P = 0.019) in patients. For patients with advanced melanoma on first diagnosis, sentinel lymph node biopsy and primary site surgery can still improve patient survival.

TI  - Evaluating the capabilities of Sentinel-2 data for large-area detection of bark beetle infestation in the Central German Uplands
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An increase in forest damage caused by the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) has recently been observed in many Central European forests such as the forests of the Central German Uplands. For these regions, which are highly vulnerable due to their tree species composition and an increasing frequency of extreme weather events, the availability of time- and cost-efficient monitoring procedures is of particular importance. Thus it was the objective of our study to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-2 data for large-area detection of bark beetle infestation. Using change detection, infestation maps were produced for the Saxon Switzerland National Park Forest District (SAXS) and the Black Forest National Park (BFOR). An accuracy assessment provided a user's accuracy of 97% (SAXS) and 88% (BFOR), respectively. The calculation of the producer's accuracy (AP) resulted in 34% (SAXS) and 4% (BFOR). However, when small infestation areas were excluded from stereoscopic reference data, AP increased up to 52% (SAXS) and 40% (BFOR), respectively. Taking these findings into account, our study highlights both the high value of Sentinel-2-based change detection for area-wide bark beetle monitoring and its limitation to large contiguous infestation areas.

TI  - Monitoring the spatiotemporal changes in regional ecosystem health: a case study in Izmir, Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The maintenance of human well-being and development is dependent on ecosystem goods and services. However, natural ecosystems and biodiversity have been disturbed by human activities. Therefore, assessment of ecosystem health has become one of the main topics in landscape management. The aim of this study is to reveal the effects of land use/land cover (LULC) change on regional ecosystem health (REH) in Izmir, Turkey. The study used the vigour, organization and resilience model together with potential ecosystem services to understand the relationships between LULC structure, ecosystems and human activities using the most populous and urbanized parts of Izmir metropolitan city. For this purpose, the CORINE land cover maps and Landsat satellite images for 1990 and 2018 were used. Our results showed that there was an increase in the mean regional ecosystem health value (from 48.06 to 49.32) during 1990-2018, but it changed in an inconsistent way in the different parts of the study area. The urban sprawl type and the presence of vegetation were important factors affecting the overall REH value. The spatiotemporal LULC changes were effective on all the ecosystem health indicators. Among all the ecosystem health indicators, ecosystem vigour and resilience were the most important factors positively affected the REH level in highly urbanized districts. Overall, our study showed that whilst the gains in vegetation between urban and rural areas enhanced the ecosystem vigour and resilience during 1990-2018, they have also improved the regional health of districts located along the coastal parts of the study area.

TI  - Assessment of the Sentinel-1 based ground motion data feasibility for large scale landslide monitoring
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a systematic procedure to assess the feasibility of Advanced Differential Interferometric SAR (A-DInSAR) technique for landslide monitoring using SAR images acquired by Sentinel-1 sensors is presented. The methodology is named "Assessment of the advanced differentiaL interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique Feasibility for large scale lAndslide monitoring - ALFA" and it is structured in two main phases, which includes pre-processing and post-processing elaborations. The methodology was developed and tested in the Alpine sector of the Piedmont region in Italy, which represents a landslide prone area. In particular, ALFA represents a methodology based on previous algorithms available in the literature to assess the a-prior feasibility assessment and post-processing analysis of A-DInSAR data for landslide, which introduces three novel aspects such as (1) a systematic scheme suitable within regional practices; (2) the use of Sentinel-1 data and the development of (3) an index to take into account of the kind of distribution of the measuring points along the landslide. The approach was applied over an area extended about 5300 km(2) affected by 5703 landslides mapped in the database of the Piedmont Region (Landslides information system in Piedmont-SIFRAP). Sentinel-1 images covering the period 2014-2018 were analysed. The results show the potential of the Sentinel-1 data for large-scale landslide monitoring. The developed methodology presents reliable tools that could be useful as feasibility for the use of Sentinel-1 data for landslide monitoring at regional and national scale.

TI  - Monitoring dissolved organic carbon by combining Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites: Case study in Saginaw River estuary, Lake Huron
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in aquatic environments is an important cyded pool of organic matter on the Earth. Satellite remote sensing provides a useful tool to determine spatiotemporal distribution of water quality parameters. Previous DOC remote sensing studies in inland water suffered from either low spatial resolution or low temporal frequency. In this study, we evaluated the potential of jointly using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 with high spatial resolution to estimate DOC concentrations in Saginaw River plume regions of Lake Huron. Firstly. CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter) was estimated from images using the known models and then DOC can be derived in terms of the good correlations between DOC and CDOM. The results show that Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 had acceptable accuracy and good consistency in DOC estimation so that jointly using them can improve the observation frequency. In different seasons from 2013 to 2018, DOC was typically higher in spring and autumn but lower in summer. Monthly spatiotemporal variations of DOC in 2018 were also observed. The image-derived DOC spatiotemporal variations show that DOC was covaried with Saginaw River discharge (r =0.82) and also weakly and negatively correlated with water temperature (r =-0.6). This study demonstrated that using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 together can offer the potential applications for monitoring DOC and water quality dynamic in complex inland water. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A nomogram to predict non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in patients with initial cN plus breast cancer that downstages to cN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives This study mainly explored the factors that influence non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis in patients with breast cancer (BC) whose axillary lymph nodal status changed from clinically node positive (cN+) to clinically node negative (cN0) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological factors affecting NSLN metastasis in a total of 179 patients with cN+ BC downstaged to cN0 (120 in the training set and 59 in the validation set) who underwent both sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection following NAC.Results Among 179 patients enrolled, the overall NSLN metastatic rate was 24.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.7%-30.3%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the number of positive SLNs achieving a pathological complete remission of the breast and clinical node staging was independent predictors of NSLN metastasis. A nomogram was established based on these factors and displayed a good discriminatory capability, with an area under the curve of 0.919 (95% CI: 0.865-0.973) for the training set and 0.900 (95% CI: 0.812-0.988) for the validation set and its clinical utility was confirmed by the decision curve analysis.Conclusions The nomogram established showed the ability to predict NSLN metastases in patients with initial cN+ BC that downstaged to cN0 after NAC.

TI  - Deep Penetrating Nevus and Borderline-Deep Penetrating Nevus: A Literature Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Deep penetrating nevi (DPN) are rare melanocytic nevi, which can exhibit atypical histological features hampering the differentiation from malignant melanoma. DPN are considered benign melanocytic lesions, but rare spread to lymph nodes and unfavorable clinical outcomes associated with borderline/atypical DPN (B-DPN) has been reported. Since no guidelines are available for DPN and B-DPN, we aimed to review the literature on DPN and B-DPN to assess the management and prognosis. We screened 3,513 references from EMBASE, Scopus and Medline databases, and included 15 studies with a total of 355 DPN patients and 48 B-DPN patients. Therapeutic interventions ranged from simple excision to wide excisions and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), with block lymph node dissection in some positive SLNB cases. Follow-up periods ranged from 3 months to 23 years during which a total of five recurrences, two in DPN and three in B-DPN group, and three metastases, in B-DPN group, were reported. While some of the included studies comprised clinical and histopathological correlation, few included genetic assessment. The present review highlights the need for prospective cohort studies applying composite measures to identify effective regimens of diagnostic workup and treatment in DPN and B-DPN.

TI  - Remote sensing reveals Antarctic green snow algae as important terrestrial carbon sink
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the first estimate of green snow algae community biomass and distribution along the Antarctic Peninsula. Sentinel 2 imagery supported by two field campaigns revealed 1679 snow algae blooms, seasonally covering 1.95 x 10(6) m(2) and equating to 1.3x10(3) tonnes total dry biomass. Ecosystem range is limited to areas with average positive summer temperatures, and distribution strongly influenced by marine nutrient inputs, with 60% of blooms less than 5 km from a penguin colony. A warming Antarctica may lose a majority of the 62% of blooms occupying small, low-lying islands with no high ground for range expansion. However, bloom area and elevation were observed to increase at lower latitudes, suggesting that parallel expansion of bloom area on larger landmasses, close to bird or seal colonies, is likely. This increase is predicted to outweigh biomass lost from small islands, resulting in a net increase in snow algae extent and biomass as the Peninsula warms. Snow algae bloom along the coast of Antarctica and are likely to be biogeochemically important. Here, the authors produced the first map of such blooms, show that they are driven by warmer temperatures and proximity to birds and mammals, and are likely to increase given projected climate changes.

TI  - Improving air quality forecasting with the assimilation of GOCI aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals during the KORUS-AQ period
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Korean Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite has monitored the East Asian region in high temporal (e.g., hourly) and spatial resolution (e.g., 6km) every day for the last decade, providing unprecedented information on air pollutants over the upstream region of the Korean Peninsula. In this study, the GOCI aerosol optical depth (AOD), retrieved at the 550 nm wavelength, is assimilated to enhance the quality of the aerosol analysis, thereby making systematic improvements to air quality forecasting over South Korea. For successful data assimilation, GOCI retrievals are carefully investigated and processed based on data characteristics such as temporal and spatial distribution. The preprocessed data are then assimilated in the three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3D-Var) technique for the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). For the Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) period (May 2016), the impact of GOCI AOD on the accuracy of surface PM2.5 prediction is examined by comparing with effects of other observations including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors and surface PM2.5 observations. Consistent with previous studies, the assimilation of surface PM2.5 measurements alone still underestimates surface PM2.5 concentrations in the following forecasts, and the forecast improvements last only for about 6 h. When GOCI AOD retrievals are assimilated with surface PM2.5 observations, however, the negative bias is diminished and forecast skills are improved up to 24 h, with the most significant contributions to the prediction of heavy pollution events over South Korea.

TI  - A comparative analysis of different phenological information retrieved from Sentinel-2 time series images to improve crop classification: a machine learning approach
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the potential of phenological indicators derived from Sentinel-2A (S2) time series were evaluated to explore the key variables that allow identifying both cropland and crop types. Based on the derived S2 phenological metrics and fitted vegetation indices (VI), 10 feature sets were developed and assessed to discriminate different crop types via Random Forest (RF) classifier. The comparison between VI data-based classifications has shown that NDVI and EVI2 phenological sets could delineate and identify crop types more accurately compared to RENDVI data. Overall, the combined use of fitted VI and phenological features rather than being used separately achieved the best performances. Further, the result of using optimum features was the most accurate among 10 feature sets, with an overall accuracy of 88% and kappa of 0.84. This study constitutes a substantial improvement in crop type identification, which gives a valuable tool to monitor agricultural areas.

TI  - Investigating urban land dynamic change and its spatial determinants in Harbin city, China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Research and analysis of urban growth and its driving factors are crucial to the long-term sustainable development of cities. Based on the multi-temporal Landsat remote sensing data, this paper extracts urban information by interpreting and supervising classification, and makes a dynamic study on the urban expansion of Harbin in different temporal intervals. By analyzing the spatial determinants of urban growth, we deeply understand the process of urban growth, thus providing important help for urban planning and policy formulation. In this paper, four landscape metrics (total area, aggregation index, landscape shape index, and total edge) were selected to characterize the urban landscape characteristics from two spatial scales (2 and 5 km grid sizes), then the spatial regression model was used to explore the relationship between the urban landscape and its spatial determinants. These changes exhibit significant spatial variations and spatial autocorrelation at two spatial scales. Topography and proximity factors have important effects on urban landscape change. These research results may help us to better understand the process and driving factors of urban development, so as to help the underdeveloped cities in northeast China to formulate scientific and reasonable development plans and policies.

TI  - Optical properties of dust and crop burning emissions over India using ground and satellite data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms during the pre-monsoon season (April-June) and crop residual burning events during the post-monsoon season (mid-October-mid-November) are common every year over the Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP). In this paper, we have compared dust storm and crop burning aerosols characteristics for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 using ground and satellite data. CALIPSO data show that dust layers extended from the ground upto an altitude of about 5 km and the smoke from crop burning upto the height of 2 km. Characteristics of dust and crop burning aerosols show pronounced difference based on Kanpur AERONET data. Dominance of coarse particles (0.6-15 mu m) during dust storms (pre-monsoon season), while fine particles (0.05-0.6 mu m) dominate during crop residual burning. The spectral variations of single scattering albedo (SSA) during dusty days and crop burning days show low and high fractions of anthropogenic aerosols. We have also observed the impact of dust particles on Himalayan snow (cover, albedo and reflectance) and meteorological parameters (relative humidity and water vapor) on the surface and lower atmosphere using MODIS data and AIRS data at different pressure levels. Pronounced aerosols behaviors of the crop residual burning event coincided with Diwali festival on 30-31 October 2016 were observed. Our detailed analysis combining ground and satellite observations provides better understanding of aerosol optical and microphysical properties of dust storms and crop residual burnings. The results will be valuable in monitoring surrounding environment, identifying the emission source and dynamics of dust storms and crop burning emissions over India, especially in the IGP.

TI  - Spatio-temporal interactions of surface urban heat island and its spectral indicators: a case study from Istanbul metropolitan area, Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A surface urban heat island (SUHI) is a significant meteorological phenomenon of the microclimate and environment in urban territories. Knowledge about the variations of SUHI is critical for urban planning and public welfare. In the current study, the seasonal and spatial changes of the Istanbul SUHI and its interactions with spectral indicators of the urban heat phenomenon including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), tasseled cap wetness (TCW), and surface albedo were analyzed. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) L2 thermal products (brightness temperature) of Landsat 8 imageries were used to calculate land surface temperature (LST) values. The thermal islands of the study area were detected based on the Urban Thermal Field Variation Index method. The retrieved LST values showed acceptable agreement with in situ observations of mean daily temperature for all the seasons. Monthly precipitation, however, demonstrated good correlation with summer and autumn LSTs. It is found that the central parts of the metropolitan area were subject to the most intense SUHI in the spring and summer seasons. Outskirt areas showed higher thermal values during cooler seasons of autumn and winter. The results of spatio-temporal interactions of SUHI and the spectral indicators revealed a negative correlation for NDVI and TCW and a positive correlation for surface albedo during different seasons from summer 2017 to spring 2018. The highest and lowest correlations were found between SUHI and TCW (spring) and surface albedo (winter), respectively. The regression results overall suggested that TCW and NDVI were the best indicators of SUHI in Istanbul. Surface albedo was not recommended for seasonal monitoring practices of SUHI in the study area due to the high differences in its seasonal interactions.

TI  - Inhibition of protein phosphatase methylesterase 1 dysregulates MAP kinase signaling and attenuates muscle cell differentiation
T2  - GENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Protein phosphatase methylesterase 1 has been identified as a novel gene in skeletal muscle that is upregulated in response to neurogenic atrophy in mice. Western blot analysis confirms that Ppme1 is expressed during both muscle cell proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, the Ppme1 promoter is active in muscle cells, while mutation of a conserved E-box element prevents full induction of the Ppme1 reporter gene, suggesting that Ppme1 is transcriptionally regulated by myogenic regulatory factors. Interestingly, immunofluorescence analysis indicates that Ppme1 is localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, while cell fractionation shows that Ppme1 is found only in the cytoplasm. Functional studies reveal that inhibition of Ppme1 using ABL127 or AMZ30 attenuates muscle cell differentiation. Interestingly, inhibition of Ppme1 by ABL127 led to a significant increase in AP-1 reporter activity, as well as, increases in ERK1/2, c-Jun, Ppme1, and PP2A protein levels in differentiating muscle cells. In contrast, AMZ30 treated cells showed a significant decrease in AP-1 reporter activity and a decrease in ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation levels. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation studies show that ABL127, but not AMZ30, causes disruption of the endogenous interaction between Ppme1 and PP2A. The data in this study show for the first time that Ppme1 is expressed in skeletal muscle and is upregulated in response to neurogenic atrophy. Furthermore, these findings suggest that Ppme1 may act as a sentinel of the MAP kinase signaling pathway and may indirectly regulate the ERK1/2 and p38 branches via a non-canonical mechanism leading to inhibition of muscle cell differentiation.

TI  - Should altitudinal gradients of temperature and precipitation inputs be inferred from key parameters in snow-hydrological models?
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates whether snow-covered area and streamflow measurements can help assess altitudinal gradients of temperature and precipitation in data-scarce mountainous areas more efficiently than using the usual interpolation procedures. A dataset covering 20 Alpine catchments is used to investigate this issue. Elevation dependency in the meteorological fields is accounted for using two approaches: (i) by estimating the local and time-varying altitudinal gradients from the available gauge network based on deterministic and geostatistical interpolation methods with an external drift; and (ii) by calibrating the local gradients using an inverse snow-hydrological modelling framework. For the second approach, a simple two-parameter model is proposed to target the temperature/precipitation-elevation relationship and to regionalize air temperature and precipitation from the sparse meteorological network. The coherence of the two approaches is evaluated by benchmarking several hydrological variables (snow-covered area, streamflow) computed with snow-hydrological models fed with the interpolated datasets and checked against available measurements. Results show that accounting for elevation dependency from scattered observations when interpolating air temperature and precipitation cannot provide sufficiently accurate inputs for models. The lack of high-elevation stations seriously limits correct estimation of lapse rates of temperature and precipitation, which, in turn, affects the performance of the snow-hydrological simulations due to imprecise estimates of temperature and precipitation volumes. Instead, retrieving the local altitudinal gradients using an inverse approach enables increased accuracy in the simulation of snow cover and discharge dynamics while limiting problems of over-calibration and equifinality.

TI  - Utilising red cell antigen genotyping and serological phenotyping in sickle cell disease patients to risk-stratify patients for alloimmunisation risk
T2  - TRANSFUSION MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Alloimmunisation and haemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs) can occur in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) despite providing phenotype-matched red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Variant RBC antigen gene alleles/polymorphisms can lead to discrepancies in serological phenotyping. We evaluated differences between RBC antigen genotyping and phenotyping methods and retrospectively assessed if partial antigen expression may lead to increased risk of alloimmunisation and HTRs in SCD patients at a tertiary centre in Canada.Methods RBC antigen phenotyping and genotyping were performed by a reference laboratory on consenting SCD patients. Patient demographic, clinical and transfusion-related data were obtained from a local transfusion registry and chart review after research ethics board approval.Results A total of 106 SCD patients were enrolled, and 91% (n = 96) showed additional clinically relevant genotyping information when compared to serological phenotyping alone. FY*02N.01 (FY*B GATA-1) (n = 95; 90%) and RH variant alleles (n = 52, 49%; majority accompanied by FY*02N.01) were common, the latter with putative partial antigen expression in 25 patients. Variability in genotype-phenotype antigen prediction occurred mostly in the Rh system, notably with the e antigen (kappa: 0.17). Fifteen (14.2%) patients had a history of alloimmunisation, with five having HTR documented; no differences in clinical outcomes were found in patients with partial antigen expression. Genotype/extended-phenotype matching strategies may have prevented alloimmunisation events.Conclusion We show a high frequency of variant alleles/polymorphisms in the SCD population, where genotyping may complement serological phenotyping. Genotyping SCD patients before transfusion may prevent alloimmunisation and HTRs, and knowledge of the FY*02N.01 variant allele increases feasibility of finding compatible blood.

TI  - Exploring the spatial-temporal characteristics of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Central Asia based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Asia has become a key node of the belt and road corridor. It is located in arid and semi-arid climate regions, and it is a region where the contribution of global aerosols of sand and dust is continuous. However, few studies have been conducted on the Central Asian aerosol optical depth. Therefore, this paper relied on the belt and road sustainable development dataset to analyze the spatial-temporal variations in the AOD in Central Asia and provide spatial-temporal characteristics of the AOD for environmental services. We analyzed the spatial and temporal variation in the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Central Asia by using MODIS/AQUA C6 MYD08_M3 images from 2008 to 2017. The results showed that (1) the annual average AOD in Central Asia in the past decade varied from 0.183 to 0.232, which indicated a slow decline starting in 2014. The percentage of average annual decline was approximately 0.18%, and the regular distinct revealed the distribution characteristics of AOD. In different years, the Central Asian region exhibited the similar monthly change characteristics: from July to December, the AOD decreased, and from December to February, it increased. In different seasons, the Central Asian region exhibited the different seasonal change characteristics: the AOD value was higher in the spring and summer. The mean values in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter were 0.273, 0.240, 0.155, and 0.183, respectively, and the standard deviations were 0.036, 0.038, 0.025, and 0.048, respectively. (3) Based on spatial distribution characteristics, the Tarim Basin, Aral Sea region, and Ebinur Lake area were high value areas, and Kazakhstan was a low value area. The AOD of the surrounding area of the Aral Sea had increased in the last 5 years, while that of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan had decreased. The AOD of the Taklamakan area exhibited an inter-annual change. Sand dust aerosols were the largest contributors to the AOD in the Taklamakan area. The rising trend of the AOD in the Aral Sea area was clear, with an average annual increase of 0.234%, and the contribution of salt dust aerosols to the AOD increased. The average annual AOD in the Ebinur Lake area remained stable.

AB  - The United States is funding homeland security programs with a large budget (e.g., 74.4 billion for FY 2019). A number of game-theoretic defender-attacker models have been developed to study the optimal defense resource allocation strategies for the government (defender) against the strategic adversary (attacker). However, to the best of our knowledge, the substitution or complementary effects between different types of defensive resources (e.g., human resource, land resource, and capital resource) have not been taken into consideration even though they exist in practice. The article fills this gap by studying a sequential game-theoretical resource allocation model and then exploring how the joint effectiveness of multiple security investments influences the defensive budget allocation among multiple potential targets. Three false belief models have been developed in which only the defender, only the attacker, and both the defender and attacker hold false beliefs about the joint effectiveness of resources. Regression analysis shows that there are significant substitution effects between human and capital resources. The results show that the defender will suffer a higher loss if he fails to consider the substitution or complementary effects. Interestingly, if the attacker holds a false belief while the defender does not, the defender will suffer an even higher loss, especially when the resources are substitutes. However, if both the attacker and defender hold false beliefs, there will be lower loss when resources are complementary. The results also show that the defender should allocate the highly effective resource when the resources substitute each other. This article provides some new insights to the homeland security resource allocation.

TI  - Recent understanding of Antarctic supraglacial lakes using satellite remote sensing
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) are now known to be widespread in Antarctica, where they represent an important component of ice sheet mass balance. This paper reviews how recent progress in satellite remote sensing has substantially advanced our understanding of SGLs in Antarctica, including their characteristics, geographic distribution and impacts on ice sheet dynamics. Important advances include: (a) the capability to resolve lakes at sub-metre resolution at weekly timescales; (b) the measurement of lake depth and volume changes at seasonal timescales, including sporadic observations of lake drainage events and (c) the integration of multiple optical satellite datasets to obtain continent-wide observations of lake distributions. Despite recent progress, however, there remain important gaps in our understanding, most notably: (a) the relationship between seasonal variability in SGL development and near-surface climate; (b) the prevalence and impact of SGL drainage events on both grounded and floating ice and (c) the sensitivity of individual ice shelves to lake-induced hydrofracture. Given that surface melting and SGL development is predicted to play an increasingly important role in the surface mass balance of Antarctica, bridging these gaps will help constrain predictions of future rapid ice loss from Antarctica.

TI  - A global compilation of in situ aquatic high spectral resolution inherent and apparent optical property data for remote sensing applications
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Light emerging from natural water bodies and measured by radiometers contains information about the local type and concentrations of phytoplankton, non-algal particles and colored dissolved organic matter in the underlying waters. An increase in spectral resolution in forthcoming satellite and airborne remote sensing missions is expected to lead to new or improved capabilities for characterizing aquatic ecosystems. Such upcoming missions include NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission; the NASA Surface Biology and Geology designated observable mission; and NASA Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) airborne missions. In anticipation of these missions, we present an organized dataset of geographically diverse, quality-controlled, high spectral resolution inherent and apparent optical property (IOP-AOP) aquatic data. The data are intended to be of use to increase our understanding of aquatic optical properties, to develop aquatic remote sensing data product algorithms, and to perform calibration and validation activities for forthcoming aquatic-focused imaging spectrometry missions. The dataset is comprised of contributions from several investigators and investigating teams collected over a range of geographic areas and water types, including inland waters, estuaries, and oceans. Specific in situ measurements include remote-sensing reflectance, irradiance reflectance, and coefficients describing particulate absorption, particulate attenuation, non-algal particulate absorption, colored dissolved organic matter absorption, phytoplankton absorption, total absorption, total attenuation, particulate backscattering, and total backscattering. The dataset can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.902230 (Casey et al., 2019).

TI  - Measuring upper limb function and patient reported outcomes after major breast cancer surgery: a pilot study in an Asian cohort
T2  - BMC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Major breast cancer surgery especially with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), is associated with upper limb functional decline. Majority of studies are conducted in Western population and may not be applicable to Asians. This pilot study aims to evaluate whether major breast surgery results in upper limb functional impairment in a cohort of Asian women with breast cancer. Methods This is a prospective cohort study of 41 patients who underwent 44 major breast surgeries from April 2018 to August 2019. Main inclusion criteria were patients over 21 years of age undergoing major breast surgery for breast cancer. Major breast surgery was defined as wide local excision (WLE) or mastectomy. Main exclusion criteria were patients with pre-existing neurological or rheumatological co-morbidities affecting upper limb function or previous trauma with resulting deformities to the upper limbs. Patients underwent early rehabilitation from post-operative day 1. Shoulder flexion and abduction active range of motion (AROM) and QuickDASH disability score were assessed 1 week before surgery, post-operative week 2 and week 6. Baseline demographics and peri-operative data were also collected. Results Median age was 62.5 years. There were 16 (36.4%) wide local excisions and 28 (63.6%) simple mastectomies. Two (4.5%) cases had neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Fifteen (34.1%) cases had ALND. At post-operative week 6, shoulder flexion was comparable to baseline (p = 0.775), while abduction improved from baseline (p = 0.016). However, QuickDASH disability score was significantly worse at post-operative week 6 compared to baseline (median score 2.5 vs 0, p = 0.027). Subgroup analysis of patients with ALND demonstrated significantly worse QuickDASH disability score at post-operative week 6 (p = 0.010) but not for patients with only sentinel lymph node biopsy (p = 0.396). Conclusion This pilot study in an Asian cohort found that patients were able to regain AROM of shoulder after major breast surgery at post-operative week 6 but had a worse QuickDASH disability score, especially in the subgroup with ALND. Aggressive and early rehabilitation should be encouraged. However, a longer follow-up is required to evaluate long term functional outcomes.

TI  - Assessment of NO<sub>2</sub> observations during DISCOVER-AQ and KORUS-AQ field campaigns
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - NASA's Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ, conducted in 2011-2014) campaign in the United States and the joint NASA and National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) Korea-United States Air Quality Study (KORUS-AQ, conducted in 2016) in South Korea were two field study programs that provided comprehensive, integrated datasets of airborne and surface observations of atmospheric constituents, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), with the goal of improving the interpretation of spaceborne remote sensing data. Various types of NO2 measurements were made, including in situ concentrations and column amounts of NO2 using ground- and aircraft-based instruments, while NO2 column amounts were being derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on the Aura satellite. This study takes advantage of these unique datasets by first evaluating in situ data taken from two different instruments on the same aircraft platform, comparing coincidently sampled profile-integrated columns from aircraft spirals with remotely sensed column observations from ground-based Pandora spectrometers, intercomparing column observations from the ground (Pandora), aircraft (in situ vertical spirals), and space (OMI), and evaluating NO2 simulations from coarse Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) and high-resolution regional models. We then use these data to interpret observed discrepancies due to differences in sampling and deficiencies in the data reduction process. Finally, we assess satellite retrieval sensitivity to observed and modeled a priori NO2 profiles. Contemporaneous measurements from two aircraft instruments that likely sample similar air masses generally agree very well but are also found to differ in integrated columns by up to 31.9 %. These show even larger differences with Pandora, reaching up to 53.9 %, potentially due to a combination of strong gradients in NO2 fields that could be missed by aircraft spirals and errors in the Pandora retrievals. OMI NO2 values are about a factor of 2 lower in these highly polluted environments due in part to inaccurate retrieval assumptions (e.g., a priori profiles) but mostly to OMI's large footprint (> 312 km(2)).

TI  - Change detection, risk assessment and mass balance of mobile dune fields near Dunhuang Oasis with optical imagery and global terrain datasets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the kinematic evolution patterns of dune migration plays a major role in resisting the sand-dust disasters and evaluating the desertification process. With the increment of optical observations, measuring the dune migration with dense spatial and temporal density has become possible. In this study, with the open-accessible Landsat-8 (L8)/Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery and global terrain datasets, we designed a complete workflow of inverting the dune displacement time series and velocity, identifying the potential encroachment risk, and evaluating the sediment balance of mobilized dune fields near Dunhuang Oasis. After the performance of time-series inversion, the standard deviation (STD) of measurements in stable area of raw correlation results was improved by above 40%. The displacement time series and velocity revealed out the spatial heterogeneity and seasonal/inter-annual dynamic evolution of dune migration. Furthermore, dune encroachment risk in the immediate vicinity of local landscapes was evaluated to highlight the unstable dune fields, and the workability of existent sand-control facilities. Additionally, the mass budget of around -0.001 +/- 0.025 m/yr shows the stable sediment transport in Mingsha mountain. This study case can be exemplified to lead the risk monitoring and sustainable conservation of Dunhuang region and other places controlled by similar climatic conditions.

TI  - Long time series of remote sensing to monitor the transformation research of Kubuqi Desert in China
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is one of the major challenges facing humanity. However, there is no effective way to effectively control desertification. China is experiencing serious desertification, and to alleviate this trend, China has implemented a series of major ecological projects since 1978 and has achieved good results. Remote sensing can record changes in surface processes over a long period of time and can play an active role in desertification monitoring and governance. However, there is no systematic remote sensing monitoring method for desertification. In response to this problem, this paper takes a demonstration and reconstruction project of the United Nations desertification in the Kubuqi Desert in China as an example. By using the 30-year time series Landsat data, we propose a new remote sensing monitoring method for the impact of ecological restoration engineering of desert to monitor the spatial and temporal evolution pattern of the Kubuqi Desert in the past 30 years and the impact of the human ecological reconstruction project on the location of land use types in the Kubuqi Desert. In addition, the method analyzes the impact of the Kubuqi Desert Reconstruction Project on the local ecological environment changes from time and space perspectives. The results show the following: (1) During 1991-2017, the Kubuqi Desert Reconstruction Project improved the cultivated land, afforestation, and the Yellow River Drainage to control the sand and in conjunction with other renovation projects improved the ecological environment. The area of the sandy land decreased from 45.76% to 28.66%, while the areas of the waters wetland and artificial forest (shrub), urban construction land, and agricultural land increased; (2) There are obvious time and space differences in the transformation, and the vegetation cover increases as a whole. The obvious change areas are mainly distributed in the riverbank irrigation area of the Yellow River section of the Kubuqi Desert and the torrents such as the Maobula Kong, Buer Taigou and Heilaigou and other mountain gully areas. The relevant experience of the Kubuqi Desert Reconstruction Project in China has important reference significance for world desertification transformation.

TI  - Role of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Microinvasive Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Microinvasive ductal carcinoma (DCISM), defined as DCIS with a focus of invasive carcinoma <= 1 mm, can be managed similarly to pure DCIS; however, management of the axilla in DCISM has been a subject of debate. Reports in the literature differ on the utility and necessity of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for DCISM. The aim of the present study was to identify risk factors for nodal disease in patients with DCISM, which can help develop a selective approach to SLNB in this patient population. Methods The National Cancer Database was used to select patients with DCISM (pT1mi), diagnosed from 2012 to 2015, who underwent SLNB. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to determine associations between sentinel lymph node metastasis and relevant clinical variables. Results Our cohort comprised of 2609 patients with pT1mi who underwent SLNB. Of these, 76 (2.9%) were found to have sentinel lymph node metastases on final pathology. Low/intermediate grade tumors were associated with decreased SLN metastasis (OR 0.50, CI 0.28-0.92). Age and receptor status of the tumor did not have a clear association in predicting SLN metastases. Conclusions The rate of sentinel node metastases in DCISM is low at only 2.9% in this national study. Tumor grade was identified as influencing the risk of SLN metastases. This information can factor into shared decision-making for SLNB in patients with DCISM.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used the Landsat 8 OLI satellite image and the supervised classification method to estimate uneven-aged forest stand parameters and land use/cover. The spatial success of classification was also investigated. The overall success rates and Kappa values of the classification were, respectively, 74.7% and 0.75 for actual structural type, 84.6% and 0.80 for crown closure, and 88.35% and 0.81 for land use class, whereas the spatial success of classification on the forest cover type map was 36.91% for actual structural type, 64.74% for crown closure, and 41.78% for land use/cover class. The results revealed that the Landsat 8 OLI image can be used to identify stand parameters and land use/cover class. However, because the spatial success rates were below 50% for the actual structural type and land use/cover class of the stand types, it is not suitable for use in spatial classification determination for these classes.

TI  - Current Issues in Conduct and Reporting of Noninferiority Randomized Controlled Trials in Surgical Management of Cancer Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Serious concerns regarding quality of conduct and reporting of noninferiority trials (NITs) have been raised. Systematic analysis of the quality of the surgical NITs is lacking. Assessing the quality of conduct, reporting, and interpretation of surgical NITs in cancer patients is critical given their potential clinical impact. We aim to assess the quality of conduct, reporting, and interpretation of NITs that investigate the effects of surgical management in cancer patients. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of papers identified through a comprehensive literature database search was performed. Forty papers employing a phase III noninferiority (NI) randomized trial design to study effects of surgical methodology or sequencing of surgery in patients with solid cancers were included. Papers were assessed for type of analysis, justification of the noninferiority margin (NIM), consistency of type I error with confidence intervals (CIs), ability to achieve the predefined sample size, and interpretations regarding NI. Results Only half of the papers used both intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses; 62.5% provided no or poor justification for the NIM; 42.5% showed inconsistency of the type I error rate with CIs; 52.5% were deemed poor or fair quality, and 60.0% did not achieve the predefined sample size. One-fifth of the papers provided interpretation of the NI hypothesis that was not in concordance with the CONSORT guidelines. Conclusions The quality of conduct, reporting, and interpretation of surgical NITs is suboptimal, requiring further improvements through adherence to guidelines and rigorous assessment at the stages of the study approval, funding, and the peer-review process.

TI  - Does sentinel lymph node biopsy for screening high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast cause more harm than good?
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast does not metastasize to axillary lymph nodes. Yet high-grade DCIS (HgDCIS) is often subjected to Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) concomitant with definitive surgery. This is to avoid further axillary surgery in the event of upstaging to invasive carcinoma, which often entails Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND). We wished to examine the validity of this approach. Methods This study includes a retrospective analysis of consecutive pre-operatively diagnosed HgDCIS patients from a single screening unit between December/2014 and August/2016. The main outcomes were the overall incidence of upstaging and the independent predictors of upstaging on multivariable analysis. The rates of various complications of SLNB vs ALND in four RCTs were used to calculate the upstaging rate below which SLNB could be safely omitted. Results There were 224 eligible patients of whom 26 (11.6%) were upstaged. Axillary metastasis (pN1) occurred in two patients (0.9%). On Univariable analysis, upstaged patients were significantly younger (median (IQR) = 56.0 (51.0-63) vs 60.0 (54.0-65.0); p = 0.019). Radiological size, pathological size, type of biopsy, type of operation, and comedo-necrosis were not significant (p > 0.05). On multivariable analysis, age as a continuous variable (OR 0.93; p = 0.031) and core biopsy (OR 2.62; p = 0.036) were the only independent predictors of upstaging. Chi-square test showed that patients < 55 years whose pre-operative diagnosis was made on core biopsy were at significantly higher risk of upstaging than the others (31.8% vs 9.4%; p = 0.002). Conclusion Upstaging of HgDCIS is infrequent. According to the known rates of complications of SLNB relative to ALND, routine SLNB concomitant with surgery seems to be more harmful than its routine omission. A selective approach based on age and type of biopsy could be considered.

AB  - The recent availability of freely and openly available satellite remote sensing products has enabled the implementation of global surface water monitoring at a level not previously possible. Here we present a global set of satellite-derived time series of surface water storage variations for lakes and reservoirs for a period that covers the satellite altimetry era. Our goals are to promote the use of satellite-derived products for the study of large inland water bodies and to set the stage for the expected availability of products from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, which will vastly expand the spatial coverage of such products, expected from 2021 on. Our general strategy is to estimate global surface water storage changes (Delta V) in large lakes and reservoirs using a combination of paired water surface elevation (WSE) and water surface area (WSA) extent products. Specifically, we use data produced by multiple satellite altimetry missions (TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, Jason-3, and Envisat) from 1992 on, with surface extent estimated from Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2000 on. We leverage relationships between elevation and surface area (i.e., hypsometry) to produce estimates of Delta V even during periods when either of the variables was not available. This approach is successful provided that there are strong relationships between the two variables during an overlapping period. Our target is to produce time series of Delta V as well as of WSE and WSA for a set of 347 lakes and reservoirs globally for the 1992-2018 period. The data sets presented and their respective algorithm theoretical basis documents are publicly available and distributed via the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO DAAC; https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/, last access: 13 May 2020) of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Specifically, the WSE data set is available at https://doi.org/10.5067/UCLRS-GREV2 (Birkett et al., 2019), the WSA data set is available at https://doi.org/10.5067/UCLRS-AREV2 (Khandelwal and Kumar, 2019), and the Delta V data set is available at https://doi.org/10.5067/UCLRS-STOV2 (Tortini et al., 2019). The records we describe represent the most complete global surface water time series available from the launch of TOPEX/Poseidon in 1992 (beginning of the satellite altimetry era) to the near present. The production of long-term, consistent, and calibrated records of surface water cycle variables such as in the data set presented here is of fundamental importance to baseline future SWOT products.

TI  - Classification of complex environments using pixel level fusion of satellite data
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study reports classification and analysis of composite land features using fusion images obtained by fusing two original hyperspectral and multispectral datasets. The high spatial-spectral resolution, multi-instrument and multi-period satellite images were used for fusion. Three pixel level fusion based techniques, Color Normalized Spectral Sharpening (CNSS), Principal Component Spectral Sharpening Transform (PCSST) and Gram-Schmidt Transform (GST), were implemented on the datasets. Performance evaluations of three fusion algorithms were done using classification results. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) were used for classification using five types of images, viz. hyperspectral, multispectral and three fused images. Number of classes considered was eight. Sufficient number of ground field data for each class has also been acquired which was needed for supervise based classification. The accuracy was improved from 74.44 to 97.65% when the fused images were considered with SVM classifier. Similarly, the results were improved from 69.25 to 94.61% with original and fused data using MLC classifier. The fusion image technique was found to be superior to the single original image and the SVM is better than the MLC method.

TI  - Annual 30-m land use/land cover maps of China for 1980-2015 from the integration of AVHRR, MODIS and Landsat data using the BFAST algorithm
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual land use land cover (LULC) change information at medium spatial resolution (i.e. at 30 m) is required in numerous subjects, such as biophysical modelling, land management and global change studies. Annual LULC information, however, is usually not available at continental or national scale due to reasons such as insufficient remote sensing data coverage or lack of computational capabilities. Here we integrate high temporal resolution and coarse spatial resolution satellite images (i.e., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) with high spatial resolution datasets (China's Land-Use/cover Datasets (CLUDs) derived from 30-meter Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI) to generate reliable annual nominal 30 m LULC maps for the whole of China between 1980 and 2015. We also test the performance of a statistical based change detection algorithm (Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend), originally designed for tracking forest change, in classifying all-type LULC change. As a result, a nominal 30 m annual land use/land cover datasets (CLUD-A) from 1980 to 2015 was developed for the whole China. The mapping results were assessed with a change sample dataset, a regional annual validation sample set and a three-year China sample set. Of the detected change years, 75.61% matched the exact time of conversion within +/- 1 year. Annual mapping results provided a detail process of urbanization, deforestation, afforestation, water and cropland dynamics over the past 36 years. The consistent characterization of land change dynamics for China can be further used in scientific research and to support land management for policy-makers.

TI  - Variation in Albedo and Its Relationship With Surface Dust at Urumqi Glacier No. 1 in Tien Shan, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is an important driver of surface processes that promote glacier melting and is a key variable influencing glacier surface melt. Despite much focus in the literature on variations in albedo and its influence on snow surfaces, little attention has been paid to dust and its impact on bare-ice albedo with respect to glacier melting surfaces. In this paper, spatial changes in glacier albedo were investigated using three Landsat images taken during the ablation season in 2006; temporal variations in albedo were measured by an automatic weather station (AWS) in the ablation zone between 26 June and 1 August 2007 at Urumqi Glacier No. 1 in Tien Shan. Ice and snow samples and reflection spectra at 325-1050 nm were collected in August, 2007 at Urumqi Glacier No. 1. The data suggested that spatial changes in glacier albedo are not prominent after snowfall; however, once ice becomes exposed, glacier albedo varies remarkably and generally increases with elevation, especially around the snow line. Temporal variations are characterized by a large range and high frequency, and most are induced by snowfall, changes in cloud conditions, and surface dust; snowfall and cloud increase glacier albedo. Furthermore, the response of snow albedo is more sensitive to cloud compared with the response of ice albedo. Over a bare ice surface, the albedo generally decreases as the concentration of surface dust increases. Organic matter is a primary factor in reducing the albedo over ice.

TI  - Blend Sign Is a Strong Predictor of the Extent of Early Hematoma Expansion in Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Purpose: It is unclear which imaging marker is optimal for predicting the extent of hematoma expansion (EHE). We aimed to compare the usefulness of the blend sign (BS) with that of other non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) markers for predicting the EHE in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH).Methods: Patients with sICH admitted to our Neurology Emergency Department between September 2013 and January 2019 were enrolled. The EHE was calculated as the absolute increase in hematoma volume between baseline and follow-up CT (within 72 h). The EHE was categorized into four groups: "no growth," "minimal change" (<= 5.1 ml), "moderate change" (5.1-12.5 ml), and "massive change" (>12.5 ml). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between the NCCT markers [BS, black hole sign (BHS), satellite sign, and island sign] and the EHE.Results: A total of 1,111 sICH patients were included (median age: 60 years; 66.5% males). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the presence of the BS and BHS was independently associated with the EHE, after adjusting for confounders (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively). The presence of the BS and BHS was positively correlated with growth category (r = 0.285 and r = 0.199, both Ps < 0.001). The BS demonstrated a better predictive performance for the EHE than did the BHS [area under the curve (AUC): 0.67 vs. 0.57; both Ps < 0.001].Conclusions: In patients with acute sICH, the BS showed a better performance in predicting the EHE compared with other NCCT markers. This imaging marker may help identify patients at a high risk of significant hematoma expansion and may facilitate its early management.

TI  - Breast-conserving surgery without axillary lymph node surgery or radiotherapy is safe for HER2-positive and triple negative breast cancer patients over 70 years of age
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The prognosis of elderly patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is very good, and their survival is unaffected by performing breast-conserving surgery (BCS) without radiotherapy. Therefore, we aimed to verify that BCS without axillary lymph node dissection, sentinel lymph node biopsy, or radiotherapy (BCSNR) is safe for patients over 70 years of age with luminal-type breast cancer, as well as for those with HER2-positive and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Methods This study retrospectively included 450 patients > 70-year-old with breast cancer from 2010 to 2016. The patients were divided into two groups, one treated with BCSNR and the other treated with mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection (MALND), with a median follow-up period of 5 years. Disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival, local recurrence, distant metastasis, and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) were compared between the two groups. Results The 5-year DFS for patients who underwent BCSNR and MALND was 90.1 and 91.3% (p = 0.903), respectively. In the BCSNR and MALND groups, respectively, the 5-year DFS for patients with luminal A type breast cancer was 99.2 and 100% (p = 0.167), that for patients with luminal B type breast cancer was 89.2 and 95.5% (p = 0.138), that for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer was 86.7 and 75.9% (p = 0.455), and that for TNBC patients was 71.7 and 89.7% (p = 0.195). IBTR significantly differed between the BCSNR and MALND groups for patients with TNBC (18.9% vs 0.0%, p = 0.040) and luminal B type patients (5.6% vs 0.0%, p = 0.043). Conclusion BCSNR is not only suitable for elderly patients with luminal-type breast cancer but also for those with HER2-positive breast cancer and TNBC.

TI  - Mapping copper mineralization using EO-1 Hyperion data fusion with Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2A in Moroccan Anti-Atlas
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In Morocco, the oriental Anti-Atlas encompasses many valuable deposits, including that of copper (Cu) which is located in the Sidi Flah-Bouskour inlier. This deposit is known for its high importance on the national scale. The present work aims to compare the Hyperion raw and fused data for mapping Cu mineralization. After applying the pre-processing steps on the images used, the fusion (hyperspectral/multispectral) process was done using the colour normalized spectral sharpening method. Subsequently, the mineralogical mapping task was performed using the mixture tuned matched filtering and the independent component analysis methods. In the last step, a geophysical data, a field survey and spectroradiometric measurements were done for checking and validating the results obtained. The analysis showed a high performance of the fused images for mineralogical mapping. Consequently, the methodology proposed can be exploited in mineralogical mapping, and also in other remote sensing works.

TI  - Spatio-temporal trends in snow extent and their linkage to hydro-climatological and topographical factors in the Chitral River Basin (Hindukush, Pakistan)
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In many parts of the world, including the Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalayan (HKH) region, the population depends on snow and glaciers-melt waters to grow food, generate electricity and store water for their use throughout the year. The annual and seasonal variation in the snow cover area (SCA) due to its response to the climatic variables directly influences the water supplies. The aim of current study is to evaluate the spatio-temporal trends in the annual and seasonal snow cover at basin-wide scale. Impact of topography on the SCA is analyzed by revealing the trends in SCA in different elevation bands. It also investigates the trends in hydro-climatic factors (temperature, precipitation and river flows) in the Chitral River basin (Hindukush region) and their linkage to the SCA variations. Snow cover is estimated using cloud-free 8-day MODIS snow products on 17-year time-period (2000-2016). Hydro-climatic data of the river flow (1989-2014), temperature, and precipitation (1965-2013) were obtained from Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), and Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). Trend analysis of the SCA and hydro-climatic variables was carried out using Mann-Kendall's trend test and Sen's slope. The results reveal: (1) a significant increasing trend in the SCA at basin-wide scale and at all elevation zones i.e. A to E (1471-7708 m ASL), except zone B (2500-3500 m ASL), (2) decreasing and constant trends in the mean temperature and total precipitation, respectively, over the same time-period as SCA indicating possible reasons for increasing SCA, (3) a slight decrease in the mean annual and summer flow (1989-2014) possibly due to the summer cooling, reduced snowmelt and slightly decreasing summer precipitation over this time-period, and (4) strong dependency of the Chitral River flow on snowmelt, driven by the temperature seasonality. Modeling snowmelt runoff under future climate projections in the study area may help to manage the water resources properly.

TI  - Thermal sharpening of MODIS land surface temperature using statistical downscaling technique in urban areas
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The limitation of thermal satellite images at finer spatial resolution (FR) led to increased demand for developing various downscaling techniques for the generation of FR image of land surface temperature (LST) to enhance the information content. Thus, the major concern of the analysis is the thermal sharpening of MODIS-LST in various urban regions by establishing the correlation of LST with various spectral indices (SI). Various regression techniques using combination of SI were applied for the thermal sharpening of LST from MODIS data over four different Indian cities with different climate zones i.e. Bikaner, Vadodara, Hyderabad and Varanasi. The LST image from MODIS sensors at spatial resolution of 930 m was disaggregated to 100 m and accuracy was determined by comparing with the LST image of Landsat-8-TIRS at 100 m. The best combination of indices found to include both vegetation and built-up/soil indices for thermal sharpening of MODIS-LST. Further, the variation of the best combination for different cities indicates its dependence on the present land cover. The correlation coefficients (R) between the downscaled MODIS-LST image and the reference-Landsat image were found to be 0.84, 0.76, 0.83 and 0.92, whereas the RMSE values were found to be 1.27, 1.02, 0.73 and 0.62 for Bikaner, Vadodara, Hyderabad and Varanasi, respectively. The RMSE values were found remarkably below the standard deviation of each reference LST image. Therefore, the downscaling approach adopted in this study showed high potential for accurate LST mapping at FR in various urban areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing demands for water due to growing population, urban expansion, agricultural development and groundwater resources are gaining much attention, particularly in Gopiballavpur block, Paschim Medinipur district (West Bengal, India). Present study used cohesive approach of remote sensing and geographic information system to deliver an appropriate platform for convergent study of multi-disciplinary data and decision building for artificial groundwater recharge. Thematic maps were generated from Landsat8-Operational land Imager (OLI) and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), and aquifer parameter thematic layers were organized from conventional field data. The weighted linear combination method was used to determine the weights of various themes and their classes, namely 'very good', 'good', 'poor' and 'very poor' for identifying recharge potential zone. It has been concluded that 14.58% area has very good groundwater recharge potentiality of the study area. The area having 'good', 'moderate' and 'low' recharge potential is about 32.77%, 39.67% and 12.98%, respectively.

TI  - Mapping multiple tree species classes using a hierarchical procedure with optimized node variables and thresholds based on high spatial resolution satellite data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species distribution mapping using remotely sensed data has long been an important research area. However, previous studies have rarely established a comprehensive and efficient classification procedure to obtain an accurate result. This study proposes a hierarchical classification procedure with optimized node variables and thresholds to classify tree species based on high spatial resolution satellite imagery. A classification tree structure consisting of parent and leaf nodes was designed based on user experience and visual interpretation. Spectral, textural, and topographic variables were extracted based on pre-segmented images. The random forest algorithm was used to select variables by ranking the impact of all variables. An iterating approach was used to optimize variables and thresholds in each loop by comprehensively considering the test accuracy and selected variables. The threshold range for each selected variable was determined by a statistical method considering the mean and standard deviation for two subnode types at each parent node. Classification of tree species was implemented using the optimized variables and thresholds. The results show that (1) the proposed procedure can accurately map the tree species distribution, with an overall accuracy of over 86% for both training and test stages; (2) critical variables for each class can be identified using this proposed procedure, and optimal variables of most tree plantation nodes are spectra related; (3) the overall forest classification accuracy using the proposed method is more accurate than that using the random forest (RF) and classification and regression tree (CART). The proposed approach provides results with 3.21% and 7.56% higher overall land cover classification accuracy and 4.68% and 10.28% higher overall forest classification accuracy than RF and CART, respectively.

TI  - Excess Out-Of-Hospital Mortality and Declining Oxygen Saturation: The Sentinel Role of EMS Data in the COVID-19 Crisis in Tijuana, Mexico.
T2  - medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences
M3  - Preprint
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Emergency medical services (EMS) may serve as a key source of real-time data about the evolving health of COVID-19 affected populations, especially in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) with less rapid and reliable vital statistic registration systems. Although official COVID-19 statistics in Mexico report almost exclusively in-hospital mortality events, excess out-of-hospital mortality has been identified in other settings, including one EMS study in Italy that showed a 58% increase. EMS and hospital reports from several countries have suggested that silent hypoxemia--low oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the absence of dyspnea--is associated with COVID-19 outbreaks. It is unclear, however, how these phenomena can be generalized to LMICs. We assess how EMS data can be used in a sentinel capacity in Tijuana, a city on the Mexico-United States border with earlier exposure to COVID-19 than many LMIC settings.METHODS: We calculated numbers of weekly out-of-hospital deaths and respiratory cases seen by EMS in Tijuana, and estimate the difference between peak-epidemic rates (during April 14th-May 11th) and forecasted 2014-2019 trends. Results were compared with official COVID-19 statistics, stratified by neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), and examined for changing demographic or clinical features, including mean (SpO2).RESULTS: An estimated 194.7 (95%CI: 135.5-253.9) excess out-of-hospital deaths events occurred, representing an increase of 145% (70%-338%) compared to forecasted trends. During the same window, only 8 COVID-19-positive, out-of-hospital deaths were reported in official statistics. This corresponded with a rise in respiratory cases of 274% (119%-1142%), and a drop in mean SpO2 to 77.7%, from 90.2% at baseline. The highest out-of-hospital death rates were observed in low-SES areas, although respiratory cases were more concentrated in high-SES areas.CONCLUSIONS: EMS systems may play an important sentinel role in monitoring excess out-of-hospital mortality and other trends during the COVID-19 crisis in LMICs. Using EMS data, we observed increases in out-of-hospital deaths in Tijuana that were nearly threefold greater magnitude than increases reported using EMS data in Italy. Increased testing in out-of-hospital settings may be required to determine if excess mortality is being driven by COVID-19 infection, health system saturation, or patient avoidance of healthcare. We also found evidence of worsening rates of hypoxemia among respiratory patients seen by EMS, suggesting a rise in silent hypoxemia, which should be met with increased detection and clinical management efforts. Finally, we observed that social disparities in out-of-hospital death that warrant monitoring and amelioration.

TI  - Extracting tidal creek features in a heterogeneous background using Sentinel-2 imagery: a case study in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to difficulties accessing areas where tidal creeks develop and the frequent morphological changes they undergo, there are very significant advantages in using remote sensing methods to effectively monitor conditions and the dynamics in these zones. The Yellow River Delta, which is the research area of this study, exhibits a very irregular tidal flat, with tidal creeks that vary in width and experience water current anisotropy. This study proposes a method for extracting tidal creeks based on a digital image processing technology that can carry out accurate characterization of tidal creeks against heterogeneous backgrounds. First, the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and Maximum Between-Class Variance (Otsu) classification are used to delineate the wide tidal creeks. Second, the modified fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm (MFCM) is used to suppress the difference between the target and background caused by spatial heterogeneity of the tidal flat environment. Next, the Gaussian matching filter (GMF) is used to enhance the narrow tidal creeks and suppress the influence of anisotropy. Then, adaptive threshold segmentation is conducted to delineate the narrow tidal creeks. Finally, the complete tidal creek networks are delineated by combining the wide and narrow tidal creeks. The overall performance was evaluated by visual interpretation and the result is excellent. In the four test areas, the kappa coefficient (kappa) was greater than 0.79, the error of Commission was less than 22%, and the error of omission was less than 15%; the proposed method performed better than the Maximum Likelihood method, Support Vector Machine, and k-means algorithms. The results show that the proposed method can differentiate tidal creeks from different research areas, with good extraction accuracy and stability. The method can provide reference data for real-time dynamic monitoring of tidal creeks and has potential for application to other tidal zones in different regions.

TI  - A hierarchical spatial-temporal graph-kernel for high-resolution SAR image change detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective utilization of structural information is important for high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image change detection. For comprehensively utilizing the local and global structures in SAR images, a hierarchical spatial-temporal graph kernel (STGK) method is proposed in this paper for high-resolution SAR image change detection. First, the bi-temporal hierarchical graph models are constructed for extracting the local-global structures in the bi-temporal SAR images. Then, a STGK function, which measures the spatial and temporal similarities between the local-global structures, is constructed for indicating the change levels between the bi-temporal images. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) is implemented with the STGK function for producing the final change detection results. Experimental results on real GaoFen-3 SAR data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and prove that the STGK method is capable of detecting changed areas with relatively complex structures.

TI  - Estimation of Trophic State Index of Chilika Lake using Landsat-8 OLI and LISS-III satellite data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Trophic State Index (TSI) of the Chilika Lake has been estimated using secchi disk transparency (SDT) as well as satellite data. An algorithm was developed to estimate TSI using in-situ observed SDT and band ratio of Landsat-8 OLI in exponential mode (R-2 = 0.72). Different interpolation methods have been applied and the best one was considered to prepare two dimensional water quality images of the lake. The in-situ and satellite observed, TSI value shows the northern sector is always in eutrophic to hypereutrophic condition. During pre-monsoon season of 2015 the southern sector shows lake water is eutrophic condition. The analysis of satellite image indicate the lake water is in eutrophic condition from the year 2006 to 2015. However, the average TSI values were comparatively less during post-monsoon season of 2013 and 2015.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of snow cover and effect of terrain attributes in the Upper Ganga River Basin, central Himalaya
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of snow cover area (SCA) in space and time is a vital input to estimate the snow/glacier melt runoff, glacial mass balance and other hydrological studies. The present study aims to find out the spatio-temporal variation of SCA and inter-relationship between snow accumulation and topography in the Upper Ganga River Basin (UGRB) including Bhagirathi, Alaknanda, Mandakini and Pindar River sub-basins, central Himalaya using MODIS Terra (MOD10A2) data. SCA is found similar to 32.33% to the total basin area of similar to 18724 km(2) in UGRB. The Average of 12 year shows that Bhagirathi River Basin has maximum SCA similar to 33.25%, whereas Pindar river basin has minimum SCA similar to 17.50% among these four sub-basins. Maximum rate of change of SCA is found in the Mandakini River Basin. Slope class 20 degrees-30 degrees has more favorable conditions for snow accumulation. North and north-west aspect has higher snow accumulation with maximum positive attribution in January and minimum in July.

TI  - Correlating Sentinel-2 MSI-derived vegetation indices with <i>in-situ</i> reflectance and tissue macronutrients in savannah grass
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of vegetation indices is subject to sensor-dependent errors and uncertainty. This study examines the accuracy of Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) imagery when estimating biophysical properties of savannah grasses. Six commonly used vegetation indices utilising spectral ranges covered by the MSI were derived from a satellite image coinciding with a field campaign. The imaging and fieldwork dates were at the end of the growing season, at peak grass productivity. Two common grass species were selected for sampling: one broad-leaved, the other narrow-leaved. At widely spread sampling sites under different grazing intensities, five plants with no external manifestation of infection and in close proximity were selected for each species. From each species 35 foliar and 10 stem reflectance measurements were collected using a spectroradiometer which sensed in the 350-2500 nm range in 1.1-1.4 nm bandwidths. The reflectance was later averaged to generate one reflectance profile per species per sampling site. The leaves and stems from which reflectance was measured were collected for laboratory analysis to determine macronutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) concentrations. At three sites where sampling coincided with sunny weather during the satellite overpass window of 09:30-10:30 AM local time, above canopy grass reflectance was measured at ground resolution distance (GRD) of 1 m. Some reflectance was collected within 10 min of image acquisition, which facilitated comparison. The image data were corrected to bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance using the Sent2Cor algorithm whose output included 20 m GRD visible, red edge, near- and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands, which were used for the respective vegetation indices. The plant level and above canopy reflectance were resampled to the spectral ranges of the MSI bands, and values of the respective indices computed. Plant level values of three red edge indices, which collectively indicated green biomass and chlorophyll, had the strongest significant correlation with N concentrations in both grass species (r = 0.473-0.561; p < 0.01). P and K concentrations had low correlations with the tested indices. Largely due to canopy background reflectance, the above canopy and image-derived vegetation index values differed from corresponding plant level values by up to 9% and 40%, respectively. Despite the attenuation, the Red Edge Chlorophyll Index, Red Edge Inflection Point and a devised SWIR ratio index (rho(1650 nm)/rho(2200 nm)) showed potential for monitoring relative chlorophyll and green biomass (indicated by N concentrations), Ca and Mg content of savannah grass using Sentinel-2 MSI images.

TI  - Study of Urban Growth Dynamics Using Global Human Settlement Layer Data Set: Uttarakhand, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to remote sensing-derived time-series geospatial data sets of built-up area, settlement typologies are becoming increasingly available in public domain. The present study aims to study the urban growth dynamics in Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, India, for the last four decades, using open and freely available Global Human Settlement Layer data sets. The growth dynamics was analysed based on factors like increase in built-up area, hot spot analysis and settlement typologies. The results indicate a highly skewed and unbalanced pattern of urban growth, especially after the formation of Uttarakhand State in year 2000. Most of the urban growth process is confined to foothill cites, while in the hill towns there is a stagnated urban growth. The study emphasizes the applicability of GHSL data sets in analysing the urban growth process in Indian conditions where time-series geospatial data are often lacking.

TI  - A rule-based spectral unmixing algorithm for extracting annual time series of sub-pixel impervious surface fraction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution and the temporal dynamics of impervious surface (IS) are important for understanding urbanization and its impact on surface energy balance, ecohydrological processes, and urban heat island. Despite the development of various methods, quantification of IS on multi-temporal scale is still challenging in complex urban areas due to the mixed pixel problem and the spectral ambiguity between classes. This study aimed at developing an algorithm, named Rule-Based Spectral Unmixing Algorithm (RBSUA), to derive sub-pixel IS fraction at annual scale using a time series of satellite images. A rule-based composite scheme is developed to integrate temporal contextual information into the popular Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to improve the classification of spectrally ambiguous classes. The developed algorithm also encompasses a temporal filtering to derive consistent IS fractions. Evaluation of the algorithm in a complex urban area - the National Capital Region (NCR), India - shows an improved performance in separating spectrally ambiguous classes, particularly IS and soil, and obtaining consistent series of IS fraction. The developed algorithm yielded the accuracy of annual IS fraction between 88% and 91% which is considerably higher than those from the original MESMA (48% to 83%). The application of the RBSUA in the NCR, India, shows that the IS has increased in the study area from the initial value of 377 +/- 78 km(2) in 1992 to 708 +/- 64 km(2) in 2017. The results suggested that the developed algorithm was effective in deriving IS at the sub-pixel level and detecting changes at the annual frequency.

TI  - Oxpeckers Help Rhinos Evade Humans
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evolutionary theory expects social, communicative species to eavesdrop most on other species' alarm calls [e.g., 1, 2] but also that solitary-living species benefit most from eavesdropping [3, 4]. Examples of solitary species responding to the alarm calls of other species, however, are limited and unconvincing [3-5]. The Swahili name for the red-billed oxpecker (Buphagus erythrorynchus) is Askari wa kifaru, the rhinos' guard [6]. Black rhino (Diceros bicornis) are a solitary-living, non-vocal species and are critically endangered through hunting. We searched Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa, for rhinoceros for 27 months with and without the aid of radio telemetry and conducted 86 experimental, unconcealed approaches to 11 rhino, without or with varying numbers of resident oxpecker. Oxpeckers enabled rhinos to evade detection by us in 40% to 50% of encounters. Alarm-calling by oxpeckers significantly improved the rate and distance that rhinos detected our approach from 23% to 100% and 27 +/- 6 m to 61 +/- 4 m, respectively. Every additional oxpecker improved detection distance by 9 m. Rhinos alerted by oxpeckers' alarm calls never re-oriented in our direction but moved to face downwind. Thus, oxpeckers' calls communicate only threat proximity, not direction, and rhinos assume the hunter is stalking from downwind. We confirm that oxpeckers guard rhinos and the importance of depredation, not sociality, in the evolution of eavesdropping [4, 7]. Conservationists should consider reintroducing oxpeckers to rhino populations, reinstating their anti-human sentinel [8].

TI  - Assessing the relationship between vegetation greenness and surface temperature through Granger causality and Impulse-Response coefficients: a case study in Mexico
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The existence of a consistent inverse relationship between vegetation greenness and surface temperature has been the premise of many environmental studies. However, some authors have found that the nature of this relationship varies depending on the spatial and temporal scales of analysis as well as vegetation type. Therefore, this research aims to contribute to the understanding of this matter by evaluating the annual and intra-seasonal relationship between Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Central Mexico using monthly anomalies of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data collected from 2002 to 2017. LAI is proposed as an alternative index to overcome the shortcomings of other widely used indicators of vegetation greenness (e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index). The presence/absence of any relationship is investigated through the notion of Granger causality, while the sign and strength of the relationship is estimated by means of an Impulse-Response (IR) function. Unlike traditional regression and correlation analysis, the Granger causality approach enables the examination of lagged effects of one variable over the other based on past values of both variables. IR coefficients, which have been rarely used in the related literature, help to model the over-time response of a variable with the change of another variable. The overall results indicate that, at any temporal scale, Granger causality from LST to LAI occurs more consistently than causality in the opposite direction. At the annual scale, the nature of the relationship is primarily inverse in both directions and usually weaker from LAI to LST. At the seasonal scale, the occurrence of LST to LAI causality is higher in spring (it occurs in about 40% of the evaluated pixels) and lower in winter (10%) among all forest types. The effect of LST on LAI is predominantly inverse (median coefficient 1 month after impulse -0.043) and particularly strong in deciduous broadleaf forest during summer. On the other hand, the effect of LAI on LST is mainly direct in autumn and inverse in the remaining seasons, except for evergreen needleleaf forest where the effect is inverse only in summer. The highest presence (23%) and strength (-0.039) of LAI to LST causality occur in spring over deciduous broadleaf forest. Based on these results, caution has to be exercised when assuming a consistent strong inverse relationship between vegetation greenness and surface temperature, which seems to be the general consensus in much of the literature that makes use of these two variables to study an environmental phenomenon.

TI  - Vaccination and monitoring strategies for epidemic prevention and detection in the Channel Island fox (<i>Urocyon littoralis</i>)
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Disease transmission and epidemic prevention are top conservation concerns for wildlife managers, especially for small, isolated populations. Previous studies have shown that the course of an epidemic within a heterogeneous host population is strongly influenced by whether pathogens are introduced to regions of relatively high or low host densities. This raises the question of how disease monitoring and vaccination programs are influenced by spatial heterogeneity in host distributions. We addressed this question by modeling vaccination and monitoring strategies for the Channel Island fox (Urocyon littoralis), which has a history of substantial population decline due to introduced disease. We simulated various strategies to detect and prevent epidemics of rabies and canine distemper using a spatially explicit model, which was parameterized from field studies. Increasing sentinel monitoring frequency, and to a lesser degree, the number of monitored sentinels from 50 to 150 radio collared animals, reduced the time to epidemic detection and percentage of the fox population infected at the time of detection for both pathogens. Fox density at the location of pathogen introduction had little influence on the time to detection, but a large influence on how many foxes had become infected by the detection day, especially when sentinels were monitored relatively infrequently. The efficacy of different vaccination strategies was heavily influenced by local host density at the site of pathogen entry. Generally, creating a vaccine firewall far away from the site of pathogen entry was the least effective strategy. A firewall close to the site of pathogen entry was generally more effective than a random distribution of vaccinated animals when pathogens entered regions of high host density, but not when pathogens entered regions of low host density. These results highlight the importance of considering host densities at likely locations of pathogen invasion when designing disease management plans.

TI  - Potential of Large-Scale Inland Water Body Mapping from Sentinel-1/2 Data on the Example of Bavaria's Lakes and Rivers
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping of water bodies is an important application area of satellite-based remote sensing. In this contribution, a simple framework based on supervised learning and automatic training data annotation is shown, which allows to map inland water bodies from Sentinel satellite data on large scale, i.e. on state level. Using the German state of Bavaria as an example and different combinations of Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery as inputs, potentials and limits for the automatic detection of water surfaces for rivers, lakes, and reservoirs are investigated. Both quantitative and qualitative results confirm that fully automatic large-scale inland water body mapping is generally possible from Sentinel data; whereas, the best result is achieved when all available surface-related bands of both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are fused on a pixel level. The main limitation arises from missed smaller water bodies, which are not observed in bands with a resolution of about 20 m. Given the simplicity of the proposed approach and the open availability of the Sentinel data, the study confirms the potential for a fully automatic large-scale mapping of inland water with cloud-based remote sensing techniques.

TI  - Determining the dry boundary of the LST/FVC space for soil moisture monitoring: a semi-empirical method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature and fractional vegetation coverage (LST/FVC) space is a classical model for monitoring soil moisture (SMC) from optical/thermal remote sensing. However, its applications are critically constrained by the determination of the dry and wet boundaries. In this study, a semi-empirical method was provided for determining the dry boundary by introducing a parallel resistance following the Biome-BGC (BioGeochemical Cycles) model to determine the temperature endmembers on the dry boundary. The semi-empirical method was evaluated by comparing with typical theoretical calculation methods in calculating soil moisture index (SMI) based on the LST/FVC space. Public datasets from SMAPVEX12 (Soil Moisture Active Passive mission Validation Experiment 2012) experiment, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), and NLDAS-2 (North American Land Data Assimilation System) Forcing Dataset were utilized in the evaluation. Results demonstrated that the semi-empirical method has comparable performances with the theoretical methods in monitoring the spatial variation of SMC. The SMIs based on the semi-empirical and theoretical methods are significantly correlated at a high level of Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) around 0.8-0.9 with p-value = 0.05. More importantly, this semi-empirical method requires fewer parameters and does not require a complex iteration calculating process as compared with previous theoretical methods.

TI  - Reconstructing past forest composition and abundance by using archived Landsat and national forest inventory data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective modelling of forest susceptibility to defoliating insect outbreaks requires a better understanding of outbreak dynamics, which includes detailed knowledge of the pre- and post-outbreak forest status as well as subsequent feedback mechanisms. In this paper, we strive to fill the forest status need by combining archived Landsat sensor data (pre- and post-outbreak) with different formats and dates of the U.S. Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data (periodic [1970s, 1990s] and annual [2003-2006]). Specifically, we explore the utility of these FIA ground data for calibrating models of forest species and type abundance for mapping past forest composition in the Border Lakes Ecoregion (BLE) of Upper Midwest of the US. Model calibration results between Landsat reflectance and FIA ground data for both total forest basal area and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) relative basal area, a preferred host of the spruce budworm (SBW, Choristoneura fumiferana), were poor to moderate (R-adj(2) 0.39 and 0.48, respectively). Results for aspen (Populous tremuloides) and spruce (Picea glauca and P. mariana) abundance yielded substantially better accuracies (R-adj(2) 0.64 and 0.78; RMSE 15.56 and 10.65 m(2) ha(-1), respectively). Groupings of tree species into broadleaved and conifers substantially improved model calibration result (R-adj(2) range: 0.72-0.91), except for the SBW host group (A. balsamea, P. glauca, and P. mariana). Periodic FIA ground data from the early 1990s generated stronger models compared to other FIA-Landsat date combinations tested. A paired t-test of abundance differences between undisturbed forest from the older 1977 and 1990 periodic inventories was significant (p-value < 0.0001), suggesting possible effects of variable FIA sampling protocol or ground plot positional accuracy through time. However, a similar paired t-test of abundance difference between periodic FIA (1990) and annual FIA (2003-2006) was not significant (p-value = 0.249). We posit four potential factors that may have contributed to weak Landsat-FIA calibration results for species abundance: 1) variation in FIA subplot arrangement and sampling protocols through time, 2) variability in species abundance and heterogeneity among FIA sampling across adjacent Landsat orbital paths, 3) understory species (balsam fir) that are largely hidden from remote detection, and 4) cloud cover and orbital phase mismatches preventing capture of key forest phenology aids. While past and present FIA sampling protocols were not specifically designed for integration with 30-meter satellite sensor data, careful pairing of FIA ground data (past or present) with Landsat sensor data can facilitate reasonable estimates, of forest abundance for generalized forest types, and possibly forest species when heterogeneity is low. Nevertheless, we recommend that FIA subplot sampling protocols be augmented to include measurements of forest conditions that are more amenable to integration with 30-meter Landsat sensor data.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The proper healing of a people is difficult without a correct understanding of those peoples' experiences and their worldview. This is very true with respect to the healing of the shattered consciousness and fractured identity of what has been called the transatlantic slave trade encountered by Afrikan people in America and throughout the Afrikan Diaspora. My journey into healing the wounds of racism and oppression began when I was called a "nigger" in 1971 in first grade. Years of studying Black/Afrikan history and being informed by Black psychologists would inspire me to conceptualize racism as a mental disorder that should be classified as such in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. Moreover, I advance a distinct psychology (Ubuntu psychology/psychotherapy) of healing psychic trauma of Afrikans in America as well as throughout the diaspora and on the continent of Afrika.

TI  - Hyperspectral anomaly detection by local joint subspace process and support vector machine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral anomaly detection is a challenging task due to the inaccurate evaluation of background statistics and the contamination of anomaly pixels. In this paper, we propose an effective hyperspectral anomaly detection algorithm based on local joint subspace process and support vector machine (SVM). The method mainly consists of three steps. At first, in the local joint subspace process, we combine Mahalanobis distance detection and spectral angular distance detection of subspace projection by local sliding change dual windows. With this local joint subspace process, the spatial-spectral information is jointly utilized and the local subspace score is also obtained. Then, to further improve the detection probability, we propose the support vector score by classifying the dimensionally reduced hyperspectral image data through a trained SVM model. Finally, we obtain the final detection result from the linear combination of above scores. Compared with alternative methods, the proposed method has shown a superior performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

TI  - Glacier variations and their response to climate change in an arid inland river basin of Northwest China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are a critical freshwater resource of river recharge in arid areas around the world. In recent decades, glaciers have shown evidence of retreat due to climate change, and the accelerated ablation of glaciers and associated impacts on water resources have received widespread attention. Glacier variations result from climate change, so they can serve as an indicator of climate change. Considering the climatic differences in different elevation ranges, it is worthwhile to explore whether different responses exist between glacier area and air temperature in each elevation zone. In this study, we selected a typical arid inland river basin (Sugan Lake Basin) in the western Qilian Mountains of Northwest China to analyze the glacier variations and their response to climate change. The glacier area data from 1989 to 2016 were delineated using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced TM+ (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. We compared the relationships between glacier area and air temperature at seven meteorological stations in the glacier-covered areas and in the Sugan Lake Basin, and further analyzed the relationship between glacier area and mean air temperature of the glacier surfaces in July-August in the elevation range of 4700-5500 m a.s.l. by the linear regression method and correlation analysis. In addition, based on the linear regression relationship established between glacier area and air temperature in each elevation zone, we predicted glacier areas under future climate scenarios during the periods of 2046-2065 and 2081-2100. The results indicate that the glaciers experienced a remarkable shrinkage from 1989 to 2016 with a shrinkage rate of -1.61 km(2)/a (-0.5%/a), and the rising temperature is the decisive factor dominating glacial retreat; there is a significant negative linear correlation between glacier area and mean air temperature of the glacier surfaces in July-August in each elevation zone from 1989 to 2016. The variations in glaciers are far less sensitive to changes in precipitation than to changes in air temperature. Due to the influence of climate and topographic conditions, the distribution of glacier area and the rate of glacier ablation first increased and then decreased in different elevation zones. The trend in glacier shrinkage will continue because air temperature will continue to increase in the future, and the result of glacier retreat in each elevation zone will be slightly slower than that in the entire study area. Quantitative glacier research can more accurately reflect the response of glacier variations to climate change, and the regression relationship can be used to predict the areas of glaciers under future climate scenarios. These conclusions can offer effective references for assessing glacier variations and their response to climate change in arid inland river basins in Northwest China as well as other similar regions in the world.

TI  - The Demographic and Neurocognitive Profile of Clients Diagnosed With Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder in PATCHES Paediatrics Clinics Across Western Australia and the Northern Territory
T2  - ALCOHOL-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a diagnosis relating to neurocognitive impairments associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. A key aspect of improving FASD diagnostic processes and management is understanding the demographic and neurocognitive profile of those living with FASD. The aim of this study was to describe the demographic and neurocognitive profile of the first 199 individuals diagnosed with FASD in PATCHES Paediatrics clinics.Methods A retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study design was conducted with individuals diagnosed with FASD between 2013 and 2018 through a multidisciplinary team according to the Australian FASD Diagnostic Guidelines.Results Participants were primarily male 133 (66.8%) and Aboriginal Australian 147 (73.9%), aged 2 to 31 (mean 10.5), with 94 (47.3%) from remote or very remote parts of Western Australia. Participants came from low 119 (59.8%), medium 48 (24.1%), and high 32 (16.1%) socioeconomic (SE) backgrounds. Low SE background was found to be a predictor of number of sentinel facial features (Wald chi(2) (1) = 4.03, p < 0.05). Most received a diagnosis of FASD with <3 sentinel features 165 (82.9%). Participants either had 6 or more 46 (23.1%), 5 44 (22.1%), 4 55 (27.6%), or 3 (27.1%) neurodevelopmental domains impaired. Executive functioning was the most commonly impaired neurodevelopmental domain 158 (79.4%), and 31 (61%) reported sleep disturbance. ADHD was the most observed comorbid condition (41.7%).Conclusions This study improves our current understanding of neurocognitive and demographic profiles in individuals with FASD that have been clinically referred for diagnosis within Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and highlights the importance of prevention and early assessment/diagnosis as well as guidance regarding more targeted interventions. FASD affects individuals from all cultural and SE backgrounds. Individuals from middle to higher SE groups are at risk of FASD with prevention efforts needing to target these sectors of society. Suggestions for future research directions are also provided.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping of clinically N0 early oral cancer: a diagnostic pitfall on CT lymphography
T2  - ORAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The purpose of this study was to reevaluate preoperative computed tomography lymphography (CTL) and enhanced CT images during follow-up to clarify whether SLNs enhanced by CTL were identified accurately before primary surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for clinically N0 early oral cancer. Methods Thirty two early oral cancer patients without cervical lymph node metastasis were enrolled in this study. To clarify whether SLNs enhanced by CTL were identified accurately before primary surgery with SLNB, we reevaluated preoperative CTL and enhanced CT images during follow-up in all patients. Results SLNs were detected by CTL in 31 of 32 patients (96.9%). During follow-up after primary surgery with SLNB, 4 of 27 patients without SLN metastasis had occult neck metastasis. Of the 4 patients, only 1 patient with cancer of floor of the mouth had overlooking of SLN, and the overlooking rate of SLN was 3.1%. The overlooked small SLN (2.9 x 3.3 x 3.1 mm) was located at contralateral level IB. The CT numbers before, 2, 5, 10 min after iopamidol injection, were 33 HU, 37 HU, 62 HU, 52 HU, respectively. The CT numbers of overlooked SLN 5 and 10 min after the injection was higher than CT images scanned before the iopamidol injection. Conclusions The enhancement of SLNs in CTL images after iopamidol injection should be compared sufficiently with CT images before iopamidol injection to avoid overlooking of SLNs in N0 early oral cancer.

TI  - Assessing the impact of drought stress on grasslands using multi-temporal SAR data of Sentinel-1: a case study in Eastern Cape, South Africa
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are a major component of the natural vegetation in South Africa, it covers almost one-third of the country's land surface. The current study focuses on assessing the impact of drought stress on communal and commercial grasslands in Eastern Cape Province using multi-temporal analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR data. Data analysis included retrieval of biophysical parameters of grasslands using Sentinel-1 SAR backscattering coefficients. Correlation analysis was performed between SAR data and NDVI values derived from Landsat-8 optical data. A linear mixed-effects regression analysis was performed for detecting the impact of drought on communal and commercial grasslands during a drought and non-drought growing seasons. Our results indicate that vegetation dynamics in grasslands in the study area are highly responsive to the climatic fluctuations. A significant correlation between backscattering coefficients of Sentinel-1 SAR data (VH and VV) and NDVI was observed for both communal and commercial grasslands (R-2 = 0.89). Results also demonstrated that communal grasslands are more affected by drought impact than commercial grasslands. In commercial grasslands, management activities can improve the growing conditions of grasslands, reduce the impact of drought, and subsequently increase the resilience and productivity of this ecosystem.

TI  - Transforming an Imperial Frontier: Japanese Knowledge and the Qing Empire's New Tibet Policy
T2  - ASIAN STUDIES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qing Empire maintained a reciprocal relationship with Tibet for more than a century after acquiring it in the 1720s. The Manchu court granted Tibet a high degree of autonomy while Tibetan leaders obtained a strong ally to defend them from foreign invasion by compromising part of their authority. The mutually beneficial relationship, however, ended in the 1900s when the Manchu court adopted predatory policies to tighten its control over Tibet to resist British and Russian expansionism. This article explores the often-overlooked impact of Meiji Japan, and aims to reveal its role in setting the intellectual framework for the Qing Empire's new Tibet policy. I argue that Japanese knowledge of imperialism and Tibet promoted an imperialist worldview, which conceptualised the Tibetan frontier as a colony that needed to be exploited, civilised and nationalised. Through an in-depth discussion of discourses on Tibet produced by Japanese elites, Chinese students in Meiji Japan, and Chinese elites in China, as well as policy proposals drafted by Chinese officials, I demonstrate that Japanese knowledge shaped Chinese perceptions of Tibet and was translated into the Qing Empire's new Tibet policy. Ultimately, the article aims to reveal a specific mechanism of imperialism, which attempted to convert China into its accomplice.

TI  - Trends in AOD, Clouds, and Cloud Radiative Effects in Satellite Data and CMIP5 and CMIP6 Model Simulations Over Aerosol Source Regions
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Several regions worldwide have seen significant trends in anthropogenic aerosol emissions during the period of detailed satellite observations since 2001. Over Europe (EUR) and North America (NAM) there were strong declines, over China increases then declines and over India, strong increases. Regional trends in model-simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud radiative effects in both the Fifth and Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP5 and CMIP6) are broadly consistent with the ones from satellite retrievals in most parts of EUR, NAM and India. CMIP6 models better match satellite-derived AOD trend in western NAM (increasing) and eastern China (decreasing), where CMIP5 models failed, pointing to improved anthropogenic aerosol emissions. Drop concentration trends in both observations and models qualitatively match AOD trends. The result for solar cloud radiative effect in models, however, is due to compensating errors: Models fail to reproduce observed liquid water path trends and show, in turn, opposite trends in cloud fraction.

TI  - Modeling changes trend of time series of land surface temperature (LST) using satellite remote sensing productions (case study: Sistan plain in east of Iran)
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the long-term variations in the trend of the mean monthly land surface temperature, LST products from the MODIS sensor on Terra satellite (MOD11A1) were employed. A total of 1365 daily images of LST MODIS were provided from the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center for April (450 images), May (465 images), and June (450 images) months. Then the mean monthly land surface temperature (LST) was estimated separately using daily land surface temperature (LST) time series for 3 months, April, May, and June, as well as for the total statistical period studied. A total number of 30,080 pixels were investigated within the studied area according to spatial resolution 1 in 1 km each image. Finally, the long-term variations trend of the mean monthly land surface temperature was evaluated using Sen's slope estimator and classic linear regression on a pixel basis. According to the results, there was no significant difference in both models about the estimation of long-term variations trend of the mean monthly LST and they had the same performance. The results of this research also showed that the highest increasing trends in LST was observed in the north of the plain, which may be due to the drying up of Hamoun triple wetlands. However, the highest decreasing trends in LST was observed in the northeast, southwest, and west of the study area, which may be attributed to the expansion of agricultural lands and gardens in the northeastern part of the plain (along the main branch of Hirmand River) and digging of small wells in the southwest and west of the plain by indigenous peoples as well as the use of supply water for farming.

T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The global distribution of winter to winter sea surface temperature (SST) reemergence is analyzed using a novel metric based on an autoregressive 1 model, and the global impact of SST on cloud amount and cloud type are examined using satellite data. A region in the northeastern Pacific Ocean is identified where wintertime SSTs are correlated with the occurrence of marine stratiform cloud the following winter. This correlation is likely a manifestation of SST reemergence. We hypothesize that through this reemergence mechanism marine stratus cloud amount, and thus shortwave cloud radiative effect, in the northeastern Pacific exhibits memory on inter-seasonal and even multi-year time scales and that exploration of this relationship may provide insight into the SST-low cloud feedbacks.

TI  - Spatiotemporal relation of RADAR-derived land subsidence with groundwater and seismicity in Semnan-Iran
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to excessive harvesting of underground water resources in many important aquifers inside Iran, ground subsidence is occurring at different speeds. In present study, InSAR processing was applied to identify land displacement by using Sentinel-1A. For this target, 17 frames of images during 2015-2019 with small temporal-perpendicular baseline were allocated and using SBAS approach were analyzed. After removing unnecessary noise and phases, phase shift due to land deformation is extracted and then converted to subsidence. Besides SAR images, fluctuations of groundwater were analyzed using piezometric data for last 10 years. Then the spatial pattern relationship between subsided regions and underground water resources as well as urbanization was investigated. Throughout this period, all datasets reveal 125 km(2) bowl subsidence in a maximum rate of 10 cm/year. Generally, areas with high rates of subsidence are located between the industrial town and city of Semnan over clay foundation with high rates of groundwater head decline. Moreover, surveying the piezometers and landuse change map obtained from Landsat indicates that due to the intense groundwater withdrawal as a result of industrialization and urbanization, the maximum annual decline of groundwater head at 123 cm/year is detected. Our preliminary investigation shows some spatiotemporal positive correlation between the subsidence and seismicity of the area. Considering the fragility of arid ecosystems and increasing the population of Semnan, it is recommended that the development of industries with high water consumption is prevented and the groundwater resources policies should seek to strictly reduce overusing of groundwater in agricultural lands and urban areas.

TI  - Large-Scale Dynamics and Moisture Sources of the Precipitation Over the Western Tibetan Plateau in Boreal Winter
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the heaviest precipitations over the Asian continent in winter is located in the western Tibetan Plateau (TP). In this study, the dynamics of the precipitation over the western TP (PWTP) in boreal winter and its interannual variability are explored. The moisture origins and paths are detected using a Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model. In climatology, the PWTP is generated as results of upward air motions on the windward side of the TP and ranges from 0.5 to 2.5 mm center dot day(-1). Under the influence of midlatitude westerlies and the subtropical high over the Arabian Peninsula, three key moisture sources (by percentage contribution) are identified: South Asia-North Indian Ocean (56.6%), Central Eurasia-North Africa (37.7%), and Central-North Atlantic (5.6%). The dominant precipitating cloud types are nimbostratus and stratus/stratocumulus derived from satellite data. On the interannual timescale, PWTP variation is closely associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and midlatitude cyclones. ENSO warm events lead to an anomalous anticyclone over the tropical northwest Indian Ocean and intensify moisture transport northward in the lower troposphere, as well as abnormal divergence in upper troposphere. However, ENSO explains only about 38.1% of the PWTP variance. Midlatitude teleconnection also contributes to the PWTP variability, which is comparable to the effect of ENSO. The cyclones imbedded in the subtropical jet are part of the teleconnection, with an anticyclone upstream over the North Atlantic and an cyclone over the western TP. Further evidence suggests that the transient eddies in the North Atlantic help to maintain the teleconnection.

AB  - Reliable species discrimination remains essential for the management of commercial forests. Therefore, this study sought to evaluate the utility of Partial Least Squares Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLS-LDA) and Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) multivariate techniques for delineating forest species using Landsat 8 OLI. PLS-LDA produced a higher (88.9%) overall accuracy compared to the PLS-DA (79%). The high performance of PLS-LDA is associated with its ability to deal with correlation and variability between and within classes, hence offer great potential for the monitoring and management of commercial forest species.

TI  - Snow cover monitoring by remote sensing and evaluating melting water effects on karstic springs discharges (a case study from Lasem area)
T2  - CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowfall is the dominant form of precipitation in high mountainous areas and its driving melt water has an indispensable role in the hydrological cycle and groundwater recharge, particularly in karstic landscapes with high infiltration capacity. Monitoring snow cover area (SCA) and its melting process is essential for the investigation of climatic variables, hydrology, hydrogeology, and water resource management. Prodigious advances of satellite imaginary technology in the past decades made it possible to monitor spatiotemporal distribution of snow and its melting process. In this research, SCA was investigated using cloud-free images of Landsat-8 from December 2014 to June 2016 and Sentinel-2 from November 2015 to June 2016 at Lasem area (north of Iran) by normalized difference snow index. Simultaneously, the discharges of the main karstic springs were monitored over May 2015 to June 2016. The catchment subdivided into three sub-zones based on the hydrogeological characteristics and snow melting time. Fractional SCA time series within each subdomain used to develop snow melting curve in each subzone. Comparison of melting peaks between the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 water years shows that melting shifted in average 20 days later in 2016 at north-facing subdomains. North-facing slopes show quite fast transmitting time (20-35 days) of the peak snowmelt to the springs, while the south-facing springs are more silent to the recharge pulses (70-80 days), indicating a higher degree of karstification in north-facing domains. More concentrated snowmelt in 2016 led to increasing peak flow by an average of 15% in the springs fed by north-facing domains.

TI  - Factors affecting urban electricity consumption: a case study in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area using an integrated approach of earth observation data and data analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization induces shifts in surface environmental factors, including impervious surface expansion, green space loss, and temperature increase in which the extreme temperature is supposed to significantly raise total electricity consumption (TEC) in urban areas. Applying remote sensing data and data analysis, this study aims to explore relationships between urbanization, surface environmental factors (SEF), and electricity consumption (EC). The relevance of surface temperature and total electricity consumption was also considered. The research found the disturbance of SEF through changes in vegetation index, urban index, and surface temperature. The vegetation was detected to be narrowed while the impervious surface and land surface temperature had the same trend of rising. These tendencies correspond to the urbanization process in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area (BMA). The urbanization process was also detected by extension of customers and electricity consumption, mainly in industrial sectors and household consumption. The number of users in industrial sectors well explained total consumption. Besides, the surface environmental factors jointly contributed to the consumption in the residential sector. Urban expansion assessed by urban index has more contribution to electricity utilization compared to surface temperature. These findings proved that the total consumption originated from the industrial sectors, especially the medium and large scales. These outcomes can serve the electrical business in order to provide adequate and improve service quality.

AB  - Objective To perform the cross-cultural validation process of the Dutch Norman Questionnaire (NQ), a questionnaire for the detection and characterisation of breast-cancer related lymphoedema (BCRL) using self-reported signs and symptoms.Methods Test-retest reliability and construct (including convergent, divergent and known-groups validity), face and content validity were examined in breast cancer patients with (n = 30) and without (n = 30) lymphoedema. For concurrent validity, first, agreement between the diagnostic item of the NQ and a clinical diagnosis were analysed. Second, correlations between NQ scores and clinical arm volume assessment were tested.Results Test-retest reliability was found to be strong to very strong (ICC 0.79-0.96) in the lymphoedema group and moderate to very strong ( ICC 0.64-0.99) in the non-lymphoedema group. Seventeen out of 20 hypotheses on convergent and divergent validity were accepted. There was good face, content and known-groups validity as well. For concurrent validity, agreement between evaluation methods was only 0.462. Moderate correlations were found between 6 out of 9 symptom scores (r = 0.422-0.630) of the NQ and clinical assessment.Conclusion The Dutch NQ is a reliable and valid questionnaire for the characterisation of BCRL using self-reported signs and symptoms. Only moderate agreement for the detection of BCRL was found.

TI  - Quantifying total suspended matter (TSM) in waters using Landsat images during 1984-2018 across the Songnen Plain, Northeast China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of total suspended matter (TSM) in waters is necessary to promote efficient water resource management. In our study, we have estimated the spatiotemporal pattern of TSM with the combination of time-series Landsat images and field survey. Among various remote sensing-derived parameters, the red/blue band turns to be robust and the most sensitive to the TSM from field measurements. In Songnen Plain, the mean annual TSM in 60.5% of the water bodies decreased from 1984 to 2018. The decreasing of TSM is likely due to the increasing of vegetation in the area. The TSM concentration in waters declined from April to July, and then increased from September onwards. We also found the TSM in water bodies in Songnen Plain has very high spatial variation. Our results indicated that the meteorological factors such as wind and precipitation may affect the variation of TSM. Our results demonstrate that long-term Landsat data are useful to examine TSM in inland waters. Our findings can support for water resource management under human activities and climate change.

TI  - Multichart Schemes for Detecting Changes in Disease Incidence
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several methods have been proposed in open literatures for detecting changes in disease outbreak or incidence. Most of these methods are likelihood-based as well as the direct application of Shewhart, CUSUM and EWMA schemes. We use CUSUM, EWMA and EWMA-CUSUM multi-chart schemes to detect changes in disease incidence. Multi-chart is a combination of several single charts that detects changes in a process and have been shown to have elegant properties in the sense that they are fast in detecting changes in a process as well as being computationally less expensive. Simulation results show that the multi-CUSUM chart is faster than EWMA and EWMA-CUSUM multi-charts in detecting shifts in the rate parameter. A real illustration with health data is used to demonstrate the efficiency of the schemes.

TI  - On the possible contribution of ionospheric vertical drifts to TEC modelling in low latitudes
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A single station empirical total electron content (TEC) model based on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data during 2001-2015 is presented over the African low latitude region. For the first time, we have investigated the contribution of ionospheric vertical drifts to TEC modelling by including vertical ExB drift generated from Communication/Navigation Outage and Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite data as an input along with diurnal variation, seasonal variation, solar activity and geomagnetic activity representations. The inputs were used to develop the neural network (NN) TEC model over Mbarara, MBAR (0.6 degrees S, 30.74 degrees E; 10.22 degrees S geomagnetic) which was later validated on independent dataset that was selected from different solar activity periods. The model without vertical ExB drift as an input gave mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.013 TECU. Inclusion of the vertical ExB drift input reduced the MAE to 3.757 TECU equivalent to an average improvement of 6.4% in TEC modelling. The maximum improvement attained was around 13% during the high solar activity period. The correlation coefficient (R) values for models without and with vertical E x B drift input were 0.954 and 0.958 respectively. Our results show that availability of ionospheric vertical drift data has the potential of improving future TEC modelling in low latitude regions. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

M3  - Article
AB  - The synthetic aperture radar SAR system with the capability of imaging during the night, day, and the all-weather conditions has a high potential in change detection on the ground surface. In this research, we used three SAR images of ALOS-2 satellite over Sarpole-Zahab town in the west of Iran that had an earthquake with the magnitude of 7.3 on November 12, 2017. The effects of speckle noise on the accuracy of the results were assessed based on noise reduction filters. Correlation coefficient, difference of intensity (in five window sizes), and difference of coherence and texture (in six window sizes) of the pre- and post-event images were calculated, and the output parameters were extracted. Then, the damage assessment was carried out based on four machine learning classifiers, containing the random forest (RDF), the support vector machine, the naive Bayes classifier, and K-nearest neighbor. The RDF showed an overall accuracy of 86.3%. Seventy percent of the dataset was used for training, and 30% of it was used for the prediction purpose (similar to 300 buildings). Based on the training dataset, the total number of structures in the study area was predicted (approximately 9200 buildings). Finally, a discriminant analysis was carried out among the damaged and undamaged buildings.

TI  - An entropy-based investigation into the impact of ecological water diversion on land cover complexity of restored oasis in arid inland river basins
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - An improved understanding of the response of oasis ecosystems to ecological water diversion is essential for sustainably managing water resources in arid inland river basins. This entropy-based investigation provides new insight into the ecohydrological impacts of ecological water diversions through a case study of Qingtu oasis in the lower Shiyang River basin in Northwest China. Since 2010, an ecological water diversion project was put in place by Water Resources Bureau of Shiyang River Basin to restore the degraded Qingtu oasis. Annual cumulative water releases from this water diversion project had reached 0.25 billion m(3) in 2018. This contributed to an increase in shallow groundwater level of 1.2 m. A combination of land cover classification indices and an entropy approach were used to assess the ecohydrological response to water diversion inputs. Land cover was classified as sparsely, lowly, moderately, and highly vegetated areas using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from Landsat images and the Excess Green minus Excess Red Index that was estimated from unmanned aerial vehicle images. Land cover complexity was evaluated using component complexity and spatial complexity. The component complexity corresponds to land cover composition and was assessed using the Shannon's entropy. The spatial complexity corresponds to spatial configuration of different land cover compositions and was analyzed using spatial entropy methodology. The rise in groundwater level caused by ecological water diversion drove the land cover transition and enhanced the component complexity. Field survey data showed that tendency and randomness co-existed in the spatial pattern of groundwater depth and its relationship with NDVI, which jointly affected spatial complexity (i.e., dependence and independence in spatial cooccurrences of different land cover categories). Results from this study improve understanding of the impacts that ecological water diversions can have on land cover evolution in natural oasis in arid inland river basins.

TI  - The BJP's 2019 election campaign: not business as usual
T2  - CONTEMPORARY SOUTH ASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Five aspects of the BJP's election campaign contributed to its success in 2019. The first is the personal appeal of the prime minister, which again played a major role, like it did in 2014, as Narendra Modi led a hyper-personalized campaign. Second, this campaign focused on security-related themes which were especially relevant in the context of the India-Pakistan tensions. Third, the BJP campaign strategy was backed by the most formidable election campaign machinery assembled by any party in India since Independence. Fourth, the BJP saturated the public space with the prime minister's image, adroitly using the traditional mainstream media as well as social media. The party used religious appeal to address its core base of supporters while projecting the prime minister's image as a protector and sentinel. Fifth, the latter three aspects of the BJP's campaign were fuelled by unprecedented levels of campaign expenditure and by the opacity of political funding in India, which the BJP had made more impenetrable through the introduction of electoral bonds. The combination of these factors show that the 2019 elections were not business as usual; their singularity largely due to the decline of institutions regulating the electoral process, including the Election Commission of India.

TI  - Generation of chilling hours maps using surface observations and satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In complex terrain, the topography influences the air temperature near the surface since cold air pooling and thermally-generated winds might respectively enhance or diminish the nocturnal cooling rate. The characterization of the temperature patterns in agricultural areas is important because many crops need a certain amount of time under cold temperatures. This is usually given by the Chilling Hours (CH, number of hours below a certain temperature threshold). In this work the number of CH has been estimated in the island of Mallorca using in-situ and satellite Meteosat data for the period 2008-2018, taking a threshold value of 7 degrees C, applying corrections for missing data in both cases, including cloudiness for the satellite data.CH values per year obtained are small for stations near or at the coast (CH below 400) and large at mountain tops (CH above 1500), whereas at the foothills and central plain the values vary between 500 and 1000. Cold events contributing to the number of CH happen mostly between December and March and they may be related to cold synoptic advection (with clear or cloudy skies) or mostly to clear nights with weak local winds that may end in late night fog.Satellite-derived CH maps indicate that the coldest areas are located in the central lowlands between the two major mountain ranges and the elevated area in the center of the island, where cold air pools are usually found. Significant differences between in-situ and satellite CH may exist due to the topographical local features compared to a surface-averaged value from the satellite pixel. Furthermore, existing CH parameterizations making use of daily extreme temperatures are checked and adjusted coefficients are proposed.

TI  - Assessing vegetation recovery in reclaimed opencast mines of the Teruel coalfield (Spain) using Landsat time series and boosted regression trees
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Opencast mining is an activity that caters to many economic sectors; however, it has a large impact on society and the environment. After mining, the major concern is to restore the previous land cover, which was generally a natural vegetation cover. Establishing permanent vegetation cover can restore landscape connectivity and previous ecosystem functions, enhance aesthetic values and prevent off-side effects associated with post-mining landscapes. Opencast mining reclamation deals with these issues with several strategies that aim to develop a vegetation cover after mining activity has stopped. However, not all reclamation actions are effective, and assessing their efficiency by monitoring vegetation development at reclaimed sites is a time-consuming task because it usually involves extensive field work. In this study, we present a semi-automatic approach based on analysing satellite data (Landsat) time series and using a machine learning technique to identify suitable conditions for vegetation development at reclaimed opencast mines. We analysed the Teruel coalfield (Aragon, central-eastern Spain). This area is a representative Mediterranean-Continental region that is of particular interest due the diversity of reclamation actions that have been applied and the increase in drier conditions during the last decades. Conditions were described with topography derived variables, technical reclamation features and drought-occurrence variables as potential explanatory factors. The implemented approach allowed us to identify the main abiotic filters for vegetation of this geographic region: the water availability and soil retention (both controlled by the topographic slope), and the proximity to seed sources. The analysis evidenced the negative influence of drought occurrence on vegetation development, and different responses were found depending on the timescale at which drought is calculated. Our results indicate that the reclamation landform model is the main key factor influencing vegetation development. A model such as the smooth berm-slope increases water availability and controls soil erosion, and hence, improves vegetation development. In addition, we found that further than 500-600 m from the mine, the effect of seed source declines dramatically. Therefore, all these issues should be considered in future reclamation designs in a Mediterranean-Continental environment. Our methodology could be adapted to other geographic regions where spatial environmental data are available. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Detection of the ionospheric disturbances on GPS-TEC using Differential Rate Of TEC (DROT) algorithm
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The solar, geomagnetic, gravitational and seismic activities can cause spatial and temporal (hourly, diurnal, seasonal and annual) variabilities of the ionosphere. Main observable ionospheric parameters such as Total Electron Content (TEC) can be used to quantify these. TEC is the total number of electrons on a ray path crossing the atmosphere. The network of world-wide Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers provide a cost-effective solution in estimating TEC over a significant proportion of global land mass. This study is focused on the analysis of the variations of ionosphere over a midlatitude region using GPS-TEC estimates for three Sun Spot Numbers (SSN) periods. The investigation is based on a fast and automatic variability detection algorithm, Differential Rate Of TEC (DROT). The algorithm is tested using literature data on disturbances generated by a geomagnetic activity, a Solar Flare, a Medium Scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbance (MSTID), a Large Scale TID (LSTID) and an earthquake. Very good agreement with the results in the literature is found. DROT is applied to IONOLAB-TEC estimates from nine Turkish National Permanent GPS Network (TNPGN Active) stations over Turkey to detect the any wave-like oscillations, sudden disturbances and other irregularities during December, March, June, September months for 2010, 2011, 2012 years. It is observed that DROT algorithm is capable of detecting both small and large scale variability due to climatic, gravitational, geomagnetic and solar activities in all layers of ionosphere. The highest DROT values are observed in 2010 during winter months. In higher solar activity years of 2011 and 2012, DROT is able to indicate both seasonal variability and severe changes in ionosphere due to increased number of geomagnetic storms and local seismic activities.

TI  - A method in near-surface estimation of air temperature (NEAT) in times following the satellite passing time using MODIS images
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature is one of the most important parameters in environmental, agricultural and water resources studies. This information is not usually always available at the required temporal and spatial resolution. The air temperature is measured at a fixed point in the meteorological stations which are dispersed and may not have the appropriate spatial resolution needed for many applications. On the other hand, MODIS satellite images have relatively acceptable spatial resolution specially for use in environmental studies. There is a methodology with which the near surface air temperature can be extracted from MODIS images at the satellite passing time with an acceptable accuracy. The goal in this study is to find a way to predict the air temperature in times after/before the satellite passing time. The procedure consists of two steps. In the first step, the relationship between the air temperature at a time in a synoptic station and the air temperature in other times up to 5 h later were modeled. In the second step, using these built up relationships, the air temperature extracted from the satellite image at the passing time was extrapolated to the next hours. Finally, the results of this extrapolation method were evaluated using the air temperatures measured at those hours and in the pixels containing some other meteorological stations. The error of the method when applied to a relatively homogeneous surface cover was about 1.5 degrees C. This error when applied to the next hours, was below 2 degrees C up to 5 h after satellite passing time. This method can be useful in some agricultural and horticultural applications in which both the spatial and temporal resolution are needed simultaneously. This product is a useful tool for frost prediction, a phenomenon that usually happens at night or early in the morning. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The (in)credibility of algorithmic models to non-experts
T2  - INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development and dissemination of data analysis techniques permits the creation of ever more intricate algorithmic models. Such models are simultaneously the vehicle and outcome of quantification practices and embody a worldview with associated norms and values. A set of specialist skills is required to create, use, or interpret algorithmic models. The mechanics of an algorithmic model may be hard to comprehend for experts and can be virtually incomprehensible to non-experts. This is of consequence because such black boxing can introduce power asymmetries and may obscure bias. This paper explores the practices through which experts and non-experts determine the credibility of algorithmic models. It concludes that (1) transparency to (non-)experts is at best problematic and at worst unattainable; (2) authoritative models may come to dictate what types of policies are considered feasible; (3) several of the advantages attributed to the use of quantifications do no hold in policy making contexts.

TI  - Satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth and carbon monoxide and comparison with ground data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data of aerosol optical depths (AODs) from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and carbon monoxide (CO) columns from the measurements of pollution in the troposphere (MOPITT) were collected for the study in Northern Thailand. Comparative analyses were conducted of MODIS (Terra and Aqua) AODs with ground particulate matter with diameter below 10 microns (PM10) concentrations and MOPITT CO surface/total columns with ground CO concentrations for 2014-2017. Temporal variations in both the satellite and ground datasets were in good agreement. High levels of air pollutants were common during March-April. The annual analysis of both satellite and ground datasets revealed the highest levels of air pollutants in 2016 and the lowest levels in 2017. The AODs and PM10 concentrations were at higher levels in the morning than in the afternoon. The comparison between satellite products showed that AODs correlated better with the CO total columns than the CO surface columns. The regression analysis presented better performance of Aqua AODs-PM10 than Terra AODs-PM10 with correlation coefficients (r) of 0.72-0.83 and 0.57-0.79, respectively. Ground CO concentrations correlated better with MOPITT CO surface columns (r = 0.65-0.73) than with CO total columns (r = 0.56-0.72). The r values of satellite and ground datasets were greatest when the analysis was restricted to November-March (dry weather periods with possible low mixing height (MH)). Overall, the results suggested that the relationships between satellite and ground data can be used to develop predictive models for ground PM10 and CO in northern Thailand, particularly during air pollution episodes located where ground monitoring stations are limited.

TI  - Effect of terrestrial vegetation growth on climate change in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, some vegetation has grown significantly over the past decades, but the climate benefits remain unclear, especially in the temperate regions. Understanding the biophysical effects and identifying the potential of vegetation will help to mitigate climate change. Here, we propose a vegetation-adjusted temperature index to understand how terrestrial vegetation growth in China affects the air temperature for 2001-2013, based on satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index, near-surface air temperature (T-a) and the land surface temperature. Grassland growth and cropland growth are found to cool the T-a by -0.08 +/- 0.32 degrees C (mean. one standard deviation) and -0.06 +/- 0.28 degrees C, respectively. Forest growth results in net climate warming by 0.05 +/- 0.29 degrees C. Biophysical effects, elevation and background climate are used to explain the climate impacts of vegetation. Results show that the biophysical effects dominate the climate impact. More specifically, evapotranspiration (ET) controls the daytime climate impact, and at night, an indirect effect of albedo (the release of daytime heat storage) dominates it. Lower precipitation, temperature and elevation reinforce the warming potential. Moreover, the effects of albedo and ET on climate are nonlinear. During the day, although lower albedo absorbs more incoming radiation, it releases more extra heat per unit ET that can compensate for the increased incoming radiation. At night, the warming effect reflects the release of daytime heat storage. Overall, tropical vegetation growth (-0.04 +/- 0.10 degrees C) and warm temperate vegetation growth (-0.08 +/- 0.15 degrees C) achieve the climatic benefits. Overall, the method proposed contributes to quantitatively evaluate the role of afforestation plan on regional climate cooling, and provides some policy/practical implications for future afforestation projects. Future afforestation projects should carefully consider the biophysical process and background climate to mitigate climate change.

TI  - Impact of a prognostic 40-gene expression profiling test on clinical management decisions for high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine how results from a prognostic 40-gene expression profiling (40-GEP) test would impact clinician management decisions and how their choices would align with a National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) compliant, risk-directed management plan for high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Methods: Clinicians attending a national dermatology conference were presented with 40-GEP test validation data. They were asked to rate clinicopathological features and molecular test results to assess their opinion of how concerning each is to cSCC prognosis. When presented with vignettes describing patients with NCCN-defined high-risk features, clinicians were asked to select a treatment plan using pre-test (no 40-GEP results), then, post-test (40-GEP Class 1, 2A, or 2B results) methodology along with corresponding metastasis rates for each test group. Results: Risk factors deemed of highest concern for metastatic outcomes were a Class 2B 40-GEP result, perineural invasion, immunosuppression, invasion beyond subcutaneous fat, and tumor diameter >1 cm on the scalp. When presented with a 40-GEP result that indicated reduced risk of metastasis (Class 1), clinicians altered their treatment management plan accordingly. Specifically, there was significant reduction in the recommendations for sentinel lymph node biopsy, adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy, follow-up time, and nodal imaging. By comparison, when a 40-GEP result indicated an increased risk of metastasis (Class 2B), significant risk-appropriate increases in management intensity was observed for the aforementioned clinical decisions. Conclusion: Integration of 40-GEP results impacted management decisions in a significant and risk-appropriate manner for high-risk cSCC patient scenarios, while remaining aligned with national guidelines for patient management.

TI  - Influence of polluted dust on chlorophyll-a concentration and particulate organic carbon in the subarctic North Pacific Ocean based on satellite observation and the WRF-Chem simulation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust aerosols play important roles in marine ecosystems and carbon export once they are deposited and dissolved in the ocean. The effect of dust aerosols on chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations and particulate organic carbon (POC) in the subarctic North Pacific Ocean (SNPO) received particular attention due to their influence on air-sea carbon flux. However, significant uncertainties remain in understanding the long-range transport, atmospheric process and deposition of dust/polluted dust aerosols and their impacts on oceans. A trans-Pacific dust/polluted dust episode from 12 to 17 March 2015 was analyzed using satellite data and the WRF-Chem model. Both results confirmed that dust/polluted dust aerosols were transported from the Taklimakan Desert to the SNPO in 4-5 days under the effect of the westerly jet system. Anthropogenic aerosol mixed with dust aerosol during atmospheric process. The total deposition of dust aerosols based on model results over the research region (40 degrees-50 degrees N, 150 degrees-155 degrees E) in the SNPO from 16 to 18 March 2015 was 6.8 mg m(-2). Both Chl-a concentrations and POC increased nearly 50% after the dust deposition. Dust deposition might leads to an increase in phytoplankton by iron fertilization effect. In addition, polluted dust deposition might be an important source of POC in the surface ocean.

TI  - A fuzzy GIS model to determine confluence morphological sensitivity to tributary inputs at the watershed scale
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Confluences are key nodes of river systems that have the potential of disrupting downstream longitudinal trends in the main river through inputs of water, sediment, wood or ice delivered from tributaries. From a geomorphological perspective, confluence zones are particularly active and thus susceptible to increased flooding and bed instability, which, in turn, pose serious threats to infrastructure. However, not all confluences are active. Despite major advances in our knowledge of confluence dynamics, there has been limited progress in the development of low complexity, practical tools that use remotely sensed data to predict the spatial distribution of the main river's sensitivity to tributary inputs. We have thus developed a novel semi-automated GIS model that uses a fuzzy approach to integrate key factors (unit stream power, valley confinement and sediment connectivity potential) in order to map the distribution of the confluence morphological sensitivity (CMS) index at the watershed scale. The GIS model was tested using digital elevation models of high (LiDAR, 1 m) and coarser (10 m) resolution in the Coaticook and Gaspesie watersheds (Quebec, Canada). Results indicate that the model is useful for detecting geomorphologically active confluences and the resulting sensitivity of the main channel and thus has potential to be used in diverse river management applications (e.g., hazard reduction and freedom space mapping).

TI  - Halogenated natural products in birds associated with the marine environment: A review
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Halogenated natural products (HNPs) arc widespread compounds found at high concentrations in top predators such as seabirds. This paper reviews available data on methoxylated polybrominated Biphenyl ethers (MeO-BDEs), heptachloro-1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrok (Q1) and 1,1'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyrroles (HDBPs) in these animals. In all, 25 papers reported such HNPs in seabirds. White tailed sea eagle from Sweden was the seabird species with higher MeO-BDEs levels in eggs and blood, while in liver the European shag from Norway was the one. Regarding HDBPs, glaucous gull livers from North Water Polynya and Leach's storm petrel eggs from South Canada (NE Atlantic) showed the highest levels, while brown skua eggs presented the highest concentration of Q1. DBPBr4Cl2 and DBP-Br-6 were the most abundant HDBPs in seabirds, although only one study investigated DBP-Br-6. Furthermore, 2'-MeO-BDE-68/6'-MeO-BDE-47 ratios were lower than one in mostly of the studies (91%). The main sources of methoxylated congeners found in seabirds might to be from sponges and/or associated organisms (bacteria). The scarcity of data in seabirds showed the gap in knowledge. Few studies were done especially in tropical areas and Southern Hemisphere and the most were conducted in the northwest part of the globe. This review arouses the need of knowledge about the distribution of these compounds in seabirds worldwide as well as it encourages toxicological studies to better understand the possible effects of HNPs on seabirds.

TI  - Comparison of long-term solar radiation trends from CM SAF satellite products with ground-based data at the Iberian Peninsula for the period 1985-2015
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to analyse the quality of long-term trends of surface incoming shortwave solar radiation (SIS) derived from two satellite datasets from the EUMETSAT Satellite Application on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF): the SIS Data Set from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, Edition 2 (CLARA-A2), and the SIS Data Set-Heliosat, Edition 2 (SARAH-2). In order to achieve this goal, reference ground-based SIS measurements recorded at 12 stations over the Iberian Peninsula for the period 1985-2015 are used in this study. Firstly, the two satellite datasets have been compared against ground-based SIS measurements at 12 surface sites, showing a good agreement (i.e., R = 0.83 in SARAH-2 and R = 0.80 in CLARA-A2 on an annual basis). However, the two satellite datasets substantially underestimate the SIS trends found for the ground-based measurements. Thus, while the ground-based SIS data reported trends between -0.5 and + 6.5 Wm(-2)decade(-1) (with statistical significance at 95% level at most stations), the satellite datasets gave trends lower for all locations (without statistical significance); between -0.4 and + 3.8 Wm(-2)decade(-1) for CLARA-A2, and between + 0.2 and + 2.8 Wm(-2)decade(-1) for SARAH-2. It is worth to mention that the seasonal analysis of the SIS trends for both ground-based and satellite data displays a reasonably good agreement in spring (i.e., high positive trends), in accordance with the notable decline in the cloudiness for this season in the study region. By contrast, satellite products exhibit smaller SIS anomalies than ground-based data in summer, particularly from the beginning 2000s, which could be related to well-known decrease in the aerosol load over the study region.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper describes experience of analysis of the high time resolution satellite image series aimed on detection of growing season framing dates. Satellite data use for growing season detection were discovered as observation gap filling technique in areas with sparse network of meteorological stations. We discovered the possibilities of growing season detection using annual series of 1-day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composites instead of the ground-based monitoring of surface air temperature. Particularly, the study was aimed on comparison of growing season detection results based on ground and satellite observations. We attracted Google Earth Engine platform to process initial (Terra/MODIS) satellite data series, derived map series of Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) with a 1-day time resolution, produced annual graphs of the index in the reference points of meteorological stations, detected growing season framing dates at the reference points for the period of 2000-2017, and compared detected growing seasons with their estimations made upon the analysis of surface air temperature dynamics at the same meteorological stations. Involvement of satellite data gives the possibility to monitor growing seasons not only at the points of meteorological stations but through the whole studied area highlighting heterogeneity in spatial distribution in growing season dates and regional differences of growing season dynamics. Currently, we concluded weak quality of growing season detection based upon the 1-day NDWI series, due to the noise presented on annual graphs of NDWI. Mean observed accuracy of detection in comparison with the ground observations of surface air temperature was similar to 11.3 days, while median accuracy value was similar to 10.5.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background Influenza is an acute infection affecting all age groups; however, elderly patients are at an increased risk. We aim to describe the clinical characteristics and the circulation of influenza virus types in elderly patients admitted for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) to a tertiary care hospital in Bucharest, Romania, part of the I-MOVE+ hospital network.Methods We conducted an active surveillance study at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases "Prof. Dr Matei Bals," Bucharest, Romania, during three consecutive influenza seasons: 2015/16, 2016/17, and 2017/18. All patients aged 65 and older admitted to our hospital for SARI were tested for influenza by PCR.Results A total of 349 eligible patients were tested during the study period, and 149 (42.7%) were confirmed with influenza. Most patients, 321 (92.5%) presented at least one underlying condition at the time of hospital admission, the most frequent being cardiovascular disease, 270 (78.3%). The main influenza viral subtype circulating in 2015/16 was A(H1N1)pdm09, followed by A(H3N2) in 2016/17 and B influenza in 2017/18. Case fatality was highest in the 2015/16 season (3.7%), 0% in 2016/17, and 1.0% in 2017/18. Vaccination coverage in elderly patients with SARI from our study population was 22 (6.3%) over the three seasons.Conclusions Our study has highlighted a high burden of comorbidities in elderly patients presenting with SARI during winter season in Romania. The influenza vaccine coverage rate needs to be substantially increased in the elderly population, through targeted interventions.

TI  - Monitoring, analysis and spatial and temporal zoning of air pollution (carbon monoxide) using Sentinel-5 satellite data for health management in Iran, located in the Middle East
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Various natural and anthropogenic factors are effective in causing air pollution. The effects of air pollution are more pronounced on the health of living things, especially on the mental and physical health. Therefore, this issue is important because of the importance of health and well-being. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the spatial and temporal monitoring and analysis of air pollution (carbon monoxide, CO) using satellite and remote sensing data in Iran. To do this, Sentinel-5 satellite data for air pollution (CO) monitoring over a 14-month period (November 2018 to December 2019) and Terra satellite and MODIS satellite data with LST index for monitoring changes of daily and nocturnal temperatures (Kelvin unit) over a 24-month period (January 2018 to December 2019) were used. The results showed that the highest amount of air pollution (CO) was obtained in April 2019 with 0.39 mol/m(2). However, the highest amount of air pollution in spatial monitoring of CO was obtained for Tehran and Guilan provinces with values of 0.51 mol/m(2) and 0.49 mol/m(2) respectively, while the lowest amount of CO was 0.19 mol/m(2) for December 2019. Northwestern Iran, south and west areas of the central part of Ardebil province, south half and eastern part of East Azarbaijan province, Sahand mountain range, and western part of the border section of West Azerbaijan province were exposed to air pollution with average values of 0 to 0.21 mol/m(2). Since the highest amounts of air pollution (CO) occur during the cold months of the year, people who are vulnerable to this phenomenon should travel to the polluted sites with observing hygiene principles.

TI  - Artificial intelligence for ocean science data integration: current state, gaps, and way forward
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanographic research is a multidisciplinary endeavor that involves the acquisition of an increasing amount of in-situ and remotely sensed data. A large and growing number of studies and data repositories are now available on-line. However, manually integrating different datasets is a tedious and grueling process leading to a rising need for automated integration tools. A key challenge in oceanographic data integration is to map between data sources that have no common schema and that were collected, processed, and analyzed using different methodologies. Concurrently, artificial agents are becoming increasingly adept at extracting knowledge from text and using domain ontologies to integrate and align data. Here, we deconstruct the process of ocean science data integration, providing a detailed description of its three phases: discover, merge, and evaluate/correct. In addition, we identify the key missing tools and underutilized information sources currently limiting the automation of the integration process. The efforts to address these limitations should focus on (i) development of artificial intelligence-based tools for assisting ocean scientists in aligning their schema with existing ontologies when organizing their measurements in datasets; (ii) extension and refinement of conceptual coverage of - and conceptual alignment between - existing ontologies, to better fit the diverse and multidisciplinary nature of ocean science; (iii) creation of ocean-science-specific entity resolution benchmarks to accelerate the development of tools utilizing ocean science terminology and nomenclature; (iv) creation of ocean-science-specific schema matching and mapping benchmarks to accelerate the development of matching and mapping tools utilizing semantics encoded in existing vocabularies and ontologies; (v) annotation of datasets, and development of tools and benchmarks for the extraction and categorization of data quality and preprocessing descriptions from scientific text; and (vi) creation of large-scale word embeddings trained upon ocean science literature to accelerate the development of information extraction and matching tools based on artificial intelligence.

TI  - Melanoma-Secreted Lysosomes Trigger Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cell Apoptosis and Limit Cancer Immunotherapy
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent success of checkpoint blockade therapies has established immunotherapy as one of the most promising treatments for melanoma. Nonetheless, a complete curative response following immunotherapy is observed only in a fraction of patients. To identify what factors limit the efficacy of immunotherapies, we established mouse models that cease to respond to immunotherapies once their tumors exceed a certain stage. Analysis of the immune systems of the organisms revealed that the numbers of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells (TIDC) drastically decreased with time. Further, in contrast to the current paradigm, once melanoma was established, TIDC did not migrate into sentinel lymph nodes. Instead, they underwent local cell death due to excessive phagocytosis of lysosomes. Importantly, TIDC were required to license the cytotoxic activity of tumor CD8(+) T cells, and in their absence, T cells did not lyse melanoma cells. Our results offer a paradigm shift regarding the role of TIDC and a framework to increase the efficacy of immunotherapies.Significance: This work redefines the role of monocyte-derived dendritic cells in melanoma and provides a novel strategy to increase the efficacy of T-cell-based immunotherapies in nonresponding individuals.

TI  - Effects of urban forms on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in China from a multi-perspective analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Effectively evaluating the effects of urban forms on CO2 emissions has become a hot topic in socioeconomic sustainable development; however, few studies have been able to explore the urban form-CO2 emission relationships from a multi-perspective view. Here, we attempted to analyze the relationships between urban forms and CO2 emissions in 264 Chinese cities, with explicit consideration of the government policies, urban area size, population size, and economic structure. First, urban forms were calculated using the urban land derived from multiple-source remote sensing data. Second, we collected and processed CO2 emissions and three control variables. Finally, a correlation analysis was implemented to explore whether and to what extent the spatial patterns of urban forms were associated with CO2 emissions. The results show that urban form irregularity had a more significant impact on CO2 emissions in low-carbon pilot cities than in non-pilot cities. The impact of the complexity of urban forms on CO2 emissions was relatively significant in the small- and large-sized cities than in the medium-sized cities. Moreover, urban form complexity had a significant correlation with CO2 emissions in all of the cities, the level of which basically increased with the population size. This study provides scientific bases for use in policy-making to prepare effective policies for developing a low-carbon economy with consideration of the associations between urban forms and CO2 emissions in different scenarios.

TI  - Remote sensing and GIS based analysis of temporal land use/land cover and water quality changes in Harike wetland ecosystem, Punjab, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands help in maintaining ecological balance in an area, but are shrinking fast all over the world. A study was conducted on the Harike wetland in Punjab state of India to analyze temporal changes in land use/land cover (LULC), water spread area and water pollution by using RS and GIS techniques. The LULC map of Harike wetland ecosystem covering an area of 22213.91 ha was prepared through on-screen visual interpretation of multispectral Resourcesat 2 LISS-IV satellite data (2014 and 2018) having spatial resolution of 5.8 m. Area under agriculture, forest and built up increased and that under waste land, water bodies and wetland decreased during 2014-18. The rate of increase in agricultural land was quite high (18.87 ha/year) during 2006-2014, but reduced to 3.53 ha/year during 2014-2018. The built up land increased comparatively at low rates (0.87 and 0.90 ha/year). Areas under waste land, water bodies and wetland decreased at the rate of 4.32, 1.61 and 13.80 ha/year during 2006-2014 and 2.37, 0.34 and 1.71 ha/year during 2014-2018, respectively. The water spread area of Harike wetland which was 4073 ha and 4166 ha in year 2002 and 2006 reduced to 3918.98 ha and 3910.56 ha in the year 2014 and 2018, respectively. However, wetland ponded area shrinked at a rate of 30.37 ha/year during 2006-2014 and 2.11 ha/year during the period 2014-2018. The area under low and medium turbidity increased by 22.02% and 15.2%, respectively, but decreased by 49% under high turbidity during 2014-18. Wetland water was observed to be rich in macro and micronutrients. The pH, BOD and COD of wetland water increased by 0.51, 9.7 mg/l and 24 mg/l, respectively, during 2002-14 and by 0.03, 2.0 mg/l and 5.92 mg/l, respectively during 2014-18. Interaction between land use, water quality, water inflow, ground water and wetland area has also been studied. Intensive cultivation and declining groundwater levels in the area are negatively affecting the wetland. This necessitates regular monitoring of wetland structural components and water quality along with an urgent plan in place for conservation, rehabilitation and management of Harike wetland ecosystem in participatory mode.

TI  - Development of an infrared pollution index to identify ground-level compositional, particle size, and humidity changes using Himawari-8
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Speciated air quality data informs health studies and quantitates impacts. However, monitoring is concentrated around populated regions whilst, large remote and rural regions remain unmonitored despite risks of dust-storms or wild-fires. Sub-hourly, infrared, geostationary data, such as the 10-min data from Himawari 8, could potentially be used to quantify regional air quality continually. Monitoring of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is restricted to visible spectra (i.e. daytime only), while newer quantification methods using geostationary infrared (IR) data have focused on detecting the presence, or absence, of an event. Limited attention has been given to the determination of particle size and aerosol composition (such as sulfates, black carbon, sea-salt, and mineral dust), using IR exclusively, and more appropriate methods are required to improve the understanding of source impacts.Hourly data were collected for a three-year study period (July 2015 to July 2018) across the greater Sydney region in Eastern Australia from seventeen ground-based sites that measured meteorological data and quantified ambient concentrations of NO, NO2, SO2, PM2.5, PM10, and O-3 This data was combined with source-apportioned categories (soil, sea-spray, smoke, secondary sulfates, and vehicles) from positive matrix factorization (PMF) of elemental aerosol collected on daily filters at five monitoring sites across the region. Regression analysis of five brightness temperature difference (BTD) infrared indices were used to determine a pollution index.The pollution index was shown to be related to humidity, particle size, and compositional changes. Unlike fixed thresholds, the continual index function can be aggregated spatially and temporarily. Good resolution is obtained between PM2.5 and O-3. BTD appears insensitive to concentration, and the pollution index was used to detect and identify composition prior to determining concentration.

TI  - Wild boar as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been recognized as an emerging and growing problem worldwide. Knowledge concerning AMR bacteria circulating in wildlife is currently limited, although it could provide important insights into AMR emergence and persistence. Across Europe, wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations have dramatically increased their distribution and number over the last decades. In the context of AMR dynamics, wild boar is a perfect model species to unveil the emergence, spread and persistence of AMR at the human-livestock-wildlife interface. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the importance of wild boar as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistant bacteria, and its possible use as sentinel species for surveillance. Analyses of available data showed a rising interest on this topic in the last years, highlighting the growing concern on wild boar potential role as AMR facilitator and it is foreseen that the importance of antimicrobial resistance research in wild boar will continue to increase in years to come. Available studies have been focused on specific bacterial species, particularly E. coli., Salmonella spp. and Enterococcus spp., bioindicators of AMR, and have been mainly conducted in three countries: Spain, Portugal and Germany. Strikingly, AMR surveillance in wild boar is uneven and still poorly allocated as many wild boar high-density countries do not yet have publications on the topic. Overall, accumulated data showed that wild boar are carriers of antimicrobial resistant bacteria, with variation in the prevalence of bacterial species and the percentage of resistance to different antibiotics. The lack of harmonized sampling and testing protocols makes it difficult to compare AMR in wild boar. The need for the establishment of standardised protocols keen to provide quantitative comparable data is highlighted. We finally suggest the long-term monitoring of wild boar as a sentinel species for AMR surveillance in order to inform public policies on this topic. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Selection of Antibody Responses Associated With<i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>Infections in the Context of Malaria Elimination
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In our aim to eliminate malaria, more sensitive tools to detect residual transmission are quickly becoming essential. Antimalarial antibody responses persist in the blood after a malaria infection and provide a wider window to detect exposure to infection compared to parasite detection metrics. Here, we aimed to select antibody responses associated with recent and cumulative exposure to malaria using cross-sectional survey data from Haiti, an elimination setting. Using a multiplex bead assay, we generated data for antibody responses (immunoglobulin G) to 23Plasmodium falciparumtargets in 29,481 participants across three surveys. This included one community-based survey in which participants were enrolled during household visits and two sentinel group surveys in which participants were enrolled at schools and health facilities. First, we correlated continuous antibody responses with age (Spearman) to determine which showed strong age-related associations indicating accumulation over time with limited loss. AMA-1 and MSP-1(19)antibody levels showed the strongest correlation with age (0.47 and 0.43,p< 0.001) in the community-based survey, which was most representative of the underlying age structure of the population, thus seropositivity to either of these antibodies was considered representative of cumulative exposure to malaria. Next, in the absence of a gold standard for recent exposure, we included antibody responses to the remaining targets to predict highly sensitive rapid diagnostic test (hsRDT) status using receiver operating characteristic curves. For this, only data from the survey with the highest hsRDT prevalence was used (7.2%; 348/4,849). The performance of the top two antigens in the training dataset (two-thirds of the dataset;n= 3,204)-Etramp 5 ag 1 and GLURP-R0 (area-under-the-curve, AUC, 0.892 and 0.825, respectively)-was confirmed in the test dataset (remaining one-third of the dataset;n= 1,652, AUC 0.903 and 0.848, respectively). As no further improvement was seen by combining seropositivity to GLURP-R0 and Etramp 5 ag 1 (p= 0.266), seropositivity to Etramp 5 ag 1 alone was selected as representative of current or recent exposure to malaria. The validation of antibody responses associated with these exposure histories simplifies analyses and interpretation of antibody data and facilitates the application of results to evaluate programs.

TI  - Summer maize growth under different precipitation years in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the important crops for meeting the high food demand for both humans and animals in the world. Promptly monitoring and accurately assessing growth of summer maize, a major crop in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain (the HHH Plain) in China, is regularly conducted for estimating national yield and assessing food security. In this study, the process-based Remote-Sensing-Photosynthesis-Yield Estimation for Crops (RS-P-YEC) model, driven by remote sensing products, meteorological observations, phenophases of summer maize, and some auxiliary parameters, was used to simulate daily net primary productivity (NPP) of summer maize in the HHH Plain from June to September in 2000-2017. Summer maize growth at the county scale level (characterized by NPP) under different precipitation years was evaluated along West-East, North-South, and Northwest-Southeast transects in the HHH Plain. Results showed that with increasing accumulative precipitation during the summer maize growing season, maize growth exhibited the characteristics of a downward opening parabolic curve for a dataset including all site-years and for single year datasets. The best simulated maize growth and actual observed yield generally occurred when accumulative precipitation during the summer maize growing season was between 300 and 500 mm. Furthermore, summer maize growth was reduced in years with growing season accumulative precipitation less than 300 mm or greater than 500 mm as seen in the analysis of data from several stations under different precipitation levels along the three transects. This study confirmed that NPP simulated with the RS-P-YEC model, driven by remote sensing products and ground-based meteorological observations, is a good indicator for monitoring and evaluating summer maize growth under different precipitation levels in the HHH Plain. As such, the evaluation results will be helpful for forecasting yield across broad geographical areas, and for assessing national food security.

TI  - Mapping the cumulative impacts of long-term mining disturbance and progressive rehabilitation on ecosystem services
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Open-cut coal mining can seriously disturb and reshape natural landscapes which results in a range of impacts on local ecosystems and the services they provide. To address the negative impacts of disturbance, progressive rehabilitation is commonly advocated. However, there is little research focusing on how these impacts affect ecosystem services within mine sites and changes over time. The aim of this study was to assess the cumulative impacts of mining disturbance and rehabilitation on ecosystem services through mapping and quantifying changes at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Four ecosystem services including carbon sequestration, air quality regulation, soil conservation and water yield were assessed in 1989, 1997, 2005 and 2013. Disturbance and rehabilitation was mapped using LandTrendr algorithm with Landsat. We mapped spatial patterns and pixel values for each ecosystem service with corresponding model and the landscape changes were analyzed with landscape metrics. In addition, we assessed synergies and trade-offs using Spearman's correlation coefficient for different landscape dasses and scales. The results showed that carbon sequestration, air quality regulation and water yield services were both positively and negatively affected by vegetation cover changes due to mined land disturbance and rehabilitation, while soil conservation service were mainly influenced by topographic changes. There were strong interactions between carbon sequestration, air quality regulation and water yield, which were steady among different spatial scales and landscape types. Soil conservation correlations were weak and changed substantially due to differences of spatial scales and landscape types. Although there are limitations associated Corresponding with data accessibility, this study provides a new research method for mapping impacts of mining on ecosystem services, which offer spatially explicit information for decision-makers and environmental regulators to cany out feasible policies, balancing mining development with ecosystem services provision.

TI  - Human activities alter response of alpine grasslands on Tibetan Plateau to climate change
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's largest alpine pastures are found on the Tibetan Plateau, where considerable climate changes and human impacts have been experienced. Identifying their contributions to terrestrial productivity is essential if we are to adapt to, or mitigate the effects of, climate change. In this work, we begin by showing how the current warming and wetting of the climate over the last three decades has favored plant growth, as consistently captured by satellite observations and 15 models. However, the interactions between climate factors explain less of the variation in greenness observed by satellites after the 2000s, implying non-climatic influences. Next, we show that there is a significant negative impact of livestock grazing on pasture greenness, especially in peak summer. Official statistics across 72 counties verify these negative impacts, especially in poorer pastures with a higher density of grazing livestock. The variation in grazing density has a stronger negative effect on vegetation growth during the early part of the growing season after the 2000s, as compared with that before the 2000s. We found a compensatory effect of grazing and climate on alpine grassland growth, and the grazing regulates the response of vegetation greenness to climate change by modulating the dependency of vegetation growth on temperature. Thus, we suggest there is a weakening influence of climate on the greenness of alpine pastures, largely due to a strengthening influence of management, which should be considered by both the scientific community and policymakers.

TI  - Received power attenuation due to the wave-front aberrations induced by the receiving optical antenna in an inter-satellite laser communication link
T2  - OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the design defect, adjustment error, thermal deformation and gravity deformation in orbit, the bad optical antenna of the communication receiving terminal in an inter-satellite laser communication link will induce aberrations to the received wave-front. This will cause attenuation of the received power and deterioration of the bit error rate (BER) performance. The calculation model of the compensated and normalized received power is established when the received light spot is pointed at the center of the focal plane and the limited receiving radius is considered. The numerical results show that, for receivers with a single first-order Zernike mode wave-front aberration, the primary spherical aberration has the most influence on the received power attenuation, and for receivers with the same type aberrations, higher-order Zernike aberrations have more influence on that. The universality of the result for different antennas is verified by introducing a characteristic radius and a relative receiving radius. Some suggestions are proposed to lower the requirements of the wave aberrations control, thus reducing the difficulty of optical design, structural design, thermal design, assembly and adjustment. The outcome of this study would contribute to the design of the inter-satellite laser communication systems.

TI  - Tendencies, variability and persistence of sea surface temperature anomalies
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying global trends and variability in sea surface temperature (SST) is of fundamental importance to understanding changes in the Earth's climate. One approach to observing SST is via remote sensing. Here we use a 37-year gap-filled, daily-mean analysis of satellite SSTs to quantify SST trends, variability and persistence between 1981-2018. The global mean warming trend is 0.09K per decade globally, with 95% of local trends being between -0.1K and+0.35K. Excluding perennial sea-ice regions, the mean warming trend is 0.11K per decade. After removing the long-term trend we calculate the SST power spectra over different time periods. The maximum variance in the SST power spectra in the equatorial Pacific is 1.9 K-2 on 1-5 year timescales, dominated by ENSO processes. In western boundary currents characterised by an intense mesoscale activity, SST power on sub-annual timescales dominates, with a maximum variance of 4.9 K-2. Persistence timescales tend to be shorter in the summer hemisphere due to the shallower mixed layer. The median short-term persistence length is 11-14 days, found over 71-79% of the global ocean area, with seasonal variations. The mean global correlation between monthly SST anomalies with a three-month time-lag is 0.35, with statistically significant correlations over 54.0% of the global oceans, and notably in the northern and equatorial Pacific, and the sub-polar gyre south of Greenland. At six months, the mean global SST anomaly correlation falls to 0.18. The satellite data record enables the detailed characterisation of temporal changes in SST over almost four decades.

T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Minimally invasive surgery for gynecologic cancers is associated with fewer postoperative complications including less blood loss and quicker recovery time compared to traditional laparotomy. The robotic platform has allowed patients access to minimally invasive surgery due to its increased utilization by gynecologic oncologists. Many surgeons have embraced the robotic platform due to its technological advances over traditional laparoscopy including high-definition 3D optics, wristed instrumentation, camera stability and improved ergonomics. While robotic surgery continues as a mainstay in the management of gynecologic cancers, it remains controversial in regards to its cost effectiveness and more recently, its long-term impact on clinical and oncologic outcomes. A strong component of the justification of this surgical platform is based on extrapolated data from traditional laparoscopy despite limited prospective randomized trials for robotic-assisted surgery. In this review, we highlight the use of robotic surgery in the management of gynecologic cancers in special populations: fertility sparing patients, the morbidly obese, the elderly, and patients with a favorable response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - Capacity of urban springs to support emergency water needs, a secondary city case study: Kharkiv, Ukraine
T2  - URBAN WATER JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The twenty-first century is experiencing the emergence of secondary cities (small-to-medium-sized cities) as major growth areas, especially in low-and middle-income countries. Secondary cities experience rapid, unplanned, and informal growth patterns, creating water issues that influence human insecurity. The Department of State's Secondary Cities Initiative generates geospatial data through field-based participatory mapping to assist secondary cities to prepare for sustainability issues such as water scarcity. This paper focuses on urban springs in Kharkiv, Ukraine, as an alternative water source during emergencies. These results show the spatial location and discharge of spring water aligns with the population distribution. Twenty-eight percent of people can meet minimum drinking-water requirements from spring water.

TI  - Encephalopathy as the Sentinel Sign of a Cortical Stroke in a Patient Infected With Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19)
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel coronavirus has challenged medical systems worldwide to provide optimal medical care in the setting of limited resources. Although we are uncovering many facets of its disease spectrum, with rapidly emerging data, there is still limited knowledge of the sequelae of this infection, making treatment guidelines incomplete and resulting in serious unpredictable outcomes in patients at seemingly low risk, especially ones afflicted by neurological consequences. We present a case of a cortical stroke in a 31-year-old coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) positive female with otherwise no stroke risk factors. We noted a correlation between cytokine release, encephalopathy, and the onset of stroke symptoms. Patients with marked pro-thrombotic and inflammatory markers may benefit from closer neurological monitoring and thromboprophylaxis at therapeutic doses. The establishment of acute care pathways to manage critically ill patients with neurological consequences may reverse the suboptimal outcome trends seen during the pandemic.

TI  - A geospatial model for allocating potential urban-industrial zones in a desert: Case study Matrouh, Egypt
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Planning for new urban-industrial communities in deserts is a main objective of the Egyptian government. Allocation of such communities should comply with both environmental protection and sustainable consumption of resources. The current study explores such approach, through mapping potential zones for new urban-industrial communities in Matrouh Governorate, Western Desert, Egypt. A spatial multidisciplinary approach has been adopted to facilitate zoning based on satellite data, spatial decision support systems and a geospatial model. Landsat 8, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission in addition to several thematic maps were input for the geospatial model. Three sub-models were created for three themes (visions), two of which were created using spatial multicriteria analysis (land resources and infrastructures), and the third sub-model, namely environmental protection, was created using a binary model. The analytical hierarchy process method was applied to assign relative weights for the resources theme, while the rank-sum method was used for the infrastructure theme. The three sub-models were aggregated to produce the suitability index for three zoning visions. Such index was classified and the highest three suitability values in each suitability index were extracted being the most optimum zones. Such zones are found in the northeastern part of the study area. The most optimum zones amounted to 23,863 km(2), 47,707 km(2) and 25,474 km(2); equivalent to 14.8%, 29.7% and 15.9% for the first, second and third visions, respectively. The resultant maps can be used in site selection, allocation, decisions and for planning new urban communities.

TI  - A morphology-independent methodology to assess erosion, accretion and lateral migration of an alluvial channel using geospatial tools: a study on the Raidak-I river of Himalayan Foothills
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Channel migration is a significant geomorphological process in the floodplain region. Human intervention in the form of engineering constructions (bridges, embankment, etc.) regarded as another dominant issue which is pulverizing the ways of natural channel adjustment as well as channel behavior. In the study, the channel adjustment in terms of lateral migration is lucidly illustrated with the application of modern tools of geoinformatics, i.e., the techniques of RS and GIS. At present, RS and GIS are capable of detecting as well as representing the channel changes over space and time. The Raidak-I river is a meandering course stretching for about 81.9 km through alluvial plains of Cooch Behar and Alipurduar districts of West Bengal. To study erosion-accretion and lateral migration of Raidak-I river, sequential changes in the position of bank line have been studied with the help of USGS satellite data for the year 1972, 1978, 1990, 1996, 2002, 2009 and 2016. Using Arc GIS10.1 software and Arc GIS extension tools, bank centerline, the average length of migration of channel, shape area migration of the channel and different segments-wise erosion and accretion were assessed. The river bank line shifting due to bank erosion has been carried out considering various time spans, i.e., 1972-1978, 1978-1990, 1990-1996, 1996-2002, 2002-2009 and 2009-2016. The average migration of channel, shape area migration of channel and erosion-deposition decreased from 1972 to 2016 except during the period 1990-1996. Such changes in meander morphology of the Raidak-I river have made the channel more dynamic in the Himalayan foothill region.

TI  - Geosynchronous SAR raw data simulator in presence of ionospheric scintillation using reverse backprojection
T2  - ELECTRONICS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The future L-band geosynchronous synthetic aperture radar (GEO SAR) system will be inevitably affected by ionospheric scintillation. Due to the lack of the real system, it is necessary to achieve the scintillation-affected GEO SAR raw data for the research of influential mechanism and correction strategies. A method for the generation of scintillation-affected GEO SAR raw data is proposed that utilises the reverse backprojection (ReBP) to efficiently and accurately modulate the scintillation transfer function on GEO SAR signals. A simulation experiment for a real SAR scene from one of the ALOS-PALSAR observation is operated in case of the current inclined L-band GEO SAR system configuration. The simulation takes less time by using the ReBP, compared with the existent method, and shows the speckle-like phase error similar to the injected scintillation phase error, which validates the nice efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methodology.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-1 and-2 time series for estimating LAI and biomass of wheat and rapeseed crop types
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring crops at a fine scale is critical because it provides information crucial for assessing the influence of increased food production on sustainable management of agricultural landscapes. We assessed the potential of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 (S-1) and optical Sentinel-2 (S-2) images to derive crop biophysical parameters of wheat and rapeseed in Brittany, France. We generated a dataset of 29 features, including spectral bands and vegetation indices derived from S-2 images, and backscattering coefficients and polarimetric indicators derived from S-1 images. Then, we compared the respective value of S-1 and S-2 features to estimate crop LAI, biomass, and water content (WC) using a Gaussian processes regression. The results show that best S-2-based models were achieved using the green band, NIR bands, and vegetation indices for the wheat WC, LAI, and biomass, respectively, and the shortwave-infrared bands for rapeseed biomass. Concerning S-1-based models, the sigma(VH)-V-0 : sigma(VV)-V-0 ratio was the most relevant feature for wheat LAI and rapeseed biomass, and the Shannon entropy polarization contribution best performed for wheat WC. We highlighted not only the value of optical S-2 images but also the importance of polarimetric indicators derived from SAR S-1 images for estimating crop biophysical parameters.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background Rapid reporting of surveillance data is essential to better inform national prevention and control strategies.Objectives We compare the newly implemented smartphone-based system to the former paper-based and short message service (SMS) for collecting influenza epidemiological data in Cameroon.Methods Of the 13 sites which collect data from persons with influenza-like illness (ILI), six sites send data through the EWS, while seven sites make use of the paper-based system and SMS. We used four criteria for the comparison of the data collection tools: completeness, timeliness, conformity and cost.Results Regarding the different collection tools, data sent by the EWS were significantly more complete (97.6% vs 81.6% vs 44.8%), prompt (74.4% vs n/a vs 60.7%) and of better quality (93.7% vs 76.1% vs 84.0%) than data sent by the paper-based system and SMS, respectively. The average cost of sending a datum by a sentinel site per week was higher for the forms (5.0 USD) than for the EWS (0.9 USD) and SMS (0.1 USD). The number of outpatient visits and subsequently all surveillance data decreased across the years 2017-2019 together with the influenza positivity rate from 30.7% to 28.3%. Contrarily, the proportion of influenza-associated ILI to outpatient load was highest in the year 2019 (0.37 per 100 persons vs 0.28 and 0.26 in the other 2 years).Conclusion All sentinel sites and even other disease surveillance systems are expected to use this tool in the near term future due to its satisfactory performance and cost.

TI  - Superparamagnetic iron oxide as a tracer for sentinel lymph node detection in uterine cancer: a pilot study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping using dye or radioisotopes has been performed in patients with uterine cancer. Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) can be handled safely and is taken up by lymph nodes (LNs); however, its efficacy in detecting SLNs in uterine cancer remains unknown. This pilot study evaluated the use of SPIO as a tracer for SLN detection in patients with uterine cancer. SPIO was injected into the uterine cervixes of 15 patients with uterine cancer scheduled for pelvic LN dissection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed preoperatively. Five patients also underwent radioisotope injection and single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography. Dissected LNs were stained with iron and examined pathologically. Of the radioisotope-positive LNs, 92% were also SPIO/MRI-positive. SPIO/MRI and iron staining were positively correlated. SLNs were identified by iron staining in 93% of cases. Iron staining was strongly positive in two of the five areas of LN metastasis; these were considered SLNs. Staining was negative or very weak in the other three areas and lymph flow disturbance was considered. SPIO and radioisotopes are taken up similarly by SLNs. SPIO/MRI and iron staining may thus be useful for detection of SLNs and diagnosis of LN metastasis in patients with uterine cancer.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the association between cumulative visits for care of minor injuries and risk of traumatic brain injuries in children aged <= 36 months.Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of children born from 2009 to 2012, using a health insurance claims database in Japan. We investigated the total number of visits where children aged 0-36 months presented for treatment of minor injuries such as superficial injuries, fractures, burns and foreign body ingestions. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between the cumulative number of visits for treatment of minor injuries and traumatic brain injuries in children aged <= 36 months.Results A total of 91 011 children were included in the analysis, 51% of whom were boys. Traumatic brain injuries were identified in 0.7% of these children. Cumulative visits for care of minor injuries among children aged 0-36 months were significantly associated with traumatic brain injuries by 36 months of age, with an odds ratio of 2.12 (95% confidence interval: 1.68-2.68) for multiple visits.Conclusion Cumulative visits for treatment of minor injuries during the first 36 months of life were associated with increased risk of traumatic brain injuries by 36 months of age.

TI  - Validation of a ground-based telescope-assisted hyperspectral remote sensor for soil measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The utility of the ground-based soil observation laser absorption spectrometer (SOLAS) was demonstrated through spectral reflectance measurements of five soil types during laboratory- and field-based collection. The SOLAS telescope-assisted measurements were compared with proximal measurements. The spectra that were acquired at an intermediate range of 40 meters compared well with the spectra that were acquired proximally. Specimen type, range-dependent spatial resolution, and environmental conditions are discussed. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was assessed and is presented as a function of wavelength for the spectral range of the receiver for each measurement condition. The proximal measurements performed outdoors under solar illumination had the greatest SNR, while the remote measurements performed indoors under artificial illumination had the lowest SNR. For the outdoor measurements, loss of signal was observed around the 1400- and 1900-nm bands due to long-path atmospheric water vapor absorption. The discussed future improvements to the SOLAS remote sensor will enable measurements of reflectance over longer ranges. Envisioned applications include remote characterization of surface materials for large construction projects (e.g., surface mines and tailings) for geohazard investigations, or for ground truthing of current and future multispectral and hyperspectral satellite data.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover is rapidly changing across the globe. An understanding of how land use/cover changes (LUCCs) are made can lead to appropriate management measures to assess environmental changes and to develop policies and plans for sustainable land cover in the future. In this study, we used Land Change Modeler (LCM) to predict LULC by 2030. LUCC was detected using Landsat satellite images, TM, ETM+, and OLI sensors for the years 1987, 2002, and 2017. Transmission potential was modeled using an artificial neural network (multilayer perceptron) and seven variables. LUCCs were modeled for 2017 using the Markov chain with the calibration period 1987-2002, and then, we validated the LULC map that was predicted through LCM by comparing it with the ground reality map of 2017. Finally, LULCs were predicted for 2030 using the calibration period 2002-2017. The largest change in all periods is associated with the change of forest lands into other land uses. Prediction for 2030 suggest that approximately 6000 ha of forest land will change into pastures and 248 ha into agricultural lands.

TI  - Variability and uncertainty in forest biomass estimates from the tree to landscape scale: the role of allometric equations
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Biomass maps are valuable tools for estimating forest carbon and forest planning. Individual-tree biomass estimates made using allometric equations are the foundation for these maps, yet the potentially-high uncertainty and bias associated with individual-tree estimates is commonly ignored in biomass map error. We developed allometric equations for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) in northern Colorado. Plot-level biomass estimates were combined with Landsat imagery and geomorphometric and climate layers to map aboveground tree biomass. We compared biomass estimates for individual trees, plots, and at the landscape-scale using our locally-developed allometric equations, nationwide equations applied across the U.S., and the Forest Inventory and Analysis Component Ratio Method (FIA-CRM). Total biomass map uncertainty was calculated by propagating errors from allometric equations and remote sensing model predictions. Two evaluation methods for the allometric equations were compared in the error propagation-errors calculated from the equation fit (equation-derived) and errors from an independent dataset of destructively-sampled trees (n = 285). Results Tree-scale error and bias of allometric equations varied dramatically between species, but local equations were generally most accurate. Depending on allometric equation and evaluation method, allometric uncertainty contributed 30-75% of total uncertainty, while remote sensing model prediction uncertainty contributed 25-70%. When using equation-derived allometric error, local equations had the lowest total uncertainty (root mean square error percent of the mean [% RMSE] = 50%). This is likely due to low-sample size (10-20 trees sampled per species) allometric equations and evaluation not representing true variability in tree growth forms. When independently evaluated, allometric uncertainty outsized remote sensing model prediction uncertainty. Biomass across the 1.56 million ha study area and uncertainties were similar for local (2.1 billion Mg; % RMSE = 97%) and nationwide (2.2 billion Mg; % RMSE = 94%) equations, while FIA-CRM estimates were lower and more uncertain (1.5 billion Mg; % RMSE = 165%). Conclusions Allometric equations should be selected carefully since they drive substantial differences in bias and uncertainty. Biomass quantification efforts should consider contributions of allometric uncertainty to total uncertainty, at a minimum, and independently evaluate allometric equations when suitable data are available.

TI  - Discovery of Peptide Boronate Derivatives as Histone Deacetylase and Proteasome Dual Inhibitors for Overcoming Bortezomib Resistance of Multiple Myeloma
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - While proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib showed satisfactory clinical benefits in the initial treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), drug resistance and relapse are unavoidable. Recent studies suggested inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) restored sensitivity of bortezomib-resistant MM. Hence, we designed dual inhibitors targeting both HDACs and proteasomes to address the resistance of bortezomib. The most potent inhibitors, ZY-2 and ZY-13 showed excellent inhibition against proteasome and good selectivity against HDACs. In particular, ZY-2 not only exhibited good antiproliferative activities on the MM cell lines RPMI-8226, U266, and KM3 (IC50 values of 6.66, 4.31, and 10.1 nM, respectively) but also showed more potent antiproliferative activities against the bortezomib-resistant MM cell line KM3/BTZ compared with bortezomib (IC50 values of 8.98 vs. 226 nM, P < 0.01) and even better than the combination of the HDAC inhibitor MS-275 and bortezomib (1:1) (IC50 values of 8.98 vs. 98.0 nM, P < 0.01).

M3  - Article
AB  - The notion of worldview figures prominently in the recent discourse surrounding Religious Education (RE) in English schools following the publication of the final report of the Commission on Religious Education (CoRE) in 2018. This article reflects on the veracity of this initiative. It begins with an autobiographical reflection on the impact of worldview on the author's development as a scholar. Then, the work of several critics of CoRE is discussed and a more nuanced understanding of worldview is developed as a result. Finally, the pedagogical implications of the shift to worldview are explored by drawing on the personal development approach of Michael Grimmitt and the responsible hermeneutics approach of Anthony Thiselton.

TI  - Anthropogenic and volcanic point source SO<sub>2</sub> emissions derived from TROPOMI on board Sentinel-5 Precursor: first results
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper introduces the first TROPOMI-based sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions estimates for point sources. A total of about 500 continuously emitting point sources releasing about 10 kt yr(-1) to more than 2000 kt yr(-1) of SO2, previously identified from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) observations, were analyzed using TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) measurements for 1 full year from April 2018 to March 2019. The annual emissions from these sources were estimated and compared to similar estimates from OMI and Ozone Mapping Profiling Suite (OMPS) measurements. Note that emissions from many of these 500 sources have declined significantly since 2005, making their quantification more challenging. We were able to identify 274 sources where annual emissions are significant and can be reliably estimated from TROPOMI. The standard deviations of TROPOMI vertical column density data, about 1 Dobson unit (DU, where 1 DU = 2.69 x 10(16) molecules cm(-2)) over the tropics and 1.5 DU over high latitudes, are larger than those of OMI (0.6-1 DU) and OMPS (0.3-0.4 DU). Due to its very high spatial resolution, TROPOMI produces 12-20 times more observations over a certain area than OMI and 96 times more than OMPS. Despite higher uncertainties of individual TROPOMI observations, TROPOMI data averaged over a large area have roughly 2-3 times lower uncertainties compared to OMI and OMPS data. Similarly, TROPOMI annual emissions can be estimated with uncertainties that are 1.5-2 times lower than the uncertainties of annual emissions estimates from OMI. While there are area biases in TROPOMI data over some regions that have to be removed from emission calculations, the absolute magnitude of these are modest, typically within +/- 0.25 DU, which can be comparable with SO2 values over large sources.

TI  - Untargeted Metabolomics to Reveal Red versus White Meat-Associated Gut Metabolites in a Prudent and Western Dietary Context
T2  - MOLECULAR NUTRITION & FOOD RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Scope To improve understanding of the epidemiological link between red and processed meat consumption and chronic diseases, more insight into the formation of metabolites during meat digestion is warranted.Methods and results Untargeted mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics is applied to explore the impact of red and processed meat consumption (compared to chicken), combined with a prudent or Western dietary pattern. A pig feeding study (n = 32), as a sentinel for humans, is conducted in a 2 x 2 factorial design for 4 weeks. The luminal content of the small intestine and colon are collected to determine their metabolic fingerprints. Seventy-six metabolites (38 in the small intestine, 32 in the colon, and 6 in both intestinal compartments) contributing to the distinct gut metabolic profiles of pigs fed either chicken or red and processed meat are (tentatively) identified. Consumption of red and processed meat results in higher levels of short- and medium-chain acylcarnitines and 3-dehydroxycarnitine, irrespective of dietary context, whereas long-chain acylcarnitines and monoacylglycerols are associated with the red and processed Western diet.Conclusion The identification of red and processed meat-associated gut metabolites in this study contributes to the understanding of meat digestion in a complex but controlled dietary context and its potential health effects.

TI  - Analyzing the Variability of Remote Sensing and Hydrologic Model Evapotranspiration Products in a Watershed in Michigan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this paper was to statistically explore the spatiotemporal performance of remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration (ETa) datasets and a remotely sensed ensemble in a region that lacks observed data. The remotely sensed datasets were further compared with ETa results from a physically based hydrologic model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) to examine the differences and determine the level of agreement between the ETa datasets and the model outputs. ETa datasets were compared on temporal (i.e., monthly and seasonal basis) and spatial (i.e., landuse) scales at both watershed and subbasin levels. The results showed a lack of consistent similarities and differences among the datasets when evaluating the monthly ETa variations; however, the seasonal aggregated data presented more consistent similarities and differences during the spring and summer compared to the fall and winter. Meanwhile, spatial analysis of the datasets showed the MOD16A2 500 m ETa product was the most versatile of the tested datasets, being able to differentiate between landuses during all seasons. Furthermore, the use of an averaging ensemble was able to improve overall ETa performance in the study area. This study showed that the remotely sensed ETa products are not similar throughout the year, but the appropriate application periods for different ETa products were identified. Finally, spatial variabilities of the ETa products are more in tune with landuse and climate characteristics.

TI  - Flash flood risk assessment for drainage basins in the Himalayan foreland of Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling Districts, West Bengal
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods pose significant threats to the socio-economic development of the Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling Districts. These districts situated in the piedmont zone of Sikkim-Darjeeling and Bhutanese Himalayas suffer from the flash floods, and those cause tremendous loss of life and property more or less every year. This study assessed flash flood risk of watersheds of the Himalayan foreland of Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling Districts in support of mitigation planning. Different hydro-geomorphological setup controls the magnitude, frequency and distribution of flash flood like topography, geomorphology, geology and climatology of the area under study. Land use/land cover and soils also have an integral relationship with run-off generation in the watersheds. Thus, we adopted holistic approach considering the topographic, hydrological, climatological, geological, soil and land use/land cover factors to assess the relative susceptibility to flash floods of the watersheds of Himalayan foreland of Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling Districts. Jaxa 30m DSM, Landsat8 OLI/TIRS and Sentinel 2A satellite images, digitized drainage network, geological, rainfall, soil and geomorphological map were analysed in GIS environment to infer lithology, land use, hydrological soil type and watershed morphometrics. The morphometric parameters were used to assign the relative susceptibility of the watersheds to flash flood, applying the weighted sum average method. Soil Conservation Service rainfall-runoff model of USDA and synthetic unit hydrograph were used to infer the hydrological response of the basin including curve number, runoff depth, time of concentration, lag time, peak discharge, etc. Final flash flood risk map was achieved by the integration of both the susceptibility maps. Higher weightage was given to the susceptibility map produced from run-off modelling and synthetic hydrograph parameters. The result shows that 63% of basins are fall in the high to very high categories of flash flood risk, 28% under medium and only 9% in the low categories of flash flood risk. Accuracy of the model was assessed using the flood inventory coupled with field diagnosis of past flood damages and available records. The resulting flash flood risk map could be used by the planners to adopt mitigation strategies to reduce the severity of the flash flood hazard.

TI  - Usefulness of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Oral Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for detecting neck nodal metastasis in early oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as an alternative to elective neck dissection.Study Design A systematic search for relevant literature was conducted in the PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases.Methods Two reviewers individually searched the five databases up to November 2019. For studies that met inclusion criteria, data on patient diagnoses were pooled, including true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Methodological quality was checked with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (version 2) tool.Results In total, 98 observational or retrospective studies were included. The diagnostic odds ratio of SLNB was 326.165 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 231.477-459.587; I-2 = 0%). The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.982. Sensitivity was 0.827 (95% CI: 0.804-0.848), and specificity was 0.981 (95% CI: 0.975-0.986). The correlation between sensitivity and the false positive rate was -0.076, which indicates that heterogeneity did not exist. Subgroup analyses were performed with the subgroups reference test type, publication year, and study type. No significant difference was found within the reference test type subgroup. However, differences within the publication year and study type subgroups were significant, where the retrospective study subgroup was significantly more sensitive and specific than the prospective study subgroup.Conclusion Results of this meta-analysis imply that the high specificity of SLNB supports its role as a diagnostic tool for patients with clinical tumor stage (CT)1-2 clinically negative (N0) OSCC. More studies should be done to further verify the results of this study.Level of Evidence 2a Laryngoscope, 2020

TI  - Predominant risk factors for tick-borne co-infections in hunting dogs from the USA
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBoth incidence and geographical range of tick-borne disease has increased across the USA. Similar to people, dogs are hosts for Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Ehrlichia spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi. Dogs also share our homes and beds, making them both a sentinel for the ticks in our backyards but also increasing our exposure to ticks. Measures to better track, prevent, and/or treat tick-borne diseases in companion animals can lead to better control and prevention of human tick-borne disease. This study identifies demographic and co-infection risk factors for canine seropositivity to tick-borne infections in a cohort of hunting dogs across the USA.ResultsHuman patterns of tick-borne disease co-infection in the USA have been predominantly driven by the geographical distribution of the tick vector. Dogs who tested seropositive for Anaplasma spp. were 1.40 times more likely (P = 0.0242) to also test seropositive for Babesia spp. and vice versa (1.60 times more likely, P = 0.0014). Dogs living in the West had 5% lower risk (P = 0.0001) for Ehrlichia spp. seropositivity compared to other regions. Controlling for age and Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence, dogs in all three other regions were 2.30 times more likely (P = 0.0216) to test seropositive for B. burgdorferi than dogs in the West. Dogs seropositive for B. burgdorferi were 1.60 times more likely (P = 0.0473) to be seropositive for Anaplasma spp.ConclusionsTick geographical distributions have a prominent impact on the regional distribution of hunting dog exposure to tick-borne diseases. Education concerning regional tick prevalence and disease risk is important for everyone, but particularly dog owners, regarding ticks in their region and protection from infection and co-infection of tick-borne pathogens as they travel or move with their dogs. Dogs are sentinel species for human exposure to ticks, and as such surveillance of canine tick-borne infections and understanding the probability that these infections might be seen together as co-infections helps predict emerging areas where people are more likely to be exposed as well.

TI  - The influence of cultural worldviews on people's responses to hurricane risks and threat information
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores whether and how cultural worldviews influence people's responses to approaching natural hazard threats, using data from a survey that asked residents of coastal Florida, USA, about a scenario of a hurricane forecasted to affect their region. The analysis finds that stronger individualist worldview is associated with lower hurricane-related evacuation intentions, cognitive risk perception, negative affect, response and self-efficacy, perceptions of government preparedness, and information seeking. It is also associated with greater hurricane information avoidance, perceptions of bias in key hurricane information sources, and negative reactance to hurricane threat information. Mediation analysis indicates that stronger individualists' lower evacuation intentions are explained by their lower cognitive risk perception, negative affect, and response efficacy related to the hurricane threat. Their greater negative reactance to the hurricane threat information is partly explained by their lower cognitive risk perception, but not by their lower efficacy; both are counter to the predictions of the Extended Parallel Process Model. These results demonstrate that worldviews can interact with how people perceive and respond to near-term hazard risks and risk information, and they suggest that hazard risk communication should consider cultural theory when designing and conveying forecasts, warnings, and other risk messages. The authors recommend further research to investigate in greater depth the roles of cultural theory in these contexts.

TI  - Landslide detection in mountainous forest areas using polarimetry and interferometric coherence
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud-free, wide-swath, day-and-night observation capability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has an important role in rapid landslide monitoring to reduce economic and human losses. Although interferometric SAR (InSAR) analysis is widely used to monitor landslides, it is difficult to use that for rapid landslide detection in mountainous forest areas because of significant decorrelation. We combined polarimetric SAR (PolSAR), InSAR, and digital elevation model (DEM) analysis to detect landslides induced by the July 2017 Heavy Rain in Northern Kyushu and by the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake. This study uses fully polarimetric L-band SAR data from the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 satellite. The simple thresholding of polarimetric parameters (alpha angle and Pauli components) was found to be effective. The study also found that supervised classification using PolSAR, InSAR, and DEM parameters provided high accuracy, although this method should be used carefully because its accuracy depends on the geological characteristics of the training data. Regarding polarimetric configurations, at least dual-polarimetry (e.g., HH and HV) is required for landslide detection, and quad-polarimetry is recommended. These results demonstrate the feasibility of rapid landslide detection using L-band SAR images.

TI  - Geospatial assessment of land surface temperature in Nagpur, India: an impact of urbanization
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature is one of the factors which affects the meteorological phenomenon prevailing in an urban area and ultimately leads to climate change and global warming. Measurement of surface temperature with conventional temperature sensors is tedious, has single point value and expensive. Satellite data of 2005, 2008, 2010 and 2016 are used to assess the land use land cover (LULC) and to measure the land surface temperature (LST) during the hottest month of May in Nagpur city, India. Based on the image analysis, it is observed that there is an increase in the average temperature from 40.0 to 44.6 oC. This may be due to an increase in built-up area from 55.5 to 69.8% during 2005 to 2016, respectively. It has also been revealed that the outskirts of the city are hotter than the central portion of the city as there is more barren land on the outskirts. Results were compared to ambient temperature sensor that showed good agreement between temperature retrieved from satellite and temperature sensor. The study suggests that urban areas should be developed intermixed with vegetation and plantation and provisions of green belt along the city roads, highways and ring roads. Based on LST and LULC analysis, a green belt of 30 m along both sides of the road would lower the road temperature by 9.3 oC from existing temperature of 44.7 oC. This would help in lowering down the average temperature of the city.

TI  - Ford's metaphysics: On the Transcendental origins of Henry Ford's Fordism
T2  - ORGANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Since it was first articulated by Antonio Gramsci in his Prison Notebooks (1929-1935), Fordism has been understood at two interconnected levels. At one level, it is understood in secular materialist terms as an archetypal system of mass production. At another, as a techno-economic paradigm of capitalist expansion. However, little attention has been given to the philosophical influences and ideas that underpinned Henry Ford's (1863-1947) worldview and how this came to influence the formation of the factory systems at his Highland Park and River Rouge complexes. In most textbooks, it is assumed that Ford based his industrial design on a technological intensification of F.W. Taylor's Principles of Scientific Management. This article seeks to examine the origins and rationale behind Ford's factory system by exploring the relationship between his personal worldview and the 'ism' which came to bear his name. Through a cultural-historical analysis, this article critically explores Henry Ford's personal Fordism, and argues that what has come to be understood as one of the most 'secular' and 'materialist' processes of organising 'men and machine' began with an attempt by Henry Ford to realise a 'metaphysical' ideal that was informed by the popular philosophical and theological thought of the previous century. By returning to the ideas and the context of this period, Ford's engagement with the work of the American Transcendentalist, Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882) is considered to both contextualise Henry Ford's Fordism and explore the philosophical tensions at the heart of his organisational theory and practice.

TI  - Current Status and Factors Influencing Surgical Options for Breast Cancer in China: A Nationwide Cross-Sectional Survey of 110 Hospitals
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There are limited nationwide data regarding breast cancer surgery in China. The Chinese Anti-Cancer Association's Committee of Breast Cancer Society and the Chinese Society of Breast Surgeons conducted a nationwide survey to examine the use of and barriers associated with surgical options among patients with breast cancer.Methods Surveys were sent via e-mail to the directors of 110 centers that performed at least 200 breast cancer operations in 2017. The electronic questionnaire contained 183 questions and covered six aspects, including demographic information about the hospitals and surgeons, surgical practice, and application of breast reconstruction.Results The selected hospitals were from 31 provinces or municipalities. The overall proportion of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) was 22%. Local gross domestic product was significantly related to the rate of BCS (p = .046). Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed routinely in 76% of hospitals. Only 14.5% (16/110) of hospitals used the dual-tracer method, including radioisotopes. For patients with cN0 disease receiving BCS with one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes, 20% (22/110) of hospitals accepted omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). For patients who underwent mastectomy, only 4% (4/110) of hospitals accepted omitting ALND. There was an obvious polarization trend in the proportion of oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery (OPS); 35/110 (32%) performed OPS in fewer than 10% of cases, whereas 36/110 (33%) performed OPS in more than 50% of cases. OPS was more likely to be performed in academic hospitals. Volume displacement was more commonly used than volume replacement (p < .001). Breast reconstruction was routinely performed in 96/110 (87%) of hospitals, 62% of which involved cooperation with the plastic surgery department. Factors influencing breast reconstruction after mastectomy included the establishment of a plastic surgery department, regional economy, and cooperation between the plastic and general surgery departments. Overall, the proportion of breast reconstruction procedures after mastectomy was 10.7%, with 70% being implant-based reconstruction, 17% autologous tissue reconstruction, and 13% a combination. Overall, 22% of the hospitals predominantly performed immediate breast reconstruction. For delayed reconstruction, two-stage implant-based breast reconstruction was the first choice for 46% of centers, whereas 20% of centers chose autologous reconstruction. Among the 96 centers that performed autologous-based reconstruction, 96% performed latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction, 65% performed transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap reconstruction, and 45% used deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flaps.Conclusion The results are of great value for promoting the implementation of a consensus on diagnostic and treatment standards, development of guidelines for breast cancer, and training of breast specialists.Implications for Practice This study aimed to establish comprehensive baseline data on the status of current breast cancer treatment in China by presenting the statistics on clinical treatments and surgeries, the distribution of clinical stages, and the demographic characteristics of patients.This report is based on a survey conducted by the Chinese Anti-Cancer Association's Committee of Breast Cancer Society and the Chinese Society of Breast Surgeons, which examined the use of breast cancer surgical options in hospitals all over the country and the factors hindering the adoption of procedures and techniques. This study makes a significant contribution to the literature because there are limited nationwide data regarding breast cancer surgery in China.

When the whole image or a set of grid cells are analyzed for a global effect, the problem of multiple testing arises. When no global effect is present, we expect alpha of all grid cells to be false positives, and spatially autocorrelated data can give rise to clustered spurious rejections that can be misleading in an analysis of spatial patterns. In this work, we review standard solutions for the multiple testing problem and apply them to spatio-temporal environmental data. These solutions are independent of the test statistic, and any test statistic can be used (e.g., tests for trends or change points in time series). Additionally, we introduce permutation methods and show that they have more statistical power. Real-world data are used to provide examples of the analysis, and the performance of each method is assessed in a simulation study. Unlike other simulation studies, our study compares the statistical power of the presented methods in a comprehensive simulation study. In conclusion, we present several statistically rigorous methods for analyzing spatio-temporal environmental data and controlling the false positives. These methods allow the use of any test statistic in a wide range of applications in environmental sciences and remote sensing.

TI  - Assessing the impact of master plan on the dynamicity and resilience of forest cover change: a study on Adina Deer Park (Forest), West Bengal, India
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing land use and land cover change as well as monitoring dynamic nature of forest cover plays an important role for the management of biodiversity and its native ecosystem. The present paper mainly focuses on the impact of master plan on dynamicity and resilience of Adina Deer Park since 1990-2017 using multi-temporal LANDSAT data. Supervised pixel and object oriented techniques and change detection method have been used for both pre (1990-2015) and post (2015-2017) master plan. Landscape metrics have also been analyzed to detect forest fragmentation applying fragstats software. Overall accuracies for both classified images of 2010 and 2017 were 81.25% and 84.12%. The forest cover changes map exhibits that dense forest and water bodies increased from 15.68 to 39.64 ha and 8.12 to 9.17 ha whereas sparse forest and bare land declined from 31.02 to 22.08 ha and 22.59 to 9.11 ha respectively. The result showed a significant increase in dense forestand sparse forest with annual growth rate of 20% and 15.97% after the implementation of master plan in 2015. This study may assist the planners and policy makers to adopt the environmental and ecological oriented strategies for sustainable management of ecosystems and biodiversity.

TI  - Idea Paper: Tracking the distribution of accretive reef communities across the Kuroshio region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In line with contemporary changes in oceanic conditions, reef communities could be declining at the equator and expanding polewards, having previously happened in the past. Yet, some tropical organisms are now decimated at their distributional cores and observed beyond their inferred range limits. However, it remains unclear if this is happening at the community scale, especially due to the challenges of collecting quantitative and comparable data across latitudes. Here, we propose that monitoring sentinel plots via photogrammetry could help to assess abiding changes in benthic communities and trajectories of reef-building populations across the Kuroshio region. We think that as oceans are becoming warmer, accretive reef communities may shift their distribution northwards which may be primarily due to a change in the relative biomass-abundance of resident taxa. Consistent trends among latitudes will resolve the possibility of contraction or expansion of accretive reef communities, providing further insight into the variety of responses and dynamics observed across latitudes in the context of the Anthropocene.

TI  - A schematic sampling protocol for contaminant monitoring in raptors
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Birds of prey, owls and falcons are widely used as sentinel species in raptor biomonitoring programmes. A major current challenge is to facilitate large-scale biomonitoring by coordinating contaminant monitoring activities and by building capacity across countries. This requires sharing, dissemination and adoption of best practices addressed by the Networking Programme Research and Monitoring for and with Raptors in Europe (EURAPMON) and now being advanced by the ongoing international COST Action European Raptor Biomonitoring Facility. The present perspective introduces a schematic sampling protocol for contaminant monitoring in raptors. We provide guidance on sample collection with a view to increasing sampling capacity across countries, ensuring appropriate quality of samples and facilitating harmonization of procedures to maximize the reliability, comparability and interoperability of data. The here presented protocol can be used by professionals and volunteers as a standard guide to ensure harmonised sampling methods for contaminant monitoring in raptors.

TI  - Determination of the dipping direction of a blind reverse fault from InSAR: case study on the 2017 Sefid Sang earthquake, northeastern Iran
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the fault parameters of an earthquake is fundamental for studying the earthquake physics, understanding the seismotectonics of the region, and forecasting future earthquake activities in the surrounding area. Dense crustal deformation data such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) are useful for fault parameter determination, but determining the dipping direction of a blind fault is often challenging when the size of the earthquake is not large (M < 7) or when the coverage of the deformed area is limited to capture the details of rupture. The 5th April 2017, Mw 6.1 earthquake occurred near the city of Sefid Sang, northeast of Iran, provides an excellent case for exploring the potential of InSAR data for determining the dipping direction of a blind reverse fault. Using Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) and Sentinel-1A interferograms of four different observation directions and a fault slip inversion method that allows thorough exploration of the fault geometry led to two candidates of reverse fault models, dipping either to the northeast or the south. The results show that the fault models of both dipping directions explain the data well, with a slight advantage in the northeast-dipping fault model in terms of the misfit when the atmospheric corrections were applied. The northeast-dipping fault model is, in addition, more consistent with the strike of the mapped active faults in the region and with the aftershock distribution, from which we infer that the 2017 Sefid Sang earthquake occurred on a northeast-dipping dextral-reverse fault. The preferred fault model has a strike angle of 314.8 degrees, dip angle of 47.4 degrees and rake angle of 130.3 degrees, and a slip distribution of maximum 1.35 m at depth of 5 km equivalent to Mw 6.0. This study illuminates the difficulty of determining the dipping direction of blind faults even with InSAR measurements from multiple directions, but also that correcting for the atmospheric noise and comparing with other kinds of data can help infer the fault dipping direction.

TI  - Predictors of global warming risk perceptions among Latino and non-Latino White Americans
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming will disproportionately affect people of color (e.g., Latinos). Previous research has found that Latinos in the USA are more engaged with global warming than are non-Latino Whites, in part, because they are more likely to perceive it as a serious risk. It was unclear, however, what factors most strongly explain Latinos' elevated perceptions of risk. This study uses two parallel, nationally representative surveys of Latino and non-Latino White Americans to investigate these different levels of risk perception. Mediation analyses indicate that Latinos' greater risk perceptions may be explained by (in order of magnitude) their stronger pro-climate injunctive social norms and egalitarian worldviews, stronger identification with the Democratic party, more frequent communication with family outside the USA, greater harm from environmental hazards, stronger descriptive norms, and a weaker individualist worldview. These findings help inform strategies for communicating with different subgroups of Americans that have different global warming risk perceptions.

TI  - Mandatory notification of infectious diseases and agents in Germany: development and suggestions for improvement
T2  - BUNDESGESUNDHEITSBLATT-GESUNDHEITSFORSCHUNG-GESUNDHEITSSCHUTZ
M3  - Article
AB  - With the entry into force of the Infection Protection Act (IfSG) in 2001, the reporting obligations for infectious diseases and infectious agents were placed on a new foundation. For the first time, a distinction was made between an obligation for the notification of infectious diseases by physicians and a notification obligation for infectious agents by laboratories. The aim was to reduce the notification burden on physicians and thus to improve the quality of the notifications. Since then, numerous new obligations for notifications have been added. The aim of this work is to describe and discuss the mandatory notification of infectious diseases in Germany on the basis of their development - compared to previous regulations in Germany (Federal Communicable Diseases Act) as well as international and Europe-wide recommendations (IHR; decisions of the EU Commission 1999, 2018) - and to submit suggestions for improvement. Regarding the considerable increase in reporting requirements and reports in recent years, and the fact that the IfSG provides other surveillance systems in addition to mandatory reporting, the mandatory reporting system should be focused on the necessary reporting requirements. In a first step, the proposed abolition of the mandatory reporting of noroviruses and rotaviruses could relieve both the notifiers and the health authorities, thus enabling more efficient reporting and more intensive and better investigation by the health authorities.

TI  - Citizen Science Data Show Temperature-Driven Declines in Riverine Sentinel Invertebrates
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We used the presence and absence data of sentinel invertebrates (stonefly, order Plecoptera) collected by citizen scientists over 17 years to approximate trends in stream health in urban Detroit, Michigan, USA. Citizen science data are commonly collected based on availability of limited funds. Thus, survey locations lack consistent data collection, and missing values are common. While citizen science data sets can be large, on a regional and local scale, they are often undervalued but present an opportunity for managers to inform their decisions if the missing data can be addressed. To overcome this hurdle, here, missing values were modeled with a combination of spatial (inverse distance weighting and spatial stream network), temporal (Bayesian state space), and machine learning (ensemble random forest) models combining atmospheric, hydrologic, and biologic data. Using the estimated missing values, we determined negative population trends in stoneflies driven by stream temperature via a dynamic occupancy model. Urban streams present a challenge to resource managers because data are collected at disparate locations and frequencies and inconsistently recorded. However, we show how a combination of methods with publicly available and citizen science data from across disciplines can inform managers and support land-use decisions.

TI  - Fluvial inundation parameterization in climate model and its effects on regional climate: a case study of the 2009 Red River spring flood
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study introduces a simple and newly developed fluvial inundation parameterization using high-resolution climate model and investigates its impacts on regional climate. The 2009 Red River spring flood is selected as a case study and this approach is tested with the regional climate model, Global Environment Multiscale (GEM) version 4.8 with 10 km resolution, and Canadian Digital Surface Model (CDSM) elevation (similar to 20 m). To investigate the impacts of fluvial inundation on regional climate, the sensitivity experiments using different initial conditions for soil moisture are conducted with 1 km resolution through a three-step one-way nesting approach. Generally, new approach can capture the development-decay of fluvial inundation, similar to MODIS observation. The reasonable statistic values (probability of detection, 0.71; false alarm ratio, 0.26) are found on April 15-22 when occurred the largest MODIS-observed fluvial inundation. In sensitivity experiments, the increase of soil moisture by flooding can induce the decrease of albedo, leading to the increase in absorbed solar radiation energy at surface. Most of the absorbed energy is used by the latent heat flux, inducing the temperature cooling and moisture increase. These changes are larger in daytime than nighttime and are statistically significant in only 2 months (May-June) from the flooding, which contribute to the improvement of temperature simulation. The significant decrease and increase of precipitation in northeastern and southeastern regions away from the flooded region, respectively, are noted post-flooding. These changes are closely associated with the decrease and increase of moist static energy by moisture divergence and convergence, respectively.

TI  - The value and practical utility of intraoperative touch imprint cytology of sentinel lymph node(s) in patients with breast cancer: A retrospective cytology-histology correlation study
T2  - CYTOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Intraoperative evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) for patients with breast cancer is widely performed with frozen section (FS), cytology, or a combination of both. Touch imprint cytology (TIC) reportedly has an equivalent sensitivity to FS. We studied its diagnostic utility to detect SLN metastases.Materials and Methods: Cases of 367 patients with breast cancer who underwent intraoperative valuation of SLNs (507 LNs) were evaluated. All FS and corresponding TIC slides of SLNs of each case were reviewed microscopically for the presence of metastases of any size. If present, the metastatic focus was measured on the FS.Results: Of these 507 SLNs, 82 LNs (16.2%) from 69 women were found to have metastases in the FS and consisted of 5 LNs of isolated tumor cells, 15 of micrometastasis, and 62 of macrometastasis. TIC identified metastases in 69 of these 82 SLNs (sensitivity: 84.1%, specificity: 100%, and accuracy: 97.4%). All macrometastases could be detected by TIC, whereas TIC identified approximately 50% of micrometastases and none of isolated tumor cells. The size detection limit of metastatic foci, defined as the smallest dimension of metastasis detected without false negatives, was 2 mm. The smallest metastatic focus identified was 0.8 mm.Conclusions: TIC of SLNs is of great use given its negative predictive value of 100% for identification of macrometastasis in our study. For intraoperative evaluation of SLNs, based on our data, a practical two-step approach is proposed: SLN evaluation should be initially performed by TIC and then proceed to FS histological analysis only when cytologically positive to determine the size of metastatic focus.

TI  - Assessment of drought condition using remotely sensed drought severity index and its correlations with soil moisture product in Inner Mongolia
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has a deep impact in Inner Mongolia, which relies on livestock and farming. The temporal and spatial variability of drought conditions in Inner Mongolia were analyzed with a drought severity index (DSI), which is derived from the ratio of evapotranspiration to potential evapotranspiration and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), as measured by remote sensing. Soil moisture as an important drought measure has not been used in the calculation of DSI. Using monthly DSI data during the growing season (May-September) in 2001-2010, the relationship between DSI and soil moisture was investigated with correlation coefficient and regression analysis. Different seasonal and spatial patterns of drought occurrence were found in the notable drought years of 2001, 2007, and 2009. The largest correlations between DSI and soil moisture were attributed to the links between evapotranspiration and soil moisture. The spatial distribution of the correlation coefficients between DSI and soil moisture varied seasonally, tracking closely with the movement of rainfall belt. DSI could not reflect the variation of soil moisture in woodland. In grassland, DSI correlated with surface soil moisture in the east in the beginning of the growing season. As the rainfall belt expands to the west in the second half of the growing season, DSI reflected apparently deeper soil moisture conditions because of the spatial difference of soil properties, i.e., the water-holding capacity becomes larger from west to east.

TI  - Combination of remote sensing, GIS and palaeohydrologic remarks for promoting the exploitation of water resources in the Sahara: cases from the Red Sea Coast, Egypt
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The current work presents an integrated approach to maximize groundwater exploitation under Sahara conditions. The approach includes investigation of palaeohydrology, remote sensing data, field verification and geophysical datasets (gravity, aeromagnetic and geoloelectrical data). Results reveal the existence of palaeohydrologic remarks such as; palaeodriange, terraces, tufas, gorges and alluvial fans. The hydrogeological investigation reflects that the Quaternary groundwater existed under free water table conditions with water depths range between 5.06 and 50 m from the ground, while the Miocene aquifer has water depths vary between 22 m (of shallow wells) and 108 m (of deep wells). The study illustrates the presence of the tectonic fallen zones (TFZ) where the Precambrian rocks show throw down blocks associated with a set of faults and covered by thick sedimentary succession. The TFZ, with their faults (NW-SE and NE-SW), are attributed to the regional Red Sea rift, where these faults can provide groundwater recharge opportunities. The groundwater occurrences in the TFZ indicate saturation thickness ranges between 75 and 175 m for Miocene aquifer and between 50 and 180 m for Nubian sandstone aquifer. A total of 22 basins were analyzed where their morphometric parameters indicate the possibility of groundwater accumulations. The obtained stable isotopes compositions of hydrogen (delta D %) and oxygen (delta O-18 %) reveal that aquifers were recharged throughout the previous wetter climate with reasonable contributions during intervening arid periods. Due to the continued and urgent need for water in the Sahara, the obtained results can be utilized to develop applied recommendations for future groundwater exploration.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The overall goal of the present study was to evaluate and compare the existence of genotoxic damage in Rattus norvegicus captured in sites with different levels of chemical mixtures along the Matanza-Riachuelo river basin (MRRB). For this, thirty-six wild rats (R. norvegicus) were captured from six different sites in the MRRB. Capture sites were characterized with concentrations of 20 parameters in surface water, including concentrations of metals and its soluble state and physicochemical parameters. To evaluate genotoxic damage in the rats, the bone marrow micronucleus test was performed. For this, the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) was calculated based on the observation of 2000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) per animal. Also, to detect possible cytotoxic effects, the PCE/TE (total erythrocytes) ratio in 1000 erythrocytes/animal was calculated. The frequency of MNPCE was positively associated with the highest concentration of chrome, lead, copper, biological oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen demand. Also, the decrease on PCE/TE ratio in bone marrow was related with increase of practically all metals and physicochemical parameters in surface water. The results of this study reveal that rats that live in the MRRB were exposed to concentrations of pollutants that can cause genotoxic damage, even though the concentrations of these pollutants are mostly below the safety standards. Therefore, this work highlights the importance of using methods that allow to integrate all environmental parameters in risk assessment, such as sentinel species.

TI  - Potential for nocturnal satellite detection of suspended matter concentrations in coastal waters using a panchromatic band: a feasibility study based on VIIRS (NASA/NOAA) spectral and radiometric specifications
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of coastal waters is important for understanding the functioning of these complex ecosystems. High satellite revisit frequency is required to permit a relevant monitoring of the strong dynamical processes involved in such areas, for example rivers discharge or tidal currents. One key parameter that is derived from satellite data is the suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration. Knowledge of the variability of SPM could be used by sediment transport models for providing accurate predictions. Most of the current satellites that are dedicated to ocean color observations have a sun-synchronous orbit that performs a single daytime observation. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) ocean color sensor (NASA/NOAA) is the only one that is equipped with a panchromatic spectral band, so-called Day-Night Band, which is able to measure extremely low level signals, typically of the order of magnitude of 10(-5) W m(-2) sr(-1) mu m(-1). The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential of the panchromatic and radiometric specifications of the VIIRS sensor to detect SPM concentrations from nighttime satellite observations. Realistic radiative transfer simulations are performed to quantitatively determine the amplitude of the top of atmosphere radiances under various conditions such as various moon incident illuminations, observation geometries, atmospheric and oceanic turbidities. The simulations are compared with the minimum detectable radiance as specified for the VIIRS sensor. The results show that the detection of SPM is systematically feasible, including in clear waters, for any observation geometries in the case of a full moon illumination. The sensitivity of the results to the lunar phase (i.e., out of the full moon conditions), which is one of the originalities of the study, shows that the detection should also be feasible for a significant number of nights over the entire lunar cycle, typically from 5 to 15 nights depending on the water turbidity. Therefore, nighttime ocean color panchromatic measurements performed using a VIIRS-like sensor are a highly promising approach, especially if it is combined with daytime observations, for improving the monitoring of ocean dynamics.

TI  - Roles of a Mast Cell-Specific Receptor MRGPRX2 in Host Defense and Inflammation
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Mast cells are multifunctional immune cells that are found most abundantly at host-environment interfaces, such as the skin, respiratory tract, and oral/gastrointestinal mucosa. Not surprisingly, mast cells act as sentinel cells that sense microbial attacks and initiate a protective immune response and promote healing. Although mast cells share many features with other innate immune effector cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, they uniquely interact closely with blood vessels and release an extensive set of mediators for the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells. A novel human G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), known as Mas-related GPCR-X2 (MRGPRX2, mouse ortholog, MrgprB2), has recently been identified, which is expressed on mast cells but not neutrophils and macrophages. Interestingly, activation of MrgprB2 by bacteria-derived quorum-sensing peptides inhibits bacterial growth, prevents biofilm formation, and leads to the recruitment of neutrophils to effectively clear bacteria. Furthermore, host defense antimicrobial peptides and small-molecule peptide mimetics also activate mast cells via MRGPRX2/B2. MrgprB2-mediated activation of local mast cells also clears cutaneous bacterial infection, promotes healing, and protects against reinfection. In addition to their role in host defense, mast cells contribute to a number of chronic inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis, neurogenic inflammation, and inflammatory pain likely via the activation of MRGPRX2. In this review, we discuss the roles of MRGPRX2/B2 in the clearance of bacterial infection, wound healing, periodontal disease, neurogenic inflammation, and inflammatory pain. We propose that harnessing mast cells' host defense and immunomodulatory properties via the activation of MRGPRX2 may lead to novel approaches for the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections. On the other hand, increased MRGPRX2 expression on mast cells and their inappropriate activation may contribute to periodontitis, neurogenic inflammation, and inflammatory pain. Thus, targeting MRGPRX2 could provide novel approaches to modulate these conditions.

TI  - The value of Theodore Beza's inaugural address at the Geneva Academy for Christian Higher Education
T2  - EXPOSITORY TIMES
M3  - Article
AB  - At the founding of the Academy of Geneva, Theodore Beza was appointed rector, and he had to give the inaugural address. Beza's inaugural address provides a crucial window into the ideas of the founders of the Academy of Geneva. This Academy can rightly be regarded as one of the most influential instruments for the spread of the Reformation of the sixteenth century. Today, the founding and management of the Academy of Geneva serves as a valuable example for a deeper understanding of Christian higher education. Although today's curriculum, assessment and academic structures will not look like that of the Academy of Geneva, the principles are still as relevant as they were in the sixteenth century. Beza's short inaugural address provides an important window into the core principles of Christian higher education through the ages. Some of these core principles include creating a disciplined environment where students learn a Christian worldview, create a healthy learning culture while not losing sight of their duty to help reform society.

TI  - The 2-axis stress component decoupling of {100} c-Si by using oblique backscattering micro-Raman spectroscopy
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the application of strain engineering in microelectronics, complex stress states are introduced into advanced semiconductor devices. However, there is still a lack of effective metrology for the decoupling analysis of the complex stress states in semiconductor materials. This paper presents an investigation on the 2-axis stress component decoupling of {100} monocrystalline silicon (c-Si) by using oblique backscattering micro-Raman spectroscopy. A spectral-mechanical model was established, and two practicable methods for actual stress decoupling analyses were proposed. The verification experiments demonstrated the correctness and applicability of the methods proposed in this paper.

TI  - The unusual spin reorientation transition and exchange bias effect in Er<sub>0.6</sub>Dy<sub>0.4</sub>FeO<sub>3</sub> single crystal
T2  - APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, the single crystal Er0.6Dy0.4FeO3 (EDFO) was grown using optical floating-zone method. The magnetic behaviors of single crystal EDFO at low temperatures were systematically investigated. With lowering temperatures, an unusual spin reorientation transition could be observed. The transition was reasonably speculated as Gamma(3) (C-x, F-y, A(z)) -> Gamma(4) (G(x), A(y), F-z). Exchange bias effect could be found in the magnetization hysteresis loops, revealing the relationship of interaction between Fe3+ and R3+ (Dy3+ and Er3+) sublattices in EDFO single crystal. Additionally, when the magnetic field along the a-axis increased to 70 kOe, the magnetic phase transition took place at around 40 K, suggesting that an external field can trigger spin reorientation transition along a special axis. The features in single crystal EDFO have a significant potential in material physics and device application and provide insight into the magnetic structure and exchange bias for RFeO3 single crystals.

TI  - Integration of remote sensing, GIS and 2D resistivity methods in groundwater development
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - An integration of remote sensing, geographical information system (GIS) and 2D resistivity techniques was used to evaluate the groundwater potential of Obafemi Owode local government area (LGA) in Ogun State, southwestern Nigeria. A composite Landsat 7 image was used to produce land use and lineament of the study area. Advanced space-borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) data were used to generate slope and drainage density. The study adopted modified drastic model for groundwater potential, integrating six parameters which are land use, lineament density, slope, drainage density, geology and soil map. The contribution of each theme to groundwater potential was weighted and ranked using ArcGIS 10.2 software. The groundwater potential zone of the study area delineated five distinct zones which include very high (196.39 km(2)), high (334.64 km(2)), moderate (481.76 km(2)), low (298.46 km(2)) and very low (95.73 km(2)). Eight zones were delineated for further study. A total of 4.8 line km of 2D resistivity profiles were investigated in one of the designated zones labeled "area D" based on the groundwater potential map. Pole-dipole and dipole-dipole arrays used reveal five geoelectric layers within the study area. The 2D inverse models of resistivity variation with depth suggest the occurrence of potential carbonate and silicate aquifers. To verify the interpreted results within the "high" groundwater potential zone, a well was drilled on traverse 1. A potential water-bearing aquifer was encountered at a depth of 75 m. The groundwater potential map of the study area was tested with five existing wells, and the result was impressive. The outcomes from this study show that the high potential zones would play a key role in future expansion of drinking water and irrigation development in the study area.

TI  - Drainage network extraction and morphometric analysis in an Iranian basin using integrating factor analysis and geospatial techniques
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) in analyzing drainage basin morphometry, in conjunction with seismic events (focal mechanism) and associated tectonic influences, has been discussed less in the framework of existing geomorphometric studies. Hence, in this study, an integrated approach was designed combining the geomorphometric analysis with MSA, focal mechanism and associated structural lineaments (using a remote sensing and GIS framework) to address the role of active tectonism on the drainage network characteristics in Qorveh-Dehgolan basin located in western part of Iran (Kurdistan province). Eight watersheds were delineated from burnt ASTER DEM using SWAT model and categorized into high-altitude watersheds and low-altitude watersheds. Four-sets of the drainage network were extracted from satellite imageries (Landsat 7 and 8) over a period of 17 years (2000-2017) to monitor the temporal stream network behavior. Overall, nineteen morphometric parameters were calculated (and categorized into linear, aerial, and relief aspects) exhibiting significant changes in the drainage network from 2000 to 2017 (the stream order declined from 5th to 4th order). The higher-altitude watersheds showed various anomalies in the calculated indices (indicating the potential influence of tectonic activity), while the lower altitude watersheds did not exhibit any specific anomalies. In addition, higher concentration of longer lineaments was observed in areas where the relatively resistant, fractured bedrock lithology (meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary rocks) provided favorable conditions for origin and propagation of the lineaments. Further analysis of focal mechanism solutions (FMS, beachball diagrams) showed that the study area is primarily influenced by moderate earthquake events (3 <= Mw <= 6) and is influenced by a complex fault mechanism (primarily normal faults and strike slip faults). The morphometric parameters were further subjected to the factor analysis (principal axis factoring using Varimax rotation transformation) resulting in derivation of "factor of basin magnitude", "factor of steepness" and "factor of texture" as three principal factors impacting the drainage network. Finally, it was concluded that "factor of steepness" played a decisive role in defining hydrology of higher-altitude watersheds (an indication of tectonic influences in these watersheds) and thereby defining the overall hydrology of the study area as well. Overall, this study highlighted the significant role of the tectonic activity associated with structural lineaments and the seismic events in defining the nature and behavior of the drainage network and certain anomalies caused in the basin hydrology under these structural controls.

TI  - Principal component based fusion of land surface temperature (LST) and panchromatic (PAN) images
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial details of panchromatic (PAN) images are always higher than land surface temperature (LST) images. The main aim of this paper is to develop a fusion technique for PAN and LST images of the LANDSAT8 satellite. The key is to appropriately estimate the spatial details of the PAN images while preserving the LST image's thermal contents. The existing methods are incapable to fuse the thermal details of LST images while fully considering the PAN image's structure, resulting in inaccurate LST estimation and spectral distortion. Principal components (PC) of PAN-LST images can efficiently transfer the spatial details of the PAN image in the spectral information of the LST image. In this paper, a novel fusion algorithm has been proposed named as "intensity transformation fusion model" (ITFM), to downscale LST images using the PC1-PC4. The results have shown that the root mean square error of PAN fused LST images were minimum for PC1 (0.63 degrees C) and maximum for PC4 (1.04 degrees C), respectively. The proposed ITFM method has enhanced spatial resolution and visual distinctiveness of LST images as well as precisely preserved the LST data. The fusion algorithm would help in studies related to the detection of land cover's thermal emissions, thermal comfort monitoring, urban heat island effect analysis, and LST downscaling applications.

TI  - Monitoring soil salinization in Manas River Basin, Northwestern China based on multi-spectral index group
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale and accurate monitoring soil salinization is essential for controlling soil degradation and sustainable agricultural development. The agricultural irrigation area of the Manas River Basin in the arid area of Northwest China was selected as the test area. The soil salinization monitoring model based on spectral index group was constructed by comparing the accuracy of PCR, PLSR and MLR models using the transformation of multi-spectral index group and index screening. The results showed that there was a certain correlation between the 28 spectral index groups, with a maximum correlation coefficient -0.3689 between the original spectral group and the soil salt content was B10 band. After the transformation of original data for the logarithm Ln(R), exponential e(R) and square root R-1/2 respectively, the correlation between each index and soil salinity was significantly improved, with the maximum correlation coefficient was up to -0.7564 of R-1/2. The salt content estimation models were constructed by different data transformation using PLSR, PCR and MLR methods, respectively. This study provides a fast and accurate method for monitoring regional soil salinity content and the results can provide a reference for soil salinity grading management in arid and semi-arid areas.

TI  - Assessment and simulation of land use and land cover change impacts on the land surface temperature of Chaoyang District in Beijing, China
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization is changing the existing patterns of land use land cover (LULC) globally, which is consequently increasing the land surface temperature (LST) in many regions. The present study is focused on estimating current and simulating future LULC and LST trends in the urban environment of Chaoyang District, Beijing. Past patterns of LULC and LST were identified through the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method and multispectral Landsat satellite images during the 1990-2018 data period. The cellular automata (CA) and stochastic transition matrix of the Markov model were applied to simulate future (2025) LULC and LST changes, respectively, using their past patterns. The CA model was validated for the simulated and estimated LULC for 1990-2018, with an overall Kappa (K) value of 0.83, using validation modules in IDRISI software. Our results indicated that the cumulative changes in built-up to vegetation area were 74.61 km2 (16.08%) and 113.13 km2 (24.38%) from 1990 to 2018. The correlation coefficient of land use and land cover change (LULCC), including vegetation, water bodies and built-up area, had values of r = -0.155 (p > 0.005), -0.809 (p = 0.000), and 0.519 (p > 0.005), respectively. The results of future analysis revealed that there will be an estimated 164.92 km2 (-12%) decrease in vegetation area, while an expansion of approximately 283.04 km2 (6% change) will occur in built-up areas from 1990 to 2025. This decrease in vegetation cover and expansion of settlements would likely cause a rise of approximately similar to 10.74 degrees C and similar to 12.66 degrees C in future temperature, which would cause a rise in temperature (2025). The analyses could open an avenue regarding how to manage urban land cover patterns to enhance the resilience of cities to climate warming. This study provides scientific insights for environmental development and sustainability through efficient and effective urban planning and management in Beijing and will also help strengthen other research related to the UHI phenomenon in other parts of the world.

TI  - A machine-learning-based cloud detection and thermodynamic-phase classification algorithm using passive spectral observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We trained two Random Forest (RF) machine learning models for cloud mask and cloud thermodynamic-phase detection using spectral observations from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP). Observations from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) were carefully selected to provide reference labels. The two RF models were trained for all-day and daytime-only conditions using a 4-year collocated VIIRS and CALIOP dataset from 2013 to 2016. Due to the orbit difference, the collocated CALIOP and SNPP VIIRS training samples cover a broad-viewing zenith angle range, which is a great benefit to overall model performance. The allday model uses three VIIRS infrared (IR) bands (8.6, 11, and 12 mu m), and the daytime model uses five Near-IR (NIR) and Shortwave-IR (SWIR) bands (0.86, 1.24, 1.38, 1.64, and 2.25 mu m) together with the three IR bands to detect clear, liquid water, and ice cloud pixels. Up to seven surface types, i.e., ocean water, forest, cropland, grassland, snow and ice, barren desert, and shrubland, were considered separately to enhance performance for both models. Detection of cloudy pixels and thermodynamic phase with the two RF models was compared against collocated CALIOP products from 2017. It is shown that, when using a conservative screening process that excludes the most challenging cloudy pixels for passive remote sensing, the two RF models have high accuracy rates in comparison to the CALIOP reference for both cloud detection and thermodynamic phase. Other existing SNPP VIIRS and Aqua MODIS cloud mask and phase products are also evaluated, with results showing that the two RF models and the MODIS MYD06 optical property phase product are the top three algorithms with respect to lidar observations during the daytime. During the nighttime, the RF all-day model works best for both cloud detection and phase, particularly for pixels over snow and ice surfaces. The present RF models can be extended to other similar passive instruments if training samples can be collected from CALIOP or other lidars. However, the quality of reference labels and potential sampling issues that may impact model performance would need further attention.

TI  - Deep learning-based rapid recognition of oasis-desert ecotone plant communities using UAV low-altitude remote-sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The oasis-desert ecotone plant community is a protective barrier for an oasis. With the continuous expansion of oasis ecosystems and gradual increases in the intensity of human activities, the degradation of plant communities in oasis-desert ecotones has become increasingly prominent. Timely and accurate detection of such degradation is a prerequisite for vegetation restoration. Currently, vegetation information extraction has been primarily based on an analysis of spectral features; however, the vegetation coverage area and the soil background are easily confused. In addition, conventional supervised classification methods have a strong dependence on the training samples, and this technique can fail due to the complicated image processing procedure, relatively lower recognition ability, and optimal threshold determination for a multi-temporal image. In this study, the aim was to accurately extract the plant community features, distribution area, and the image background using two automatic recognition algorithm models known as the convolution neural network (CNN)-based VGG16 and VGG19 models. These models were used to investigate an oasis-desert ecotone in an arid area using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote-sensing image. Additionally, the impacts of a change in the training sample size on the automatic classification accuracy of the models were evaluated. The results showed that the size of the training samples has a significant impact on the classification accuracy, and with an increase in the sample sizes, the generalization ability of the models gradually improved. The modeling accuracy of the VGG16 and VGG19 increased from 88.25% and 95.25% to 88.50% and 96.73%, respectively. The classification accuracy of the VGG16 model varied from 79.6 to 93.8%, and the classification accuracy of VGG19 model varied from 82.3 to 95.6%. The size of the training samples was 300, so both models presented the best classification results. Compared with the conventional supervised classification methods, the deep learning algorithm-based models yielded significantly higher classification accuracies. These models can provide technical support for the realization of the unsupervised automatic classification of oasis-desert ecotone plant communities in arid areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background Defining the start and assessing the intensity of influenza seasons are essential to ensure timely preventive and control measures and to contribute to the pandemic preparedness. The present study aimed to determine the epidemic and intensity thresholds of influenza season in Tunisia using the moving epidemic method.Methods We applied the moving epidemic method (MEM) using the R Language implementation (package "mem"). We have calculated the epidemic and the different intensity thresholds from historical data of the past nine influenza seasons (2009-2010 to 2017-2018) and assessed the impact of the 2009-2010 pandemic year. Data used were the weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) proportions compared with all outpatient acute consultations. The goodness of the model was assessed using a cross validation procedure.Results The average duration of influenza epidemic during a typical season was 20 weeks and ranged from 11 weeks (2009-2010 season) to 23 weeks (2015-2016 season). The epidemic threshold with the exclusion of the pandemic season was 6.25%. It had a very high sensitivity of 85% and a high specificity of 69%. The different levels of intensity were established as follows: low, if ILI proportion is below 9.74%, medium below 12.05%; high below 13.27%; and very high above this last rate.Conclusions This is the first mathematically based study of seasonal threshold of influenza in Tunisia. As in other studies in different countries, the model has shown both good specificity and sensitivity, which allows timely and accurate detection of the start of influenza seasons. The findings will contribute to the development of more efficient measures for influenza prevention and control.

TI  - Does mangrove plantation reduce coastal erosion? Assessment from the west coast of India
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are believed to stabilize the coastlines by controlling erosion and facilitating sediment deposition. Coastal managers often plant mangroves to counter coastal erosion. The state of Gujarat in West India has planted thousands of hectares of mangroves over the years, and control of coastal erosion has been one of the prime reasons of plantation. This study performed a statistical assessment of the effect of the planted mangroves on the coastline changes in the state from 1990 to 2013. The study utilized geographic information system and remote sensing data to demarcate the areas under erosion and accretion during this period, and then compared these changes with the change in mangrove cover using statistical models. This cross-sectional analysis was conducted at the level of a tehsil, an administrative unit below a district. The results show that mangrove plantation did not decrease erosion, not even after normalizing the coastline changes by the length of the coastline and using controls for physical and anthropogenic features of the tehsils. Tehsils with increased mangrove cover witnessed both increased erosion and accretion, although the latter was much higher. The geophysical features of the area appeared to be the main determinants of coastline changes in Gujarat.

TI  - Spatial and temporal effects of drought on Chinese vegetation under different coverage levels
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface vegetation dynamics are strongly affected by drought. Thus, understanding the responses of vegetation to drought can inform measures to increase biome stability. In this study, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) were utilized to investigate the relationship between vegetation activity and drought across different drought regions and ecological community types from 1982 to 2015. Our results showed that the highest correlation between monthly NDVI and PDSI at different timescales (1-36 months) indicated the degree of drought impact on vegetation. There were diverse responses of vegetation to drought according to the drought features and dimatic environment. The northern grassland, cropland, and desert ecosystems were strongly impacted by drought. These vegetation ecosystems had a low sensitivity to drought in southern China. Drought had the strongest impact on grassland in summer, which is the high frequency drought season. The most susceptible ecosystem types to drought were those with homogenous vegetation, especially under long-term drought conditions (such as the Inner Mongolia Plateau dominated by grassland). Under global warming, drought with high-temperature characteristics is expected to become more frequent and severe. Such drought could threaten the survival of plateau grassland, arid plain grassland, and rain-fed cropland, as high temperatures accelerate evaporation, leading to water deficit. However, moist forests showed little threat under normal drought. We suggest that future research should focus on vegetation activity in northern and southwestern China, where the vegetation shows the greatest sensitivity to drought. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Quantitative study on the cooling effect of green roofs in a high-density urban Area-A case study of Xiamen, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Green roofs are thought to be an effective measure to solve the contradiction between land shortages and ecological construction, especially address urban heat island (UHI) effects in high-density urban areas. However, few empirical studies have focused on the cooling effect of green roof projects at urban scales. This study quantified the cooling effect of green roofs in Xiamen Island, China, where 540,000 m(2) of green roofs were implemented between 2015 and 2017, in order to address the two research questions: (1) do green roofs in high-density urban areas have a significant cooling effect at the city scale and (2) what is the extent of the cooling? The relative difference between the average land surface temperature (LST) of Xiamen Island and the green roofs stemmed from Landsat 8 remote sensing image in the summers of 2014 and 2017 were calculated in geographic information systems (GIS) to represent the cooling effect of green roof project. Results showed that: (1) the average LST difference between green roofs and Xiamen Island decreased by 0.91 degrees C, indicating that green roofs could effectively alleviate UHI effects in high-density urban areas; (2) The cooling effect was significant up to 100 m from the green roof installation in Xiamen Island, we called it as characteristic cooling buffer zone; (3) Regression analysis revealed that for every 1000 m(2) increase in green roof area, the average LST of the roof and its characteristic cooling buffer zone decreased by 0.4 degrees C. These findings provide the empirical proof for the cooling effect of green roofs on the surrounding environment in high-density urban areas and important insights for urban planners and government agencies for the effective mitigation of UHI impacts.

TI  - Retrieval of Snow Grain Size and Albedo Using Two Radiative Transfer Models
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A method combining the asymptotic radiative transfer (ART) theory and discrete ordinate radiative transfer (DISORT) method is proposed in this study to retrieve the snow spectral albedo. First, based on the assumption that snow grain shape is the second generation Koch fractals, snow grain size results arc retrieved using different satellite data and three methods derived from the ART theory. The average results, although different, arc all close to 50 tom Second, assuming the snow grains arc spherical, snow spectral albedo is calculated using the DISORT model in the 0.3 -5.0 -p.m region based on the retrieved snow grain size results. Snow black-sky and whitesky spectral albedo arc calculated using the ART theory in the 0.3 -1.5-mu m region. The small difference between the two types of snow spectral albedo calculated through the two radiation transfer models in the 0. 3-1. 5-mu m region reveals that the assumption of different snow grain shapes is reasonable. The method combining the two radiation transfer models can calculate the snow albedo of the solar spectrum. Finally, the snow spectral albedo calculation using DISORT model also considers the light-absorbing impurities such as black carbon. The study area is located in northeast border proximity to Siberia demarks region, where the impurities have a very limited influence on snow spectral albedo. While in the northeast area, which is heavily industrialized, the impurities can markedly decrease

T2  - Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the epidemiological characteristics of leptospirosis in Sichuan province from 2004 to 2018, and provide evidence for the prevention and control of leptospirosis. Methods: The descriptive epidemiology analysis was conducted based on the epidemic data of leptospirosis collected from the national notifiable infectious disease reporting information system (NNIDRIS) and sentinel surveillance system in 11 areas in Sichuan from 2004 to 2018. The ArcGIS 10.2 software was used for mapping. The SaTScan 9.1.1 software was used to analyze spatiotemporal scanning and characteristics of temporal-spatial clusters of leptospirosis. Results: A total of 2 834 cases of leptospirosis, including 41 deaths, were reported in Sichuan from 2004 to 2018, and the reported morbidity rate was 0.23/100 000 and the mortality rate was 0.003/100 000. It revealed that leptospirosis had an overall downward fluctuated trend. The incidence of leptospirosis had obvious seasonality, mainly from the last ten-day of August to the end of September, 1-2 weeks later after rice harvesting time. The reported cases were mainly males, the male to female ratio of the cases was 2.05∶1. The incidence was higher in age group 50-65 years. The majority of reported cases were farmers, accounting for 82.75% (2 345/2 834), followed by students, accounting for 12.74% (361/2 834). However, rare cases in students had been reported since 2011. In recent years, the high-incidence areas were alternating between Mabian, Muchuan counties along the Yangtze River and Yilong county located in the Jialing River basin. According to the spatial-temporal descriptive analyses by SaTScan, there were two clustering areas in the province where most cases occurred (P<0.001). The average density of field rats in 11 sentinel surveillance areas was 5.44%(14 351/263 767), and the predominant field rats included Anourosorexsquamipes (69.07%), Apodemusagrarius (12.73%). Whatmore, the density of the Apodemusagrarius ranged from 4.60% to 0.19%, showing downward trend with the lowest level in 2018. The annual culture rate of Leptospira from rat kidney samples declined. During 2007-2018, the average positive rate of Leptospira antibodies in healthy people was 24.52%(3 271/13 339), and the predominant serogroup was Icterohaemorrhagiae. There was no replacement of Leptospira serogroup in recent years. Conclusions: The incidence of leptospirosis in Sichuan was extremely low during 2004-2018, and the incidence peak of leptospirosis occurred in rice harvesting period. The cases were mainly old farmers, and the high-risk areas were constantly alternating between the Yangtzi River and the Jialing River basin. Both the density and the carriage rate of Leptospira of Apodemusagrarius were low, and the predominant serogroup was Icterohaemorrhagiae. The average positive rate of leptospira antibodies in healthy people was very low.

TI  - Factors Affecting Sentinel Node Metastasis in Thin (T1) Cutaneous Melanomas: Development and External Validation of a Predictive Nomogram
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE Thin melanomas (T1; <= 1 mm) constitute 70% of newly diagnosed cutaneous melanomas. Regional node metastasis determined by sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is an important prognostic factor for T1 melanoma. However, current melanoma guidelines do not provide clear indications on when to perform SNB in T1 disease and stress an individualized approach to SNB that considers all clinicopathologic risk factors. We aimed to identify determinants of sentinel node (SN) status for incorporation into an externally validated nomogram to better select patients with T1 disease for SNB.PATIENTS AND METHODS The development cohort comprised 3,666 patients with T1 disease consecutively treated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori (Milan, Italy) between 2001 and 2018; 4,227 patients with T1 disease treated at 13 other European centers over the same period formed the validation cohort. A random forest procedure was applied to the development data set to select characteristics associated with SN status for inclusion in a multiple binary logistic model from which a nomogram was elaborated. Decision curve analyses assessed the clinical utility of the nomogram.RESULTS Of patients in the development cohort, 1,635 underwent SNB; 108 patients (6.6%) were SN positive. By univariable analysis, age, growth phase, Breslow thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate, regression, and lymphovascular invasion were significantly associated with SN status. The random forest procedure selected 6 variables (not growth phase) for inclusion in the logistic model and nomogram. The nomogram proved well calibrated and had good discriminative ability in both cohorts. Decision curve analyses revealed the superior net benefit of the nomogram compared with each individual variable included in it as well as with variables suggested by current guidelines.CONCLUSION We propose the nomogram as a decision aid in all patients with T1 melanoma being considered for SNB.

TI  - A study of subsidence hotspots by mapping vulnerability indices through innovatory 'ALPRIFT' using artificial intelligence at two levels
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Declining groundwater levels due to the absence of a planning system makes aquifers vulnerable to subsidence. This paper investigates possible hotspots in terms of Subsidence Vulnerability Indices (SVI) by applying the ALPRIFT framework, introduced recently by the authors by mirroring the procedure for the DRASTIC framework. ALPRIFT is suitable to cases, where data is sparse, and is the acronym of seven data layers to be presented in due course. It is a scoring technique, in which each data layer bears an aspect of land subsidence and is prescribed with rates to account for local variability, and with prescribed weights to account for relative significance of the data layer. The inherent subjectivity in prescribed weights is treated in this paper by learning their values from site-specific data by the strategy of using artificial intelligence to learn from multiple models (AIMM). The strategy has two levels: (i) at Level 1, three fuzzy models are used to learn weight values from the local data and from observed target data, and (ii) at Level 2, genetic expression algorithm (GEP) is used to learn further, in which the outputs of the models at Level 1 are reused as its inputs and observed data as its target values. The results show that (i) the Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) coefficient for ALPRIFT with measured land subsidence values is approx. 0.21; (ii) NSE is improved to 0.88 by learning the weights at Level 1 using fuzzy logic, and (iii) NSE is further improved to 0.94 by further learning at Level 2 using GEP.

TI  - Comparative study on the monocycle of <i>Phakopsora meliosmae-myrianthae</i> and <i>Phakopsora pachyrhizi</i>
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Asian grapevine leaf rust, caused by Phakopsora meliosmae-myrianthae, presents symptoms similar to Asian soybean rust, caused by P. pachyrhizi, such as the presence of satellite uredinia and early leaf fall. To shed light on the epidemiological behaviour of these rusts, we compared the monocyclic components of these Phakopsora species and the effects of these pathogens on host photosynthesis over time. Both hosts were inoculated with a 10(4) urediniospores mL(-1) suspension and incubated at 23-25 degrees C. Incubation and latent periods were simultaneous at 8 days in Asian grapevine leaf rust and 13 days in Asian soybean rust. The minimum infectious periods were 21 days for P. meliosmae-myrianthae and 13 days for P. pachyrhizi. The continuous production of urediniospores through a long infectious period was observed for both pathogens. Both Phakopsora rusts showed an increase in rust severity with similar progress rates to those estimated with the monomolecular model as 0.07 day(-1) and 0.02 day(-1) for grapevine and soybean rusts, respectively. No increase in the number of lesions was observed from the first assessment, although the number of uredinia increased over time. P. meliosmae-myrianthae and P. pachyrhizi infection reduced the net photosynthetic rates by 22% and 5%, respectively, before the onset of symptoms. Both pathogens withstand non-ideal environmental conditions for secondary infections. We concluded that, although P. meliosmae-myrianthae has a restricted host range on Vitis sp., unlike to P. pachyrhizi with a broad host range, the epidemiological behaviour of P. meliosmae-myrianthae is in some ecological aspects similar to that of P. pachyrhizi.

TI  - Insights into riverscape dynamics with the hydrological, ecological and social dimensions for water sustenance
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal patterns of four neighbouring river-scapes in the central Western Ghats, India through land-use analyses using temporal remote sensing data (1973, 2018), reveal a decline in evergreen forests (41%) and fragmentation of intact or contiguous forests (60%). Hydro-ecological footprint illustrates that catchment integrity plays a decisive role in sustaining water for societal and ecological needs. This is evident from the occurrence of perennial streams in the catchment dominated by native flora with forest cover greater than 60%, highlighting the riverscape dynamics with hydrological, ecological, social and environmental dimension linkages and water sustainability. This helps in evolving strategies to adopt integrated watershed management to sustain anthropogenic and environmental water demand.

TI  - Updated information on soil salinity in a typical oasis agroecosystem and desert-oasis ecotone: Case study conducted along the Tarim River, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise and spatially explicit regional estimates of soil salinity are necessary to efficiently management and utilise limited land and water resources. Despite advances achieved in remote sensing over the past century, knowledge about the distribution and severity of soil salinization in economically important areas, such as oasis agroecosystems and desert-oasis ecotones (OADoE), is currently limited. An example of an area is southern Xinjiang, where the OADoE has a high anthropogenic influence. This study was conducted with the aim of mapping soil salinity in typical OADoE using remote sensing and machine learning techniques (Cubist and Random Forest, RF). A range of covariates was obtained from the multi-temporal Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) satellite for the period from 2013 to 2018. The values of coefficients of determination (R-2), Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, root mean square error, and relative root mean squared error values, were 0.78, 0.87, 9.59, and 0.76, respectively, for the Cubist and 0.78, 0.86, 9.79, and 0.78, respectively, for RF models. The slope of the linear fitting equation was higher for the Cubist model (0.75) than for RF (0.69). The explanatory power of Cubist and RF for soil salinity variation were 33.22% and 31.41% in the agroecosystem, and 72.25% and 71.66% in desert-oasis ecotone, respectively. For the agroecosystem, the range of the predicted values for 89.13% (Cubist) and 84.78% (RF) of sample was controlled within the same observational range at an interval of 0-5 dS m(-1). Compared to single-year data (from 2013 to( )2018), the ability to account for model spatial variability in soil salinity based on multi-year Landsat images was increased by 16%-35%. According to the variable importance evaluation, soil-related indices are the most important predictor variables, followed by vegetation, topography, landform, and land use, with relative importance values of 60%, 21%, 16%, and 3%, respectively. The predicted map was also broadly consistent with those obtained for Xinjiang in the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) from the second national soil survey of China conducted from 1984 to 1997. The results also showed that the average value of the study area is 8.10 dS m(-1) based on the Cubist-based map whereas that of the HWSD is 10.60 dS m(-1), this implied that the overall salinity level has reduced by 23.58%. The methodological framework presented covers all prediction process steps and has considerable potential to be used in future soil salinity mapping at large scales for other similar region as OADoEs. The map derived from the Cubist/RF model revealed more detailed variation information about spatial distribution of the soil salinity compared to HWSD, and can further assist with decision-making when planning and utilising on existing soil and water resources in OADoEs.

TI  - On-Board Absolute Radiometric Calibration and Validation Based on Solar Diffuser of HY-1C SCS
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the solar diffuser of the satellite calibration spectrometer (SCS), we establish an absolute radiometric calibration model. We can obtain the absolute radiometric calibration coefficient of SCS by processing the on-board diffuser calibration data obtained on December 12, 2018. The radiometric calibration coefficient of SCS is cross-validated thrice using TERRA MODIS, which is used as the reference load. In order to improve the accuracy of spectral matching and to eliminate the difference in spectra setting, the measured equivalent radiance of SCS is interpolated to obtain the spectral radiance, and subsequently the obtained results arc integrated with the spectral response function of TERRA MODIS to obtain the predicted equivalent radiance. The comparison results show that the predicted equivalent radiance of each band of MODIS is in consistency with the measured equivalent radiance and the maximum relative deviation is 2. 78%, which indicates that the SCS radiometric calibration coefficient is reliable and has a high calibration accuracy. It is verified that the parameters such as bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF) and transmittance have relatively high test precision.

TI  - Estimating burn severity and carbon emissions from a historic megafire in boreal forests of China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires, especially those of large size, worsen air quality and alter the carbon cyde through combustion of large quantities of biomass and release of carbon into the atmosphere. The Black Dragon fire, which occurred in 1987 in the boreal forests of China is among the top five of such megafires ever recorded in the world. With over 30 years of accumulation of data and availability of new greenhouse gas emission accounting methods, carbon emissions from this megafire can now be estimated with improved precision and greater spatial resolution. To do this, we combined field and remote sensing data to map four burn severity classes and calculated combustion efficiency in terms of the biomass immediately consumed in the fire. Results of the study showed that 1.30 million hectares burned and 52% of that area burned with high severity. The emitted carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e), accounted for approximately 10% of total fossil fuel emissions from China in 1987, along with CO (2%-3% of annual anthropogenic CO emissions from China) and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) contributing to the atmospheric pollutants. Our study provides an important basis for carbon emission estimation and understanding the impacts of megafires. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impacts of post-harvest open biomass burning and burning ban policy on severe haze in the Northeastern China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Open filed biomass burning is a major contributor to airborne particulate matter and reactive trace gases during the post-harvest season in the Northeastern China. Due to prevailing weather conditions and high emission density, this region is prone to the accumulation of air pollutants that often leads to severe haze events. In this study, we combined satellite and ground observations, and a regional air quality modeling system to quantify the con- tribution of open biomass burning to surface PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 mu m), concen- trations during a severe haze episode. During this period (November 1st - 4th 2015), the average PM2.5 concentrations in Heilong-jiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces reached 116.98 mu g/m(3), 98.60 mu g/m(3), and 70.17 mu g/m(3) respectively. Model simulations showed that open biomass burning contributed to 52.7% of PM2.5 concentrations over Northeast China. Using the differences in active fire spots as detected by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suites (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi-NPP, we estimated that the burning ban enforced in 2018 have caused the PM2.5 concentrations to decrease from the 2015 level by 67.10%, 53.23%, and 10.06% in the Heilong-jiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces respectively. Over the region, the burning ban proved to be effective in reducing fire emissions and lowering region-wide PM2.5 concentration by 48.1% during the post-harvest season. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Scales of justice: putting remembrance back on the map in Palestine and Mi'kma'ki
T2  - SETTLER COLONIAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper considers two remarkable efforts to counter the repressive effects of 'colonial cartography': the Nakba map project in Israel, and the Ta'n Weji-sqalia'tiek Mi'kmaw Place Names Digital Atlas and Website Project in Mi'kma'ki (Nova Scotia, Canada). Undertaken by the Israeli NGO Zochrot ('remembering' in Hebrew), the Nakba 'counter-mapping' project seeks to challenge settler foundation myths utilized to perpetuate ongoing oppression. The Ta'n Weji-sqalia'tiek Mi'kmaw Place Names project deploys cartographic revelation - the recovery of erased place names - as a mode of cultural reclamation, confronting settlers with the natural and human realities of the 'world' they 'discovered.' In addition, by delineating the legends and lore encoded and embedded in those place names, the project helps place the Mi'kmaw language and worldview back 'on the map' of remembrance and dialogue. Linkages between the two examples of settler occupation are highlighted through a consideration of the ways the Canadian government assists with the ongoing oppression of Palestine, as well as the ways Palestinian-Indigenous solidarity efforts seek to resist entrenched settler-centric narratives (mental maps). The case studies are presented as part of a necessarily larger, on-going effort to give voice to those long silenced by the hegemonic 'truth' of settler societies.

TI  - Geographical differences in habitat relationships of cetaceans across an ocean basin
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The distributions of highly mobile marine species such as cetaceans are increasingly modeled at basin scale by combining data from multiple regions. However, these basin-wide models often overlook geographical variations in species habitat relationships between regions. We tested for geographical variations in habitat relationships for a suite of cetacean taxa between the two sides of the North Atlantic basin. Using cetacean visual survey data and remote sensing data from the western and eastern basin in summer, we related the probability of presence of twelve cetacean taxa from three guilds to seafloor depth, sea surface temperature and primary productivity. In a generalized additive model framework, we fitted 1) basin-wide (BW) models, assuming a single global relationship, 2) region-specific intercepts (RI) models, assuming relationships with the same shape in both regions, but allowing a region-specific intercept and 3) region-specific shape (RS) models, assuming relationships with different shapes between regions. RS models mostly yielded significantly better fits than BW models, indicating cetacean occurrences were better modeled with region-specific than with global relationships. The better fits of RS models over RI models further provided statistical evidence for differences in the shapes of region-specific relationships. Baleen whales showed striking differences in both the shapes of relationships and their mean presence probabilities between regions. Deep diving whales and delphinoids showed contrasting relationships between regions with few exceptions (e.g. non-statistically different shapes of region-specific relationships for harbor porpoise and beaked whales with depth). Our findings stress the need to account for geographical differences in habitat relationships between regions when modeling species distributions from combined data at the basin scale. Our proposed hypotheses offer a roadmap for understanding why habitat relationships may geographically vary in cetaceans and other highly mobile marine species.

TI  - Spatial interpolation of urban air temperatures using satellite-derived predictors
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperatures in urban environments are usually obtained from sparse weather stations that provide limited information with regard to spatial patterns. Effective methods that predict air temperatures (T-air) in urban areas are based on statistical models which utilize remotely sensed and geographic data. This work aims to compute T-air predictions for diurnal and nocturnal time intervals using predictive models that do not exploit information on Land Surface Temperatures. The models are developed based on explanatory variables that describe the urban morphology, land cover and terrain, aggregated at 100 m x 100 m resolution, combined with in situ T-air measurements from urban meteorological stations. The case study is the urban and per-urban area of Heraklion, Greece, where a dense meteorological station network is available since 2016. Moran's eigenvector filtering and an autoregressive moving average residual specification are implemented to account for spatial and temporal correlations. The statistical models display satisfactory predictive performance, with mean annual Mean Absolute Error (MAE) equal to 0.36 degrees C, 0.34 degrees C, 0.42 degrees C and 0.54 degrees C, for 11:00-12:00, 14:00-15:00, 22:00-23:00 and 02:00-03:00 (UTC + 2), respectively. The minimum (maximum) MAE for the estimated datasets is 0.22 degrees C (0.81 degrees C). The mean annual MAE for all T-air interpolations is 0.42 degrees C, the mean annual Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is 0.49 degrees C and the mean annual bias < 0.01 degrees C. The time intervals of the analysed measurements coincide with the acquisition times of MODIS and Copernicus Sentinel 3 over Heraklion; hence, the derived estimates can be used in future spaceborne calculations of urban energy budget parameters.

TI  - Monitoring mining-induced subsidence by integrating differential radar interferometry and persistent scatterer techniques
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface subsidence is a dominant component of the displacement vector triggered by underground mining. Over the last few decades, Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) has been used to efficiently monitor this phenomenon with great spatial and temporal coverage. More advanced multi-temporal DInSAR (MTInSAR) algorithms have been proposed to overcome some of the limitations of conventional DInSAR. However, advanced MTInSAR approaches are also not perfect in terms of measuring mining subsidence (e.g., temporal decorrelation, ambiguity, nonlinearity). For this reason, we propose a fusion of the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSInSAR) and DInSAR results. By combining these complementary techniques, the atmospheric errors in PSInSAR data are reduced and larger deformation rates could have been detected more accurately (thanks to DInSAR) than by an approach solely based on PS-InSAR. This allows to measure areas with fast-moving subsidence (1 m/year) due to ongoing underground coal exploitation. Data from ascending and descending orbits of Sentinel-1A\B were used to obtain the vertical deformation component. The resulting integrated vertical deformation map was compared with the results from levelling benchmarks. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) calculated based on this comparison was 22 mm. Moreover, the maximal vertical cumulative subsidence detected in the study area was 1.05 m/year.

TI  - Are soft tissues of urban rats good indicators of exposure to heavy metal pollution? A study conducted in one of the most polluted basins of Buenos Aires, Argentina
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The overall goal of this work was to analyze the relationship between the concentration of lead in the kidney, liver, and stomach contents of rats captured in a polluted urban basin and the concentration of this metal in the environment, meteorological factors, and different intrinsic characteristics of the individuals. To this end, we determined the concentration of lead in the kidney, liver, and stomach contents of 133 Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) captured in the Matanza-Riachuelo River Basin (Buenos Aires, Argentina). This basin is one of the most severe cases of water pollution in Latin America and metals like lead represent the most common chemical pollutants. Rats were trapped in nine sites with different soil and water lead concentrations, between 2014 and 2015. A positive relationship was found between lead concentration in the liver and kidney of R. norvegicus and the environmental concentration of this metal in water and soil. Although the remaining variables analyzed were also related to the lead concentration in soft tissues, they did not affect the association between the lead concentration in soft tissues and that in the environment. The lead concentration in the stomach contents was not related to any of the variables analyzed. Our results constitute the first study in an urban basin with a gradient of environmental lead concentration and suggest that the quantification of lead in the kidney and liver of rats can be used as an indicator of exposure to this metal within a large city.

TI  - Performance evaluation of satellite precipitation estimation with ground monitoring stations over southern Himalayas in Bhutan
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution remote sensing-based hydro-meteorological data products are being increasingly used for various scientific studies throughout the world. As such, it is important to evaluate the quality of the data retrieved by the means of remote-sensing especially for the regions characterized by the drastic variation of topography such as the Himalayas. This work focuses on the comparison and evaluation of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA-3B43v7) with point-based ground observations recorded by Department of Hydro-Met Services (DHMS) in Bhutan. For this study, 32 rain gauge stations over Southern Himalayas in Bhutan (SHB) were selected and precipitation data for a period of 19 years (from 1998 to 2017) were compared with the TRMM precipitation product. The comparison revealed that the coefficient of correlation between satellite data and ground observation is statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Furthermore, the coefficient of correlation is near unity in some stations and an average of 0.814 over the entire SHB region for 19 years. This finding imparts that the TRMM can capture the rainfall trend over the SHB. As per the findings, the average root-mean-square error was 219.1 mm per month considering the entire duration and 344.7 mm per month considering only the rainy season. Similarly, the average Bias was computed at 0.27 for all seasons and 0.32 for the rainy season, indicating TRMM underestimates the precipitation over SHB. The satellite estimate provides a piece of good information on the distribution of rainfall over the SHB. Nevertheless, it is still advisable to correct the bias of the satellite product, as the relative root-mean-square error is larger than 50% for 96% of the evaluated stations.

TI  - A Bitter Taste in Your Heart
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The human genome contains similar to 29 bitter taste receptors (T2Rs), which are responsible for detecting thousands of bitter ligands, including toxic and aversive compounds. This sentinel function varies between individuals and is underpinned by naturally occurring T2R polymorphisms, which have also been associated with disease. Recent studies have reported the expression of T2Rs and their downstream signaling components within non-gustatory tissues, including the heart. Though the precise role of T2Rs in the heart remains unclear, evidence points toward a role in cardiac contractility and overall vascular tone. In this review, we summarize the extra-oral expression of T2Rs, focusing on evidence for expression in heart; we speculate on the range of potential ligands that may activate them; we define the possible signaling pathways they activate; and we argue that their discovery in heart predicts an, as yet, unappreciated cardiac physiology.

AB  - The shoreline is constantly under the influence of physical elements, such as geomorphological events, earthquakes, and tectonic movements. In recent years, it has been changing due to the intensive use of coasts and the impact of human factors on coastal areas. This study's aim was to analyze the coastal change in the Gulf of Izmit, Turkey, using satellite images from different dates. In this context, coastal changes were analyzed in a 95% confidence interval by the end point rate (EPR), linear regression rate (LRR), and weighted linear regression (WLR) statistical methods, after the automatic extraction of shorelines from Landsat satellite images of 17 periods belonging to different dates between 1975 and 2017 in four different scenarios. Furthermore, the effects of the destructive earthquake (Mw, 7.4), which caused the loss of many lives and property in the Gulf of Izmit on August 17, 1999, were also examined in detail.

TI  - Adverse events of interest vary by influenza vaccine type and brand: Sentinel network study of eight seasons (2010-2018)
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Influenza contributes significantly to the burden of disease worldwide; the United Kingdom has a policy of vaccination across all ages. Influenza vaccinations are known to be associated with common minor adverse events of interest (AEIs). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommends ongoing surveillance of AEIs following influenza vaccination to monitor common and detect infrequent but important AEIs.Methods: A retrospective cohort study using computerised medical record data from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) sentinel network database 2010-2018 (N = 848,375). We extracted data about vaccine exposure (n = 3,121,334) and consultations for AEIs within seven days of receiving vaccinations specified by the EMA (1,488,870 consultations by 430,029 unique individuals). We used a self-case series design which employs a likelihood estimation method using conditioning of observed adverse events. Such a model assumes non-homogenous Poisson intensity processes for each exposure period and age interval. We compared AEI between QIV and TIV reporting relative incidence (RI) of AEIs. A RI < 1 signified lower AEI rate compared to TIV.Results: QIV was associated with a RI of AEIs of 1.14 (95%CI, 1.10-1.18, p < 0.01), though the number of years exposure was limited. By way of contrast, LAIV had a lower rate 0.60 (95%CI 0.63-0.68, p < 0.001). Cellular manufacture was also associated with a lower rate 0.78 (95%CI 0.61-0.99, p = 0.04). AEIs varied by season: Rash and musculoskeletal conditions are particularly pronounced in the 2014/15 season and respiratory conditions in 2016/17. In an analysis of all seasons, we found an elevated relative incidence of AEIs of 1.78 (95%CI, 1.62-1.95) in pregnant women and 1.76 (95%CI, 1.56 - 1.99) in children under 5 years.Conclusion: Routine sentinel network data can be used to contrast AEIs between vaccine types and may provide a consistent method of observation of vaccine benefit-risk over time.

AB  - For tourism to be entirely sustainable, one cannot travel. This is impossible. This paradox is particularly evident within last chance tourism (LCT), where tourists, seeking experiences with vanishing animals and land/seascapes, can accelerate the decline of those very attractions. Though recent studies hint that those with the highest intentions to visit LCT destinations are also some of the most concerned with climate change, no study has assessed the psychological drivers that may help explain why individuals are increasingly engaging in this paradox. Drawing on the VBN model, this research examines a theoretical framework to assess the psychological drivers behind individuals' intention to engage in environmentally responsible behavior while traveling and, ultimately, their desire to participate in LCT. Results reveal that a set of environmentally referent cognitions (i.e., values, environmental worldview, awareness of consequences, and ascription of responsibility) lead to personal norms activation, which then influence tourists' intent to behave in pro-sustainable ways and, ultimately, individuals' intentions to engage in LCT. Findings are important as they further confirm the benefits of using VBN theory within an LCT context. For practitioners, this research strengthens the appeal of sustainable tourism operations to secure business and receive positive word-of-mouth from potential LCT tourists.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for high-thickness cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DERMATOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Squamous cell carcinomas are among the most common skin tumors and show a risk of metastasis depending on various factors such as tumor thickness, localization, histological subtype and immune status of the patient. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) SLNB represents a possibility for assessing the locoregional lymph node status. In this study, the role of the SLNB in lymph node status and survival was analyzed. Retrospectively, 720 patients with high-risk squamous cell carcinoma (tumor thickness > 5 mm) were examined. 150 patients agreed to SLNB, 570 patients did not undergo histologic confirmation of lymph node status and were included directly in follow-up. In 101 patients, a sentinel lymph node was successfully marked and extirpated, followed by regular follow-up examinations. A total of 11.11% of the patients showed lymph node metastasis in the course of their treatment, with no difference in the proportion of patients in the SLNB group (11.9%) and the observation group (11.4%) (p = 0.873). The proportion of distant metastasis also did not differ between the groups (p = 0.898). In 3.96% of the patients in the SLNB group, a metastasis was found in the sentinel lymph node. Tumor-specific death was observed in 7.14% of the patients in the SLNB group and 4.74% in the observation group (p = 0.269). Although SLNB is a principally suitable method for determining lymph node status, the available data do not provide any benefit regarding further metastasis or tumor-specific survival.

TI  - Density-ratio-invariant mean-species profile of classical Rayleigh-Taylor mixing
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately predicting profiles of mean-mass fraction (Y) over bar and mean-molar/volume fraction (Phi) over bar (equivalent to renormalized mean density (rho) over bar) of turbulent mixing induced by Rayleigh-Taylor instability at different density ratio R is of fundamental importance for many natural phenomena and engineering applications but has not been quantified yet. Based on asymptotic analysis, we give an R-invariant hybrid profiles C(X) F (Y) over bar + (1-F)(Phi) over bar with A  (R - 1)/(R + 1) and F  (1 + A)(1 - X)/2 and derive the analytical expression of C(X), where X is an element of [0, 1] is a mixing-width-rescaled dimensionless coordinate. The invariance are validated by both experiments and simulations. Consequently, combining the R invariance of C(X) and the relation of (Phi) over bar = (Y) over bar /[(Y) over bar (1 - (Y) over bar )R] derived from definitions, the mean profiles of density, mass fraction, and molar/volume fraction at different density ratios are accurately predicted.

TI  - The use of a sentinel cerebral protection system during Impella CP removal in a patient with left ventricular thrombus
T2  - CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (pMCS) devices are commonly being utilized for hemodynamic support in patients undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary interventions or stabilization for those in cardiogenic shock. Left ventricular (LV) to ascending aorta (Ao) rotodynamic pumps such as the Impella devices allow for rapid hemodynamic stabilization or support in such instances. The use of such devices is contraindicated in patients with known LV thrombus. However, it remains unclear on how to manage patients who develop an LV thrombus while on prolonged Impella support. While there are currently no cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPDs) approved for use in conjunction with LV to Ao pMCS devices or other short-term mechanical support devices, there is a theoretical benefit for the use of such technology in the right circumstances. We present a case describing the use of the sentinel cerebral protection system (SCPS) in a patient who developed LV thrombus while on Impella CP support. The use of the SCPS in this patient suggests a potential role for CEPD in prevention of thromboembolism while on Impella support.

TI  - Northern Benguela <i>Merluccius</i> <i>paradoxus</i> Annual Growth From Otolith Chronologies Used for Age Verification and as Indicators of Fisheries-Induced and Environmental Changes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we develop a 32-year (1982-2013) otolith biochronology of the commercially important deepwater hake Merluccius paradoxus in the northern Benguela, Namibia. Mean annual growth (mm) calculated from 140 thin-sectioned M. paradoxus otoliths were compared with change in mean length at age 3 to age 4 determined from Namibian whole-otolith-read age-length keys (ALKs). Annual growth rates calculated from the two methods (overlapping 2000-2013) were strongly positively correlated (rho = 0.730, n = 14, p < 0.01). This indirectly validated annual age determination of M. paradoxus, the accuracy of otolith chronologies, and the ability of ALKs to capture annual variability in fish growth. Annual M. paradoxus growth rates were significantly positively correlated with the July-September upwelling index 1982-2013 at 30 degrees S, (rho = 0.414, n = 32, p < 0.05) and positively correlated with August mean chlorophyll-a concentrations (as indicator for primary production) 2002-2013 in the 28-30 degrees S area (rho = 0.734, n = 12, p < 0.01). Annual M. paradoxus growth rates significantly negatively correlated with October (austral spring) sea surface temperatures in the 24-28 degrees S area (rho = -0.381, n = 32, p < 0.05). This Orange-River Namaqua upwelling cell corresponds to the area where juvenile and young adult M. paradoxus live, suggesting growth rate strongly responds to local forcing. We also determined that mean length-at-age 3 calculated from ALKs (current and literature) significantly increased from 1977 through 2016 at 0.075 cm.year(-1) (t = 3.04, df = 41, p = 0.004), while length-at-age 8 significantly decreased at 0.25 cm.year(-1) (t = -3.59, df = 30, p = 0.001). Both trends may indicate fisheries-induced adaptive changes. M. paradoxus occurring at >300 m bottom depth, are thus strongly influenced by fisheries. As an upper-level demersal predator, this species integrates signals throughout the food web to provide a unique "view from the top" of long-term changes in the northern Benguela upwelling system. These results provide background ranges of growth variability and context for what will likely be negative impacts of predicted decreases in future upwelling.

TI  - [Spatio-temporal Variation of PM2.5 Related Relationships in China from the Perspective of Air Pollution Regional Linkage Control and Prevention].
T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Identification of spatio-temporal variation of PM2.5 related relationships under joint management zones is of great significance for scientifically conducting joint control of air pollution in China. Based on the PM2.5 concentration data of 334 prefecture-level cities in China from 2000 to 2016, from the perspective of air pollution regional linkage control and prevention, this paper systematically analyzes the spatio-temporal variation of PM2.5 related relationships in China using a spatial unit aggregation strategy and geographically and temporally weighted regression. The results show that:① With PM2.5 as the primary pollutant, ten air pollution joint management areas are obtained by considering the degree of pollution, geographical location, meteorology, topography, and economy. ② Geographically and temporally weighted regression can effectively reveal the spatio-temporal non-stationarity of the relationships between PM2.5 concentration and related factors. Meanwhile, population size, secondary industry gross domestic product, SO2 emissions, annual average temperature, annual precipitation, and annual relative humidity are identified as having a significant effect on changes in PM2.5 concentration. ③ The population impacts on PM2.5 concentration in the Beijing-Tianjin-Yunmeng region are the largest of all regions during the period. The influence of the secondary industry's gross domestic product on the PM2.5 concentration in the Sichuan-Yunnan District is the most variable. Apart from these values in the northeast of China, the regression coefficient values of SO2 emissions first decrease with time, then increase, and then decrease again. The time variability of the average annual temperature of each treatment area to PM2.5 is small. The influences of annual precipitation and annual average relative humidity on PM2.5 present different variability characteristics in each region.

TI  - Large scale reforestation of farmlands on sloping hills in South China karst
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context South China karst is undergoing large scale land-use conversions driven by reforestation projects aiming at combating land degradation. However, the spatial extent of these human induced land-use changes is largely unknown. Objectives This study aims at quantifying land use changes in South China karst in the context of large scale restoration and reforestation projects. Results We apply an extensive field survey on land-use mapping and find that 45,406 km(2) of farmland have been converted to forest, while 41,811 km(2) have been deforested (likely due to timber harvest), which corresponds to a forest expansion of 6%, and an 8% contraction of farmlands. We find that the converted areas agree well with satellite observed greening trends, explaining why South China karst is considered a global hot-spot of vegetation cover increase. In total, 43% of the farmland to forest conversions have taken place on sloping hills steeper than 25 degrees and predominantly at larger distances from settlements. However, 19,464 km(2) of the steep sloping areas were still farmland in 2016, which is 15% of the total farmland in South China karst. Conclusions Large scale forest dynamics are observed on sloping hills. Given the low agricultural productivity but high erosion risk, considerations regarding loss of crop production and local food security must be balanced against gains in expected provisioning of ecosystem services (e.g. carbon sequestration, timber production).

AB  - Modern breast imaging techniques include digital mammography, 3-dimensional tomography, high-resolution ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. Each of these has enabled the diagnosis of ever smaller, largely non-palpable lesions, not all of which require surgery. As these techniques evolved, so too did methods of accurately targeting and sampling the lesions, necessitating methods to mark the areas should surgical localization be needed. These methods have introduced heretofore unseen histologic changes to both breast tissue and lymph nodes, especially sentinel lymph nodes. These changes are the topic of this review.

TI  - Fluorescent-Image Guidance in Robotic Subtotal Gastrectomy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Robotic surgery technology has significant advantages, but its limitations include lack of tactile feedback. Fluorescent-imaging technology, part of the da Vinci robotic surgery system, helps to overcome this lack of feedback and improve safety. This video demonstrates the utility of fluorescent-image guidance in robotic subtotal gastrectomy. First, peritumoral injection of indocyanine green helps localize the primary lesion. Second, it enables visualization of sentinel lymphatic flow to guide the extent of lymph node dissection. Third, intravenous injection of indocyanine green confirms adequate tissue perfusion of the remnant stomach. Lastly, fluorescent angiography also visualizes the jejunal arterial arcade in the mesentery. In summary, we consider that fluorescent-image guidance may provide important intraoperative information that supports techniques of robotic subtotal gastrectomy. Further studies to validate the benefits of fluorescent-image guidance are needed.

TI  - High incidence of RAS pathway mutations among sentinel genetic lesions of Korean pediatric <i>BCR-ABL1</i>-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Recent advances in genetic analysis have led to the discovery of novel genetic subtypes of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with prognostic relevance. In this study, we studied a cohort of pediatric B-ALL patients to retrospectively determine the incidence of patients harboring novel genetic subtypes, as well as their outcome.Methods B-ALL patients (N = 190) diagnosed in a single Korean hospital were included in the study. Patients' medical records were reviewed for data on established genetic abnormalities and outcome. CRLF2 expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Anchored multiplex PCR-based enrichment was used to detect fusions and point mutations in 81 ALL-related genes.Results Incidence of established recurrent genetic subtypes was as follows: high hyperdiploidy (21.6%), ETV6-RUNX1 (21.6%), BCR-ABL1 (7.9%), KMT2A rearrangement (7.4%) TCF3-PBX1/TCF3-HLF (7.4%), and hypodiploidy (1.1%). Incidence of new genetic subtypes was as follows: BCR-ABL1-like (13.2%), ETV6-RUNX1-like (2.1%), EWSR1-ZNF384 (1.1%), and iAMP21 (1.1%). Median age at diagnosis of BCR-ABL1-like ALL was 6.8 years. According to type of genetic abnormality, BCR-ABL1-like ALL was divided into ABL class (12%), CRLF2 class (8%), JAK-STAT class (12%), and RAS class (68%). The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of BCR-ABL1-like patients was significantly inferior to non-BCR-ABL1-like low- and standard-risk patients (71.5 +/- 9.1% vs 92.5 +/- 3.2%, P = .001) and comparable to non-BCR-ABL1-like high (75.2 +/- 6.2%) and very high-risk patients (56.8 +/- 7.4%). All four ETV6-RUNX1-like patients survived event-free.Conclusion Analogous to previous studies, incidence of BCR-ABL1-like ALL in our cohort was 13.2% with outcome comparable to high and very high-risk patients. A significantly high number of RAS class mutations was a distinct feature of our BCR-ABL1-like ALL group.

TI  - Testing UAV-derived topography for hydraulic modelling in a tropical environment
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The past few years have seen the raise of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in geosciences for generating highly accurate digital elevation models (DEM) at low costs, which promises to be an interesting alternative to satellite data for small river basins. The reliability of UAV-derived topography as input to hydraulic modelling is still under investigation: here, we analyse potentialities and highlight challenges of employing UAV-derived topography in hydraulic modelling in a tropical environment, where weather conditions and remoteness of the study area might affect the quality of the retrieved data. We focused on a stretch of the Limpopo River in Mozambique, where detailed ground survey and airborne data were available. First, we tested and compared topographic data derived by UAV (25 cm), RTK-GPS (50 cm DEM), LiDAR (1 m DEM) and SRTM (30 m DEM); then, we used each DEM as input data to a hydraulic model and compared the performance of each DEM-based model against the LiDAR based model, currently used as benchmark by practitioners in the area. Despite the challenges experienced during the field campaign-and described here-, the degree of accuracy in terrain modelling produced errors in water depth calculations within the tolerances adopted in this typology of studies and comparable in magnitude to the ones obtained from high-precision topography models. This suggests that UAV is a promising source of geometric data even in natural environments with extreme weather conditions.

TI  - Hybrid (2D/3D) Dosimetry of Radiolabeled Gold Nanoparticles for Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Patients with Breast Cancer
T2  - CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previously, we reported the preparation and preclinical studies of Tc-99m-labeled gold nanoparticles-mannose (Tc-99m-AuNP-mannose) with potential for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection by using nuclear medicine procedures. This study aimed to evaluate the biokinetics and hybrid (2D/3D) dosimetry of Tc-99m-AuNP-mannose in five patients with breast cancer under a sentinel lymph node detection protocol. Anterior and posterior whole-body planar images (2D, at 0.5, 2, 6, and 24 h) and single-photon emission computed tomography (3D at 6.5 h)/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) images were acquired after Tc-99m-AuNP-mannose administration (37 MBq). Through a hybrid quantification method, activity in tissues of interest at the different acquisition times was determined and integrated over time to obtain the total nuclear transformations (N), as well as the mean residence time, in each tissue. N values and the OLINDA code were used for estimating the internal radiation absorbed doses. Results demonstrated that Tc-99m-AuNP-mannose successfully accumulates and remains up to 24 h in the sentinel lymph node without detectable migration to other lymph nodes and no side effects on patients. Negligible absorption of the radiolabeled nanoparticles into the circulatory system was observed, from which the radio-nanosystem is rapidly eliminated by kidneys. Hybrid (2D/3D) dosimetry evaluations showed equivalent doses to SLN, breast, and kidneys of 172.34, 5.32, and 0.08 mSv/37 MBq, respectively, with an effective dose of 2.05E - 03 mSv/MBq. The mean effective residence time in SLN was 0.92 h. This preliminary study indicates that the use of Tc-99m-AuNP-mannose for successful SLN detection in patients is safe, producing an effective dose at the level recommended for diagnostic studies (<10 mSv).

The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiologic and laboratory characteristics and trends of HAIs and AMR from 2014 to 2018 using surveillance data provided by Canadian hospitals participating in the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program.METHODS: Data were collected from 70 Canadian sentinel hospitals between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018 for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci bloodstream infections and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Case counts, rates, outcome data, molecular characterization and antimicrobial resistance profiles are presented. Additionally, hospital-level Escherichia coli antibiogram data were collected and are described.RESULTS: Increases in rates per 10,000 patient-days were observed for methicillin-resistant S. aureus bloodstream infections (59%; 0.66-1.05, p=0.023) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci bloodstream infections (143%; 0.14-0.34, p=0.023). However, CDI rates decreased by 12.5% between 2015 and 2018 (from 6.16-5.39, p=0.042). Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae infection rates remained low and stable whereas colonization increased by 375% (0.04-0.19; p=0.014).CONCLUSION: Ongoing efforts to prevent HAIs and reduce AMR in Canada require consistent, standardized surveillance data from acute care hospitals. Increased collaboration with provincial, territorial and international partners in infection prevention and control, as well as antimicrobial stewardship, will be essential in reducing the burden of observed HAIs (including antimicrobial resistant organisms).

TI  - National findings from the Tracks survey of people who inject drugs in Canada, Phase 4, 2017-2019.
T2  - Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: The Tracks survey of people who inject drugs (PWID) collected data in 14 sentinel sites across Canada (2017-2019).Objective: To describe the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C and associated risk behaviours and to examine trends over time.Methods: Information regarding socio-demographics, social determinants of health, use of prevention services and testing, drug use, risk behaviours, and HIV and hepatitis C testing, care and treatment was collected through interviewer-administered questionnaires. Biological samples were tested for HIV, hepatitis C antibodies and hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA). Descriptive statistics were calculated and trends over time were assessed.Results: Of the 2,383 participants, 65.6% were cisgender male, 42.2% were Indigenous, 48.0% completed some high school or less, 62.6% lived in unstable housing and 75.7% had ever been incarcerated. Average age was 40.1 years. The majority experienced stigma and discrimination (88.7%) and physical, sexual and/or emotional abuse in childhood (85.0%) or with a sexual partner (75.9%). The majority reported use of a needle/syringe distribution program (90.1%) and tested for HIV (90.5%) and hepatitis C (90.9%).Among participants who had ever had sex, the majority (59.2%) reported inconsistent condom use during vaginal and/or anal sex with a casual sex partner. Prevalence of HIV was 10.3% (82.9% were aware of infection status) and many (36.9%) were hepatitis C RNA-positive (50.1% were aware of infection status).Most surveillance indicators remained relatively stable from Phase 1 to Phase 4. Changes were found in substances used, and improvements were noted related to HIV and hepatitis C prevalence and care cascade indicators.Conclusion: Many PWID in Canada were living in unstable housing and experienced high levels of stigma and discrimination. Prevalence of HIV and hepatitis C was high in some areas. These findings contribute to the evidence base used to inform targeted prevention and control measures.

TI  - Juvenile fish assemblage recruitment dynamics in a mid-Atlantic estuary: before and after Hurricane Sandy
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hurricanes can have long-term effects on estuarine fauna. Understanding these effects is important as climate change may influence the severity and frequency of these storms. On 29 October 2012, Hurricane Sandy, a large storm spanning roughly 1850 km in diameter, made landfall in Brigantine, New Jersey (USA), approximately 20 km south of Barnegat Bay, during an ongoing study of the bay's ichthyofauna, providing an opportunity to observe fish recruitment dynamics coincident with hurricane passage. The objective of this study was to measure variance in the Barnegat Bay pre-Sandy fish assemblage relative to that of 1 and 2 yr after the storm. Barnegat Bay fishes were surveyed with an extensive otter trawl study in April, June, August, and October of 2012 (pre-Sandy), 2013 (1 yr post-Sandy), and 2014 (2 yr post-Sandy). Species composition of the fish assemblage was similar across years. Analyzed structural characteristics (abundance, diversity, richness) of the fish assemblage were occasionally more likely to occur or were larger pre-Sandy and 2 yr post-Sandy relative to 1 yr post-Sandy, but this trend was inconsistent across seasons and between structural characteristics. Furthermore, odds of occurrence and length frequency distributions for many resident species and sentinel fall/winter spawners did not indicate that variance could be definitively explained as a hurricane effect. The capability of fish to relocate from areas of temporarily unsuitable habitat and annual new recruitment of larvae and juveniles to the bay likely contributed to the observed stability in the fish assemblage.

TI  - Post-abortion contraception before hospital discharge after installation of a surveillance network in Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate the use of contraception soon after abortion, ectopic, or molar pregnancy following the establishment of a surveillance network (MUSA).Methods A cross-sectional study of women admitted for abortion, or ectopic or molar pregnancy at UNICAMP Women's Hospital (part of the MUSA Network), Campinas, Brazil, between July 2017 and August 2019. Clinical and sociodemographic data were compared between women who initiated contraception before discharge and those who did not by using a Cochran-Armitage test and multiple logistic regression.Results Overall, 382 women were enrolled (mean +/- SD age, 29.6 +/- 7.4 years). Most women (287, 75.2%) had abortions, and 146 (38.2%) initiated contraception before hospital discharge. The most common contraceptives were injectables (75, 51.4%) followed by pills (65, 44.5%). Use of contraception increased during the study period (Z=3.69, P<0.01), mostly due to injectables (Z=3.84, P<0.01). Factors independently associated with contraceptive initiation were admission in 2019 (odds ratio [OR], 2.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-5.17) and not having an abortion for legal reasons (OR, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.30-9.62).Conclusion Implementation of a surveillance network optimized the health service and quality of care.& x202f;There was an increase in contraception use and a vulnerable population was identified.

TI  - Dynamics and drivers of land use and land cover changes in Bangladesh
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bangladesh has undergone dramatic land use and land cover changes (LULCC) in recent years, but no quantitative analysis of LULCC drivers at the national scale exists so far. Here, we quantified the drivers of major LULCC in combination with biophysical and socioeconomic observations at the sub-district level. We used Landsat satellite data to interpret LULCC from 2000 to 2010 and employed a Global Surface Water Dataset to account for the influences of water seasonality. The results suggest that major LULCC in Bangladesh occur between agricultural land and waterbodies and between forest and shrubland. Exclusion of seasonal waterbodies can improve the accuracy of our LULCC results and driver analysis. Although the gross gain and loss of agricultural land are large on the local scale, the net change (gross gain minus gross loss) at a country scale is almost negligible. Climate dynamics and extreme events and changes in urban and rural households were driving the changes from forest to shrubland in the southeast region. The conversion from agricultural land to standing waterbodies in the southwest region was mainly driven by urban household dynamics, population growth, distance to cities and major roads, and precipitation dynamics. This study, which is the first effort accounting for water seasonality and quantifying biophysical and socioeconomic drivers of LULCC at the national scale, provides a perspective on overall LULCC and underlying drivers over a decadal time scale and national spatial scale and can serve as a scientific basis for developing land policies in Bangladesh.

TI  - Emission stations location selection based on conditional measurement GAN data
T2  - NEUROCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban vehicle emission monitoring can help make suggestions for the pollution emission control, and can protect public health. However, it is hard to get an overview of the vehicle emission in the city scale due to the sparse emission remote sensing stations in city, and selecting the appropriate stations locations which can reflect the emission variation in the given region mostly is another challenge. The existing methods solve the problem by spatial interpolation based on geographical statistics methods, without considering that urban vehicle emission varies by locations non-linearly and depends on many complex external factors. To tackle the spatial sparsity of vehicle remote sensing data, we design a data augmentation strategy based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which leverages prior model COPERT with conditional measurement data to filling the missing entries at other locations. With this strategy, we can generate realistic emission data while accelerating the training process. In addition, to address the emission stations location selection problem, we design a novel location selection strategy based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficients, which leverages the realistic data generated to discover the grids with maximum link correlation for the pre-deployed station. Finally, we present experiments with the remote emission sensing data in Hefei, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model can mimics the real vehicle emission distribution in the given region effectively.

TI  - Identification and validation of potential flood hazard area using GIS-based multi-criteria analysis and satellite data-derived water index
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article identifies potential flood hazard areas through multi-criteria analysis in Allahabad district, India. The study has incorporated eight criteria, namely, flow accumulation, draining capability, elevation, groundwater depth, land use, runoff coefficient, slope, and geology for preparing hazard index. The weights of the criteria were obtained through the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method based on their relative importance for occurring floods. Finally, a flood hazard index (FHI) was prepared by combining the parameter ratings and corresponding weights. The credibility of the present methodology was tested through validation with the satellite-based inundation map of August 20, 2016. A normalized difference water index (NDWI) was prepared from Landsat-8 OLI data and the inundated area was delineated by a binary classification of NDWI based on a threshold calculated following Otsu's method. The analysis found 81% of inundation is associated with high to very high flood hazard zones. Agricultural land is more prone to flood than other land use types. The results showed that the GIS-based multi-criteria analysis framework could be effectively applied for flood hazard analysis to support decision making in disaster management.

TI  - The clinical importance of early acute hepatic porphyria diagnosis: a national cohort
T2  - INTERNAL AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) attacks begin with abdominal pain and can progress to severe life-threatening conditions. Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent these complications. We investigated the difference between the severity of porphyria attacks before and after porphyria diagnosis. A retrospective study including AHP patients hospitalized for an acute attack in Israel during a 15-year period. Diagnosis of an attack was based on typical clinical symptoms accompanied by at least one documented elevated urinary porphobilinogen above fourfold of normal values. The primary outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. Secondary outcomes included the length of hospital stay, severe hyponatremia, seizures, and psychiatric symptoms. 42 attacks in 9 patients were included. Most attacks occurred in women (78.6%) and in acute intermittent porphyria patients (76.2%). The mean age of attack was 26.5 (+/- 6.3) years. Attacks following porphyria diagnosis had a lower prevalence of ICU admission (3.3% versus 75.0%, p < 0.001), seizures (0% versus 50.0%, p < 0.001), psychiatric symptoms (23.3% versus 66.7%, p = 0.01), severe hyponatremia (16.7% versus 83.3%, p < 0.001), and median length of hospital stay (5 versus 11.0 days, p < 0.001). These results remained significant after simple univariate logistic regression for ICU admission [odds ratio (OR) 0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00-0.12], prolonged hospital stay (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.41), seizures or neurological symptoms (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.30), and severe hyponatremia (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00-0.20). Previously diagnosed AHP patients have a significantly milder attack course as compared to previously undiagnosed patients. Family screening following sentinel cases might prevent severe AHP attacks.

TI  - Intercomparison of NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>4</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and HCHO slant column measurements by MAX-DOAS and zenith-sky UV-visible spectrometers during CINDI-2
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In September 2016, 36 spectrometers from 24 institutes measured a number of key atmospheric pollutants for a period of 17 d during the Second Cabauw Intercomparison campaign for Nitrogen Dioxide measuring Instruments (CINDI-2) that took place at Cabauw, the Netherlands (51.97 degrees N, 4.93 degrees E). We report on the outcome of the formal semi-blind intercomparison exercise, which was held under the umbrella of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) and the European Space Agency (ESA). The three major goals of CINDI-2 were (1) to characterise and better understand the differences between a large number of multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) and zenith-sky DOAS instruments and analysis methods, (2) to define a robust methodology for performance assessment of all participating instruments, and (3) to contribute to a harmonisation of the measurement settings and retrieval methods. This, in turn, creates the capability to produce consistent high-quality ground-based data sets, which are an essential requirement to generate reliable long-term measurement time series suitable for trend analysis and satellite data validation.The data products investigated during the semi-blind intercomparison are slant columns of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), the oxygen collision complex (O-4) and ozone (O-3) measured in the UV and visible wavelength region, formaldehyde (HCHO) in the UV spectral region, and NO2 in an additional (smaller) wavelength range in the visible region. The campaign design and implementation processes are discussed in detail including the measurement protocol, calibration procedures and slant column retrieval settings. Strong emphasis was put on the careful alignment and synchronisation of the measurement systems, resulting in a unique set of measurements made under highly comparable air mass conditions.The CINDI-2 data sets were investigated using a regression analysis of the slant columns measured by each instrument and for each of the target data products. The slope and intercept of the regression analysis respectively quantify the mean systematic bias and offset of the individual data sets against the selected reference (which is obtained from the median of either all data sets or a subset), and the rms error provides an estimate of the measurement noise or dispersion. These three criteria are examined and for each of the parameters and each of the data products, performance thresholds are set and applied to all the measurements. The approach presented here has been developed based on heritage from previous intercomparison exercises. It introduces a quantitative assessment of the consistency between all the participating instruments for the MAX-DOAS and zenith-sky DOAS techniques.

TI  - Estimating acute human leptospirosis incidence in northern Tanzania using sentinel site and community behavioural surveillance
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many infectious diseases lack robust estimates of incidence from endemic areas, and extrapolating incidence when there are few locations with data remains a major challenge in burden of disease estimation. We sought to combine sentinel surveillance with community behavioural surveillance to estimate leptospirosis incidence. We administered a questionnaire gathering responses on established locally relevant leptospirosis risk factors and recent fever to livestock-owning community members across six districts in northern Tanzania and applied a logistic regression model predicting leptospirosis risk on the basis of behavioural factors that had been previously developed among patients with fever in Moshi Municipal and Moshi Rural Districts. We aggregated probability of leptospirosis by district and estimated incidence in each district by standardizing probabilities to those previously estimated for Moshi Districts. We recruited 286 community participants: Hai District (n = 11), Longido District (59), Monduli District (56), Moshi Municipal District (103), Moshi Rural District (44) and Rombo District (13). The mean predicted probability of leptospirosis by district was Hai 0.029 (0.005, 0.095), Longido 0.071 (0.009, 0.235), Monduli 0.055 (0.009, 0.206), Moshi Rural 0.014 (0.002, 0.049), Moshi Municipal 0.015 (0.004, 0.048) and Rombo 0.031 (0.006, 0.121). We estimated the annual incidence (upper and lower bounds of estimate) per 100,000 people of human leptospirosis among livestock owners by district as Hai 35 (6, 114), Longido 85 (11, 282), Monduli 66 (11, 247), Moshi Rural 17 (2, 59), Moshi Municipal 18 (5, 58) and Rombo 47 (7, 145). Use of community behavioural surveillance may be a useful tool for extrapolating disease incidence beyond sentinel surveillance sites.

TI  - Are healthcare workers more likely than the general population to consult in primary care for an influenza-like illness? Results from a case-control study
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Healthcare workers are at increased risk of contracting influenza. However, existing studies do not differentiate professional categories or domains of the healthcare system that are most at risk.Methods This case-control study compared proportions of patients with professional activity in the healthcare system between cases consulting their primary care physician for an influenza-like illness (ILI) and controls from the general patient population of the same practices of the Swiss sentinel network. Influenza was confirmed by rRT-PCR in a subset of practices. Analysis used a mixed logistic regression model, including age and sex as potential confounders.Results During the 2018/2019 influenza surveillance season, out of 4287 ILI cases and 28 561 controls reported in 168 practices, 235 (5.5%), respectively 872 (3.1%), were active in the healthcare system. After adjustment, being active in health care increased the odds of consulting for an ILI (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.40-1.97). The association was strongest for physicians and nursing aides. In terms of work setting, odds of consulting for ILI were increased for professionals of almost all healthcare settings except home-based care.Conclusion Individuals active in the healthcare system were more likely to consult their primary care physician for an influenza-like illness than for another reason, compared with individuals not active in the healthcare system. These results warrant further efforts to understand influenza transmission in the healthcare system at large.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of albedo in managed agricultural landscapes: inferences to global warming impacts (GWI)
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Albedo can be used to quantify ecosystem and landscape contributions to local and global climate. Such contributions are conventionally expressed as radiative forcing (RF) and global warming impact (GWI). We contextualize our results within landscape carbon production and storage to highlight the importance of changes in albedo for landscape GWI from multiple causes, including net ecosystem production (NEP) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Objective To examine the spatiotemporal changes in albedo (Delta alpha) in contrasting managed landscapes through calculations of albedo-induced RF (RF Delta alpha) and GWI (GWI(Delta alpha)) under different climatic conditions. Methods We selected five contrasting landscapes within the Kalamazoo River watershed in southern Michigan USA as proof of concept. The daily MCD43A3 MODIS (V006) product was used to analyze the inter- and intra-annual variations of growing season albedo. In addition, the variations of RF Delta alpha and GWI(Delta alpha) were computed based on landscape composition and climate. Results The RF Delta alpha (- 5.6 W m(-2)) and GWI(Delta alpha) (- 1.3 CO2eq ha(-1) year(-1)) were high in forest-dominated landscapes, indicating cooling effects and CO2eq mitigation impacts similar to crops. The CO2eq mitigation of cropland-dominated landscapes was on average 52% stronger than forest-dominated landscapes. In the landscape with the highest proportion of forest, under dry and wet conditions CO2eq mitigation was reduced by up to 24% and similar to 30%, respectively; in one cropland-dominated landscape wet conditions reduced CO2eq mitigation by 23%. Conclusions Findings demonstrate that quantifying spatiotemporal changes in albedo in managed landscapes and under different climatic conditions is essential to understand how landscape modification affects RF Delta alpha and GWI(Delta alpha) and thereby contributes to ecosystem-level GWI.

TI  - Land cover classification combining Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 imagery driven by Markov random field with amendment reliability factors
T2  - EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliability factors in Markov random field (MRF) could be used to improve classification performance for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images; however, insufficient utilization of reliability factors based on characteristics of different sources leaves more room for classification improvement. To solve this problem, a Markov random field (MRF) with amendment reliability factors classification algorithm (MRF-ARF) is proposed. The ARF is constructed based on the coarse label field of urban region, and different controlling factors are utilized for different sensor data. Then, ARF is involved into the data energy of MRF, to classify the sand, vegetation, farmland, and urban regions, with the gray level co-occurrence matrix textures of Sentinel-1 imagery and the spectral values of the Landsat 8 imagery. In the experiments, Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 images are used with overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient to evaluate the proposed algorithm with other algorithms. Results show that the overall accuracy of the proposed algorithm has the superiority of about 20% in overall precision and at least 0.2 in Kappa coefficient than the comparison algorithms. Thus, the problem of insufficient utilization of different sensors data could be solved.

TI  - Landslide Occurrences Along Lineaments on NH-154A, Chamba, Himachal Pradesh; Extracted from Satellite Data Landsat 8, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lineament analysis is an important factor to assess its control on landslide occurrences and also to analyze the general tectonics of the terrain. Lineament may signify the vulnerable weak planes where slope material strength is being reduced and causing slope failures. The present work is carried along the parts of NH-154A, Chamba-Bharmour road, Chamba, Himachal Pradesh to establish the association between landslide occurrences and lineaments. Approximately 60 km stretch of road section from Kuranh to Hadsar has been studied for this analysis. The Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS C1 Level-1data suggests that the presence of 1129 lineaments, which are classified into very high, high, moderate, low and very low density classes applying natural break techniques in Arc GIS 10.4.1 software. The total study area is 446.17 km(2) in which 26 km(2) area is under very high, 66 km(2) area into high, 100 km(2) into moderate, 138 km(2) into low and 116 km(2) area into very low risk zones. The lineament intersection point map shows a direct relationship between it and the existing landslide. Two major directions, i.e., NW-SE which is of tectonic origin coincides with the Chamba Thrust and a less prominent, NE-SW directed lineaments are present. The results also indicate a direct association between lineament and landslide distribution.

TI  - Multi-geohazards susceptibility mapping based on machine learning-a case study in Jiuzhaigou, China
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Jiuzhaigou, located in the transitional area between the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Sichuan Basin, is highly prone to geological hazards (e.g., rock fall, landslide, and debris flow). High-performance-based hazard prediction models, therefore, are urgently required to prevent related hazards and manage potential emergencies. Current researches mainly focus on susceptibility of single hazard but ignore that different types of geological hazards might occur simultaneously under a complex environment. Here, we firstly built a multi-geohazard inventory from 2000 to 2015 based on a geographical information system and used satellite data in Google earth and then chose twelve conditioning factors and three machine learning methods-random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-to generate rock fall, landslide, and debris flow susceptibility maps. The results show that debris flow models presented the best prediction capabilities [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC 0.95)], followed by rock fall (AUC 0.94) and landslide (AUC 0.85). Additionally, XGBoost outperformed the other two methods with the highest AUC of 0.93. All three methods with AUC values larger than 0.84 suggest that these models have fairly good performance to assess geological hazards susceptibility. Finally, evolution index was constructed based on a joint probability of these three hazard models to predict the evolution tendency of 35 unstable slopes in Jiuzhaigou. The results show that these unstable slopes are likely to evolve into debris flows with a probability of 46%, followed by landslides (43%) and rock falls (29%). Higher susceptibility areas for geohazards were mainly located in the southeast and middle of Jiuzhaigou, implying geohazards prevention and mitigation measures should be taken there in near future.

TI  - Determination of Cloud-top Height through Three-dimensional Cloud Reconstruction using DIWATA-1 Data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud-top height is a useful parameter with which to elucidate cloud vertical growth, which often indicates severe weather such as torrential rainfall and thunderstorms; it is widely used in meteorological research. However, general cloud-top height estimation methods are hindered by observational and analytical constraints. This study used data from DIWATA-1, the Philippines' first microsatellite, to overcome these limitations and successfully produce sophisticated three-dimensional cloud models via stereo-photogrammetry. High-temporal snapshot 200-ms-interval imaging of clouds over Iloilo, Philippines, is performed. Two types of telescopes were used to capture 30 stereoscopic cloud images at similar to 60- and similar to 3-m ground sampling resolutions; these were used to construct three-dimensional cloud models with 40- and 2-m vertical resolutions, respectively. The imaged clouds have heights of 2.0 to 4.8km, which is below freezing level for the Philippines and typical of stratocumulus and cumulus clouds. The results are validated using cloud-edge heights determined by measuring the distance from the clouds to their ground shadows. An RMSE of 0.32km and a maximum difference of 0.03km are found for the low- and high-resolution telescopes, respectively. For further validation, the results are compared with cloud-top heights estimated from HIMAWARI-8 images captured on the same day, yielding an average vertical difference of 0.15km and a maximum difference of 1.7km.

TI  - Spatial distribution and temporal variation of atmospheric pollution in the South Gobi Desert, China, during 2016-2019
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid pace of economic growth and urbanization in China affects both large and small cities of the country, causing an increase of pollutant concentrations in the air. The South Gobi is one of the main deserts and semidesert regions of the country; therefore, the study of air pollution near the potential source of natural aerosols is of great importance. Data obtained in the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2019 was used to analyze spatial-temporal characteristics of atmospheric pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO) in eight cities. Total mean concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were 36.1 +/- 21.1 mu g/m(3) and 98.6 +/- 108.7 mu g/m(3). The occurrence rates of concentrations exceeding the Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard (CNAAQS) grade 1 and grade 2 were 40.1% and 5.4% for PM2.5 and 82.9% and 11.64% for PM10 in the region. Total concentrations of SO2, NO2, and CO did not exceed the CNAAQS standard and were 20.8 +/- 23.6 mu g/m(3), 22.6 +/- 11.9 mu g/m(3), and 0.72 +/- 0.39 mg/m(3), respectively. The PM2.5 to PM10 ratio increased from 0.35 in spring to 0.46 in winter suggesting the predominance of coarse aerosol fractions in the atmosphere. Based on data on aerosol optical depth (AOD) and angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE) ratio obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the predominant aerosol types in the region are Clean Continental and Mixed. Maximum concentrations of pollutants and the highest AOD values in the region air are observed in spring and winter. Results set forth in this article will be an important basis for further regional studies on air quality and distribution of sources.

TI  - A split-window method to retrieving sea surface temperature from landsat 8 thermal infrared remote sensing data in offshore waters
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is an important parameter used to describe the air-sea interaction and the state of marine structures. Atmospheric water vapor has a significant attenuation effect on thermal infrared information, which will reduce the accuracy of SST inversion. However, the effect of atmospheric water vapor on the inversion accuracy is not considered carefully in the existing SST inversion algorithm. In this study, a new method is proposed for retrieving SST from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing (TIRS) data based on the variation of atmospheric water vapor content (wvc). First, simulating atmospheric conditions by using moderate resolution atmospheric transmission (MODTRAN) based on atmospheric profiles data (air temperature and pressure). Second, calculating the bright temperature based on the radiation transfer equation and Planck's law. Then, constructing the SST retrieval model of thermal infrared remote sensing based on wvc. Finally, evaluating the accuracy of the proposed model by using simulation data. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) are within 0.5 K, indicating that the accuracy of the model is good in theory. In addition, taking the Zhoushan sea area as the research area, SST is retrieved by Landsat 8 TIRS data. The accuracy of inversion results is evaluated by advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) SST products. The bias and RMSE based on the AVHRR SST products are within 1 K and 2 K, respectively. The results show that the accurate SST with high spatial resolution was successfully obtained by using the method. The study is of great significance to the acquisition of marine structural parameters, the exploitation of marine resources, and the monitoring of marine disasters.

TI  - Detect coastal disturbances and climate change effects in coralligenous community through sentinel stations
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was implemented to assess the Sessile Bioindicators in Permanent Quadrats (SBPQ) underwater environmental alert method. The SBPQ is a non-invasive and low-cost protocol; it uses sessile target species (indicators) to detect environmental alterations (natural or anthropic) at either the local or global (i.e., climate change) scale and the intrusion of invasive species. The SBPQ focuses on the monitoring of preselected sessile and sensitive benthic species associated with rocky coralligenous habitats using permanent quadrats in underwater sentinel stations. The selected target species have been well documented as bioindicators that disappear in the absence of environmental stability. However, whether these species are good indicators of stability or, in contrast, suffer variations in long-term coverage has not been verified. The purpose of this study was to assess the part of the method based on the hypothesis that, over a long temporal series in a highly structured and biodiverse coralligenous assemblage, the cover of sensitive sessile species does not change over time if the environmental stability characterising the habitat is not altered. Over a ten-year period (2005-2014), the sublittoral sessile biota in the Straits of Gibraltar Natural Park on the southern Iberian Peninsula was monitored at a 28 m-deep underwater sentinel stations. Analyses of the coverages of target indicator species (i.e., Paramuricea clavata and Astroides calycularis) together with other accompanying sessile organisms based on the periodic superimposition of gridded images from horizontal and vertical rocky surfaces allowed us to assess the effectiveness of the method. We conclude that no alterations occurred during the study period; only minimal fluctuations in cover were detected, and the method is reliable for detecting biological changes in ecosystems found in other geographical areas containing the chosen indicator species at similar dominance levels.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent reports from Isfahan, Iran, have announced the possibility of potential land subsidence due to the persistence of drought, interbasin water transfer, and groundwater overexploitation. By this token, we seek to employ the persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique to detect and measure the land subsidence phenomenon in the Isfahan metropolitan area. The Sentinel interferometric synthetic aperture radar dataset was used for detecting land subsidence phenomena. The corresponding data pairs were acquired and analyzed for the period from 2014 to 2019. Our prime objective is to map the spatial and temporal variations in surface deformation in Isfahan using the multitemporal persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-PSI) technique. Results indicate that Isfahan had been undergoing subsidence throughout the observation period of 2014 to 2019 at an estimated rate of -5 to -100 mm/year. Subsidence has increased from south to north of metropolitan areas from 2014 to 2019. The MT-PSI time series during the observation period correspond well with fluctuations in the level of the groundwater. The subsidence in the Isfahan region is mainly due to human activities. The estimated subsidence rates in the city for the period from 2014 to 2019 showed no signs of high subsidence rate in the cultural-historic and economic sites of the urban regions of Isfahan.

TI  - Application of Optical Laser 3D Surface imaging system (Sentinel) in breast cancer radiotherapy
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been clearly confirmed that radiation therapy (RT) after breast conserving surgery (BCS) is an effective treatment modality comparable to mastectomy for early breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to further evaluate the accuracy of 3D surface imaging system (Sentinel) for breast cancer patients received BCS. The optical surface scans and CBCT scans were acquired before and immediately after couch movement correction. The deviation of the CBCT scans from the reference planning CT was considered an estimate for the residual errors for patient setup correction. The planning target volume (PTV) margins for treatment sessions was calculated according to the setup errors. We obtained a total of 245 sets of data collected from 49 breast cancer patients. Compared with Sentinel setup errors, the residual setup errors as determined by the CBCT scans after couch movement correction were reduced in the six directions. The PTV margins derived from the CBCT residual errors were all less than 5mm in X, Y, and Z directions. Our results suggested that Optical surface imaging can be applied in positioning for breast cancer patient accurately without unnecessary imaging dose.

TI  - Pathways of suspended sediments transported from the Yellow River mouth to the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentration of suspended particulate matter in the Yellow River is very high, and the Yellow River is one of the main sources of sediment in China's coastal waters. The diffusion of substances from the Yellow River into the sea is of great significance to the ecological environments of the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea. Thus, the transport pathways and mechanisms of sediment delivered by the Yellow River are hot topics. In this paper, transport pathways, seasonal variations and their relationship between them and wind direction and flow field in the Bohai Sea were investigated based on observational data (suspended sediment concentration, temperature, and salinity) and MODIS imagery and ocean current data from ROMS. This study shows that the sediments from the Yellow River are mainly transported outward along two pathways: along the west side of the central Bohai Shoal to the central part of the Bohai Sea and along the Bohai Strait to the Yellow Sea. Winter is the main season for outward expansion. The interannual variation in the pathway exhibits little correlation with the sediment transport volume of the Yellow River, so the re-suspended sediment from the seabed is the source of the outward diffusion of sediment from the Yellow River into the sea. The interannual variations in the two pathways are closely related to sea surface temperature (SST), flow field, wind speed and wind direction.

TI  - Hierarchical multi-grain models improve descriptions of species' environmental associations, distribution, and abundance
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The characterization of species' environmental niches and spatial distribution predictions based on them are now central to much of ecology and conservation, but implicitly requires decisions about the appropriate spatial scale (i.e., grain) of analysis. Ecological theory and empirical evidence suggest that range-resident species respond to their environment at two characteristic, hierarchical spatial grains: (1) response grain, the (relatively fine) grain at which an individual uses environmental resources, and (2) occupancy grain, the (relatively coarse) grain equivalent to a typical home range. We use a multi-grain (MG) occupancy model, aided by fine-grain remotely sensed imagery, to simultaneously estimate species-environment associations at both grains, conduct grain optimization to measure response grain, and apply this analysis framework to an example species: a medium-sized bird (Tockus deckeni) in a heterogeneous East African landscape. Based on home range analysis of movement data, we calculate an occupancy grain of 1 km for T. deckeni. Using a grain optimization procedure across 32 grains from 10 to 500 m, we identify 60 m as the most strongly supported response grain for a suite of environmental variables, slightly coarser than opportunistic behavioral observations would have suggested. Validation confirms that the accuracy of the optimized MG occupancy model substantially exceeds that of equivalent single-grain (SG) occupancy models. We further use a simulation approach to assess the potential impacts of accounting for the multi-scale structure of species' environmental requirements on estimates of population size. We find that the more strongly supported MG approach consistently predicts a minimum population size in the study landscape that is much lower than that provided by the SG model. This suggests that SG approaches commonly used in conservation applications could lead to overly optimistic abundance and population estimates, and that the MG approach may be more appropriate for supporting species conservation goals. More generally, we conclude that multi-grain approaches of the sort presented, and increasingly enabled by growing high-resolution remotely sensed data, hold great promise for offering a more mechanistic framework for assessing the appropriate grain(s) for population monitoring and management and enable more reliable estimates of abundances and species' distributions.

TI  - Insights Into Microseism Sources by Array and Machine Learning Techniques: Ionian and Tyrrhenian Sea Case of Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we investigated the microseism recorded by a network of broadband seismic stations along the coastline of Eastern Sicily. Microseism is the most continuous and ubiquitous seismic signal on Earth and is mostly generated by the ocean-solid earth interaction. On the basis of spectral content, it is possible to distinguish three types of microseism: primary, secondary, and short-period secondary microseism (SPSM). We showed how most of the microseism energy recorded in Eastern Sicily is contained in the secondary and SPSM bands. This energy exhibits strong seasonal patterns, with maxima during the winters. By applying array techniques, we observed how the SPSM sources are located in areas of extended shallow water depth: the Catania Gulf and a part of the Northern Sicily coastlines. Finally, by using the significant wave height data recorded by two buoys installed in the Ionian and Tyrrhenian Seas, we developed an innovative method, selected among up-to-date machine learning techniques (MLTs), able to reconstruct the time series of sea wave parameters from microseism recorded in the three microseism period bands by distinct seismic stations. In particular, the developed model, based on random forest regression, allowed estimating the significant wave height with a low average error (similar to 0.14-0.18 m). The regression analysis suggests that the closer the seismic station to the sea, the more information concerning the sea state are contained in the recorded microseism. This is particularly important for the future development of an experimental monitoring system of the sea state conditions based on microseism recordings.

TI  - Comparative Postmarket Safety Profile of Adjuvanted and High-Dose Influenza Vaccines in Individuals 65 Years or Older
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance Every year, influenza vaccines are administered to millions of people worldwide to reduce morbidity and mortality from influenza. As new vaccine formulations are increasingly used, monitoring and comparing safety, in addition to vaccine effectiveness, in target populations are essential. Objective To assess the postmarketing safety profile of 2018 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccines, particularly 2 new enhanced trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines: an adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3) and high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3), among Australian individuals 65 years or older. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study used solicited short message service-based self-reported survey data on adverse events occurring within 3 to 5 days after receipt of an influenza vaccination. Participants included individuals 65 years or older who received routinely recommended influenza vaccines at 1 of 265 sentinel immunization sites, including primary care, hospital, and community-based clinics, participating in Australia's AusVaxSafety active vaccine safety surveillance system from April 1 to August 31, 2018. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019. Exposure Any licensed 2018 influenza vaccine administered in clinical practice. Main Outcomes and Measures Rates (overall, by brand, and by concomitant vaccine receipt) of adverse events, including medical attendance as a proxy for serious adverse events. Results Of 72 & x202f;013 individuals 65 years or older who received an influenza vaccine in 2018, 50 & x202f;134 individuals (69.6%) responded to the initial survey regarding adverse events experienced after vaccination (median [interquartile range] age, 71 [68-76] years; 27 & x202f;056 [54.0%] women). Most individuals received an enhanced trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, including 28 & x202f;003 individuals (55.9%) who received aIIV3 and 19 & x202f;306 individuals (38.5%) who received HD-IIV3; 2208 individuals (4.4%) received a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. Individuals who received HD-IIV3 reported significantly higher rates of any adverse event compared with individuals who received aIIV3 (1716 individuals [8.9%] vs 1796 individuals [6.4%]; P < .001) as well as specific adverse events, including fever (195 individuals [1.1%] vs 164 individuals [0.6%]; P < .001), injection site pain (383 individuals [2.1%] vs 350 individuals [1.3%]; P < .001), and injection site swelling or redness (256 individuals [1.4%] vs 248 individuals [0.9%]; P < .001). Adverse event rates reported by those receiving any quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine were similar to rates reported by those receiving aIIV3. Rates of medical care seeking for adverse events associated with aIIV3 and HD-IIV3 were low and comparable (80 individuals [0.3%] vs 56 individuals [0.3%]; P = .91). Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this large-scale participant-based postmarketing assessment of the safety of 2 new enhanced influenza vaccines used in individuals 65 years or older provide reassuring near-real-time and cumulative data to inform and support confidence in ongoing vaccine use.This cohort study examines rates of adverse events following vaccinations among Australian adults 65 years or older who received influenza vaccines in 2018.Question Were the 2018 adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIIV) and high-dose TIIV associated with adverse events in Australian individuals 65 years or older? Findings In this cohort study of active safety surveillance system data including 50 & x202f;134 adults 65 years or older who responded to a short messaging service-based survey of self-reported adverse events following immunization, 94.4% of participants received an adjuvanted TIIV or high-dose TIIV. Individuals who received a high-dose TIIV reported higher rates of select adverse events, including fever and injection site reactions, but rates of seeking care were low and did not differ between enhanced vaccine groups. Meaning The findings of this postmarketing active sentinel surveillance system study consisting of self-reported adverse events following immunization suggest that these 2 new enhanced influenza vaccines were well tolerated among an older Australian population.

TI  - An optimal waterline approach for studying tidal flat morphological changes using remote sensing data: A case of the northern coast of Vietnam
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats on the north coast of Vietnam suffer diurnal tide with a tide range varying between 0.3 m and 3.5 m. Along the 350 km long coastline, the diversity of environmental conditions induces various tidal flats with different characteristics. This study applies the waterline method for multi-temporal satellite images to build Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of tidal flats during the last 25 years. 117 Landsat images acquired with TM, ETMthorn, and OLI have been processed to construct tidal flat DEMs in 1989, 2000, and 2014. Waterlines extracted from single spectral bands (near-infrared [NIR], short wave infrared [SWIR]) or band ratios (normalized difference water index [NDWI], normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI], Green/SWIR) of the Landsat data have been compared with waterlines digitalized on Spot, Aster and Worldview 2 images. This experiment allows us to determine the best band (or band ratio) for extracting waterlines depending on local conditions. Consequently, the study shows that the Green/SWIR ratio image is a good solution for extracting waterlines in the black coal tidal flats of Cam Pha. However, the NDWI index appears to be a better choice for the other parts of the study area. The vertical accuracy of the tidal flat DEMs reaches 0.144 m. The change analysis of the DEMs also emphasizes the tidal flat evolution in both vertical and horizontal dimensions, i.e. erosion or accretion. The erosion of the tidal flats along the northern coast of Vietnam is particularly developed in the area extending from Yen Hung to Mong Cai, especially in Mong Cai with an amount of about 50 x 10(6) m(3) of sediments lost between 1989 and 2014. On the contrary, the tidal flats in the south of the study area show a high rate of deposition due to the sediments fed by Red and Thai Binh rivers. About 35 x 10(6) m(3) of sediments deposited in the tidal flat surrounding the Red River mouth between 1989 and 2014. This study represents a development of the waterline extraction method to investigate the evolution of tidal flat at a large scale and a diversified coastal environment using optical satellite images and fieldwork.

TI  - Satellite image analysis reveals changes in seagrass beds at Van Phong Bay, Vietnam during the last 30 years
T2  - AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass meadows are fragile ecosystems in the coastal zone. Natural disasters, land reclamation and various human activities seem to exert negative impacts on the distribution and biological performance of seagrass beds in Vietnam. In this present study, satellite Landsat TM/OLI image analysis was applied to determine changes in seagrass distribution at Van Phong Bay, Vietnam in the last 30 years. The maximum likelihood decision rule was used to extract seagrass bed distribution data. The error matrix using the in situ reference data for HLM image classification was 81-95% accurate, and Kappa coefficients were between 0.72 and 0.91. The results indicated that 186.2 ha (or 35.8%) of the original seagrass beds were lost in the last three decades at Van Phong Bay, and decline in each specific site may have been due to different causes. Typhoons may have caused the loss of seagrass beds at open-sea sites whereas aquaculture activities, excavation and terrigenous obliteration may have caused such losses in protected sites.

TI  - Prediction architecture of deep learning assisted short long term neural network for advanced traffic critical prediction system using remote sensing data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a Neural Convolutional Network (NCN) based approach for learning traffic as images and predicting high accuracy network-wide broad traffic speed. In the recent past, images describe time and space of traffic flow, where a 2-dimensional time-space matrix is used to convert space dynamics. In recent years, neural networks have been widely used for the prediction of short term traffic, where the description is covered by an NCN in two consecutive steps: abstract data extraction and network-wide traffic forecast. This paper proposes Prediction Architecture of Neural Convolutional Short Long Term Network (PANCSLTN) for the purpose of effectively capturing dynamic nonlinear traffic systems with deep learning assistance. The PANCSLTN can resolve the problem of backdated decay error via memory blocks and shows superior prediction capacity for time series with long-time dependency. Moreover, PANCSLTN can determine the optimum time laggards automatically and the travel data from Beijing microwave traffic detectors which are used for model the training and testing to validate the effective PANCSLTN using remote sensing technique. PANCSLTN can deliver the most accurate and stable prediction performance compared to different topologies in dynamical neural resealing networks or other dominant parametric and nonparametric algorithms during experimental analysis.

TI  - Classification and mapping of saltmarsh vegetation combining multispectral images with field data
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are areas of high conservation value encompassing diverse ecological gradients responsible for creating unique vegetation structure and composition. In complement to the large body of studies developing vegetation mapping methods through the use of remote sensing data, we tested for the possibility of developing a cost-effective method to map salt marsh vegetation as a basis for monitoring a French Nature Reserve. Using classical multivariate ordination and cluster analyses, accurate and ecologically relevant vegetation groups matching existing typologies were determined from a vegetation database collected for management and conservation rather than mapping purposes. This resulted in six distinct vegetation groups, which were mapped through the combination of the NIR spectral band and radiometric indices (NDVI and NDWI) derived from multispectral 2 m-resolution satellite images (Pleiades images). The addition of a LiDAR-derived digital elevation model (DEM) layer was also tested. The final classified map of the reserve based only on optical layers had an overall accuracy of 75.5% (Kappa coefficient of 0.71), with varying success between the different vegetation groups. The addition of the DEM slightly decreased map accuracy to 73.6% (Kappa of 0.68). Decreasing the number of records used for map training had detectable negative effects on map accuracy. This study demonstrated that using already existing field observations combined with only a few spectral bands and radiometric indices from multi-temporal multispectral images with a high spatial resolution can be used as a basis to aid in vegetation classification and mapping of saltmarsh habitats, with the goal of monitoring their dynamics.

M3  - Article
AB  - In order to make full use of the link resources for data transmission from near-earth remote sensing satellites, variable coding modulation (VCM) system is used to fully utilize the system link margin to improve the satellite data transmission performance. By analyzing the dynamic link under the VCM data transmission system, the contribution of the VCM system to the satellite data link optimization is studied from the perspective of engineering application, which can provide reference for the data link design of remote sensing satellites. Applying the flow design, for the currently adopted transmission system of X band, compared with traditional constant coding modulation (CCM) system, the average link performance of VCM system can be increased by 42.1% in single-station transmission mode and 53.3% in dual-station relay mode through the exampled analysis.

TI  - Analysis of properties of the 19 February 2018 volcanic eruption of Mount Sinabung in S5P/TROPOMI and Himawari-8 satellite data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an analysis of TROPOMI cloud heights as a proxy for volcanic plume heights in the presence of absorbing aerosols and sulfur dioxide for the 19 February 2018 eruption plume of the Sinabung volcano on Sumatra, Indonesia.Comparison with CALIPSO satellite data shows that all three TROPOMI cloud height data products based on oxygen absorption which are considered here (FRESCO, ROCINN, O22CLD) provide volcanic ash cloud heights comparable to heights measured by CALIPSO for optically thick volcanic ash clouds. FRESCO and ROCINN heights are very similar, with the only differences for FRESCO cloud top heights above 14 km altitude. O22CLD cloud top heights unsurprisingly fall below those of FRESCO and ROCINN, as the O22CLD retrieval is less sensitive to cloud top heights above 10 km altitude. For optically thin volcanic ash clouds, i.e., when Earth's surface or clouds at lower altitudes shine through the volcanic ash cloud, retrieved heights fall below the volcanic ash cloud heights derived from CALIPSO data.Evaluation of corresponding Himawari-8 geostationary infrared (IR) brightness temperature differences (Delta BTs) - a signature for detection of volcanic ash clouds in geostationary satellite data and widely used as input for quantitative volcanic ash cloud retrievals - reveals that for this particular eruption the Delta BT volcanic ash signature changes to a Delta BT ice crystal signature for the part of the ash plume reaching the upper troposphere beyond 10 km altitude several hours after the start of the eruption and which TROPOMI clearly characterizes as volcanic (SO2 > 1 DU - Dobson units - and AAI > 4 - absorbing aerosol index - or, more conservatively, SO2 > 10). The presence of ice in volcanic ash clouds is known to prevent the detection of volcanic ash clouds based on broadband geostationary satellite data. TROPOMI does not suffer from this effect and can provide valuable and accurate information about volcanic ash clouds and ash top heights in cases where commonly used geostationary IR measurements of volcanic ash clouds fail.

TI  - High-spatiotemporal-resolution mapping of global urban change from 1985 to 2015
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution global maps of annual urban land coverage provide fundamental information of global environmental change and contribute to applications related to climate mitigation and urban planning for sustainable development. Here we map global annual urban dynamics from 1985 to 2015 at a 30 m resolution using numerous surface reflectance data from Landsat satellites. We find that global urban extent has expanded by 9,687 km(2) per year. This rate is four times greater than previous reputable estimates from worldwide individual cities, suggesting an unprecedented rate of global urbanization. The rate of urban expansion is notably faster than that of population growth, indicating that the urban land area already exceeds what is needed to sustain population growth. Looking ahead, using these maps in conjunction with integrated assessment models can facilitate greater understanding of the complex environmental impacts of urbanization and help urban planners avoid natural hazards; for example, by limiting new development in flood risk zones.The world keeps urbanizing. This study finds that since 1985 global urban lands have expanded four times faster than previously recognized and faster than population is growing.

TI  - Prevalence of aphasia and dysarthria among inpatient stroke survivors: describing the population, therapy provision and outcomes on discharge
T2  - APHASIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Stroke causes communication impairments but we lack the real-world population-level data needed to inform inpatient and community services. Aims: To establish prevalence of aphasia and dysarthria within inpatient stroke survivors, describe those affected, the amount of therapy they receive and their outcomes. Methods & Procedures: Secondary analysis of data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme, England, Wales and Norther Ireland, including inpatient stroke survivors after 72 hours, with completed National Institute of Health Stroke Scale data (communication items), excluding those already discharged, not conscious or with incomplete data. Outcomes & Results: 64% of the 88,974 stroke survivors meeting our criteria were communication impaired: 28% had both aphasia and dysarthria, 24% had dysarthria only and 12% had aphasia only. Those in the older age range and with more severe stroke were more likely to have a communication impairment and had a worse outcome than those without communication impairment. On average, those with both communication impairments had a 21 day length of stay and 10 minutes of speech and language therapy for communication and/or dysphagia per day of stay. Conclusions: Communication impairment is common during the inpatient phase of stroke care yet average therapy provision is below the recommended levels and is likely to include dysphagia assessment and intervention. Dysarthria is reported as more prevalent than aphasia at this early stage, although this is not necessarily diagnosed by a speech and language therapist. The most common presentation is to have a combination of aphasia and dysarthria for which there is limited clinical guidance.

TI  - Developing and Testing the Transformative Travel Experience Scale (TTES)
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformative travel encourages tourists to self-reflect, question their assumptions, and develop a more tolerant worldview. While this form of travel is gaining attention, there is unmet demand for a scale that measures the complex transformative travel experience and potential outcomes. This study focuses on developing the Transformative Travel Experience Scale (TTES). The study applies a well-tested approach based on DeVellis and Podsakoff et al. to reveal that a four-dimensional scale, composed of the dimensions of local residents and culture, self-assurance, disorienting dilemma, and joy, can be successfully used to measure the process and outcomes of transformative travel. From a theoretical perspective, the findings suggest that the disorienting dilemma might occur at different points in time. The Transformative Travel Experience Scale is helpful to organizations that want to capture the positive changes resulting from participation in transformative travel when applying for certifications, awards, and grants.

TI  - Combining synthetic aperture radar and multispectral images for land cover classification: a case study of Beijing, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose exploratory research combining synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, represented by Sentinel-1A, and multispectral data, represented by Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI), to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of land cover classification based on a Beijing case study. The proposed method consists of two phases. In the fusion phase, we select three methods to evaluate the performance of integrated Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 OLI images. In the classification phase, we choose four common methods to examine the classifying capability hidden within the fused images. Experimental results indicate that the Gram-Schmidt spectral sharpening is superior in terms of maintaining the geometric structure, spectral texture, and spatial information, demonstrating a better fusion effect than other methods. The support vector machine classification exhibits the best performance of the fused images, with an overall classification accuracy of 94.01% and a kappa coefficient of 0.91. The fused images provide better classification potential as they benefit from having more spatial information and spectral information distribution, and the mean value of overall classification accuracy and the kappa coefficient are on average 5.61% and 0.08 higher, respectively, than the original Landsat-8. Finally, we conclude that the integrated use of SAR and multispectral images significantly improves classification accuracies, thus making it effective for land cover information extraction.

TI  - WE-NDBI-A new index for mapping urban built-up areas from GF-1 WFV images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, China has witnessed rapid development of high-resolution imaging satellites, with remote sensing images from satellites being applied extensively in social and economic sectors. The normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) was first used to extract urban built-up areas from TM/ETM+ image data. After successful launch of the Landsat-8 satellite, modifications have been made to the NDBI approach (BBIOLI approach) for mapping urban built-up areas from operational land imager (OLI) data with higher accuracy. However, experiments showed that the BBIOLI approach is not very suitable for Chinese high-resolution satellite image data. This study firstly analysed the spectral curves of ground objects generated by the GF-1 satellite and then proposes an innovative WE-NDBI approach to mapping urban built-up in the study area, i.e. large counties located in Xichang. The experimental results demonstrate an overall accuracy of 91.4%. To compare the WE-NDBI and BBIOLI approaches, the latter was used to extract urban built-up areas from OLI data for the same study area, and the experimental accuracy is 77.0%. It is concluded that the WE-NDBI approach is more suitable for mapping urban built-up areas.

This approach is composed by of three steps. In the beginning, urban, peri-urban and rural regions are detected from the night-time light image by a contour line algorithm. Then, using Landsat TM image, region-specific spectral index analysis is employed to generate initial training samples of urban land covers. Finally, an iterative classification framework is applied to select new training samples by integrating spectral and spatial information and to obtain the final mapping result. Experimental results of two cities show that the proposed method produces higher classification accuracy than the ones using the manual-sampling methods. Moreover, further validations suggested that the spatial information is able to effectively increase the producer's accuracy of impervious surface. This automated approach is potentially important for large-scale regional impervious surface mapping and application.

TI  - A case study on the relationship between land surface temperature and land surface indices in Raipur City, India
T2  - GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) depends primarily on the land surface material and climatic conditions. The present study focuses on deriving the LST of Raipur City and generating the relationship between LST and some land surface indices, like NDVI, NDWI, NDBI, NMDI, and NDBaI for better land-use planning and environmental management inside the city. These land surface indices respond in different ways with the changes of LST in an urban landscape. There are only a few numbers of research works available on the relationship of LST and land surface indices in a tropical city for pre-monsoon season. The present study has been performed on a total of fifteen multi-date Landsat data sets of the pre-monsoon season from 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018. The mono-window algorithm has been applied in retrieving the LST. Results show that LST builds a positive relation with NDBI, NDBaI, and NDWI and a negative relation with NDVI and NMDI. These relationships are stronger in the area below mean LST (low LST zones) and weaker in the area above mean LST (high LST zones). It indicates that the values of LST are largely influenced by the different land surfaces, like vegetation, water, soil, and built-up area.

T2  - ACTA CHIRURGICA BELGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is important for metastasis surveillance in the management of a number of human cancers. Identification of sentinel lymph nodes may be facilitated by the use of several methods including methylene blue injection. However tissue necrosis is a known effect of methylene blue application. This study aimed to investigate the effects of methylene blue injection on skin flaps using a rodent model. Methods: Modified McFarlane flaps were prepared using Wistar Albino rats. Local injection of methylene blue was given to one group while saline was injected into the control group. A third group received systemic methylene blue via intraperitoneal injection. Observational and histological comparison was made between the groups to investigate the necrotic effects of methylene blue on skip flaps. Results: The control group's surviving flap areas were significantly larger than local methylene blue group's surviving flap area. However, there was no significant difference in skin flap survival area between the control group and the systemic methylene blue group. Furthermore, there is no significant difference between local and systemic methylene blue group's surviving flap areas. Conclusions: Local methylene blue injection increases skin necrosis and decreases rates of surviving flap areas in an experimental rat models.

TI  - Detection of sea-surface wind patterns associated with convective systems and their evolution using a combination of Sentinel-1 and Radarsat-2 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can detect wind patterns induced by the Convective Systems (CS) downdraughts hitting the sea surface due to their high spatial resolution and large swath. Additionally, the combination of two successive SAR images (Sentinel-1 and Radarsat-2) with appropriate observation time delays may enable the observation of wind pattern evolution. The corresponding METEOSAT-10/11 infrared images to the SAR ones are used for the detection of deep convective clouds that are potentially associated with wind patterns. The current paper investigates two cases of time delays (1-minute and 5-minute) between two satellites. The estimated wind speeds by CMOD5.N on Sentinel-1 and Radarsat-2 images are almost the same for the background wind areas. However, the intensity of wind patterns on Radarsat-2 images (acquired 1 and 5 minutes later) is decreased, possibly due to a change of downdraught intensity according to observation time. In the 1-minute delay case, the drop of wind intensity is mainly observed for the intense spots (20-25 m s(-1)), while in the 5-minute delay case, it is noticed for both intense and moderate (10-15 m s(-1)) convection spots. The intensity of the high-wind convection spots decreases more quickly since the associated convective-scale downdraughts reach the sea surface more rapidly.

TI  - Evaluating the 2018 extreme flood hazard events in Kerala, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The very high anomalous precipitation (more than 500 mm) and release of water from reservoirs located in an upper catchment resulted in severe flood inundation situation in downslope regions of Kerala State in August 2018. In the present study, the satellite-based precipitation was analyzed on a daily to weekly basis during the flood duration in Kerala. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) based precipitation pattern indicated very high rainfall (more than 60 mm day(-1)) in the central parts of Kerala on 14 and 15August 2018. The climate research unit (CRU) based long-term mean cumulative precipitation (1901-2017) indicated high (300-400 mm) to very high (more than 500 mm) anomalous precipitation in parts of Kerala during August 2018 leading to severe flood inundation in major parts of the state. The Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) based inundation mapping exhibited flooding of 1100.4 km(2) area (5.80% of total area) during August 2018, which severely affected Alappuzha, Thrissur, and Kottayam districts. Cropland (218.69 km(2)), settlement (115.23 km(2)) and shrubland (79.46 km(2)) were the most affected land-use/land-cover in the region. The study warrants the restoration of ecological stability and augmentation of resilience to flooding hazard primarily in the upper catchments (the Western Ghats).

TI  - Study of usability of aerial images and high-resolution satellite images in cadastre renewal works in Turkey
T2  - SURVEY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - If the usability of orthophotos of aerial images and high-resolution satellite images in cadastre renewal works is ensured, the state cadastre can be maintained and constantly updated. For this purpose, three pilot fields in Konya, Adana and Sanliurfa were selected. In these fields, land surveys were made with a CORS method by using GPS. The coordinates were obtained by using orthophotos in Konya (1/2000 scale) and in Adana (1/5000 scale) and orthophotos with 1/5000 scale obtained from WorldView-2 high-resolution satellite images in Sanliurfa. One aim was to establish the positional accuracy of the data obtained from digital orthophotos and area accuracy in comparison with cadastral areas by presuming that the land surveys were accurate. In light of the discovered results, comments on the usability of orthophotos obtained from aerial images and high-resolution satellite images in renewal cadastre were made.

TI  - Assessing spatiotemporal settlement patterns in Eastern Free State, South Africa, pre and post transition from apartheid to majority rule
T2  - Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial patterns of human settlements, their changes and their geographical implications are important for understanding the drivers of land use and land cover change. This paper examines the spatiotemporal pattern of settlement development in three different settlements of Thabo Mofutsanyane municipal district namely Harrismith, Vrede and Ladybrand using GIS, remote sensing and spatial metrics techniques. The study is based on 30 years of time-series data compiled from satellite images with emphasis on pre and post 1994's (the year of change in government from apartheid to majority rule) spatial change in settlement development. Landsat 4-5 imageries for 1989, 1999, 2009 and Landsat 8 OLI for 2018 were downloaded and classified for land use/land cover change (LULCC). Also, landscape and class metrics were computed using Fragstats QGIS 2.18.9 to generate spatial analysis. A dynamic spatial pattern is observed in the settlements under study. Urban built-up areas had a rapid trend of growth in Harrismith from 1989 (5 years before transition from apartheid to majority rule) to 1999 (5 years after transition from apartheid to majority rule) but later slowed down in the subsequent years under study while Ladybrand and Vrede had moderate growth trend in the subsequent years under study. The settlement development process has developed fragmented and heterogeneous land use combinations in the years after 1994. At landscape level, land fragmentation occurred due to land use changes and significant urban expansion; Ladybrand experienced more physical connectedness than Harrismith and Vrede. While at class level, Harrismith and Vrede are more aggregated or physically connected than Ladybrand; this means Ladybrand was relatively more fragmented than the other two settlements. The study results show that a LULCC and landscape metrics integrated approach is effective to analyse and describe the spatial patterns of urban landscapes.

TI  - Dynamics of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and reflectance to detect stress-induced variations in canopy photosynthesis
T2  - PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive measurement of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) represents the most promising tool to quantify changes in photosynthetic functioning on a large scale. However, the complex relationship between this signal and other photosynthesis-related processes restricts its interpretation under stress conditions. To address this issue, we conducted a field campaign by combining daily airborne and ground-based measurements of F (normalized to photosynthetically active radiation), reflectance and surface temperature and related the observed changes to stress-induced variations in photosynthesis. A lawn carpet was sprayed with different doses of the herbicide Dicuran. Canopy-level measurements of gross primary productivity indicated dosage-dependent inhibition of photosynthesis by the herbicide. Dosage-dependent changes in normalized F were also detected. After spraying, we first observed a rapid increase in normalized F and in the Photochemical Reflectance Index, possibly due to the blockage of electron transport by Dicuran and the resultant impairment of xanthophyll-mediated non-photochemical quenching. This initial increase was followed by a gradual decrease in both signals, which coincided with a decline in pigment-related reflectance indices. In parallel, we also detected a canopy temperature increase after the treatment. These results demonstrate the potential of using F coupled with relevant reflectance indices to estimate stress-induced changes in canopy photosynthesis.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Following the identification of endometrial intravascular thrombi (IVT) as the presenting feature in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome, additional biopsy specimens were reviewed to determine the frequency and histological associations of IVT in the endometrium.Methods and Results Eighty-five additional biopsies were reviewed including 44 consecutive cases demonstrating shedding changes (both menstrual and non-cyclical), 30 cases without shedding (normal and non-cyclical), and 11 cases in which unusually prominent IVT had been recorded upon initial histological assessment. In the shedding group, IVT were significantly more common in biopsies showing disordered proliferative endometrium (DPE, 4/7 cases) than normal menstrual appearances (4/22 cases), and organising vascular changes were seen only in the former. IVT in DPE cases were also commonly multifocal and sometimes involved abnormal ectatic vessels. None of the 30 non-shedding cases demonstrated IVT. Eight of the 11 biopsies with prominent IVT demonstrated DPE and shedding but three cases demonstrated otherwise normal cyclical appearances.Conclusions IVT may be seen occasionally in normal menstrual endometrium but are more characteristic of DPE, and organising vascular changes are suggestive of abnormal haemostasis. An underlying thrombotic disorder may be considered when endometrial IVT occur in the absence of shedding changes.

TI  - Climate disturbance impact assessment in West Africa: evidence from field survey and satellite imagery analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme drought events from climate disturbances are weakening livelihood and limiting agriculture and livestock production in the Sahel region. The lack of relevant information to anticipate coping measures has exacerbated impacts leading to climate adaptation failure in most parts. In this regard, the current research paper has collected important datasets with an objective to assess the impact of extreme drought events on household's livelihoods for better understanding impacts, local people's perception, and the changes on vegetation cover in order to support a robust adaptation strategy to drought. The study conducted a household survey and collected satellite data for comparative analysis. The first survey was conducted in 2013 to collect data from 465 household heads through a structured questionnaire. Supplementary focus group discussions (FGDs) were also conducted in 2018 to collect qualitative information from targeted respondents such as village leaders and members of other key groups including women and youth. Descriptive statistics and correlation coefficient matrix were used to characterize the impact on households' main livelihoods and logistic regression to predict people's perception on pasture depletion over the last 20 years. Satellite data were used to derive spectral vegetation of land covers and unsupervised classification indexes. Both individual survey and focus group discussions identified drought as the main climate constraint which reduced crop production, water and pastures. The logistic analysis revealed that if the respondent's major occupation is livestock, the probability to perceive a depletion of pasture will increase by 28%. Concurrently, the satellite image observation in perfect agreement with the field survey showed 6.78% and 6.01% losses of water surface and vegetation cover respectively between 1986 and 2016 in the study area. These findings showed that logistic regression coupled with satellite information can inform on past and future impacts which are extremely crucial for sound adaptation planning in the Sahel region.

TI  - Soil water content monitoring using joint application of PDI and TVDI drought indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology provides a viable way for large-scale soil water content (SWC) estimation. The perpendicular drought index (PDI) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) are two drought indices that can reflect SWC based on remote sensing data. These two indices have their own set of pros and cons when used independently for SWC estimation: PDI is primarily suitable for low vegetation coverage, whereas TVDI is more suitable for dense vegetation coverage. Thus, it might be inappropriate to employ a single model for the entire growth cycle. In this study, the relationship between PDI/TVDI and SWC at soil depths of 0-20 cm, 0-30 cm and 0-40 cm was analysed. We found that the estimation accuracy of the PDI/TVDI model was markedly affected by soil depth and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Two combination approaches (joint and combined models) based on PDI and TVDI indices were established. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the joint/combined models were 1.49%/1.48% at 0-20 cm, 1.46%/1.48% at 0-30 cm and 1.86%/1.90% at 0-40 cm. Our results show that both combination models are suitable for regional SWC estimation.

TI  - The area extraction of winter wheat in mixed planting area based on Sentinel-2 a remote sensing satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PARALLEL EMERGENT AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional area extraction method mainly depends on manual field survey methods, it is workload, slow and high cost. While remote sensing technology has the advantages of accuracy, rapidity, macroscopic and dynamic, which has become an effective means to extract crop growing area. In this paper, we took Kaifeng City in Henan Province as the study area. Firstly, we explored the advantages of Sentinel-2A RENDVI in crop identification. Then used the supervised classification SVM, object-oriented classification method and assisted with field measured data to extract the winter wheat planting area, the characteristics of the two methods were compared and analysed. Finally, we combined the above two classification methods and proposed a new classification method V2OAE to remove unnecessary influencing factors. The experiment results showed that RENDVI has better recognition ability than the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) in distinguishing vegetation with similar spectrum, the classification effect of object-oriented classification is better than supervised classification SVM, and our classification method removes unnecessary influence factors in the results of object-oriented classification, which is further improve the monitoring accuracy.Firstly, we have preprocessed the Sentinel-2A image data, its steps are: (1) In the first step, we made radiation calibration for remote sensing images to eliminate the image distortion caused by external factors, data acquisition and transmission systems and so on; (2) In the second step, we made atmospheric correction to eliminate changes in the spectral feature of remote sensing images caused by atmospheric absorption or scattering; (3) In the third step, we made band resampling to unify the resolution of remote sensing images and facilitate the mathematical combination operation of vegetation index; (4) In the fourth step, we made mosaic and cutting to get preprocessed remote sensing images of Kaifeng City. Secondly, we analysed the spectral features of each object and established the interpretation mark with the field measured data. then we explored the ability to identify the ground objects based on NDVI(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and RENDVI. Third, we used the rule-based object-oriented classification method and SVM classification to extract the planting area of the study area, the input definition of SVM is spectral feature images of ground objects and the output definition of SVM is the recognition result of ground objects in the process of data training. Then the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods in classification results were analysed. Finally, In order to extract winter wheat information more accurately, we combined the above two classification methods and proposed a new classification method V2OAE (Vector Object Oriented Area Extraction) to remove unnecessary influencing factors, then the winter wheat planting area in Kaifeng City was statistically obtained.

TI  - Regional scale soil moisture content estimation based on multi-source remote sensing parameters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) is a basic condition for crop growth, and a key parameter for crop yield prediction and drought monitoring. An advantage of large-scale synchronous observation using remote sensing technology is that it provides the possibility of dynamic monitoring of soil moisture content in a large area. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of accurately estimating soil moisture content at a regional scale by combining ground hyper-spectral data with multispectral remote sensing (Sentinel-2) data. The results showed that the different mathematical transformations increased the correlation between soil spectral reflectance and SMC to varying degrees. Hyper-spectral optimized index normalized difference index (NDI) ((B-769 similar to 797 - B-848 similar to 881/B-769 similar to 797 + B-848 similar to 881); (B-842 - B-740/B-842 + B-740)) derived from the transformed reflectance (the first-order derivate of reciprocal-logarithm (Log (1/R))', second-order derivate of reciprocal-logarithm (Log (1/R)) '') showed significant correlation (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.61; r = 0.47) with SMC, and the correlation coefficient values higher than difference index (DI) and ratio index (RI). From the performance of 12 prediction models which were taken optimized indices as independent variables, the central wavelength reflectance model (Log (1/R))'' and the average wavelength reflectance model ((Log (1/R)) ' presented higher validation coefficients (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.61, root mean square error (RMSE) = 4.09%, residual prediction deviation (RPD) = 1.82; R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 3.48%, RPD = 1.91) compared with other models. When verifying the accuracy, the model yields R-2 values of 0.619 and 0.701. These results indicated that the two-band hyper-spectral optimized indices (NDI) as an optimal indicator for quickly and accurately soil moisture content estimation. Combining the ground hyper-spectral data and satellite remote sensing image regional scale soil moisture content prediction provides a scientific reference for land-space integrated soil moisture content remote sensing monitoring.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A landslide inventory is indispensable for determination of landslide susceptibility, hazard, risk assessment and disaster mitigation strategies. These inventories were traditionally developed using manual digitization of remote sensing images and aerial photographs, and pixel-based image classification. Recently, Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) supersedes visual interpretation and pixel-based methods. OBIA utilizes spectral, textural, contextual, morphological and topographical information in remote sensing images. However, OBIA-based landslide detection methods are often designed for specific areas and remote sensing dataset. The aim of this study is to evaluate the transferability of three published OBIA landslide detection methods for semi-automated landslide detection in the Himalaya mountainous region of northern Pakistan. A SPOT-6 multi-spectral image with Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derivatives, i.e. slope, aspect, hill-shade, relief, elevation and stream network are used for landslide detection using eCognition developer software. The three published methods scale parameters for image segmentation and parameter thresholds are evaluated first. It is observed that the aforementioned methods are not directly applicable to our study area and remote sensing datasets. Therefore, an alternate (proposed) method is developed for semi-automated landslide detection. Accuracy assessment of the selected methods and proposed method is assessed by Precision, Recall and F1 measures. Using the proposed method, a total of 357 landslides are detected with 91.46% Precision, 93.31% Recall and 92.38% F1 measure accuracy.

TI  - Research on a novel extraction method using Deep Learning based on GF-2 images for aquaculture areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, moderate-resolution remote sensing images have been widely used in extracting coastal aquaculture areas that are usually used to obtain marine fishery resources. However, in moderate-resolution remote sensing images, the aquaculture areas destroyed by storm-tide are hard to be observed. In order to get information of coastal aquaculture areas quickly and accurately, to help the scientific management and the planning of aquaculture resources and to meet the needs of disaster emergency response, it is imperative to extract aquaculture areas based on high-resolution remote sensing images. However, as the spatial resolution increases, there are many disadvantages that traditional pixel-level classification methods bring about, for example, the sediments and some floatage on the water surface are easy to be mistaken as aquaculture areas. In view of these problems, we proposed a novel Semantic Segmentation Network, named Hybrid Dilated Convolution U-Net (HDCUNet), which combines U-Net and Hybrid Dilated Convolution (HDC) to further expend receptive field and prevent the 'gridding' problem simultaneously. In this paper, we chose Gaofen-2 images as experimental data to extract aquaculture areas, and the Precisions and Recalls of two types of aquaculture areas are both above 95% and the overall accuracy reaches up to 99.16%. Besides, we compared the extraction accuracy with other four methods: FCN-8s, SegNet, U-Net and Threshold Segmentation (TS) to analyse the extraction effect and verify the validity of HDCUNet.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of vegetation due to drought dynamics (2012-2017): a case study of the Upper Paraiba River basin, Brazil
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices have been widely used for monitoring the spatiotemporal variables of vegetation and characterizing droughts, primarily in semiarid regions. Drought is a multifaceted natural process that can lead to reduced water availability and can consequently have extensive effects on the socioeconomic, agricultural and development sectors of countries. This study aims to evaluate the spatial-temporal pattern of vegetation as a result of drought dynamics during the last major drought (2012-2017) in the Brazilian semiarid region. Satellite image products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD16, MOD11 and MOD15), standardized precipitation index, rainfall anomaly and vegetation indices were used to monitor and identify drought episodes. To relate vegetation with droughts, the vegetation supply water index was used. The results revealed a strong influence of droughts on vegetation behavior and a strong seasonal pattern of variables in the study area, primarily for land surface temperature, leaf area index and evapotranspiration. These results lead to the conclusion that, based on correlations between vegetation and droughts over a climatological period, it is possible to evaluate the relative roles of vegetation behavior for semiarid regions using MODIS products.

TI  - Remote sensing-based river discharge estimation for a small river flowing over the high mountain regions of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - River discharge, as one of the most essential climate variables, plays a vital role in the water cycle. Small-scale headwater catchments including high-mountain regions of Tibetan Plateau (TP) Rivers are mostly ungauged. Satellite technology shows its potential to fill this gap with a high correlation of satellite-derived effective river width and corresponding in-situ gauged discharge. This study is innovative in estimating daily river discharge using modified Manning equation (Model 1), Bjerklie equation (Model 2), and Rating curve approach (Model 3) by combining river surface hydraulic variables directly derived from remote-sensing datasets with other variables indirectly derived from empirical equations, which greatly contributes to the improvement of river flow measurement information especially over small rivers of TP. We extracted the effective width from Landsat image and flow depth via hydraulic geometry approach. All the input parameters directly or indirectly derived from remote sensing were combined and substituted into the fundamental flow equations/models to estimate discharges of Lhasa River. The validation of all three models' results against the in-situ discharge measurements shows a strong correlation (the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2) values >= 0.993), indicating the potentiality of the models in accurately estimating daily river discharges. Trends of an overestimation of discharge by Model 1 and underestimation by Model 2 are observed. The discharge estimation by using Model 3 outperforms Model 1 and Model 2 due to the uncertainties associated with the estimation of input parameters in the other two models. Generally, our discharge estimation methodology performs well and shows a superior result as compared with previously developed multivariate empirical equations and its application for other places globally can be the focus of upcoming studies.

TI  - Parameter estimation and evaluation of Ross-Li and RPV models for wheat phenophases using hemispherical directional reflectance measurements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hemispherical directional reflectance factor (HDRF) measurements of wheat crop acquired with field goniometer system are used to estimate parameters and evaluate anisotropic reflectance models. The HDRFs were sampled at 54 view angles (6 azimuthal planes x 9 view zenith angles) to cover the hemispheric span up to 60 degrees zenith. The observations were made at 7-8 days' interval during different phenophases of the crop. Biophysical parameters were also measured parallel to HDRF. Kernel driven Ross-Li variants and RPV (Rehman Pinty Verstrate) models parameters are generated by fitting HDRF data. RossThin-H/LiSparse-R model was fitted best for all visible-near infrared bands in early phenophases while the RossThick-H/LiSparse-R model was best fitted for heading and flowering phases in most cases. In late grain development phases (Late milking and Dough) of the wheat, HDRFs of visible bands were best fitted with RossThin-H/LiDense-R model in most instances. The HDRF simulation of wheat by RPV models is identical to Ross-Li models. Both models are adequate to account reflectance anisotropy of wheat canopy. Phenophase specific model parameters can be used to reconstruct reflectance anisotropy of wheat for different applications.

TI  - Southern Caspian Sea wind speed retrieval from C-band Sentinel-1A SAR images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has shown the good capability for ocean wind speed retrieval. However, SAR wind speed retrieval above enclosed seas has been investigated rarely. In this study, the performance of geophysical model functions (GMFs) for the southern Caspian Sea wind speed retrieval from VV-polarized C-band Sentinel-1A SAR images is investigated. The used GMFs are recently developed empirical CMOD7 and C_SARMOD2, and two theoretical GMFs, which are derived in a simplified form based on the small-slope approximation (SSA) method with Hwang-Elfouhaily (H-E) and Hwang-McDaniel (H-M) composite sea spectra. Required wind directions for retrievals are obtained from wind streaks on SAR images by the local gradient (LG) method, a weather prediction model and in situ measurements. Estimations of all GMFs show good statistical agreements with predictions and in situ measurements. At 25-km resolution, all retrievals have mean biases better than +/- 0.7 m s(-1), and root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) and standard deviations below 2 m s(-1) relative to predicted wind speeds. At 1-km resolution, using in situ measured directions, root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of retrievals relative to in situ measured wind speeds are below 1.9 m s(-1), and mean biases are better than +/- 0.7 m s(-1). Of all the GMFs, CMOD7 has the best performance with the smallest RMSEs, and C_SARMOD2 has a good performance, except for very low winds. The theoretical GMF with H-M spectrum has a better performance than the model with H-E spectrum, and both of them can be used to retrieve Caspian Sea wind speeds from Sentinel-1A data, except for the crosswind condition with radar incident angle of about 45 degrees.

TI  - Accuracy of carrot yield forecasting using proximal hyperspectral and satellite multispectral data
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Proximal and remote sensors have proved their effectiveness for the estimation of several biophysical and biochemical variables, including yield, in many different crops. Evaluation of their accuracy in vegetable crops is limited. This study explored the accuracy of proximal hyperspectral and satellite multispectral sensors (Sentinel-2 and WorldView-3) for the prediction of carrot root yield across three growing regions featuring different cropping configurations, seasons and soil conditions. Above ground biomass (AGB), canopy reflectance measurements and corresponding yield measures were collected from 414 sample sites in 24 fields in Western Australia (WA), Queensland (Qld) and Tasmania (Tas), Australia. The optimal sensor (hyperspectral or multispectral) was identified by the highest overall coefficient of determination between yield and different vegetation indices (VIs) whilst linear and non-linear models were tested to determine the best VIs and the impact of the spatial resolution. The optimal regression fit per region was used to extrapolate the point source measurements to all pixels in each sampled crop to produce a forecasted yield map and estimate average carrot root yield (t/ha) at the crop level. The latter were compared to commercial carrot root yield (t/ha) obtained from the growers to determine the accuracy of prediction. The measured yield varied from 17 to 113 t/ha across all crops, with forecasts of average yield achieving overall accuracies (% error) of 9.2% in WA, 10.2% in Qld and 12.7% in Tas. VIs derived from hyperspectral sensors produced poorer yield correlation coefficients (R-2 < 0.1) than similar measures from the multispectral sensors (R-2 < 0.57, p < 0.05). Increasing the spatial resolution from 10 to 1.2 m improved the regression performance by 69%. It is impossible to non-destructively estimate the pre-harvest spatial yield variability of root vegetables such as carrots. Hence, this method of yield forecasting offers great benefit for managing harvest logistics and forward selling decisions.

TI  - Mapping a lithologically complex terrain using Sentinel-2A data: a case study of Suriyan area, southwestern Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Suriyan area, southwestern Iran, possesses a variety of sedimentary, volcanic, and metamorphic rocks. This paper investigates the potential of Sentinel-2A multispectral data for lithological mapping of this geologically complex terrain using the principal component analysis (PCA), band ratio, and spectral information divergence (SID) methods. Spectral features of lithological units were analysed by surveying the laboratory spectra of hand samples, the resampled spectra of rock types to spectra from Sentinel-2A wavelength ranges, and the spectra extracted directly from applied imagery. The absorption features dominantly attributed to Fe2+, Fe3+, and Al-OH electronic and vibrational modes were observable in Sentinel-2A bands; however, the main absorption feature of Mg-OH and C-O near 2.33 mu m is not collected in a distinct band by this satellite. Data processing results revealed that PCA was more successful in discriminating vegetation, greenschist, and shale, whereas it could not differentiate various types of limestone. The proposed Band Ratios, (46)/(78), (2 + 11 + 6)/(3 + 4), 12/8, and 2/5, enhanced sandstone, shale, basaltic dyke, greenschist, mica schist, meta-tuff, and various types of limestone. However, the SID algorithm discriminated few lithological units including greenschist, mica schist, shale, and Fe-bearing limestone. Considering output results, it was suggested that proposed band ratios as well as the PCA method were more successful in discriminating various lithological units, while the SID algorithm was advantageous in enhancing the metamorphic units. Field observations and microscopic studies verified the occurrences of rock units and their spatial compatibility with differentiated lithologies. It was concluded that Sentinel-2A data were successful in enhancement and discrimination of various rock types in a lithologically complex terrain.

TI  - Evaluating the accuracy of and evaluating the potential errors in extracting vegetation phenology through remote sensing in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remote sensing to study vegetation phenology faces a problem related to extraction methods. Phenology data from different methods vary greatly but there is a lack of widely recognized methods and evaluation approaches. In this study, based on the Leaf Area Index data from 2009 to 2015, we used two common fitting methods (Savitzky-Golay filter and Double Logistic function) and three phenological determining methods (Seasonal amplitude, Absolute value, and Seasonal Trend decomposition by Loess) to extract vegetation phenology in China. Using different thresholds, we obtained 18 extraction method combinations. Then the ground-based observations data from 31 phenology stations in relation to three key vegetation phenophases: Start Of growing Season (SOS), End Of growing Season (EOS) and Length Of growing Season (LOS) were used to evaluate the accuracy of these 18 method combinations. The results under five evaluation indicators showed that the suitable method combinations for SOS, EOS, and LOS were different. Compared with ground-based observations, SOS and EOS extracted by the suitable method combinations were delayed by 6.28 and 4.91 days, and the LOS was shorter. The potential difference of the suitable and unsuitable method combinations respectively reached -44.73, -35.79, and 37.38 days (for SOS, EOS, and LOS), clearly indicating the importance of selecting suitable method combination. The phenology dataset from Vegetation Index & Phenology (VIP) Lab. has also confirmed the reliability of our results. Furthermore, we explored the differences between remote sensing and ground-based phenology. Our study highlights the importance of using a suitable method combination to extract the vegetation phenology and provides a systematical assessment method for selecting a suitable method combination.

T2  - PANCREAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: A few past studies have found increased utilization of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and prevalence of osteoporosis in acute pancreatitis (AP). Our aim was to obtain a survey of bone diseases after a sentinel episode of AP.Methods: A database (Explorys), an aggregate of electronic health record from 26 integrated United States healthcare systems, was queried. A cohort of patients with a Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms diagnosis of AP between 2014 and 2019, after excluding patients with selected medical conditions and medications that are associated with poor bone health, was identified. The prevalence of new diagnoses of vitamin D deficiency (VDD), osteoporosis, and fractures in the study cohort was evaluated. Age-, race-, and sex-based distributions and risk factors were determined through univariate and multivariate analyses.Results: Of the 36,087,380 individuals in the database, we identified 256,580 (0.71%) with AP. In multivariate analysis, patients with AP were more likely to develop VDD (odds ratio [OR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-1.26; P < 0.0001), osteoporosis (OR, 1.89; CI, 1.81-1.85; P < 0.0001), and fractures (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.57-1.59; P < 0.0001).Conclusions: Acute pancreatitis was associated with increased risk of VDD, osteoporosis, and fractures.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has been proven to accurately stage endometrial cancer (EC). However, there is a lack of studies comparing the incidence of complications between different lymph node approaches in EC. The objective of the study was to define the complication rates of SLN biopsy in EC patients.Design: A retrospective cohort studySetting: A tertiary referral hospitalPatients: All patients who were surgically treated for EC form April 2013 to March 2018Interventions: Authors evaluated intraoperative complications and 30-day complications using the Memorial Sloan Lettering Cancer Center's Surgical Secondary Events Grading System, separating the patients into 4 groups: group I, hysterectomy (HT); group II, hysterectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy (HT+SLN); group III, hysterectomy plus pelvic lymphadenectomy, with or without para-aortic dissection (HT+LND); and group IV, hysterectomy plus lymphadenectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (HT+SLN+LND).Measurements and Main Results: Authors identified a total of 250 cases. As compared with the HT group, the HT+SLN group did not show any increased risk of complications in terms of intraoperative complications (0 vs 1; p = 1.0) and 30-day complications (8 vs 7; p = .782), but surgical time was approximately 20 minutes longer (p = .016). Performing LND was associated with a greater risk of 30-day complications (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.62-5.98), intraoperative complications (HR: 14.25; 95% CI: 1.85-19.63), and lower-limb lymphedema (HR: 8.14; 95% CI: 1.01-65.27).Conclusion: SLN mapping does not increase morbidity in the surgical treatment of EC patients, and compared with comprehensive lymphadenectomy, it has a lower risk of complications. Our findings support the use of the SLN algorithm in EC patients (C) 2019 AAGL. All rights reserved.

TI  - Knowledge-Based Classification of Grassland Ecosystem Based on Multi-Temporal WorldView-2 Data and FAO-LCCS Taxonomy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland ecosystems can provide a variety of services for humans, such as carbon storage, food production, crop pollination and pest regulation. However, grasslands are today one of the most endangered ecosystems due to land use change, agricultural intensification, land abandonment as well as climate change. The present study explores the performance of a knowledge-driven GEOgraphic-Object-based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) learning scheme to classify Very High Resolution (VHR) images for natural grassland ecosystem mapping. The classification was applied to a Natura 2000 protected area in Southern Italy. The Food and Agricultural Organization Land Cover Classification System (FAO-LCCS) hierarchical scheme was instantiated in the learning phase of the algorithm. Four multi-temporal WorldView-2 (WV-2) images were classified by combining plant phenology and agricultural practices rules with prior-image spectral knowledge. Drawing on this knowledge, spectral bands and entropy features from one single date (Post Peak of Biomass) were firstly used for multiple-scale image segmentation into Small Objects (SO) and Large Objects (LO). Thereafter, SO were labelled by considering spectral and context-sensitive features from the whole multi-seasonal data set available together with ancillary data. Lastly, the labelled SO were overlaid to LO segments and, in turn, the latter were labelled by adopting FAO-LCCS criteria about the SOs presence dominance in each LO. Ground reference samples were used only for validating the SO and LO output maps. The knowledge driven GEOBIA classifier for SO classification obtained an OA value of 97.35% with an error of 0.04. For LO classification the value was 75.09% with an error of 0.70. At SO scale, grasslands ecosystem was classified with 92.6%, 99.9% and 96.1% of User's, Producer's Accuracy and F1-score, respectively. The findings reported indicate that the knowledge-driven approach not only can be applied for (semi)natural grasslands ecosystem mapping in vast and not accessible areas but can also reduce the costs of ground truth data acquisition. The approach used may provide different level of details (small and large objects in the scene) but also indicates how to design and validate local conservation policies.

TI  - Outliers-Robust CFAR Detector of Gaussian Clutter Based on the Truncated-Maximum-Likelihood- Estimator in SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an outliers-robust constant false-alarm rate (OR-CFAR) detector of Gaussian clutter based on the truncated-maximum-likelihood estimator (TMLE) in SAR imagery. The proposed method aims at elevating the detection performance in multiple-target environment, where the sea clutter samples are often contaminated by the interfering target pixels, the azimuth ambiguities, and the breakwater. As a consequence, the parameters used for statistical modeling are over-estimated, resulting in a degradation of the CFAR detection rate. Inspired by the traditional two-parameter CFAR (TP-CFAR) detector of Gaussian clutter, OR-CFAR designs an adaptive threshold-based clutter truncation method to eliminate the high-intensity outliers from the clutter samples in the local reference window, and the probability density function (PDF) of the sea clutter can be accurately modeled through the newly raised TMLE. Furthermore, the optimal truncation depth used for clutter truncation and PDF modeling is evaluated and selected properly to get the best detection results. The OR-CFAR greatly enhances the CFAR detection rate in multiple-target environment, and it is computationally simple and efficient, which has a great application value. The Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR data are used for experiments to show the better detection performance of OR-CFAR.

TI  - Crop Mapping Using Random Forest and Particle Swarm Optimization based on Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate information on crop mapping and monitoring is necessary for agricultural resources management. Accordingly, the applicability of the proposed classification-feature selection ensemble procedure with different feature sets for crop mapping is investigated. Here, we produced various feature sets including spectral bands, spectral indices, variation of spectral index, texture, and combinations of features to map different types of crops. By using various feature sets and the random forest (RF) classifier, the crop maps were created. In aiming to determine the most relevant and distinctive features, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and RF-variable importance measure feature selection methods were examined. The classification-feature selection ensemble procedure was adapted to combine the outputs of different feature sets from the better feature selection method using majority votes. Multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data has been used in Ghale-Nou county of Tehran, Iran. The performance of RF was efficient in crop mapping especially by spectral bands and texture in combination with other feature sets. Our results showed that the PSO-based feature selection leads to a more accurate classification than the RF-variable importance measure, in almost all feature sets for all crop types. The RF classifier-PSO ensemble procedure for crop mapping outperformed the RF classifier in each feature set with regard to the class-wise and overall accuracies (OA) (of about 2.7-7.4% increases in OA and 0.48-3.68% (silage maize), 0-1.61% (rice), 2.82-15.43% (alfalfa), and 10.96-41.13% (vegetables) improvement in F-scores for all feature sets). The proposed method could mainly be useful to differentiate between heterogeneous crop fields (e.g., vegetables in this study) due to their more obtained omission/commission errors reduction.

T2  - GYNECOLOGIE OBSTETRIQUE FERTILITE & SENOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. - Recommendations for the management of patients with gynecological cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic period.Material and method. - Recommendations based on the consensus conference model.Results. - In the case of a COVID-19 positive patient, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and RadioChemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-bycase basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged. It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. For early stage endometrial cancer, in case of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with a sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored. It is possible to consider postponing surgery for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO la stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For high ESMO risk, it ispossible to favor the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) in order to omit pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomies.Conclusion. - During COVID-19 pandemic, patients suffering from cancer should not lose life chance, while limiting the risks associated with the virus.

TI  - Spatial Distribution of Land Surface Temperatures in Kuwait: Urban Heat and Cool Islands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The global rise of urbanization has led to the formation of surface urban heat islands and surface urban cool islands. Urban heat islands have been shown to increase thermal discomfort, which increases heat stress and heat-related diseases. In Kuwait, a hyper-arid desert climate, most of the population lives in urban and suburban areas. In this study, we characterized the spatial distribution of land surface temperatures and investigated the presence of urban heat and cool effects in Kuwait. We used historical Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra satellite 8-day composite land surface temperature (LST) from 2001 to 2017. We calculated the average LSTs of the urban/suburban governorates and compared them to the average LSTs of the rural and barren lands. We repeated the analysis for daytime and nighttime LST. During the day, the temperature difference (urban/suburban minus versus governorates) was -1.1 degrees C (95% CI; -1.2, -1.00, p < 0.001) indicating a daytime urban cool island. At night, the temperature difference (urban/suburban versus rural governorates) became 3.6 degrees C (95% CI; 3.5, 3.7, p < 0.001) indicating a nighttime urban heat island. In light of rising temperatures in Kuwait, this work can inform climate change adaptation efforts in the country including urban planning policies, but also has the potential to improve temperature exposure assessment for future population health studies.

TI  - Evaluating the Relationships of Inter-Annual Farmland Vegetation Dynamics with Biodiversity Using Multi-Spatial and Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural landscapes are highly dynamic ecosystems, but the effects of temporal farmland vegetation dynamics on species diversity have not been widely studied. In 93 sample farm landscapes in eastern Ontario, Canada, biodiversity data for seven taxa were collected in 2011 and 2012, prior to the initiation of this study. The goal of this study was to determine if trends and variability in vegetation productivity detected in these sample landscapes using long-term archived moderate and coarse resolution remote sensing time series data are related to the measured biodiversity. Mid-summer Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (2000-2011) and Landsat 5 (1985-2011) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data were used with the Thiel-Sen slope and Contextual Mann-Kendall trend analysis to identify pixels showing significant trends. NDVI temporal metrics included 1) the percentage of pixels in each landscape with a significant negative or positive trend, and 2) the temporal coefficient of variation (CV) of both the mean and spatial CV of landscape NDVI. Larger areas of significant positive NDVI trends were found in the sample landscapes than negative trends, the former being associated with agricultural intensification or crop changes and the latter with smaller areas of natural vegetation removal. Landsat better-detected changes in individual fields or small areas of natural vegetation due to its much smaller pixel size. In addition, the longer Landsat time series showed a change in the NDVI trend from positive (1985-2000) to negative or a leveling off (2000-2011) for many pixels. In biodiversity modeling, the Landsat temporal CV of NDVI was negatively correlated with 2011-2012 plant and beetle diversity, while plant biodiversity was positively correlated with the percentage of pixels in a sample landscape showing a significantly positive NDVI trend. No significant relationships were found using the MODIS data. This study shows that temporal trends and variability in farmland vegetation density derived from Landsat data are related to biodiversity for certain taxa and that such relationships should be considered along with the more commonly studied spatial landscape attributes in evaluating landscape-level impacts of farming on biodiversity.

TI  - Drought Sensitivity and Trends of Riparian Vegetation Vigor in Nevada, USA (1985-2018)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dryland riparian areas are under increasing stress due to expanding human water demands and a warming climate. Quantifying responses of dryland riparian vegetation to these pressures is complicated by high climatic variability, which can create strong, transient changes in vegetation vigor that could mask other disturbance events. In this study, we utilize a 34-year archive of Landsat satellite data to (1) quantify the strength and timescales of vegetation responses to interannual variability in drought status and (2) isolate and remove this influence to assess resultant trends in vegetation vigor for riparian areas across the state of Nevada, the driest state in the USA. Correlations between annual late-summer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) were calculated across a range of time periods (varying timing and durations) for all riparian pixels within each of the 45 ecoregions, and the variability of these values across the study area is shown. We then applied a novel drought adjustment method that used the strongest SPEI-NDVI timescale relationships for each ecoregion to remove the influence of interannual drought status. Our key result is a 30 m resolution map of drought-adjusted riparian NDVI trends (1985-2018). We highlight and describe locations where impacts of invasive species biocontrol, mine water management, agriculture, changing water levels, and fire are readily visualized with our results. We found more negatively trending riparian areas in association with wide valley bottoms, low-intensity agricultural land uses, and private land ownerships and more positive trends in association with narrow drainages, public lands, and surrounding perennial water bodies (an indication of declining water levels allowing increased vegetative cover). The drought-adjusted NDVI improved the statistical significance of trend estimates, thereby improving the ability to detect such changes. Results from this study provide insight into the strength and timescales of riparian vegetation responses to drought and can provide important information for managing riparian areas within the study area. The novel approach to drought adjustment is readily transferrable to other regions.

The zones of their thermal impact on the landscape of oil fields are determined. A model for estimating regional pollution of territories from a set of sources is suggested. Based on this model and the thermal radiation from flares, the fields of relative pollution of oil-producing areas in winter and summer periods of the year are estimated.

TI  - Impact of partnership status on clinical outcomes of patients with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma and performance of sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesVulvar squamous cell carcinoma is a rare malignancy and lymph node involvement is the most significant prognostic factor. We aimed to evaluate the association between partnership status and mortality from vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, cancer stage at the time of presentation, and the decision for sentinel lymph node biopsy.MethodsThe US National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried and different parameters were evaluated relative to partnership status. A total of 4851 patients with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, >18 years of age, who presented between January 2010 to December 2015, were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to assess survival and hazard ratio. Multinomial regression analysis and chi(2) were utilized to evaluate odd ratios and significance of variables.ResultsMost patients were unpartnered (58.5%), including never married (17.7%), divorced (13.8%), or widowed (27%). Partnered patients were mostly Caucasian (88.4%), insured (74%), and presented with stage I disease (57.2%), compared with unpartnered patients (79.1%), (61.7%), and (51.7%), respectively (p<0.01). The mean survival time (months) in partnered patients was longer, compared with unpartnered (p<0.001), and the difference between both groups increased from 9 months at stage I to 24 months at stage IV, which remained independently significant after adjusting the different variables. Cox regression showed that partnered patients had a lower hazard ratio than unpartnered patients (p<0.01). Mortality from vulvar squamous cell carcinoma increased with age at diagnosis, no surgery, and unemployment (p<0.01). Unpartnered patients were the least likely to undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy in early stages, compared with partnered (p<0.01). Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that not performing sentinel lymph node biopsy almost doubled the hazard ratio of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (p<0.01).ConclusionsPartnership status should be considered when counseling patients for vulvar squamous cell carcinoma therapy and when recommending screening and follow-up to optimize patient care.

TI  - Comparing methods for mapping canopy chlorophyll content in a mixed mountain forest using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) has three spectral bands centered at 705, 740, and 783 nm wavelengths that exploit the red-edge information useful for quantifying plant biochemical traits. This sensor configuration is expected to improve the prediction accuracy of vegetation chlorophyll content. In this work, we assessed the performance of several statistical and physical-based methods in retrieving canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) from Sentinel-2 in a heterogeneous mixed mountain forest. Amongst the algorithms presented in the literature, 13 different vegetation indices (VIs), a non-parametric statistical approach, and two radiative transfer models (RTM) were used to assess the CCC prediction accuracy. A field campaign was conducted in July 2017 to collect in situ measurements of CCC in Bavarian forest national park, and the cloud-free Sentinel-2 image was acquired on 13 July 2017. The leave-one-out cross-validation technique was used to compare the VIs and the non-parametric approach. Whereas physical-based methods were calibrated using simulated data and validated using the in situ reference dataset. The statistical-based approaches, such as the modified simple ratio (mSR) vegetation index and the partial least square regression (PLSR) outperformed all other techniques. As such the modified simple ratio (mSR3) (665, 865) gave the lowest cross-validated RMSE of 0.21 g/m(2) (R-2 = 0.75). The PISR resulted in the highest R-2 of 0.78, and slightly higher RMSE = 0.22 g/m(2) than mSR3. The physical-based approach-INFORM inversion using look-up table resulted in an RMSE = 0.31 g/m(2), and R-2 = 0.67. Although mapping CCC using these methods revealed similar spatial distribution patterns, over and underestimation of low and high CCC values were observed mainly in the statistical approaches. Further validation using in situ data from different terrestrial ecosystems is imperative for both the statistical and physical-based approaches' effectiveness to quantify CCC before selecting the best operational algorithm to map CCC from Sentinel-2 for long-term terrestrial ecosystems monitoring across the globe.

TI  - Entomological Surveillance Associated with Human Zika Cases in Miri Sarawak, Malaysia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Two confirmed human cases of Zika virus (ZIKV) were reported in the district of Miri, Sarawak, in 2016. Following that, a mosquito-based ZIKV surveillance study was conducted within 200-m radius from the case houses. Mosquito surveillance was conducted using five different methods, that is, biogents sentinel mosquito (BG) sentinel trap, modified sticky ovitrap, resting catch, larval surveillance, and conventional ovitrap. A total of 527 and 390 mosquito samples were obtained from the case houses in two localities, namely, Kampung Lopeng and Taman Shang Ri La, Miri, Sarawak, respectively. All mosquitoes collected were identified, which consisted of 11 species. Aedes albopictus, both the adult and larval stages, was the dominant species. Resting catch method obtained the highest number of adult mosquitoes (67%), whereas ovitrap showed the highest catch for larval mosquitoes (84%). Zika virus was detected in both adults and larvae of Ae. albopictus together with adults of Culex gelidus, and Culex quinquefasciatus using the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. It was noteworthy that Ae. albopictus positive with ZIKV were caught and obtained from four types of collection method. By contrast, Cx. gelidus and Culex quinquefasciatus adults collected from sticky ovitraps were also found positive with ZIKV. This study reveals vital information regarding the potential vectors of ZIKV and the possibility of transovarian transmission of the virus in Malaysia. These findings will be essentials for vector control program managers to devise preparedness and contingency plans of prevention and control of the arboviral disease.

This paper described the results from a ship-based intercomparison conducted on the Atlantic Meridional Transect 27 from 23rd September to 5th November 2017. Two different radiometric systems, TriOS-Radiation Measurement Sensor with Enhanced Spectral resolution (RAMSES) and Seabird-Hyperspectral Surface Acquisition System (HyperSAS), were compared and operated side-by-side over a wide range of Atlantic provinces and environmental conditions. Both systems were calibrated for traceability to SI (Systeme international) units at the same optical laboratory under uniform conditions before and after the field campaign. The in situ results and their accompanying uncertainties were evaluated using the same data handling protocols. The field data revealed variability in the responsivity between TRiOS and Seabird sensors, which is dependent on the ambient environmental and illumination conditions. The straylight effects for individual sensors were mostly within +/- 3%. A near infra-red (NIR) similarity correction changed the water-leaving reflectance (rho(w)) and water-leaving radiance (L-w) spectra significantly, bringing also a convergence in outliers. For improving the estimates of in situ uncertainty, it is recommended that additional characterization of radiometers and environmental ancillary measurements are undertaken. In general, the comparison of radiometric systems showed agreement within the evaluated uncertainty limits. Consistency of in situ results with the available Sentinel-3A Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) data in the range from (400...560) nm was also satisfactory (-8% < Mean Percentage Difference (MPD) < 15%) and showed good agreement in terms of the shape of the spectra and absolute values.

TI  - Timing of Landsat Overpasses Effectively Captures Flow Conditions of Large Rivers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites provide a temporally discontinuous record of hydrological conditions along Earth's rivers (e.g., river width, height, water quality). The degree to which archived satellite data effectively capture the overall population of river flow frequency is unknown. Here, we use the entire archives of Landsat 5, 7, and 8 to determine when a cloud-free image is available over the United States Geological Survey (USGS) river gauges located on Landsat-observable rivers. We compare the flow frequency distribution derived from the daily gauge record to the flow frequency distribution derived from ideally sampling gauged discharge based on the timing of cloud-free Landsat overpasses. Examining the patterns of flow frequency across multiple gauges, we find that there is not a statistically significant difference between the flow frequency distribution associated with observations contained within the Landsat archive and the flow frequency distribution derived from the daily gauge data (alpha = 0.05), except for hydrological extremes like maximum and minimum flow. At individual gauges, we find that Landsat observations span a wide range of hydrological conditions (97% of total flow variability observed in 90% of the study gauges) but the degree to which the Landsat sample can represent flow frequency distribution varies from location to location and depends on sample size. The results of this study indicate that the Landsat archive is, on average, representative of the temporal frequencies of hydrological conditions present along Earth's large rivers with broad utility for hydrological, ecologic and biogeochemical evaluations of river systems.

T2  - TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA
M3  - Article
AB  - The climatic change implies the spatial and temporal alteration of climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation which, in a hydrological way, imply extreme rain-draining events that produce human, economic and ecological losses in the lower part of the basins. It change the hydrological cycle to. For this reason, the study of basins is required in Mexico as a fundamental unit to identify the effect that climate change causes on its hydrological characteristics and to propose mitigation actions. This study evaluated the impact of climate change on water erosion by using the map algebra technique implementing a hydrological model adapted from the Universal Soil Loss Equation (EUPS) and a multitemporal series of multispectral images Landsat, and Spot of the decade of 1980 and 2010. The work was carried out in 52 subwathershed located around the Nevado de Toluca Volcano. The results showed that 36 sub-watersheds present an average increase in the erosion rate of 43.9%, which is associated with the loss of vegetation cover due to fires, anthropogenic work and increased desertification. The remaining 16 showed decrement because they had favorable change in land use and therefore in their hydrological condition. These effects are related to the increase in the values of the climatic variables in recent years.

TI  - Annual sea level variations in the Red Sea observed using GNSS
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual sea level variations in the Red Sea have amplitudes of 15-20 cm as observed using various techniques such as tide gauges, satellite altimetry and recently Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data. In this study, we demonstrate that Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations can also be used to measure the effect of these sea level variations. The extra water mass presses on the seafloor, which causes horizontal and vertical deformations. Using time-series from 10 coastal GNSS stations, we observe annual horizontal and vertical loading displacements with amplitudes of 2-5 mm. When correcting for atmospheric, hydrological and surface water loading and a residual geocentre motion, significant annual signals of approximately 0.5 and 2 mm are still observed for the horizontal and vertical components, respectively. In the northern Red Sea, the observed annual signals and predicted annual sea level loading show good agreement. This confirms that the signal is mostly a result of the variations in water mass and thermal expansion. Furthermore, we conclude that the uncertainties in the hydrological model over Ethiopia and Eritrea influence the loading over the southern Red Sea, which was underestimated in previous studies using GRACE data.

TI  - Mapping the Distribution of Shallow Groundwater Occurrences Using Remote Sensing-Based Statistical Modeling over Southwest Saudi Arabia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying shallow (near-surface) groundwater in arid and hyper-arid areas has significant societal benefits, yet it is a costly operation when traditional methods (geophysics and drilling) are applied over large domains. In this study, we developed and successfully applied methodologies that rely heavily on readily available temporal, visible, and near-infrared radar and thermal remote sensing data sets and field data, as well as statistical approaches to map the distribution of shallow (1-5 m deep) groundwater occurrences in Al Qunfudah Province, Saudi Arabia, and to identify the factors controlling their development. A four-fold approach was adopted: (1) constructing a digital database to host relevant geologic, hydrogeologic, topographic, land use, climatic, and remote sensing data sets, (2) identifying the distribution of areas characterized by shallow groundwater levels, (3) developing conceptual and statistical models to map the distribution of shallow groundwater occurrences, and (4) constructing an artificial neural network (ANN) and multivariate regression (MR) models to map the distribution of shallow groundwater, test the models over areas of known depth to groundwater (area of Al Qunfudah city and surroundings: 294 km(2)), and apply the better of the two models to map the shallow groundwater occurrences across the entire Al Qunfudah Province (area: 4680 km(2)). Findings include: (1) high performance for the ANN (92%) and MR (88%) models in predicting the distribution of shallow groundwater using temporal-derived remote sensing products (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), radar backscatter coefficient, precipitation, and brightness temperature) and field data (depth to water table), (2) areas witnessing shallow groundwater levels show high NDVI (mean and standard deviation (STD)), radar backscatter coefficient values (mean and STD), and low brightness temperature (mean and STD) compared to their surroundings, (3) correlations of temporal groundwater levels and satellite-based precipitation suggest that the observed (2017-2019) rise in groundwater levels is related to an increase in precipitation in these years compared to the previous three years (2014-2016), and (4) the adopted methodologies are reliable, cost-effective, and could potentially be applied to identify shallow groundwater along the Red Sea Hills and in similar settings worldwide.

TI  - COGNITIVE-COMMUNICATIVE STRATEGIES OF KAZAKHSTANI LITERATURE: SPECIFICITY OF FORMATION AND FUNCTIONING
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the problem of the formation of the main cognitive-communicative strategies of the literary discourse of Kazakhstan. In the implementation of these strategies, a large role is played by cultural codes. The latter, as significant semiotic units of the text, are included in its conceptual core. Such concepts of the theory of cultural code as philosophical, ideological, conceptual core, ethnostereotype, heterotopic markers, detailed multicultural landscape and others receive terminological design. Cognition of the world and understanding of history, modernity, the possible future is often realized in a work through the universalization of the art world, multiculturalism, and the construction of complex narrative structures. The specificity of a historical narrative is analyzed with its characteristic capacious referential mode, involving the reader in the active communicative process of decoding narrated events and images. The heterotopic markers of myth-folklore units in the structure of a literary text are studied, the stability and iteration of traditional ethnocultural codes are noted.The bipolar tendency of ethnostereotyping and multicultural landscape of the art world is determined as an important cognitive-aesthetic strategy of literature in Kazakhstan. A multidimensional dialogical space of one or another cultural code is formed, an extension of its referential and epistemological connotations. The issues of sacralization, unversalization and profanation of the artistic space and time, various toposs, realities, and personalities are considered. The specificity of the narrative structure of the historical novel, diffusion methanarrative, is investigated.The content and functioning of such universal frequency codes as philosophemes and ideologemes are substantiated. By their dialogical and cognitive-communicative nature, philosophies, like mythologemes and folklorems, in a literary text come closer to the universals of culture. An additional result of such an immanent presence and subsequent development in the text of these philosophems (universals) is the complication of its genre, style nature. In connection with the implementation of the strategy of maximum metaphorization and universalization of the art world, the emergence of hybrid genres is justified: a novel-myth, a novel-requiem, a novel revelation, and others.The inclusion in the literary text of a large amount of metatexts (diaries, notes, poems, translations) becomes an additional tool for constructing a complex system of coding and recoding information, specific translation of knowledge about the political, historical, cultural, legal, economic, systems, social stratification of the presented world spaces. A change in stereotype also finds a place in the paradigm of literary discourse. Some distinguished cultural codes (path, caravan), showing a strong attraction to each other, reinforce the philosophical and worldview depth of the narrative.

TI  - VEGETATION INDICES FOR IRRIGATED CORN MONITORING
T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of large agricultural lands is often hampered by data collection logistics at field level. To solve such a problem, remote sensing techniques have been used to estimate vegetation indices, which can subsidize crop management decision-making. Therefore, this study aimed to select vegetation indices to detect variability in irrigated corn crops. Data were collected in Sao Desiderio, Bahia State (Brazil), using an OLI sensor (Operational Land Imager) embedded to a Landsat-8 satellite platform. Five corn growing plots under central pivot irrigation were assessed. The following vegetation indices were tested: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index), GNDVI (Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), SR (Simple Ratio), NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index), and MSI (Moisture Stress Index). Among the tested indices, SR was more sensitive to high corn biomass, while GNDVI, NDVI, EVI, and SAVI were more sensitive to low values. Overall, all indices were found to be concordant with each other, with high correlations among them. Despite this, the use of a set of these indices is advisable since some respond better to certain peculiarities than others.

TI  - Most relevant input parameters selection for 10-min global solar irradiation estimation on arbitrary inclined plane using neural networks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper propounds the use of 'Weights' method to assess the relative importance of input features for estimating 10-min global solar irradiation on an arbitrary tilted plane, using artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Two different data sources are exerted: satellite data, including different inclinations, are used for learning, while ground data, measured at Bouzareah radiometric station (Algeria), are used for testing. 'Weights' method allowed to identify the relative importance of input variables and rank them according to their order of contribution, thus significantly improving the performance of the model by eliminating the parameters that are poorly correlated with the network output. The results show that the most relevant input data are in the following order: the global horizontal irradiation 35.9%, extraterrestrial irradiation 25.08%, declination 15.81%, elevation of the sun 12.60% and inclination 10.61%. The optimal configuration includes 16 neurons in the hidden layer with nRMSE = 6.37% and R-2 = 0.992.

TI  - Bioclimatic variables from precipitation and temperature records vs. remote sensing-based bioclimatic variables: Which side can perform better in species distribution modeling?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bioclimatic variables are considered as an indispensable data type in species distribution modeling. Such variables are available from the WorldClim database for the entire earth surface and at various spatial resolutions. Moreover, convenient access to real-time satellite data and their products has recently created a new way to produce environmental variables. Therefore, in the present study, it was attempted to compare the performance of bioclimatic variables derived from precipitation and temperature instrumental records (scenario I) and variables derived from remote sensing data (scenario II) where both scenarios were from 2001 to 2017. The variables were employed to predict the distribution of Artemisia sieberi in central Iran through five Species Distribution Models (SDMs) such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), Classification Tree Analysis (CTA), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and Maximum Entropy (Maxent). The DEM layer was derived from 90-m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), 1-km MODIS land surface temperature and vegetation indices products, and downscaled PERSIANN-CDR precipitation data were employed as derivations of temperature and precipitation to produce bioclimatic variables for scenario II. The results obtained from independent sample t-test on AUC(ratio) values derived from the correlative models showed that it had more satisfactory results when they were getting from the data of scenario II than the scenario I (p < .01). RF scored the highest partial AUC values (AUC(ratio)) among the single models, and based on both scenarios, ensemble map was able to provide the most accurate predictions. There were also non-significant differences among the performance of RF, CTA and ensemble models under two scenarios (p < .01). Results emphasized the importance of bioclimatic variables derived from remote sensing to produce more up-to-date information and also to improve the predictive performance of SDMs. Finally, it was suggested that convenient access to reliable and up-to-date information can assist modelers to outline management practices well.

TI  - Attraction Versus Capture: Efficiency of BG-Sentinel Trap Under Semi-Field Conditions and Characterizing Response Behaviors for Female <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes aegypti (L.) is an important vector of viruses causing dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever and as such is a threat to public health worldwide. Effective trapping methods are essential for surveillance of both the mosquito species and disease presence. The BG-Sentinel (BGS) is a widely used to trap Ae. aegypti but little is known of its efficiency, i.e., what proportion of the mosquitoes encountering the trap are captured. The first version of the BGS trap was predominantly white, and the current version is mostly navy blue. While this trap is often deployed without any olfactory lure, it can also be deployed with CO2 and/or a human skin odor mimic lure to increase capture rates. We tested the efficiency of capturing Ae. aegypti under semi-field conditions for the original white version without lures as well the blue version with and without various lure combinations. None of the configurations tested here captured 100% of the mosquitoes that encountered the trap. A navy-blue trap emitting CO2 and a skin odor mimic produced the highest capture (14% of the total insects in the semi-field cage), but its capture efficiency was just 5% (of mosquitoes encountering the trap). Mosquitoes often had multiple encounters with a trap that did not result in capture; they crossed over the trap entrance without being captured or landed on the sides of the trap. Understanding these behaviors and the factors that induce them has the potential to suggest improvement in trap design and therefore capture efficiency.

M3  - Article
AB  - One of the powerful factors shaping the image of the nation is religion. Religion defines the basic ethical norms, as well as the system of relations within and outside the ethnic community The specifics of religion will to some extent determine the development of national culture and stimulate or limit the development of certain genres of art. The national character and the ethical nature of the nation are largely related to the national religion.One of the most important foundations in the life and development of a nation is language. Language reflects the whole history, culture, value system and worldview of the people.The environment, religion and language all work together to create ethnic psychology. Ethnic psychology shapes the thinking, behavior and actions of members of a particular ethnic community, the whole way of life, in short, the image of the world. Parents pass it on to the next generation, and society supports it with its socio-ethical system.

TI  - Influenza surveillance case definitions miss a substantial proportion of older adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza: A report from the Canadian Immunization Research Network (CIRN) Serious Outcomes Surveillance (SOS) Network
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Older adults often have atypical presentation of illness and are particularly vulnerable to influenza and its sequelae, making the validity of influenza case definitions particularly relevant. We sought to assess the performance of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) criteria in hospitalized older adults. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: The Serious Outcomes Surveillance Network of the Canadian Immunization Research Network undertakes active surveillance for influenza among hospitalized adults. Methods: Data were pooled from 3 influenza seasons: 2011/12, 2012/13, and 2013/14. The ILI and SARI criteria were defined clinically, and influenza was laboratory confirmed. Frailty was measured using a validated frailty index. Results: Of 11,379 adult inpatients (7,254 aged >= 65 years), 4,942 (2,948 aged >= 65 years) had laboratory-confirmed influenza. Their median age was 72 years (interquartile range [IQR], 58-82) and 52.6% were women. The sensitivity of ILI criteria was 51.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.6-52.6) for younger adults versus 44.6% (95% CI, 43.6-45.8) for older adults. SARI criteria were met by 64.1% (95% CI, 62.7-65.6) of younger adults versus 57.1% (95% CI, 55.9-58.2) of older adults with laboratory-confirmed influenza. Patients with influenza who were prefrail or frail were less likely to meet ILI and SARI case definitions. Conclusions: A substantial proportion of older adults, particularly those who are frail, are missed by standard ILI and SARI case definitions. Surveillance using these case definitions is biased toward identifying younger cases, and does not capture the true burden of influenza. Because of the substantial fraction of cases missed, surveillance definitions should not be used to guide diagnosis and clinical management of influenza.

TI  - Zika among international travellers presenting to GeoSentinel sites, 2012-2019: implications for clinical practice
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: International travellers contribute to the rapid spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its sentinel identification globally. We describe ZIKV infections among international travellers seen at GeoSentinel sites with a focus on ZIKV acquired in the Americas and the Caribbean, describe countries of exposure and traveller characteristics, and assess ZIKV diagnostic testing by site.Methods: Records with an international travel-related diagnosis of confirmed or probable ZIKV from January 2012 through December 2019 reported to GeoSentinel with a recorded illness onset date were included to show reported cases over time. Records from March 2016 through December 2019 with an exposure region of the Americas or the Caribbean were included in the descriptive analysis. A survey was conducted to assess the availability, accessibility and utilization of ZIKV diagnostic tests at GeoSentinel sites.Results: GeoSentinel sites reported 525 ZIKV cases from 2012 through 2019. Between 2012 and 2014, eight cases were reported, and all were acquired in Asia or Oceania. After 2014, most cases were acquired in the Americas or the Caribbean, a large decline in ZIKV cases occurred in 2018-19. Between March 2016 and December 2019, 423 patients acquired ZIKV in the Americas or the Caribbean, peak reporting to these regions occurred in 2016 [330 cases (78%)]. The median age was 36 years (range: 3-92); 63% were female. The most frequent region of exposure was the Caribbean (60%). Thirteen travellers were pregnant during or after travel; one had a sexually acquired ZIKV infection. There was one case of fetal anomaly and two travellers with Guillain-Barre syndrome. GeoSentinel sites reported various challenges to diagnose ZIKV effectively.Conclusion: ZIKV should remain a consideration for travellers returning from areas with risk of ZIKV transmission. Travellers should discuss their travel plans with their healthcare providers to ensure ZIKV prevention measures are taken.

TI  - Methane Emission in the Russian Permafrost Zone and Evaluation of Its Impact on Global Climate
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Satellite data on methane concentration in the lower troposphere and the dynamical permafrost model are used to analyze methane emissions in the permafrost zone. The sources of methane generation in different biochemical conditions in the river valleys, thermokarst lakes, wetlands, and lowlands are studied. The statistical relationships between their intensity and air temperature, precipitation, active layer thickness, and permafrost temperature are evaluated. The CMIP5 ensemble climate projection is used to estimate methane emission in the permafrost regions for the mid-21st century. Numerical experiments with the INM-CM48 Earth system model demonstrated that the projected 20 Tg/year increase in the methane emission will lead to less than 0.05 degrees C global temperature rise. The uncertainty analysis of the results is accomplished and an alternative conceptual model of abrupt threshold changes in methane emission is proposed.

TI  - ROSACE: A Proposed European Design for the Copernicus Ocean Colour System Vicarious Calibration Infrastructure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Copernicus programme ensures long-term delivery of high-quality, global satellite ocean colour radiometry (OCR) observations from its Sentinel-3 (S3) satellite series carrying the ocean and land colour instrument (OLCI). In particular, the S3/OLCI provides marine water leaving reflectance and derived products to the Copernicus marine environment monitoring service, CMEMS, for which data quality is of paramount importance. This is why OCR system vicarious calibration (OC-SVC), which allows uncertainties of these products to stay within required specifications, is crucial. The European organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites (EUMETSAT) operates the S3/OLCI marine ground segment, and envisions having an SVC infrastructure deployed and operated for the long-term. This paper describes a design for such an SVC infrastructure, named radiometry for ocean colour satellites calibration and community engagement (ROSACE), which has been submitted to Copernicus by a consortium made of three European research institutions, a National Metrology Institute, and two small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). ROSACE proposes a 2-site infrastructure deployed in the Eastern and Western Mediterranean Seas, capable of delivering up to about 80 high quality matchups per year for OC-SVC of the S3/OLCI missions.

TI  - Weaving the Body and the Cosmos <i>Two Menstrual Festivals in Northeastern India</i>
T2  - WORLDVIEWS-GLOBAL RELIGIONS CULTURE AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the cultural context and ecological implications of two menstrual festivals in northeastern India: Rajaparba in Orissa and Ambuvaci in Kamakhya, Assam. We argue that these festivals are extremely fruitful sites to explore questions of women and power in religious communities where the Goddess is a central focus as well as their ecological implications for an integral worldview. These festivals, usually held at the beginning of the monsoon when the Hindu Goddess menstruates, are times when the earth is regenerated, when the body of the Goddess is regenerated, and when women and communities are regenerated in various ways. Participants report that pilgrimages to these festivals are indeed transformative and have positive impacts on their lives. As a result, we critique feminist arguments that claim that Hinduism is the basis for women's social disempowerment, and as a result, the only meaningful social change must occur on a secular basis. We also use these festivals to critique contemporary feminist developmentalist ideologies.

TI  - Shrub Biomass Estimates in Former Burnt Areas Using Sentinel 2 Images Processing and Classification
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrubs growing in former burnt areas play two diametrically opposed roles. On the one hand, they protect the soil against erosion, promote rainwater infiltration, carbon sequestration and support animal life. On the other hand, after the shrubs' density reaches a particular size for the canopy to touch and the shrubs' biomass accumulates more than 10 Mg ha(-1), they create the necessary conditions for severe wild fires to occur and spread. The creation of a methodology suitable to identify former burnt areas and to track shrubs' regrowth within these areas in a regular and a multi temporal basis would be beneficial. The combined use of geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) supported by dedicated land survey and field work for data collection has been identified as a suitable method to manage these tasks. The free access to Sentinel images constitutes a valuable tool for updating the GIS project and for the monitoring of regular shrubs' accumulated biomass. Sentinel 2 VIS-NIR images are suitable to classify rural areas (overall accuracy = 79.6% and Cohen's K = 0.754) and to create normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images to be used in association to allometric equations for the shrubs' biomass estimation (R-2= 0.8984,p-value < 0.05 and RMSE = 4.46 Mg ha(-1)). Five to six years after a forest fire occurrence, almost all the former burnt area is covered by shrubs. Up to 10 years after a fire, the accumulated shrubs' biomass surpasses 14 Mg ha(-1). The results described in this paper demonstrate that Northwest Portugal presents larger shrubland areas and greater shrub biomass accumulation (average 18.3 Mg ha(-1)) than the Northeast (average 7.7 Mg ha(-1)) of the country.

TI  - Moisture content estimation of <i>Pinus radiata</i> and <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> from reconstructed leaf reflectance in the SWIR region
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Valparaiso, a central-southern region in Chile, has one of the highest rates of wildfire occurrence in the country. The constant threat of fires is mainly due to its highly flammable forest plantation, composed of 97.5% Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus. Fuel moisture content is one of the most relevant parameters for studying fire spreading and risk, and can be estimated from the reflectance of leaves in the short wave infra-red (SWIR) range, not easily available in most vision-based sensors. Therefore, this work addresses the problem of estimating the water content of leaves from the two previously mentioned species, without any knowledge of their spectrum in the SWIR band. To this end, and for validation purposes, the reflectance of 90 leaves per species, at five dehydration stages, were taken between 350 nm and 2500 nm (full spectrum). Then, two machine-learning regressors were trained with 70% of the data set to determine the unknown reflectance, in the range 1000 nm-2500 nm. Results were validated with the remaining 30% of the data, achieving a root mean square error less than 9% in the spectrum estimation, and an error of 10% in spectral indices related to water content estimation.

TI  - The role of integrins in melanoma: a review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Integrins are the major family of cell adhesion receptors in humans and essential for a wide range of normal physiology, including formation and maintenance of tissue structure integrity, cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Integrins also play a prominent role in tumor growth and metastasis. Translational research has tried to define the contribution of integrins to the phenotypic aggressiveness of melanoma because such knowledge is clinically useful. For example, differential expression of integrins in primary cutaneous melanoma can be used to distinguish indolent from aggressive, prometastatic melanoma. Recent studies have shown that gene expression-based testing of patient-derived melanoma tissue is feasible, and molecular tests may fully replace interventional surgical methods such as sentinel lymph node biopsies in the future. Because of their central role in mediating invasion and metastasis, integrins are likely to be useful biomarkers. Integrins are also attractive candidate targets for interventional therapy. This article focuses on the role of integrins in melanoma and highlights recent advances in the field of translational research.

TI  - Trends in Antibiotic Resistance Among Ocular Microorganisms in the United States From 2009 to 2018
T2  - JAMA OPHTHALMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance Antibiotic resistance in ocular infections can affect treatment outcomes. Surveillance data on evolving antibacterial susceptibility patterns inform the treatment of such infections. Objective To assess overall antibiotic resistance profiles and trends among bacterial isolates from ocular sources collected during 10 years. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study of longitudinal data from the ongoing, nationwide, prospective, laboratory-based surveillance study, the Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring in Ocular Microorganisms (ARMOR) study, included clinically relevant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae cultured from patients with ocular infections at US centers from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for various combinations of antibiotics and species. Odds ratios (ORs) were determined for concurrent antibiotic resistance; analysis of variance and chi(2) tests were used to evaluate resistance rates by patient age and geographic region; Cochran-Armitage tests identified changing antibiotic susceptibility trends over time. Results A total of 6091 isolates (2189 S aureus, 1765 CoNS, 590 S pneumoniae, 767 P aeruginosa, and 780 H influenzae) from 6091 patients were submitted by 88 sites. Overall, 765 S aureus (34.9%) and 871 CoNS (49.3%) isolates were methicillin resistant and more likely to be concurrently resistant to macrolides (azithromycin: S aureus: OR, 18.34 [95% CI, 13.64-24.67]; CoNS: OR, 4.59 [95% CI, 3.72-5.66]), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin: S aureus: OR, 22.61 [95% CI, 17.96-28.47]; CoNS: OR, 9.73 [95% CI, 7.63-12.40]), and aminoglycosides (tobramycin: S aureus: OR, 18.29 [95% CI, 13.21-25.32]; CoNS: OR, 6.28 [95% CI, 4.61-8.56]) compared with methicillin-susceptible isolates (P < .001 for all). Multidrug resistance was observed among methicillin-resistant S aureus (577 [75.4%]) and CoNS (642 [73.7%]) isolates. Antibiotic resistance among S pneumoniae isolates was highest for azithromycin (214 [36.3%]), whereas P aeruginosa and H influenzae isolates showed low resistance overall. Differences in antibiotic resistance were found among isolates by patient age (S aureus: F = 28.07, P < .001; CoNS: F = 11.46, P < .001) and geographic region (S aureus: F = 8.03, P < .001; CoNS: F = 4.79, P = .003; S pneumoniae: F = 8.14, P < .001; P aeruginosa: F = 4.32, P = .005). Small changes in antibiotic resistance were noted over time (<= 2.5% per year), with decreases in resistance to oxacillin/methicillin (oxacillin: -2.16%; 95% CI, -3.91% to -0.41%; P < .001) and other antibiotics among S aureus isolates, a decrease in ciprofloxacin resistance among CoNS (-1.38%; 95% CI, -2.24% to -0.52%; P < .001), and an increase in tobramycin resistance among CoNS (0.71%; 95% CI, -0.29% to 1.71%; P = .03). Besifloxacin retained consistently low minimum inhibitory concentrations. Conclusions and Relevance Antibiotic resistance may be prevalent among staphylococcal isolates, particularly among older patients. In this study, a few small differences in antibiotic resistance were observed by geographic region or longitudinally.This cross-sectional study assesses the types of antibiotic resistance profiles and trends among bacterial isolates from ocular sources that were prevalent from 2009 to 2018.Question What are the antibiotic resistance profiles and trends among common ocular pathogens across the United States? Findings In this cross-sectional study of more than 6000 ocular isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae collected between 2009 and 2018, methicillin resistance and multidrug resistance were prevalent among staphylococci. Antibiotic resistance profiles were mostly unchanged during 10 years. Meaning These in vitro antibiotic resistance data may assist clinicians in selecting appropriate antibiotics for treatment of ocular infections.

TI  - Detecting Spatiotemporal Expansion of Water Hyacinth (<i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>) in Lake Tana, Northern Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Northern Ethiopia, Lake Tana has serious problems related to the alien water hyacinth invasive weed. The weed species grows in and swims over water and expands very quickly. The purpose of this study is to detect the spatiotemporal trend of the weed during 2013, 2015 and 2017. Landsat 8 satellite images captured in December were used to assess the rate of expansion of the water hyacinth. Training samples were collected for supervised classification of the satellite images and accuracy assessment. Image preprocessing and image enhancement was carried out before classification. The expansion and distribution of the water hyacinth was analyzed using decision tree and maximum likelihood classification techniques. The classification accuracy assessment result for 2017 reported 99.5% overall accuracy and 98% of kappa coefficient. The result depicted that in 2013, water hyacinth coverage was very small in its coverage and was estimated to be 112.1 ha (0.17%) of the study area. In 2015, the coverage of the weed showed little significant change as of 2013 and grew up to 168.7 ha (0.25%). However, after two years, its aerial coverage was dynamically expanded to 1512 ha (2.25%) of the study area in 2017. The result indicated that there was rapid expansion of the weed species from 2015 to 2017s. The coverage increased by 50% in the period between 2013 and 2015 and by 82% in the period between 2015 and 2017. Since the expansion of the weed is extremely fast and endangers the existence of the water, appropriate intervention mechanisms should be urgently introduced.

TI  - May smart technologies reduce the environmental impact of nitrogen fertilization? A case study for paddy rice
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision agriculture is increasingly considered as a powerful solution to mitigate the environmental impact of farming systems. This is because of its ability to use multi-source information in decision support systems to increase the efficiency of farm management. Among the agronomic practices for which precision agriculture concepts were applied in research and operational contexts, variable rate (VR) nitrogen fertilization plays a key role. A promising approach to make quantitative, spatially distributed diagnoses to support VR N fertilization is based on the combined use of remote sensing information and few smart scouting-driven ground estimates to derive maps of nitrogen nutrition index (NNI). In this study, a new smart app for field NNI estimates (PocketNNI) was developed, which can be integrated with remote sensing data. The environmental impact of using PocketNNI and Sentinel 2 products to drive fertilization was evaluated using the Life Cycle Assessment approach and a case study on rice in northern Italy. In particular, the environmental performances of rice fertilized according to VR information derived from the integration of PocketNNI and satellite data was compared with a treatment based on uniform N application. Primary data regarding the cultivation practices and the achieved yields were collected during field tests.Results showed that VR fertilization allowed reducing the environmental impact by 11.0% to 13.6% as compared to uniform N application. For Climate Change, the impact is reduced from 9373 to 832.7 kg CO2 eq/t of paddy rice.The highest environmental benefits - mainly due to an improved ratio between grain yield and N fertilizers were achieved in terms of energy consumption for fertilizer production and of emission of N compounds. Although further validation is needed, these preliminary results are promising and provide a first quantitative indication of the environmental benefits that can be achieved when digital technologies are used to support N fertilization.

TI  - Patterns of failure in patients with cutaneous head and neck melanoma
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The incidence of head and neck melanoma is increasing. Various factors influence prognosis. Objective: We sought to investigate the subgroup of patients with head and neck melanoma who fail primary treatment and to define the patterns of failure.Methods: The database of a tertiary medical center was reviewed for patients diagnosed and surgically treated for cutaneous head and neck melanoma in 1995-2014. Regional disease failure was defined as disease confirmed in positive SLNB at first assessment or at recurrence.Results: The cohort included 141 patients followed for a median duration of 6.8 years (range 1-20 years). Median tumor thickness was 2.1 mm (range 0.5-12 mm). Ulceration was documented in 38 patients (26.9%). Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was positive in 18 patients (12.8%). Total disease failure rate was 32.6% with similar rates of regional (n = 26, 18.4%) and distal (n = 22, 15.6%) failure. Most patients (86.3%) with systemic recurrence had a negative SNLB as did 6/26 patients (23%) with regional failure. Forty-three patients (30.4%) died during follow-up, half of them (23 patients, 16.3%) of melanoma. On multivariate analysis, Breslow thickness was the only significant predictor of outcome.Conclusions: The pattern of treatment failure in patients with head and neck melanoma relate predominantly to Breslow thickness. The high false-negative rate of SNLB and the relatively high rate of systemic failures in patients with negative SNLB indicate a low predictive value of this procedure. Efforts to detect systemic disease during follow-up need to be intensified. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd, BASO similar to The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - Simulating Multi-Directional Narrowband Reflectance of the Earth's Surface Using ADAM (A Surface Reflectance Database for ESA's Earth Observation Missions)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ADAM (A Surface Reflectance Database for ESA's Earth Observation Missions) product (a climatological database coupled to its companion calculation toolkit) enables users to simulate realistic hyperspectral and directional global Earth surface reflectances (i.e., top-of-canopy/bottom-of-atmosphere) over the 240-4000 nm spectral range (at 1-nm resolution) and in any illumination/observation geometry, at 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees spatial resolution for a typical year. ADAM aims to support the preparation of optical Earth observation missions as well as the design of operational processing chains for the retrieval of atmospheric parameters by characterizing the expected surface reflectance, accounting for its anisotropy. Firstly, we describe (1) the methods used in the development of the gridded monthly ADAM climatologies (over land surfaces: monthly means of normalized reflectances derived from MODIS observations in seven spectral bands for the year 2005; over oceans: monthly means over the 1999-2009 period of chlorophyll content from SeaWiFS and of wind speed from SeaWinds), and (2) the underlying modeling approaches of ADAM toolkit to simulate the spectro-directional variations of the reflectance depending on the assigned surface type. Secondly, we evaluate ADAM simulation performances over land surfaces. A comparison against POLDER multi-spectral/multi-directional measurements for year 2008 shows reliable simulation results with root mean square differences below 0.027 and R-2 values above 0.9 for most of the 14 land cover IGBP classes investigated, with no significant bias identified. Only for the "Snow and ice" class is the performance lower pointing to a limitation of climatological data to represent actual snow properties. An evaluation of the modeled reflectance in the specific backscatter direction against CALIPSO data reveals that ADAM tends to overestimate (underestimate) the so-called "hot-spot" by a factor of about 1.5 (1.5 to 2) for barren (vegetated) surfaces.

TI  - Assessing Meteorological and Agricultural Drought in Chitral Kabul River Basin Using Multiple Drought Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a complex and poorly understood natural hazard in complex terrain and plains lie in foothills of Hindukush-Himalaya-Karakoram region of Central and South Asia. Few research studied climate change scenarios in the transboundary Chitral Kabul River Basin (CKRB) despite its vulnerability to global warming and importance as a region inhabited with more than 10 million people where no treaty on use of water exists between Afghanistan and Pakistan. This study examines the meteorological and agricultural drought between 2000 and 2018 and their future trends from 2020 to 2030 in the CKRB. To study meteorological and agricultural drought comprehensively, various single drought indices such as Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and combined drought indices such as Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI) and Microwave Integrated Drought Index (MIDI) were utilized. As non-microwave data were used in MIDI, this index was given a new name as Non-Microwave Integrated Drought Index (NMIDI). Our research has found that 2000 was the driest year in the monsoon season followed by 2004 that experienced both meteorological and agricultural drought between 2000 and 2018. Results also indicate that though there exists spatial variation in the agricultural and meteorological drought, but temporally there has been a decreasing trend observed from 2000 to 2018 for both types of droughts. This trend is projected to continue in the future drought projections between 2020 and 2030. The overall study results indicate that drought can be properly assessed by integration of different data sources and therefore management plans can be developed to address the risk and signing new treaties.

TI  - Novel Biomarkers Aim at Detecting Metastatic Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer
T2  - Iranian Biomedical Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Intra-operative molecular diagnostic assays are currently used for the detection of lymph node metastases. The objective of this study was to find new biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy in the detection of metastatic axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients. Methods: We applied an absolute quantitative real-time RT-PCR to quantitate the expression of CK19, KLK11, and CLEC3A mRNAs in 79 FFPE SLNs from 35 breast cancer patients. The CK19 was confirmed as a standard biomarker, and the level of expression of selected new markers, KLK11 and CLEC3A, was evaluated in pathologically negative and positive SLNs by using absolute quantitative real-time PCR. Results: The overall concordance of the CK19 gene with pathological results was 92.4% (less than 250 copies) in negative SLNs and 85% in positive SLNs (more than 250 copies). The sensitivity and specificity of CK19, which were detected by real-time PCR, was 85% and 46%, respectively. Our results revealed that lower CLEC3A was associated with more lymph node involvement. We could set a cut-off point for CLEC3A with the sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 60%. Also, the mean KLK11 had a statistically significant reverse correlation with tumor grade (p = 0.017). Higher CK19 levels were related to more tumor invasion (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Regarding the findings, CLEC3A along with CK19 can be used as a promising marker with high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of metastatic SLN.

TI  - Microscopic Extracapsular Extension in Sentinel Lymph Nodes Does Not Mandate Axillary Dissection in Z0011-Eligible Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In the ACOSOG (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group) Z0011 trial and the AMAROS (After Mapping of the Axilla: Radiotherapy or Surgery?) trial, matted nodes with gross extracapsular extension (ECE), a risk factor for locoregional recurrence, were an indication for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), but the effect of microscopic ECE (mECE) in the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) on recurrence was not examined. Methods Between 2010 and 2017, 811 patients with cT1-2N0 breast cancer and SLN metastasis were prospectively managed according to Z0011 criteria, with ALND for those with more than two positive SLNs or gross ECE. Management of mECE was not specified. In this study, we compare outcomes of patients with one to two positive SLNs with and without mECE, treated with SLN biopsy alone (n = 685). Results Median patient age was 58 years, and median tumor size was 1.7 cm. mECE was identified in 210 (31%) patients. Patients with mECE were older, had larger tumors, and were more likely to be hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative, have two positive SLNs, and receive nodal radiation. At a median follow-up of 41 months, no isolated axillary failures were observed. There were 11 nodal recurrences; two supraclavicular +/- axillary, four synchronous with breast, and five with distant failure. The five-year rate of any nodal recurrence was 1.6% and did not differ by mECE (2.3% vs. 1.3%; p = 0.84). No differences were observed in local (p = 0.08) or distant (p = 0.31) recurrence rates by mECE status. Conclusions In Z0011-eligible patients, nodal recurrence rates in patients with mECE are low after treatment with SLN biopsy alone, even in the absence of routine nodal radiation. The presence of mECE should not be considered a routine indication for ALND.

TI  - Exploring the ins and outs of biodiversity in the moral community
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - If moral concern for nonhuman nature underpins conservation, it is essential to understand how individuals populate their "moral communities," a core concept from environmental ethics, with various elements of biodiversity. Using data from an online survey of the United States public (N = 1331), we investigated the extent to which respondents' moral communities align with four worldviews discussed in the environmental ethics literature: anthropocentrism, zoocentrism, biocentrism, and ecocentrism. Each worldview provides a vision for how the moral community should be constituted. To assess inclusion in terms consistent with ethical theory, we measured whether and the extent to which respondents included abstract sets of entities (humans, sentient/subjective entities, living organisms, entities with vital interests). To assess inclusion in terms relevant to conservation, we measured whether and the extent to which respondents included specific kinds of entities within those sets (e.g., Americans, cougar, fungus, rainforest ecosystem). Roughly half the sample could be affiliated with anthropocentrism, zoocentrism, biocentrism, or ecocentrism, but these respondents did not always include the specific entities they were expected to include based on ethical theory. However, respondents with more inclusive worldviews did believe more entities are included in the moral community, and also professed those beliefs more strongly than respondents with less inclusive worldviews. If strength of inclusivity beliefs is associated with other pro-conservation attitudes, intentions, and behaviors, then people with larger, more diverse moral communities may more strongly support biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Elderly Age Is Associated With More Conservative Treatment of Invasive Melanoma
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Competing mortality risks complicate treatment of elderly melanoma patients potentially leading to conservative management, including no sentinel lymph node biopsy. As systemic immunotherapy offers justification for nodal evaluation, we examined treatment trends among elderly melanoma patients. Patients and Methods: We performed a National Cancer Database analysis of melanoma patients from 2004-2015. Patients were categorized by age (elderly >= 80-years-old). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed comparing characteristics and treatment by age. Results: Of 187,814 patients, 2.7% were 1-25, 11.6% were 26-40, 46.6% were 41-64, 28.8% were 65-79, and 10.3% were >= 80-years-old with clinicopathologic and treatment differences between age cohorts. Nodal surgery was least common among elderly patients (43.1% vs. 60.7-69.8%, p<0.0001). For stage III, immunotherapy was least common among the elderly (p<0.0001), but associated with greater survival (HR=0.52, 95%CI=0.32-0.84, p=0.008). Conclusion: Elderly melanoma patients were often treated conservatively, including no nodal evaluation, concerning for the potential undertreatment of this population.

TI  - Bar-HRM for identification of cryptic earthworm species
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate species identification is crucial in ecological research on sentinel species such as earthworms. Here, we developed a reliable and cost-efficient method for the rapid identification of taxa within the Allolobophora chlorotica complex of cryptic earthworm species. We combined high resolution melting (HRM) analysis with DNA barcoding (Bar-HRM) in a three-step approach: (i) selection of a mini-barcode in the 16S mitochondrial gene, (ii) test of the method on a panel of 16 reference individuals and (iii) identification at the species level of 24 unknown specimens. Thus, we proved the efficacy of Bar-HRM to discriminate between cryptic sister (or sibling) earthworm species and we provided a standardized method that can be easily adapted to other taxa.

TI  - Near Real-Time Irrigation Detection at Plot Scale Using Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of monitoring and assessment of water consumption in the agricultural sector, the objective of this study is to build an operational approach capable of detecting irrigation events at plot scale in a near real-time scenario using Sentinel-1 (S1) data. The proposed approach is a decision tree-based method relying on the change detection in the S1 backscattering coefficients at plot scale. First, the behavior of the S1 backscattering coefficients following irrigation events has been analyzed at plot scale over three study sites located in Montpellier (southeast France), Tarbes (southwest France), and Catalonia (northeast Spain). To eliminate the uncertainty between rainfall and irrigation, the S1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signal and the soil moisture estimations at grid scale (10 km x 10 km) have been used. Then, a tree-like approach has been constructed to detect irrigation events at each S1 date considering additional filters to reduce ambiguities due to vegetation development linked to the growth cycle of different crops types as well as the soil surface roughness. To enhance the detection of irrigation events, a filter using the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from Sentinel-2 optical images has been proposed. Over the three study sites, the proposed method was applied on all possible S1 acquisitions in ascending and descending modes. The results show that 84.8% of the irrigation events occurring over agricultural plots in Montpellier have been correctly detected using the proposed method. Over the Catalonian site, the use of the ascending and descending SAR acquisition modes shows that 90.2% of the non-irrigated plots encountered no detected irrigation events whereas 72.4% of the irrigated plots had one and more detected irrigation events. Results over Catalonia also show that the proposed method allows the discrimination between irrigated and non-irrigated plots with an overall accuracy of 85.9%. In Tarbes, the analysis shows that irrigation events could still be detected even in the presence of abundant rainfall events during the summer season where two and more irrigation events have been detected for 90% of the irrigated plots. The novelty of the proposed method resides in building an effective unsupervised tool for near real-time detection of irrigation events at plot scale independent of the studied geographical context.

TI  - Estimation of Daily Terrestrial Latent Heat Flux with High Spatial Resolution from MODIS and Chinese GF-1 Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable estimates of terrestrial latent heat flux (LE) at high spatial and temporal resolutions are of vital importance for energy balance and water resource management. However, currently available LE products derived from satellite data generally have high revisit frequency or fine spatial resolution. In this study, we explored the feasibility of the high spatiotemporal resolution LE fusion framework to take advantage of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Chinese GaoFen-1 Wide Field View (GF-1 WFV) data. In particular, three-fold fusion schemes based on Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) were employed, including fusion of surface reflectance (Scheme 1), vegetation indices (Scheme 2) and high order LE products (Scheme 3). Our results showed that the fusion of vegetation indices and further computing LE (Scheme 2) achieved better accuracy and captured more detailed information of terrestrial LE, where the determination coefficient (R-2) varies from 0.86 to 0.98, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) ranges from 1.25 to 9.77 W/m(2) and the relative RSME (rRMSE) varies from 2% to 23%. The time series of merged LE in 2017 using the optimal Scheme 2 also showed a relatively good agreement with eddy covariance (EC) measurements and MODIS LE products. The fusion approach provides spatiotemporal continuous LE estimates and also reduces the uncertainties in LE estimation, with an increment in R-2 by 0.06 and a decrease in RMSE by 23.4% on average. The proposed high spatiotemporal resolution LE estimation framework using multi-source data showed great promise in monitoring LE variation at field scale, and may have value in planning irrigation schemes and providing water management decisions over agroecosystems.

TI  - Optimizing Gaussian Process Regression for Image Time Series Gap-Filling and Crop Monitoring
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Image processing entered the era of artificial intelligence, and machine learning algorithms emerged as attractive alternatives for time series data processing. Satellite image time series processing enables crop phenology monitoring, such as the calculation of start and end of season. Among the promising algorithms, Gaussian process regression (GPR) proved to be a competitive time series gap-filling algorithm with the advantage of, as developed within a Bayesian framework, providing associated uncertainty estimates. Nevertheless, the processing of time series images becomes computationally inefficient in its standard per-pixel usage, mainly for GPR training rather than the fitting step. To mitigate this computational burden, we propose to substitute the per-pixel optimization step with the creation of a cropland-based precalculations for the GPR hyperparameters theta. To demonstrate our approach hardly affects the accuracy in fitting, we used Sentinel-2 LAI time series over an agricultural region in Castile and Leon, North-West Spain. The performance of image reconstructions were compared against the standard per-pixel GPR time series processing. Results showed that accuracies were on the same order (RMSE 0.1767 vs. 0.1564 [m2/m2], 12% RMSE degradation) whereas processing time accelerated about 90 times. We further evaluated the alternative option of using the same hyperparameters for all the pixels within the complete scene. It led to similar overall accuracies over crop areas and computational performance. Crop phenology indicators were also calculated for the three different approaches and compared. Results showed analogous crop temporal patterns, with differences in start and end of growing season of no more than five days. To the benefit of crop monitoring applications, all the gap-filling and phenology indicators retrieval techniques have been implemented into the freely downloadable GUI toolbox DATimeS.

TI  - DATimeS: A machine learning time series GUI toolbox for gap -filling and vegetation phenology trends detection
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remotely sensed data are typically discontinuous, with missing values due to cloud cover. Consequently, gap-filling solutions are needed for accurate crop phenology characterization. The here presented Decomposition and Analysis of Time Series software (DATimeS) expands established time series interpolation methods with a diversity of advanced machine learning fitting algorithms (e.g., Gaussian Process Regression: GPR) particularly effective for the reconstruction of multiple-seasons vegetation temporal patterns. DATimeS is freely available as a powerful image time series software that generates cloud-free composite maps and captures seasonal vegetation dynamics from regular or irregular satellite time series. This work describes the main features of DATimeS, and provides a demonstration case using Sentinel-2 Leaf Area Index time series data over a Spanish site. GPR resulted as an optimum fitting algorithm with most accurate gap-filling performance and associated uncertainties. DATimeS further quantified LAI fluctuations among multiple crop seasons and provided phenological indicators for specific crop types.

TI  - Integrated Landscape Change Analysis of Protected Areas and their Surrounding Landscapes: Application in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing tools have been long used to monitor landscape dynamics inside and around protected areas. Hereto, scientists have largely relied on land use and land cover (LULC) data to derive indicators for monitoring these dynamics, but these metrics do not capture changes in the state of vegetation surfaces that may compromise the ecological integrity of conservation areas' landscapes. Here, we introduce a methodology that combines LULC change estimates with three Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-based proxy indicators of vegetation productivity, phenology, and structural change. We illustrate the utility of this methodology through a regional and local analysis of the landscape dynamics in the Cerrado Biome in Brazil in 2001 and 2016. Despite relatively little natural vegetation loss inside core protected areas and their legal buffer zones, the different indicators revealed significant LULC conversions from natural vegetation to farming land, general productivity loss, homogenization of natural forests, significant agricultural expansion, and a general increase in productivity. These results suggest an overall degradation of habitats and intensification of land use in the studied conservation area network, highlighting serious conservation inefficiencies in this region and stressing the importance of integrated landscape change analyses to provide complementary indicators of ecologically-relevant dynamics in these key conservation areas.

TI  - Studying coral reef patterns in UAE waters using panel data analysis and multinomial logit and probit models
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Like coral reefs around the world, the reefs of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are facing global climate change and associated threats. The coasts and islands that flank Abu Dhabi host an important number of corals that should be the focus of conservation actions. Well-designed conservation and management plans require efficient monitoring systems that include understanding coral reef patterns. To understand some of these patterns; coral cover data, satellite-derived and in-situ water quality parameters from nine key reef environments in the UAE from 2011 to 2014 to model coral patterns were used. The objectives were to model coral patterns and realistically predict coral damage intensity with changing environmental variables. Coral damage cover models were defined and estimated for the coral damage cover. Effects of environmental factors were estimated, and predictions of coral damage intensity were presented with changing factors. Main findings, based on the studied data, showed that nutrient enrichment, a proxy for anthropogenic pressure, and salinity are the most influential factors to induce coral damage in UAE waters. Furthermore, results demonstrated that the probability of severe damage increases with decreasing water oxygenation and with increasing temperature, light, salinity, acidity and nutrient levels. The defined and estimated predictions accounted for corals' behavioural aspects, across individual reefs and over time. This approach is more appropriate than estimation predictions that just account for historic trends. Nevertheless, there are, probably, many components within the model framework that can be expanded and/or improved as more information become available. An extended dataset will enable a means to independently validate the defined models and test other modelling approaches. Continually increasing the insitu and remote sensing data sizes, spatially and temporally, defines a long-term priority.

TI  - The cultural code of antifeminist communication: Voicing opposition to the 'Feminist Zeitgeist'
T2  - ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper investigates the mechanisms of antifeminist communication norms, both on a theoretical and empirical level. Applying the concept of 'cultural codes' to the study of antifeminism we argue that statements denouncing feminism are often used as a signal to communicate a more general authoritarian worldview and an opposition towards 'political correctness'. In the empirical part we present a factorial survey design applied to a German sample. This design is used to experimentally vary four situational characteristics which hypothetically influence whether individuals comply with antifeminist communication norms: (a) the gender of the speaker, (b) the topic of the conversation, (c) the personal attributes of the mentioned 'feminist', and (d) the type of sexism (benevolent vs hostile) articulated. The study shows that compliance with antifeminist communication norms increases if respective statements are voiced by women instead of men, especially if respondents report higher social status. Antifeminist norm compliance is also higher if men instead of women mention sexual harassment accusations of feminists. For left respondents, compliance increases if benevolent instead of hostile sexism is articulated. Intersituational person-related factors of antifeminist communication which we observed are: authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and distrust in public and political institutions.

TI  - Flood monitoring and forecasting using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and meteorological data: A case study
T2  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Availability of several space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions has widened the scope of utilizing radar images for monitoring flooded areas. In this paper, the capability of SAR data was investigated to assess and map flooded regions in Sylhet, located in the northeast part of Bangladesh. Co-polarized (W) Satellite imageries from 2017 have been collected from Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1 B to use in this study. Relative Humidity (RH), Soil moisture and the amount of precipitation data have been used to predict spatiotemporal inundation in Sylhet region. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was implemented to forecast the runoff directions of water from mountain after heavy rainfalls in Sylhet region. Results of this study indicated that temporal flood prediction errors could be minimized especially for shorter lead times and overall, they showed the applicability of SAR which in combination with images from SAR, DEM and meteorological data that could be exploited to monitor the flooded areas and give better forecasts.

TI  - Avian Scavengers as Bioindicators of Antibiotic Resistance Due to Livestock Farming Intensification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial food animal production uses huge amounts of antibiotics worldwide. Livestock, their excreta used for manure and meat subproducts not intended for human consumption can all play important roles in the transmission of bacterial resistance to wildlife. Vultures and other scavengers can be directly exposed to active antibiotics ingested while feeding on livestock carcasses. This study evaluates whether bacterial resistance in the red kite (Milvus milvus) differs between two wintering areas selected based on patent differences in farming practices-particularly in the industrial production of food animals (primarily swine and poultry) vs. scarce and declining sheep herding. The results support the hypothesis that intensification in food animal production is associated with increased bacterial multidrug resistance in wildlife. Resistance was positively correlated with time elapsed since the beginning of the commercial application of each antibiotic in human and veterinary medicine, with clear differences depending on farming intensification between areas. Monitoring programs are encouraged to use red kites and other avian scavengers as valuable sentinels of contamination by antibiotics and clinically relevant resistant pathogens from livestock operations of variable intensities. Farms authorized for supplementary feeding of threatened scavengers should avoid supplying carcasses with active antibiotic residues to avoid bacterial resistance in scavenger wildlife.

AB  - Aim: Morbidity of open inguinal lymphadenectomy (OIL) is high. We use laparoscopy for pelvic time, preservation of the greater saphenous vein and transverse inguinal incisions (laparoscopically assisted ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy, LIIL) to improve postoperative outcomes. Patients & methods: Retrospective comparison of 14 patients who underwent LIIL and seven patients who underwent OIL. Results: Fourteen LIIL compared with seven OIL showed a statistically significant reduction in morbidity (15.3 vs 75%) and hospital stay (7 vs 15.7 days). Pelvic lymph node involvement (27%) was not detected preoperatively. With a mean follow-up of 36.2 (range: 3-137) months, local recurrence rate was 58.3% in LIIL and 40% in OIL. Overall survival was significantly higher in OIL than in LIIL. Conclusion: Compared with OIL, LIIL reduced postoperative complications and hospital stay.

AB  - Crop growth monitoring is an important phenomenon for agriculture classification, yield estimation, agriculture field management, improve productivity, irrigation, fertilizer management, sustainable agricultural development, food security and to understand how environment and climate change effect on crops especially in Russia as it has a large and diverse agricultural production. In this study, we assimilated monthly crop phenology from January to December 2018 by using the NDVI time series derived from moderate to high Spatio-temporal resolution Sentinel and Landsat data in cropland field at Samara airport area, Russia. The results support the potential of Sentinel and Landsat data derived NDVI time series for accurate crop phenological monitoring with all crop growth stages such as active tittering, jointing, maturity and harvesting according to crop calendar with reasonable thematic accuracy. This satellite data generated NDVI based work has great potential to provide valuable support for assessing crop growth status and the above-mentioned objectives with sustainable agriculture development.

TI  - A Virtual Geostationary Ocean Color Sensor to Analyze the Coastal Optical Variability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the coastal environment the optical properties can vary on temporal scales that are shorter than the near-polar orbiting satellite temporal resolution (similar to 1 image per day), which does not allow capturing most of the coastal optical variability. The objective of this work is to fill the gap between the near-polar orbiting and geostationary sensor temporal resolutions, as the latter sensors provide multiple images of the same basin during the same day. To do that, a Level 3 hyper-temporal analysis-ready Ocean Color (OC) dataset, named Virtual Geostationary Ocean Color Sensor (VGOCS), has been created. This dataset contains the observations acquired over the North Adriatic Sea by the currently functioning near-polar orbiting sensors, allowing approaching the geostationary sensor temporal resolution. The problem in using data from different sensors is that they are characterized by different uncertainty sources that can introduce artifacts between different satellite images. Hence, the sensors have different spatial and spectral resolutions, their calibration procedures can have different accuracies, and their Level 2 data can be retrieved using different processing chains. Such differences were reduced here by adjusting the satellite data with a multi-linear regression algorithm that exploits the Fiducial Reference Measurements data stream of the AERONET-OC water-leaving radiance acquired at the Acqua Alta Oceanographic Tower, located in the Gulf of Venice. This work aims to prove the suitability of VGOCS in analyzing the coastal optical variability, presenting the improvement brought by the adjustment on the quality of the satellite data, the VGOCS spatial and temporal coverage, and the inter-sensor differences. Hence, the adjustment will strongly increase the agreement between the satellite and in situ data and between data from different near-polar orbiting OC imagers; moreover, the adjustment will make available data traditionally masked in the standard processing chains, increasing the VGOCS spatial and temporal coverage, fundamental to analyze the coastal optical variability. Finally, the fulfillment by VGOCS of the three conditions for a hyper-temporal dataset will be demonstrated in this work.

TI  - Using Satellite Imagery to Evaluate Bark Beetle-Caused Tree Mortality Reported in Aerial Surveys in a Mixed Conifer Forest in Northern Idaho, USA
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bark beetles cause significant tree mortality in western North America. The United States Forest Service coordinates annual insect and disease surveys (IDS) by observers in airplanes to map and quantify the tree mortality caused by beetles. The subjective nature of these surveys means that accuracy evaluation is important for characterizing uncertainty. Furthermore, the metric reported for quantifying tree mortality recently changed (2012-2018 depending in region) from killed trees per acre to percent tree mortality within damage polygons, posing challenges for linking older and newer records. Here we evaluated IDS severity estimates in a beetle-affected forest in northern Idaho, USA using fine-resolution satellite imagery, which permitted greater areal coverage than field data. We first used well-established methods to map beetle-caused tree mortality in two WorldView-2 (WV2) images with a high accuracy relative to field observations. Trees-per-acre measurements within collocated IDS polygons were then converted to percent mortality using three methods and evaluated with the WV2 maps. The overall accuracies for the three methods ranged from 35-38% (for methods that used five percent-mortality classes) and 49-56% (three classes). When IDS and WV2 estimates of mortality severity that were within +/- 15% of each other were considered accurate, overall accuracies were 71-78%. Within the aerial survey damage polygons, the total mortality area tended to be overestimated relative to WV2. WV2 imagery identified similar to 50% more mortality across the study region compared with the IDS methods, with most of the difference occurring where damage was low severity or in wilderness areas. Severity of Douglas-fir beetle-caused tree mortality was estimated the most accurately, whereas severity of mountain pine beetle-caused tree mortality was estimated the least accurately. Future studies that control for temporal ambiguity between IDS and satellite imagery, as well as IDS spatial error, might provide better assessments of IDS severity accuracy. Our study increases the usefulness of the rich aerial survey database by providing estimates of uncertainty in the IDS database of tree mortality severity.

TI  - Mapping Multiple Insect Outbreaks across Large Regions Annually Using Landsat Time Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest insect outbreaks have caused and will continue to cause extensive tree mortality worldwide, affecting ecosystem services provided by forests. Remote sensing is an effective tool for detecting and mapping tree mortality caused by forest insect outbreaks. In this study, we map insect-caused tree mortality across three coniferous forests in the Western United States for the years 1984 to 2018. First, we mapped mortality at the tree level using field observations and high-resolution multispectral imagery collected in 2010, 2011, and 2018. Using these high-resolution maps of tree mortality as reference images, we then classified moderate-resolution Landsat imagery as disturbed or undisturbed and for disturbed pixels, predicted percent tree mortality with random forest (RF) models. The classification approach and RF models were then applied to time series of Landsat imagery generated with Google Earth Engine (GEE) to create annual maps of percent tree mortality. We separated disturbed from undisturbed forest with overall accuracies of 74% to 80%. Cross-validated RF models explained 61% to 68% of the variation in percent tree mortality within disturbed 30-m pixels. Landsat-derived maps of tree mortality were comparable to vector aerial survey data for a variety of insect agents, in terms of spatial patterns of mortality and annual estimates of total mortality area. However, low-level tree mortality was not always detected. We conclude that our methodology has the potential to generate reasonable estimates of annual tree mortality across large extents.

TI  - Near-daily discharge estimation in high latitudes from Sentinel-1 and 2: A case study for the Icelandic Pjorsa river
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is a threat to many high-latitude regions. Changing patterns in precipitation intensity and increasing glacial ablation during spring and summer have major influence on river dynamics and the risk of widespread flooding. To monitor these rapid events, more frequent discharge observations are necessary. Having access to near-daily satellite based discharge observations is therefore highly beneficial. In this context, the recently launched Sentinel-1 and 2 satellites promise unprecedented potential, due to their capacity to obtain radar and optical data at high spatial (10 m) and high temporal (1-3 days) resolutions. Here, we use both missions to provide a novel approach to estimate the discharge of the Pjorsa (Thjorsa) river, Iceland, on a near-daily basis. Iceland, and many other high-latitude regions, are affected by frequent cloud-cover, limiting the availability of cloud-free optical Sentinel-2 data. We trained a Random Forest supervised machine learning classifier with a set of Sentinel-1 backscatter metrics to classify water in the individual Sentinel-1 images. A Sentinel-2 based classification mask was created to improve the classification results. Second, we derived the river surface area and converted it to the effective width, which we used to estimate the discharge using an at-a-station hydraulic geometry (AHG) rating curve. We trained the rating curve for a six-month training period using in situ discharge observations and assessed the effect of training area selection. We used the trained rating curve to estimate discharge for a one-year monitoring period between 2017/10 and 2018/10. Results showed a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.831, indicating the usefulness of dense Sentinel-1 and 2 observations for accurate discharge estimations of a medium-sized (200 m width) high-latitude river on a near-daily basis (1.56 days on average). We demonstrated that satellite based discharge products can be a valuable addition to in situ discharge observations, also during ice-jam events.

M3  - Article
AB  - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Sentinel System uses a distributed data network, a common data model, curated real-world data, and distributed analytic tools to generate evidence for FDA decision-making. Sentinel system needs include analytic flexibility, transparency, and reproducibility while protecting patient privacy. Based on over a decade of experience, a critical system limitation is the inability to identify enough medical conditions of interest in observational data to a satisfactory level of accuracy. Improving the system's ability to use computable phenotypes will require an "all of the above" approach that improves use of electronic health data while incorporating the growing array of complementary electronic health record data sources. FDA recently funded a Sentinel System Innovation Center and a Community Building and Outreach Center that will provide a platform for collaboration across disciplines to promote better use of real-world data for decision-making.

TI  - Satellite-based estimates reveal widespread forest degradation in the Amazon
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic and natural forest disturbance cause ecological damage and carbon emissions. Forest disturbance in the Amazon occurs in the form of deforestation (conversion of forest to non-forest land covers), degradation from the extraction of forest resources, and destruction from natural events. The crucial role of the Amazon rainforest in the hydrologic cycle has even led to the speculation of a disturbance "tipping point" leading to a collapse of the tropical ecosystem. Here we use time series analysis of Landsat data to map deforestation, degradation, and natural disturbance in the Amazon Ecoregion from 1995 to 2017. The map was used to stratify the study area for selection of sample units that were assigned reference labels based on their land cover and disturbance history. An unbiased statistical estimator was applied to the sample of reference observations to obtain estimates of area and uncertainty at biennial time intervals. We show that degradation and natural disturbance, largely during periods of severe drought, have affected as much of the forest area in the Amazon Ecoregion as deforestation from 1995 to 2017. Consequently, an estimated 17% (1,036,800 +/- 24,800 km(2), 95% confidence interval) of the original forest area has been disturbed as of 2017. Our results suggest that the area of disturbed forest in the Amazon is 44%-60% more than previously realized, indicating an unaccounted for source of carbon emissions and pervasive damage to forest ecosystems.

M3  - Article
AB  - A set of six spotlight TerraSAR-X images acquired at HH and VV polarizations in 2009 over an agricultural site in Germany are employed to evaluate the potential contribution of polarimetric features derived from this copolar mode to crop-type mapping. Results show that the inclusion of the correlation between copolar channels in the set of input features of the classifier consistently improves the classification performance with respect to the use of only backscattering coefficients. An increase around 8%-10% in overall accuracy, depending on the experiment setup, is achieved. Both user and producer accuracies are improved for all crop types, being the most noticeable contribution for barley, oat, and sugar beet. Different sets of input features, as well as classification and evaluation strategies, are tested in order to assess the robustness of this contribution.

TI  - Fine debris flows formed by the Orientale basin
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The prototype for investigations of formation mechanisms and related geological effects of large impact basins on planetary bodies has been the Orientale basin on the Moon. Its widespread secondaries, light plains, and near-rim melt flows have been well mapped in previous studies. Flow features are also widely associated with secondaries on planetary bodies, but their physical properties are not well constrained. The nature of flow features associated with large impact basins are critically important to understand the emplacement process of basin ejecta, which is one of the most fundamental processes in shaping the shallow crusts of planetary bodies. Here we use multisource remote sensing data to constrain the physical properties of flow features formed by the secondaries of the Orientale basin. The results suggest that such flows are dominated by centimeter-scale fine debris fines; larger boulders are not abundant. The shattering of target materials during the excavation of the Orientale basin, landing impact of ejecta that formed the secondaries, and grain comminution within the flows have substantially reduced particle sizes, forming the fine flows. The discovery of global-wide fine debris flows formed by large impact basins has profound implications to the interpretation of both previously-returned samples and remote sensing data.

TI  - Population Estimates from Orbital Data of Medium Spatial Resolution: Applications for a Brazilian Municipality
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, there has been an increase in the search for more detailed information on population dynamics, given the growing demand for more sustainable economic, social, and environmental planning. The dissemination of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has contributed to the development of methodologies for the field of population estimates for small areas. To support more sustainable policies, this study aims to evaluate the capacity and contribution of the orbital images (Landsat ETM+) for the production of post-census population estimates for the municipality of Contagem, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Firstly, models were built using the average of the reflectance of the spectral bands of the Landsat 7 ETM+ for each special intra-municipal unit, called the census sector, as explanatory variables for the population density. Secondly, this study constructed models that use the reflectance and the distributed population at the level of the pixels of the images. All models were tested through internal validation procedures, external validation, and comparative analyses with post-census estimates. Internal validation presented excellent results (below 7%), while in external validation, the method at the level of the pixels presented consistent results, below 1% relative error. These results provide useful clues and can help policymakers in the development of more sustainable and effective public policies, insofar as population estimates are extremely important for the planning of any society.

TI  - Bearing capacity of welded composite T-shaped concrete-filled steel tubular columns under axial compression
T2  - ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The axial compressive experiments were carried out on 21 welded composite T-shaped concrete-filled steel tubular columns, and 395 finite element models were established for parameter calculation. The calculating formula of axial compressive bearing capacity of welded composite T-shaped concrete-filled steel tubular columns is established. The results show that three typical failure modes were found: middle buckling, end local buckling, and integral bending. When the slenderness ratio lambda exceeds the elastic instability limit lambda(p), the axial stress of steel is lower than yield strength f(y), and the axial stress of core concrete is lower than axial compressive strength f(c). Increasing the thickness of steel has a more obvious effect on increasing the axial compressive bearing capacity of specimen. The theoretical calculating formula can effectively predict the axial compressive bearing capacity, and the theoretical calculation is partial to safety. The average ratio of axial compressive bearing capacity of the theoretical calculation to the experimental is 0.909, and the standard deviation is 0.075. The average ratio of axial compressive bearing capacity of the finite element calculation to the experimental is 0.957, and the standard deviation is 0.045. The average ratio of axial compressive bearing capacity of the theoretical calculation to the finite element calculation is 0.951, and the standard deviation is 0.039.

TI  - Retrieval and Analysis of Sea Surface Salinity in the Adjacent Waters of the Yangtze River Estuary Based on Multisource Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor, and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite multisource satellite remote sensing reflectance data are used with in situ sea surface salinity (SSS) measurements in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea. A linear algorithm is developed for the retrieval of summer SSS in adjacent waters of the Yangtze Estuary in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea. The accuracy of SSS retrieval results is validated using independent in situ measurements. Results show that the mean bias of the model is 0.34 psu, the rootmean-square error is 1.55 psu, and the correlation coefficient is 0.80. The linear model is extended to the retrieval of multisource satellite monthly remote sensing reflectance data to obtain monthly SSS products of the Yangtze Estuary. The spatial coverage of fused satellite SSS data is about 10% greater than that of single-satellite monthly retrieved SSS data. The SSS in the Yangtze Estuary research area has lower values nearshore and higher values offshore. The SSS gradually rises from nearshore areas to open water, and an obvious low-salinity water tongue forms in the Yangtze Estuary. The eastward expansion of freshwater flows of the Yangtze River into the sea is mainly affected by the runoff of the Yangtze River, while a southerly wind and northeastward flow in the research area are the main factors responsible for the eastward expansion of the Yangtze River freshwater flows to the NE. The effect of freshwater on the Yellow Sea and East China Sea extends to 125.5 degrees E, and the low-salinity freshwater tongue distributes northeastward. The expansion types of the Yangtze River freshwater include NE expansion, N-NE expansion, E-NE expansion, bidirectional expansion, and nondirectional expansion.

TI  - Deep learning-based remote and social sensing data fusion for urban region function recognition
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban region function recognition is key to rational urban planning and management. Due to the complex socioeconomic nature of functional land use, recognizing urban region function in high-density cities using remote sensing images alone is difficult. The inclusion of social sensing has the potential to improve the function classification performance. However, effectively integrating the multi-source and multi-modal remote and social sensing data remains technically challenging. In this paper, we have proposed a novel end-to-end deep learning-based remote and social sensing data fusion model to address this issue. Two neural network based methods, one based on a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and the other based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, have been developed to automatically extract discriminative time-dependent social sensing signature features, which are fused with remote sensing image features extracted via a residual neural network. One of the major difficulties in exploiting social and remote sensing data is that the two data sources are asynchronous. We have developed a deep learning-based strategy to address this missing modality problem by enforcing cross-modal feature consistency (CMFC) and cross-modal triplet (CMT) constraints. We train the model in an end-to-end manner by simultaneously optimizing three costs, including the classification cost, the CMFC cost and the CMT cost. Extensive experiments have been conducted on publicly available datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in fusing remote and social sensing data for urban region function recognition. The results show that the seemingly unrelated physically sensed image data and social activities sensed signatures can indeed complement each other to help enhance the accuracy of urban region function recognition.

TI  - Quantifying urban areas with multi-source data based on percolation theory
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying urban areas is crucial for addressing associated urban issues such as environmental and sustainable problems. Remote sensing data, especially the nighttime light images, have been widely used to delineate urbanized areas across the world. Meanwhile, some emerging urban data, such as volunteered geographical information (e.g., OpenStreetMap) and social sensing data (e.g., mobile phone and social media), have also shown great potential in revealing urban boundaries and dynamics. However, consistent and robust methods to quantify urban areas from these multi-source data have remained elusive. Here, we propose a percolation-based method to extract urban areas from these multi-source urban data. We derive the optimal urban/non-urban threshold by considering the critical nature of urban systems with the support of the percolation theory. Furthermore, we apply the method with three open-source datasets - population, road, and nighttime light - to 28 countries. We show that the proposed method captures the similar urban characteristics in terms of urban areas from multi-source data, and Zipf's law holds well in most countries. The accuracy of the derived urban areas by different datasets has been validated with the Landsat-based reference data in 10 cities, and the accuracy can be further improved through data fusion (kappa = 0.69-0.85, mean kappa = 0.78). Our study not only provides an efficient method to quantify urban areas with open-source data, but also deepens the understanding of urban systems and sheds some light on multi-source data fusion in geographical fields.

TI  - Remote-Sensing-Based Water Balance for Monitoring of Evapotranspiration and Water Stress of a Mediterranean Oak-Grass Savanna
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean oak savannas (known as dehesas in Spain) are exposed to numerous threats from natural and economic causes. A close monitoring of the use of water resources and the status of the vegetation in these ecosystems can be useful tools for maintaining the production of ecological services. This study explores the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) and water stress over a dehesa by integrating remotely sensed data into a water balance using the FAO-56 approach (VI-ETo model). Special attention is paid to the different phenology and contribution to the system's hydrology of the two main canopy layers of the system (tree + grass). The results showed that the model accurately reproduced the dynamics of the water consumed by the vegetation, with RMSE of 0.47 mm day(-1) and low biases for both, the whole system and the grass layer, when compared with flux tower measurements. The ET/ETo ratio helped to identify periods of water stress, confirmed for the grassland by measured soil water content. The modeling scheme and Sentinel-2 temporal resolution allowed the reproduction of fast and isolated ET pulses, important for understanding the hydrologic behavior of the system, confirming the adequacy of this sensor for monitoring grasslands water dynamics.

TI  - Sentinel-1 observation frequency significantly increases burnt area detectability in tropical SE Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent cloud cover in the tropics significantly affects the observation of the surface by satellites. This has enormous implications for current approaches that estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fires or map fire scars. These mainly employ data acquired in the visible to middle infrared bands to map fire scars or thermal data to estimate fire radiative power and consequently derive emissions. The analysis here instead explores the use of microwave data from the operational Sentinel-1A (S-1A) in dual-polarisation mode (VV and VH) acquired over Central Kalimantan during the 2015 fire season. Burnt areas were mapped in three consecutive periods between August and October 2015 using the random forests machine learning algorithm. In each mapping period, the omission and commission errors of the unburnt class were always below 3%, while the omission and commission errors of the burnt class were below 20% and 5% respectively. Summing the detections from the three periods gave a total burnt area of similar to 1.6 million ha, but this dropped to similar to 1.2 million ha if using only a pair of pre- and post-fire season S-1A images. Hence the ability of Sentinel-1 to make frequent observations significantly increases fire scar detection. Comparison with burnt area estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burnt area product at 5 km scale showed poor agreement, with consistently much lower estimates produced by the MODIS data-on average 14%-51% of those obtained in this study. The method presented in this study offers a way to reduce the substantial errors likely to occur in optical-based estimates of GHG emissions from fires in tropical areas affected by substantial cloud cover.

TI  - Evaluating free and simple remote sensing methods for mapping Chinese privet (<i>Ligustrum sinense</i>) invasions in hardwood forests
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense) is a common invasive shrub in hardwood forests of the southeastern US and has been shown to negatively affect native herbaceous and woody plants. The ability to map the distribution of L. sinense on a property could help land managers plan and budget for control operations. We evaluated whether freely available moderate resolution multispectral imageries (Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2) and open-source GIS software (QGIS with the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin) could be effective tools for this application. These tools are widely used by remote sensing and mapping professionals; however their adoption by field-level land managers appears limited, and their utility for mapping L. sinense invasions is untested. We evaluated how satellite type, image acquisition date, classification algorithm, and L. sinense cover affected detection accuracy. We found that Sentinel 2 imagery from March tended to produce good results, especially when analyzed using the maximum likelihood algorithm. Our best classifier obtained an overall accuracy of 92.3% for areas with >= 40% L. sinense cover. We recommend that land managers interested in applying this tool use an adaptive process for developing training polygons and test multiple images and classification algorithms in order to achieve optimal results.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this article we study the fundamental characteristics of the goddess Maat, highlighting her instrumental role in maintaining the balance and order of the cosmos. We start by studying the "Maat de Firenze", considering her plastic perfection, before presenting different facets of the goddess. Instead of understanding her as an ethical-moral abstract construct, we highlight her importance for Egyptian thought, her characteristics as a divinity in the pantheon and her relation with other gods. Then we analyze her role in Egyptian literature and finally her female character as a symbol of Egyptian women. The central argument is that her feminine nature forms the basis of her central position in the worldview of ancient Egypt. She embodies the importance of women in this ancient civilization, defined by some authors as uterine more than phallic.

TI  - Caring for Contemporary Mystics: Pentecostalism and the Mystical Worldview
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPIRITUAL FORMATION AND SOUL CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pentecostals can be understood as contemporary Christian mystics, and doing so can aid one in both understanding and caring for them. The task of understanding them is facilitated by this category in that it allows one to inhabit a different mindset from what is typical in contemporary settings. Pentecostalism and charismatic movements work out of distinct, fundamental claims that together work as a kind of worldview, one that operates from a hyperawareness of God's presence and a sensed empowerment of the mystic's self. The task of caring for them should honor these claims all the while being open to the Spirit's presence and work.

TI  - Resisting rape culture: The ten concubines of 2 Samuel 15-20 and #MeToo
T2  - REVIEW & EXPOSITOR
M3  - Article
AB  - This article poses this question: how do readers engage sacred texts in ways that honor the work of #MeToo by combatting the normalization of sexual violence within our society, by hearing the voices of victims of sexual violence, and by holding perpetrators of sexual violence accountable? First, identify and eradicate "rape myths." Second, promote affirmative consent. Third, practice shifting our worldview. To illustrate, this article examines a case study of ten concubines. Identification of attitudes of rape culture permeating modern biblical scholarship highlights the need for a new reading of these women. Outlining the patterns of power, consent, and autonomy within the narrative of 2 Samuel 15-20 resists modern "rape myths" and offers a liberative way for readers to engage this story in the era of #MeToo.

TI  - Local, Daily, and Total Bio-Optical Models of Coastal Waters of Manfredonia Gulf Applied to Simulated Data of CHRIS, Landsat TM, MIVIS, MODIS, and PRISMA Sensors for Evaluating the Error
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial-temporal resolution of remote data covers coastal water variability, but this approach offers a lower accuracy than in situ observations. Two of the major error sources occur due to the parameterization of bio-optical models and spectral capability of the remote data. These errors were evaluated by exploiting data acquired in the coastal waters of Manfredonia Gulf. Chlorophyll-a concentrations, absorption of the colored dissolved organic material at 440 nm (a(CDOM440nm)), and tripton concentrations measured in situ varied between 0.09-1.76 mgm(-3), 0.00-0.41 m(-1), and 1.97-8.90 gm(-3). In accordance with the position and time of in situ surveys, 36 local models, four daily models, and one total bio-optical model were parameterized and validated using in situ data before applying to Compact High-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) mode 1, CHRIS mode 2, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Precursore Iperspettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) simulated data. Concentrations retrieved from PRISMA data using local models highlighted the smallest errors. Because tripton abundance is great and tripton absorptions were better resolved than those of chlorophyll-a and colored dissolved organic material (CDOM), tripton concentrations were adequately retrieved from all data using total models, while only local models adequately retrieved chlorophyll-a concentrations and a(CDOM440nm) from CHRIS mode 1, CHRIS mode 2, MIVIS, and MODIS data. Therefore, the application of local models shows smaller errors than those of daily and total models; however, the capability to resolve the absorption of water constituents and analyze their concentration range can dictate the model choice. Consequently, the integration of more models allows us to overcome the limitations of the data and sensors.

AB  - Purpose The objectives of the International epidemiology databases to evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) are to (i) evaluate the delivery of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in children, adolescents and adults in sub-Saharan Africa, (ii) to describe ART regimen effectiveness, durability and tolerability, (iii) to examine HIV-related comorbidities and coinfections and (iv) to examine the pregnancy-related and HIV-related outcomes of women on ART and their infants exposed to HIV or ART in utero or via breast milk.Participants IeDEA is organised in four regions (Central, East, Southern and West Africa), with 240 treatment and care sites, six data centres at African, European and US universities, and almost 1.4 million children, adolescents and adult people living with HIV (PLWHIV) enrolled.Findings to date The data include socio-demographic characteristics, clinical outcomes, opportunistic events, treatment regimens, clinic visits and laboratory measurements. They have been used to analyse outcomes in PLWHIV-1 or PLWHIV-2 who initiate ART, including determinants of mortality, of switching to second-line and third-line ART, drug resistance, loss to follow-up and the immunological and virological response to different ART regimens. Programme-level estimates of mortality have been corrected for loss to follow-up. We examined the impact of coinfection with hepatitis B and C, and the epidemiology of different cancers and of (multidrug resistant) tuberculosis, renal disease and of mental illness. The adoption of 'Treat All', making ART available to all PLWHIV regardless of CD4+ cell count or clinical stage was another important research topic.Future plans IeDEA has formulated several research priorities for the 'Treat All' era in sub-Saharan Africa. It recently obtained funding to set up sentinel sites where additional data are prospectively collected on cardiometabolic risks factors as well as mental health and liver diseases, and is planning to create a drug resistance database.

TI  - Surveillance from the high ground: sentinel surveillance of injuries and poisonings associated with cannabis
T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION AND CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION IN CANADA-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In October 2018, Canada legalized the nonmedical use of cannabis for adults. The aim of our study was to present a more recent temporal pattern of cannabis-related injuries and poisonings found in the electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP) database and provide a descriptive summary of the injury characteristics of cannabis-related cases captured in a nine-year period.Methods: We conducted a search for cannabis-related cases in the eCHIRPP database reported between April 2011 and August 2019. The study population consisted of patients between the ages of 0 and 79 years presenting to the 19 selected emergency departments across Canada participating in the eCHIRPP program. We calculated descriptive estimates examining the intentionality, external cause, type and severity of cannabis-related cases to better understand the contextual factors of such cases. We also conducted time trend analyses using Joinpoint software establishing the directionality of cannabis-related cases over the years among both children and adults.Results: Between 1 April, 2011, and 9 August, 2019, there were 2823 cannabis-related cases reported in eCHIRPP, representing 252.3 cases/100 000 eCHIRPP cases. Of the 2823 cannabis-related cases, a majority involved cannabis use in combination with one or more substances (63.1%; 1780 cases). There were 885 (31.3%) cases that involved only cannabis, and 158 cases (5.6%) that related to cannabis edibles. The leading external cause of injury among children and adults was poisoning. A large proportion of cannabis-related cases were unintentional in nature, and time trend analyses revealed that cannabis-related cases have recently been increasing among both children and adults. Overall, 15.1% of cases involved serious injuries requiring admission to hospital.Conclusion: Cannabis-related cases in the eCHIRPP database are relatively rare, a finding that may point to the fact that mental and behavioural disorders resulting from cannabis exposure are not generally captured in this surveillance system and the limited number of sites found across Canada. With Canada's recent amendments to cannabis regulations, ongoing surveillance of the health impacts of cannabis will be imperative to help advance evidence to protect the health of Canadians.

TI  - Hindcast and forecast of daily inundation extents using satellite SAR and altimetry data with rotated empirical orthogonal function analysis: Case study in Tonle Sap Lake Floodplain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tonle Sap Lake (TSL) is the largest natural freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and is called the "heart of the lower Mekong" due to its high aquatic biodiversity and is considered as one of the most productive freshwater ecosystems of the world. Its floodplain eco-system, which is strongly tied to seasonal flood pulse, is extremely important for food security, trade and economy of Cambodia, supporting the livelihoods of about 1.7 million people. On the other hand, flood can also be extremely devastating in the region along the TSL. In recent years, studies have pointed out that rapid growing number of water infrastructures as well as future climate changes may alter the hydrological cycle of the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and are expected to influence the flood pulse of the TSL and surrounding TSL floodplain. Therefore, it is timely to understand historical inundation extent and predict its likely future state. In this study, we proposed a Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis-based daily inundation extent estimation framework, integrating multi-temporal stack of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Jason-series satellite altimetry data. The framework can generate daily, cloud-free and gap-free inundation extents for any given time depending on the altimetry data provided. A long-term El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index-based daily TSL level forecasting method with months of lead time was also proposed to fulfill the framework's forecasting capacity. In this study, the framework was adopted in the TSL floodplain area for hindcast (2003 to 2015) and forecast (January to July 2019) of daily inundation extents. Estimated inundation extents were cross-compared with MODIS-derived and Sentinel-1-derived inundation maps, resulting in up to higher than 90% of Critical Success Index (CSI). The proposed framework has (1) innovative capacity of estimation of future daily areal inundation extents and is (2) a fully remote sensing-based framework which can empower local authorities tasked with water resource management decisions without relying on upstream countries. The framework has potential to be implemented in other major river basins or wetlands (e.g., Amazon River Basin, and Congo River Basin). The implementation on SAR imagery from other satellites with different bands of electromagnetic wave is also possible but requires more investigation.

TI  - Mapping Floristic Patterns of Trees in Peruvian Amazonia Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recognition of the spatial variation in tree species composition is a necessary precondition for wise management and conservation of forests. In the Peruvian Amazonia, this goal is not yet achieved mostly because adequate species inventory data has been lacking. The recently started Peruvian national forest inventory (INFFS) is expected to change the situation. Here, we analyzed genus-level variation, summarized through non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), in a set of 157 INFFS inventory plots in lowland to low mountain rain forests (<2000 m above sea level) using Landsat satellite imagery and climatic, edaphic, and elevation data as predictor variables. Genus-level floristic patterns have earlier been found to be indicative of species-level patterns. In correlation tests, the floristic variation of tree genera was most strongly related to Landsat variables and secondly to climatic variables. We used random forest regression, under varying criteria of feature selection and cross-validation, to predict the floristic composition on the basis of Landsat and environmental data. The best model explained >60% of the variation along NMDS axes 1 and 2 and 40% of the variation along NMDS axis 3. We used this model to predict the three NMDS dimensions at a 450-m resolution over all of the Peruvian Amazonia and classified the pixels into 10 floristic classes using k-means classification. An indicator analysis identified statistically significant indicator genera for 8 out of the 10 classes. The results are congruent with earlier studies, suggesting that the approach is robust and can be applied to other tropical regions, which is useful for reducing research gaps and for identifying suitable areas for conservation.

TI  - To Blend or Not to Blend? A Framework for Nationwide Landsat-MODIS Data Selection for Crop Yield Prediction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The onus for monitoring crop growth from space is its ability to be applied anytime and anywhere, to produce crop yield estimates that are consistent at both the subfield scale for farming management strategies and the country level for national crop yield assessment. Historically, the requirements for satellites to successfully monitor crop growth and yield differed depending on the extent of the area being monitored. Diverging imaging capabilities can be reconciled by blending images from high-temporal-frequency (HTF) and high-spatial-resolution (HSR) sensors to produce images that possess both HTF and HSR characteristics across large areas. We evaluated the relative performance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat, and blended imagery for crop yield estimates (2009-2015) using a carbon-turnover yield model deployed across the Australian cropping area. Based on the fraction of missing Landsat observations, we further developed a parsimonious framework to inform when and where blending is beneficial for nationwide crop yield prediction at a finer scale (i.e., the 25-m pixel resolution). Landsat provided the best yield predictions when no observations were missing, which occurred in 17% of the cropping area of Australia. Blending was preferred when <42% of Landsat observations were missing, which occurred in 33% of the cropping area of Australia. MODIS produced a lower prediction error when >= 42% of the Landsat images were missing (similar to 50% of the cropping area). By identifying when and where blending outperforms predictions from either Landsat or MODIS, the proposed framework enables more accurate monitoring of biophysical processes and yields, while keeping computational costs low.

TI  - SENTINEL: A Secure and Efficient Authentication Framework for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles (commonly referred to as a "drone") has posed security and safety challenges. To mitigate security threats caused by flights of unauthorized drones, we present a framework called SENTINEL (Secure and Efficient autheNTIcation for uNmanned aErial vehicLes) under the Internet of Drones (IoD) infrastructure. SENTINEL is specifically designed to minimize the computational and traffic overheads caused by certificate exchanges and asymmetric cryptography computations that are typically required for authentication protocols. SENTINEL initially generates a flight session key for a drone having a flight plan and registers the flight session key and its flight plan into a centralized database that can be accessed by ground stations. The registered flight session key is then used as the message authentication code key to authenticate the drone by any ground station while the drone is flying. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, we implemented a prototype of SENTINEL with ECDSA, PBKDF2 and HMAC-SHA256. The experiment results demonstrated that the average execution time of the authentication protocol in SENTINEL was about 3.1 times faster than the "TLS for IoT" protocol. We also formally proved the security of SENTINEL using ProVerif that is an automatic cryptographic protocol verifier.

TI  - Investigation of Aerosol Peak Height Effect on PBL and Volcanic Air Mass Factors for SO<sub>2</sub> Column Retrieval from Space-Borne Hyperspectral UV Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the effects of aerosol peak height (APH) and various parameters on the air mass factor (AMF) for SO2 retrieval. Increasing aerosol optical depth (AOD) leads to multiple scattering within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and an increase in PBL SO2 AMF. However, under high AOD conditions, aerosol shielding effects dominate, which causes the PBL SO2 AMF to decrease with increasing AOD. The height of the SO2 layer and the APH are found to significantly influence the PBL SO2 AMF under high AOD conditions. When the SO2 and aerosol layers are of the same height, aerosol multiple scattering occurs dominantly within the PBL, which leads to an increase in the PBL SO2 AMF. When the APH is greater than the SO2 layer height, aerosol shielding effects dominate, which decreases the PBL SO2 AMF. When the SO2 and aerosol layers are of the same height under low AOD and solar zenith angle (SZA) conditions, increased surface reflectance is found to significantly increase the PBL SO2 AMF. However, high AOD dominates the surface reflectance contribution to PBL SO2 AMF. Under high SZA conditions, Rayleigh scattering contributes to a reduction in the light path length and PBL SO2 AMF. For volcanic SO2 AMF, high SZA enhances the light path length within the volcanic SO2 layer, as well as the volcanic SO2 AMF, because of the negligible photon loss by Rayleigh scattering at high altitudes. High aerosol loading and an APH that is greater than the SO2 peak height lead to aerosol shielding effects, which reduce the volcanic SO2 AMF. The SO2 AMF errors are also quantified as a function of uncertainty in the input data of AOD, APH, and surface reflectance. The SO2 AMF sensitivities and error analysis provided here can be used to develop effective error reduction strategies for satellite-based SO2 retrievals.

TI  - RFI Artefacts Detection in Sentinel-1 Level-1 SLC Data Based On Image Processing Techniques
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data are often contaminated by Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI) artefacts that make processing them more challenging. Therefore, easy to implement techniques for artefacts recognition have the potential to support the automatic Permanent Scatterers InSAR (PSInSAR) processing workflow during which faulty input data can lead to misinterpretation of the final outcomes. To address this issue, an efficient methodology was developed to mark images with RFI artefacts and as a consequence remove them from the stack of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images required in the PSInSAR processing workflow to calculate the ground displacements. Techniques presented in this paper for the purpose of RFI detection are based on image processing methods with the use of feature extraction involving pixel convolution, thresholding and nearest neighbor structure filtering. As the reference classifier, a convolutional neural network was used.

TI  - Secular Changes in Atmospheric Turbidity over Iraq and a Possible Link to Military Activity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) data during the period 2000-2018 over the Middle East to evaluate the contribution of anthropogenic pollution. We focus on Iraq, where US troops were present for nearly nine years. We begin with a plausibility argument linking anthropogenic influence and AOD signature. We then calculate the percent change in AOD every two years. To pinpoint the causes for changes in AOD on a spatial basis, we distinguish between synoptically "calm" periods and those with vigorous synoptic activity. This was done on high-resolution 10 km AOD retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor (Terra satellite). We found spatiotemporal variability in the intensity of the AOD and its standard deviation along the dust-storm corridor during three studied periods: before Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) (1 March 2000-19 March 2003), during OIF (20 March 2003-1 September 2010), and Operation New Dawn (OND; 1 September 2010-18 December 2011), and after the US troops' withdrawal (19 December 2011-31 December 2018). Pixels of military camps and bases, major roads and areas of conflict, and their corresponding AOD values, were selected to study possible effects. We found that winter, with its higher frequency of days with synoptically "calm" conditions compared to spring and summer, was the best season to quantitatively estimate the impact of these ground-based sources. Surprisingly, an anthropogenic impact on the AOD signature was also visible during vigorous synoptic activity. Meteorological conditions that favor detection of these effects using space imagery are discussed, where the effects are more salient than in surrounding regions with similar meteorological conditions. This exceeds expectations when considering synoptic variations alone.

TI  - An UAV and Satellite Multispectral Data Approach to Monitor Water Quality in Small Reservoirs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A multi-sensor and multi-scale monitoring tool for the spatially explicit and periodic monitoring of eutrophication in a small drinking water reservoir is presented. The tool was built with freely available satellite and in situ data combined with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based technology. The goal is to evaluate the performance of a multi-platform approach for the trophic state monitoring with images obtained with MultiSpectral Sensors on board satellites Sentinel 2 (S2A and S2B), Landsat 8 (L8) and UAV. We assessed the performance of three different sensors (MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Rededge Micasense) for retrieving the pigment chlorophyll-a (chl-a), as a quantitative descriptor of phytoplankton biomass and trophic level. The study was conducted in a waterbody affected by cyanobacterial blooms, one of the most important eutrophication-derived risks for human health. Different empirical models and band indices were evaluated. Spectral band combinations using red and near-infrared (NIR) bands were the most suitable for retrieving chl-a concentration (especially 2 band algorithm (2BDA), the Surface Algal Bloom Index (SABI) and 3 band algorithm (3BDA)) even though blue and green bands were useful to classify UAV images into two chl-a ranges. The results show a moderately good agreement among the three sensors at different spatial resolutions (10 m., 30 m. and 8 cm.), indicating a high potential for the development of a multi-platform and multi-sensor approach for the eutrophication monitoring of small reservoirs.

TI  - Mapping Productivity and Essential Biophysical Parameters of Cultivated Tropical Grasslands from Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) is the main nutrient element that maintains productivity in forages; it is inextricably linked to dry matter increase and plant support capacity. In recent years, high spectral and spatial resolution remote sensors, e.g., the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Sentinel satellite missions, have become freely available for agricultural science, and have proven to be powerful monitoring tools. The use of vegetation indices has been essential for crop monitoring and biomass estimation models. The objective of this work is to test and demonstrate the applicability of different vegetation indices to estimate the biomass productivity, the foliar nitrogen content (FNC), the plant height and the leaf area index (LAI) of several tropical grasslands species submitted to different nitrogen (N) rates in an experimental area of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Field reflectance data of Panicum maximum and Urochloa brizantha species' cultivars were taken and convoluted to the Sentinel-2 satellite bands. Subsequently, different vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDI), Three Band Index (TBI), Difference light Height (DLH), Three Band Dall'Olmo (DO), and Normalized Area Over reflectance Curve (NAOC)) were tested for the experimental grassland areas, and composed of Urochloa decumbens and Urochloa brizantha grass species, which were sampled and destructively analyzed. Our results show the use of different relevant Sentinel-2 bands in the visible (VIS)-near infrared (NIR) regions for the estimation of the different biophysical parameters. The FNC obtained the best correlation for the TBI index combining blue, green and red bands with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.38 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 3.4 g kg(-1). The estimation of grassland productivity based on red-edge and NIR bands showed a R-2 = 0.54 and a RMSE = 1800 kg ha(-1). For the LAI, the best index was the NAOC (R-2 = 0.57 and RMSE = 1.4 m(2) m(-2)). High values of FNC, productivity and LAI based on different sets of Sentinel-2 bands were consistently obtained for areas under N fertilization.

TI  - Delayed presentation, diagnosis, and psychosocial aspects of male breast cancer
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Male breast cancer is uncommon, delay in seeking medical attention often results in late presentation and poor prognosis.Methods Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed. Patients who were still having regular follow-up were contacted for telephone interview.Results In this study, 56 male breast cancer patients were treated in our center from January 1998 to December 2018, accounting for 0.88% of all breast cancers treated during the same period of time. Median age of onset was 61 years old (Range: 33-95). In this study, 6 (10.7%) patients presented with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis and received palliative systemic treatment only. And, 50 patients were surgically treated and all had mastectomy. Axillary dissection was performed in 36 (72%) patients, while sentinel node biopsy was performed in 14 (28%) patients. Median tumor size was 23 mm (2-100 mm). A Majority were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma (NOS), while 38 (67.8%) patients were node positive.Here 36 (64.3%) patients were alive at the time of the study, 31 (86.1%) patients responded to the telephone interview. More than 90% of our patients expressed various degrees of embarrassment at the time of breast symptom onset. Similarly, more than 90% of these patients experienced embarrassment while waiting in the breast center with predominant female patients. Most patients (N = 26) were not aware that breast cancer can occur in men prior to the diagnosis. Median duration from symptoms to the first medical consultation was 12.4 months (1-120 months).Conclusion Male breast cancer is rare and patients usually present late, Lack of knowledge, public education, and embarrassment are the important related factors.

TI  - Diversity of Algorithm and Spectral Band Inputs Improves Landsat Monitoring of Forest Disturbance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbance monitoring is an important application of the Landsat times series, both to monitor forest dynamics and to support wise forest management at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. In the last decade, there has been an acceleration in the development of approaches designed to put the Landsat archive to use towards these causes. Forest disturbance mapping has moved from using individual change-detection algorithms, which implement a single set of decision rules that may not apply well to a range of scenarios, to compiling ensembles of such algorithms. One approach that has greatly reduced disturbance detection error has been to combine individual algorithm outputs in Random Forest (RF) ensembles trained with disturbance reference data, a process called stacking (or secondary classification). Previous research has demonstrated more robust and sensitive detection of disturbance using stacking with both multialgorithm ensembles and multispectral ensembles (which make use of a single algorithm applied to multiple spectral bands). In this paper, we examined several additional dimensions of this problem, including: (1) type of algorithm (represented by processes using one image per year vs. all historical images); (2) spectral band choice (including both the basic Landsat reflectance bands and several popular indices based on those bands); (3) number of algorithm/spectral-band combinations needed; and (4) the value of including both algorithm and spectral band diversity in the ensembles. We found that ensemble performance substantially improved per number of model inputs if those inputs were drawn from a diversity of both algorithms and spectral bands. The best models included inputs from both algorithms, using different variants of shortwave-infrared (SWIR) and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance. Further disturbance detection improvement may depend upon the development of algorithms which either interrogate SWIR and NIR in new ways or better highlight disturbance signals in the visible wavelengths.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Leaf Area Index Estimation for Pine Plantations in the Southeastern United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important biophysical indicator of forest health that is linearly related to productivity, serving as a key criterion for potential nutrient management. A single equation was produced to model surface reflectance values captured from the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) with a robust dataset of field observations of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) LAI collected with a LAI-2200C plant canopy analyzer. Support vector machine (SVM)-supervised classification was used to improve the model fit by removing plots saturated with aberrant radiometric signatures that would not be captured in the association between Sentinel-2 and LAI-2200C. The resulting equation, LAI = 0.310SR - 0.098 (where SR = the simple ratio between near-infrared (NIR) and red bands), displayed good performance (R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 0.36) at estimating the LAI for loblolly pine within the analyzed region at a 10 m spatial resolution. Our model incorporated a high number of validation plots (n = 292) spanning from southern Virginia to northern Florida across a range of soil textures (sandy to clayey), drainage classes (well drained to very poorly drained), and site characteristics common to pine forest plantations in the southeastern United States. The training dataset included plot-level treatment metrics-silviculture intensity, genetics, and density-on which sensitivity analysis was performed to inform model fit behavior. Plot density, particularly when there were <= 618 trees per hectare, was shown to impact model performance, causing LAI estimates to be overpredicted (to a maximum of X-i + 0.16). Silviculture intensity (competition control and fertilization rates) and genetics did not markedly impact the relationship between SR and LAI. Results indicate that Sentinel-2's improved spatial resolution and temporal revisit interval provide new opportunities for managers to detect within-stand variance and improve accuracy for LAI estimation over current industry standard models.

TI  - Evaluation of forest fire risk in the Mediterranean Turkish forests: A case study of Menderes region, Izmir
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Turkey is exposed to forest fires damaging thousands of hectares of forest every year. Earlier studies indicate that Turkey would be one of the most affected Mediterranean countries due to increased fire risk as a result of climate change. Therefore, early detection and suppression of forest fires are very important to minimize fire damage. The main goal of this study is to analyse and model the fire risk using remote sensing technology. For this purpose, multi-temporal remote sensing data obtained pre-fire was integrated with ancillary data in Geographic Information System (GIS) to evaluate the spatial and temporal patterns of forest fire risk in Menderes region, Izmir. First, the rapid fire risk of the study area was assessed using Land Surface Temperature (LST) changes and in-situ meteorological measurements. LST and humidity were found to be the most important indicators for fire risk. In order to generate a fire risk map in the study area, six fire risk variables, determined statistically in previous studies, were considered. A linear model that uses predetermined weights for Turkish forest ecosystems was applied. According to the model, 22% of the burned area was found to be high risk area, while 77.5% was identified as moderate high risk area. The model is validated by overlaying all 292 forest fires obtained from the NASA-FIRMS website between 2002 and 2018 on the fire risk map.

TI  - Participation, for Whom? The Potential of Gamified Participatory Artefacts in Uncovering Power Relations within Urban Renewal Projects
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - When defining participation in urban renewal projects in a political sense, this concept implies the challenging of power relations in each of its dimensions while addressing the need for knowledge, action and consciousness. Knowledge is defined as a resource which affects observable decision making. Action looks at who is involved in the production of such knowledge in order to challenge and shape the political agenda. Consciousness is how the production of knowledge changes the awareness or worldview of those involved, thus shaping the psychological and conceptual boundaries of what is possible. This paper addresses these politics of participation via the use of gamification, and more particularly gamified participatory artefacts. We discuss how a 'good' participatory planning process implies rebalancing existing power relations via the redistribution of knowledge, consciousness and actions, and aims to operationalize this ambition through a game. We particularly focus on the urban renewal process of one particular case, namely the Vennestraat-one of the main commercial streets of the city of Genk (BE) and present a three year participatory mapping process that made use of three gamified participatory artefacts (i.e., socio-economic network mapping, gathering mental images and scenario games). After uncovering the complex field of power relations in the entrepreneurial street, we analyze the different types of relations/groups that emerge from this participatory mapping process. The paper concludes with an analytical framework that employs gamified participatory artefacts in order to map and understand power relations and the mechanisms that frame them.

TI  - Using GIS, Remote Sensing, and Machine Learning to Highlight the Correlation between the Land-Use/Land-Cover Changes and Flash-Flood Potential
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study was to explore the correlation between the land-use/land cover change and the flash-flood potential changes in Zbala catchment (Romania) between 1989 and 2019. In this regard, the efficiency of GIS, remote sensing and machine learning techniques in detecting spatial patterns of the relationship between the two variables was tested. The paper elaborated upon an answer to the increase in flash flooding frequency across the study area and across the earth due to the occurred land-use/land-cover changes, as well as due to the present climate change, which determined the multiplication of extreme meteorological phenomena. In order to reach the above-mentioned purpose, two land-uses/land-covers (for 1989 and 2019) were obtained using Landsat image processing and were included in a relative evolution indicator (total relative difference-synthetic dynamic land-use index), aggregated at a grid-cell level of 1 km(2). The assessment of runoff potential was made with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, which was trained for 1989 and 2019 with the help of 10 flash-flood predictors, 127 flash-flood locations, and 127 non-flash-flood locations. For the year 1989, the high and very high surface runoff potential covered around 34% of the study area, while for 2019, the same values accounted for approximately 46%. The MLP models performed very well, the area under curve (AUC) values being higher than 0.837. Finally, the land-use/land-cover change indicator, as well as the relative evolution of the flash flood potential index, was included in a geographically weighted regression (GWR). The results of the GWR highlights that high values of the Pearson coefficient (r) occupied around 17.4% of the study area. Therefore, in these areas of the Zbala river catchment, the land-use/land-cover changes were highly correlated with the changes that occurred in flash-flood potential.

TI  - Structured surveillance of <i>Achromobacter</i>, <i>Pandoraea</i> <i>and</i> <i>Ralstonia</i> species from patients in England with cystic fibrosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - A structured survey of the cystic fibrosis pathogens Achromobacter, Pandoraea and Ralstonia species from thirteen sentinel hospitals throughout England was undertaken by Public Health England. One isolate per patient of these genera collected from CF patients during the seven-month survey period in 2015 was requested from participating hospitals. Species-level identification was performed using nrdA/gyrB sequence cluster analysis, and genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In total, 176 isolates were included in the survey; 138 Achromobacter spp. (78.4%), 29 Pandoraea spp. (16.5%) and 9 Ralstonia spp. (5.1%). Novel Achromobacter and Pandoraea clusters were identified. High levels of antimicrobial resistance were found, particularly among Pandoraea isolates. Genotyping analysis revealed considerable diversity, however one geographically-widespread cluster of A. xylosoxidans isolates from six hospitals was found, in addition to two other clusters, both comprising isolates from two hospitals, either derived from the same region (A. xylosoxidans), or from hospitals within the same city (P. apista).

TI  - Concomitant Filled Prescriptions of Oxymorphone or Oxycodone with CYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE & SPECIALTY PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxymorphone's metabolism does not involve the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. The effect of this pharmacokinetic feature of oxymorphone on opioid prescribing is unknown.OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative frequency with which oxymorphone and oxycodone (a CYP3A-metabolized opioid analgesic) were each prescribed to patients concomitantly receiving CYP3A-modifying drugs (i.e., inducers and inhibitors) to characterize opioid-prescribing patterns in patients at risk for CYP3A-related drug interactions.METHODS: We analyzed the Sentinel Distributed Database from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2016, to identify the proportion of patients with concomitant dispensing of selected CYP3A modifiers among initiators of oxymorphone. We then repeated the analysis using oxycodone instead of oxymorphone. We conducted sensitivity analyses that varied the washout periods for each opioid to account for potential opioid switching.RESULTS: In the primary analysis, the proportion of patients with concomitant incident dispensings of oxymorphone and selected CYP3A modifiers was 3.26% (95% CI = 3.09%-3.43%), and the proportion of patients with incident dispensings of oxycodone and selected CYP3A modifiers was 2.82% (95% CI = 2.79%-2.85%). The difference between proportions was 0.43% (95% CI = 0.26%-0.60%). Sensitivity analyses that varied the washout periods for each opioid with respect to the other opioid to account for switching yielded similar results.CONCLUSIONS: We observed similar proportions of patients using selected CYP3A modifiers concomitantly with both oxymorphone and oxycodone. While the CIs of the point estimates did not overlap, the absolute differences between the proportions were small. Copyright (C) 2020, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Gut Microbiota of the Egyptian Mongoose as an Early Warning Indicator of Ecosystem Health in Portugal
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Egyptian mongoose is a carnivore mammal species that in the last decades experienced a tremendous expansion in Iberia, particularly in Portugal, mainly due to its remarkable ecological plasticity in response to land-use changes. However, this species may have a disruptive role on native communities in areas where it has recently arrived due to predation and the potential introduction of novel pathogens. We report reference information on the cultivable gut microbial landscape of widely distributed Egyptian mongoose populations (Herpestes ichneumon, n = 53) and related antimicrobial tolerance across environmental gradients. The panel of isolated species is consistent with the typical protein-based diet of a carnivore: Firmicutes predominate (89% of individuals), while Clostridiales, Enterobacteriales, and Lactobacillales are the major classes. Forty-one individuals (77.4%) harbour Clostridium spp. A spatial influence on mongooses' microbiota is confirmed by nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis, with a significant contribution of municipality to their microbiota composition. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of mongoose commensal bacteria to 28 compounds evidences xenobiotic tolerance of Escherichia coli (E. coli), enterococci, Salmonella Spartel and Mbandaka serotypes and Pseudomonas bacteria, among others. The common isolation of antimicrobial tolerant microbiota from the mongoose's gut suggests this species is exposed to anthropogenic influence and is affected by forestry and agricultural-related practices, reflecting its easy adaptation to ecological gradients across agroecosystems. We thus propose regular microbial and phenotypic resistance profiling of widely distributed mongooses as a sentinel tool for xenobiotics' lifecycle and ecosystem health in Portugal.

M3  - Article
AB  - The use of geotechnologies in the territorial management of river basins is a tool that has been intensifying each year and has become indispensable for the planning and maintenance of territorial occupation of these areas. This study had as objective to evaluate changes in the vegetation cover of the Munim River basin (BHRM) with the aid of remote sensing techniques. There were utilized images of the satellite Landsat 5 and 8 in the period from 1984 to 2018, realized the process of supervisioned classification and validation of the classification through satellite image of high resolution. It was noticeable the tendency to a progessive growth in the total defined area as exposed soil considering raise of 13,23% of area in relation to the year of 1984. Through the years the BHRM lost a substantial quantity of the vegetation cover. In the year of 2018 the class of land use "dense vegetation" predominates with 40.76% of area.

TI  - Ice Production in Ross Ice Shelf Polynyas during 2017-2018 from Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High sea ice production (SIP) generates high-salinity water, thus, influencing the global thermohaline circulation. Estimation from passive microwave data and heat flux models have indicated that the Ross Ice Shelf polynya (RISP) may be the highest SIP region in the Southern Oceans. However, the coarse spatial resolution of passive microwave data limited the accuracy of these estimates. The Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar dataset with high spatial and temporal resolution provides an unprecedented opportunity to more accurately distinguish both polynya area/extent and occurrence. In this study, the SIPs of RISP and McMurdo Sound polynya (MSP) from 1 March-30 November 2017 and 2018 are calculated based on Sentinel-1 SAR data (for area/extent) and AMSR2 data (for ice thickness). The results show that the wind-driven polynyas in these two years occurred from the middle of March to the middle of November, and the occurrence frequency in 2017 was 90, less than 114 in 2018. However, the annual mean cumulative SIP area and volume in 2017 were similar to (or slightly larger than) those in 2018. The average annual cumulative polynya area and ice volume of these two years were 1,040,213 km(2) and 184 km(3) for the RSIP, and 90,505 km(2) and 16 km(3) for the MSP, respectively. This annual cumulative SIP (volume) is only 1/3-2/3 of those obtained using the previous methods, implying that ice production in the Ross Sea might have been significantly overestimated in the past and deserves further investigations.

TI  - A Novel Detector Based on Convolution Neural Networks for Multiscale SAR Ship Detection in Complex Background
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolution neural network (CNN)-based detectors have shown great performance on ship detections of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, the performance of current models has not been satisfactory enough for detecting multiscale ships and small-size ones in front of complex backgrounds. To address the problem, we propose a novel SAR ship detector based on CNN, which consist of three subnetworks: the Fusion Feature Extractor Network (FFEN), Region Proposal Network (RPN), and Refine Detection Network (RDN). Instead of using a single feature map, we fuse feature maps in bottom-up and top-down ways and generate proposals from each fused feature map in FFEN. Furthermore, we further merge features generated by the region-of-interest (RoI) pooling layer in RDN. Based on the feature representation strategy, the CNN framework constructed can significantly enhance the location and semantics information for the multiscale ships, in particular for the small ships. On the other hand, the residual block is introduced to increase the network depth, through which the detection precision could be further improved. The public SAR ship dataset (SSDD) and China Gaofen-3 satellite SAR image are used to validate the proposed method. Our method shows excellent performance for detecting the multiscale and small-size ships with respect to some competitive models and exhibits high potential in practical application.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF LAND USE ON LIMNOLOGICAL VARIABLES OF THE HYDROGRAPHIC BASIN OF THE RIVER IBICUI OF ARMADA - RS.
T2  - GEOAMBIENTE ON-LINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to analyze the relationship between limnological variables and different land use models in the hydrographic basin of the Ibicui da Armada River, RS. The methodology consisted of using images from the MSI sensor on board the SENTINEL 2 satellite to generate the land use maps. The classes of land use were defined as: Anthropic Agricultural Area, Uncovered Area, Forest Area, Countryside Vegetation, Water and Urban Area. The limnological variables analyzed were: hydrogen potential, total suspended solids and turbidity. For the acquisition of limnological data, two field missions were carried out in the months of November 2018 and March 2019, at 2 sample points located in the water system of the Ibicui River hydrographic basin. The land use maps showed changes between the months analyzed, mainly in agricultural areas because the study area has agriculture as its economic base. The agricultural phases influenced the limnological variables pH, TSS, Turbidity. Thus, the results of the present work underscore the importance of analyzing the water environment to consider the context of land use in the hydrographic basin.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Land Cover Changes in the Chemoga Basin, Ethiopia, Using Landsat and Google Earth Images
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change is a major environmental concern in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. This study detected land cover transitions over the past 30 years in the Chemoga basin (total area = 118,359 ha). Land cover maps were generated via the supervised classification of Landsat images with the help of the Google Earth (GE) images. A total of 218 unchanged land features sampled from GE images were used as the training datasets. Classification accuracy was evaluated by comparing classified images with 165 field observations during the 2017 field visit. The overall accuracy was 85.4% and the kappa statistic was 0.81, implying that the land classification was satisfactory. Agricultural land is the dominant land cover in the study basin, and increased in extent by 2,337 ha from 1987 to 2017. The second and third most dominant land cover types, grassland and woodland, decreased by 1.9% and 3.6%, respectively, over the past 30 years. The increase in agricultural lands was mostly due to the conversion of grasslands and woodlands, although some agricultural lands changed to Eucalyptus plantations and human settlements. The results revealed that the expansion of built-up space and agricultural lands was the major driver of fragmentation of the landscape, and degradation of natural resources in the Chemoga basin, Ethiopia.

TI  - SARDINE: A Self-Adaptive Recurrent Deep Incremental Network Model for Spatio-Temporal Prediction of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SPATIAL ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely and accurate prediction of remote sensing data is of utmost importance especially in a situation where the predicted data is utilized to provide insights into emerging issues, like environmental nowcasting. Significant research progress can be found to date in devising variants of neural network (NN) models to fulfil this requirement by improving feature extraction and dynamic process representation power. Nevertheless, all these existing NN models are built upon rigid structures that often fail to maintain tradeoff between bias and variance, and consequently, need to spend a lot of time to empirically determine the most appropriate network configuration. This article proposes a self-adaptive recurrent deep incremental network model (SARDINE) which is a novel variant of the deep recurrent neural network with intrinsic capability of self-constructing the network structure in a dynamic and incremental fashion while learning from observed data samples. Moreover, the proposed SARDINE is able to model the spatial feature evolution while scanning the data in a single pass manner, and this further saves significant time when dealing with remote sensing imagery containing millions of pixels. Subsequently, we employ SARDINE in combination with a spatial influence mapping unit to accomplish the prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated in terms of predicting a time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)-5 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra satellite imagery. The experimental result demonstrates that the SARDINE-based prediction is able to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost.

AB  - Background This study compares well-being, recurrences, and deaths of early-stage cutaneous melanoma patients in follow-up, as recommended in the Dutch guideline, with that of patients in a stage-adjusted reduced follow-up schedule, 3 years after diagnosis, as well as costs. Methods Overall, 180 eligible pathological American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IB-IIC, sentinel node staged, melanoma patients (response rate = 87%, 48% male, median age 57 years), randomized into a conventional (CSG, n = 93) or experimental (ESG, n = 87) follow-up schedule group, completed patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at diagnosis (T1): State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State version (STAI-S), Cancer Worry Scale (CWS), Impact of Event Scale (IES), and RAND-36 (Mental and Physical Component scales [PCS/MCS]). Three years later (T3), 110 patients (CSG, n = 56; ESG, n = 54) completed PROMs, while 42 declined (23%). Results Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) showed a significant group effect on the IES (p = 0.001) in favor of the ESG, and on the RAND-36 PCS (p = 0.02) favoring the CSG. Mean IES and CWS scores decreased significantly over time, while those on the RAND-36 MCS and PCS increased. Effect sizes were small. Twenty-five patients developed a recurrence or second primary melanoma, of whom 13 patients died within 3 years. Cox proportional hazards models showed no differences between groups in recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71 [0.32-1.58]; p = 0.400) and disease-free survival (HR 1.24 [0.42-3.71]; p = 0.690). Costs per patient after 3 years (computed for 77.3% of patients) were 39% lower in the ESG. Conclusion These results seemingly support the notion that a stage-adjusted reduced follow-up schedule forms an appropriate, safe, and cost-effective alternative for pathological AJCC stage IB-IIC melanoma patients to the follow-up regimen as advised in the current melanoma guideline.

TI  - Increase of sentinel lymph node melanoma staging in The Netherlands; still room and need for further improvement
T2  - MELANOMA MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: To investigate implementation of the seventh American Joint Committee on Cancer melanoma staging with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and associations with socioeconomic status (SES). Patients & methods: Data from The Netherlands Cancer Registry on patient and tumor characteristics were analyzed for all stage IB-II melanoma cases diagnosed 2010-2016, along with SES data from The Netherlands Institute for Social Research. Results: The proportion of SLNB-staged patients increased from 40% to 65% (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that being female, elderly, or having head-and-neck disease reduced the likelihood of SLNB staging. Conclusion: SLNB staging increased by 25% during the study period but lagged among elderly patients and those with head-and-neck melanoma. In The Netherlands, SES no longer affects SLNB staging performance.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Water Hyacinth and Its Linkage with Lake-Level Fluctuation: Lake Tana, a Sub-Humid Region of the Ethiopian Highlands
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Water hyacinth originated from the Amazon Basin and has expanded to other parts of the world since the 1800s. In Ethiopia, the weed is affecting the socio-economic activities of the people whose livelihood is directly or indirectly dependent on Lake Tana. Still, the area covered by water hyacinth and the impact of water level fluctuation on the expansion of water hyacinth has not been known clearly. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of water hyacinth and relation with lake-level fluctuation. The area covered by water hyacinth was determined using monthly Sentinel-2 images, which were collected from November 2015 to December 2019. The impact of water level fluctuation on the expansion of water hyacinth was evaluated using hourly water level data converted to a monthly average to correlate with the area covered by the water hyacinth. In addition, MOD13Q1.006 data was used to evaluate the trend of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its linkage with the weed. The maximum areas covered by water hyacinth were 278.3, 613.6, 1108.7, 2036.5, and 2504.5 ha in Feb 2015, October 2016, September 2017, December 2018, and in December 2019, respectively. Its areal coverage was declining from the northern corridors and increasing in eastern shores of the lake. The lake-level fluctuation was observed in the range of 1.5 to 3.98 m in this study. The annual mean maximum spatial values of the NDVI were in the range of 0.27 and 0.47. The area covered by water hyacinth was increasing significantly (P < 0.05) and positively correlated with the seasonal lake-level fluctuation. High water level enabled the expansion of the weed by extending its suitable habitat of shallow water to the flood plain. Based on the results of this study, lake-level fluctuations can have an adverse impact on the expansion of the weed.

TI  - Environmental controls on Landsat-derived phenoregions across an East African megatransect
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Semiarid and savanna-type (SAST) ecosystems in East Africa have unique plant species compositions and characteristics that make quantifying this biome's seasonality and interannual variability difficult. Phenoregion classification offers a way to use seasonality of vegetation growth to help understand the phenological spatial patterns of complex landscapes. Here, we used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series from Landsat 8 to map phenoregions in scenes centered around national parks from Mt. Kenya National Park (Kenya) to Limpopo National Park (Mozambique). We then assessed whether landscape-scale controls on phenology are consistent across the region or whether they vary across this latitudinal gradient. We compared our phenoregion maps to MODIS Land Cover and geology, and we used multinomial logistic regression to determine the role that elevation, slope, aspect, and geology play in driving phenological differences. The sites' phenoregions showed no unique land cover composition, suggesting that MODIS land cover does not capture the subtle variations identified in phenoregion analysis. Multinomial logistic regression showed that geographic trend (x- and y-directions) was a strong predictor in four of the five landscapes and that, depending on the scene, geology, elevation, or aspect was a strong secondary predictor. Using seasonality of the NDVI time series to generate phenoregions provides different and, in some cases, more ecologically relevant information, compared to vegetation maps that use only land cover from a single season or time period to generate ecoregions. With a significant population of humans and animals that live in and depend on SAST ecosystems, it is important to better understand vegetation processes and factors that affect them as climate change becomes an increasingly pertinent issue in dry systems.

TI  - Integration of C band SAR and optical temporal data for identification of paddy fields
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of identification of single crop fields is a challenge when single date optical remote sensing image is used. The use of temporal images solves this problem. However, issues like cloud cover in optical images influence accuracy of results. Microwave data, which penetrate through the atmosphere, solve this problem. The existence of mixed pixels in satellite images and nonlinearity in image classification is also overlooked. These issues were considered and worked on by integrating C band RISAT-1 with Formosat-2 temporal images and using possibilistic c-means classifier with similarity and dissimilarity norms to identify late transplanted paddy (Oryza sativa) fields in Haridwar District of India. Three datasets in different temporal combinations of microwave and optical images were classified for various similarity and dissimilarity norms for different values of weighted constant. Favorable results were achieved for Manhattan and mean absolute difference norm at weighted constant m = 1.3. Classification of late transplanted paddy for datasets containing multiple RISAT-1 and single Formosat-2 images with transplanting, growth stages was found to yield best results as compared to other combination of temporal images.

TI  - Gold Nanorod Assemblies: The Roles of Hot-Spot Positioning and Anisotropy in Plasmon Coupling and SERS
T2  - NANOMATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plasmon-coupled colloidal nanoassemblies with carefully sculpted "hot-spots" and intense surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) are in high demand as photostable and sensitive plasmonic nano-, bio-, and chemosensors. When maximizing SERS signals, it is particularly challenging to control the hot-spot density, precisely position the hot-spots to intensify the plasmon coupling, and introduce the SERS molecule in those intense hot-spots. Here, we investigated the importance of these factors in nanoassemblies made of a gold nanorod (AuNR) core and spherical nanoparticle (AuNP) satellites with ssDNA oligomer linkers. Hot-spot positioning at the NR tips was made possible by selectively burying the ssDNA in the lateral facets via controlled Ag overgrowth while retaining their hybridization and assembly potential at the tips. This strategy, with slight alterations, allowed us to form nanoassemblies that only contained satellites at the NR tips, i.e., directional anisotropic nanoassemblies; or satellites randomly positioned around the NR, i.e., nondirectional nanoassemblies. Directional nanoassemblies featured strong plasmon coupling as compared to nondirectional ones, as a result of strategically placing the hot-spots at the most intense electric field position of the AuNR, i.e., retaining the inherent plasmon anisotropy. Furthermore, as the dsDNA was located in these anisotropic hot-spots, this allowed for the tag-free detection down to similar to 10 dsDNA and a dramatic SERS enhancement of similar to 1.6 x 10(8) for the SERS tag SYBR gold, which specifically intercalates into the dsDNA. This dramatic SERS performance was made possible by manipulating the anisotropy of the nanoassemblies, which allowed us to emphasize the critical role of hot-spot positioning and SERS molecule positioning in nanoassemblies.

TI  - The Prerequisite Criticism and Reconstruction to Praxis Philosophy of Aristotle
T2  - UNIVERSITAS-MONTHLY REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, the premise of Aristotle's practical philosophy, i.e. the tripartite confrontation among theory, poiesis and praxis, has been reflected, criticized and reconstructed. The separation of theory, poiesis and praxis has broken the "ethical-epistemological parallelism" embodied by "virtue is knowledge" and separated practical philosophy as an independent philosophical form from theoretical philosophy, but still been followed by many theoretical contradictions and internal tensions meanwhile. When extended to modern times, they even result in the relationship in reality between human and nature beyond praxis and out of the regulation of "good" from praxis and also result in flooding of scientism. In other words, the contradiction among theory, poiesis and praxis has laid a foreshadowing for the crisis of the relationship between human and nature in modern times, which blocks the practical philosophy to form the unified worldview thus fails to be a universal philosophical form. According to this article, it is a misunderstanding to Aristotle's thought that only regard the relationship among theory, poiesis and praxis as contradiction, which belongs to the premise of old practical philosophy form. There would be extended a new form of practical philosophy if this premise is broken out and the unified relationship among theory, poiesis and praxis in Aristotle's practical philosophy is deeply excavated and a new premise of practical philosophy with the connotation of the unity of theory, poiesis and praxis is reconstructed on the basis of praxis. This new form could overcome various theoretical and practical contradictions coming from premise of the tripartite confrontation. For example, it could arrange the relationship among theory, poiesis and praxis reasonably in the world unity constructed by practical philosophy, and put theory into praxis as its ultimate state to open up the infinite space for praxis, and also attach poiesis to praxis as its means or condition. Thus, the good of metaphysics would be the ultimate state of the good of practical philosophy (good of human), which gives the practical good of practical philosophy an infinite openness.

TI  - A Comparison of Estimating Crop Residue Cover from Sentinel-2 Data Using Empirical Regressions and Machine Learning Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying crop residue cover (CRC) on field surfaces is important for monitoring the tillage intensity and promoting sustainable management. Remote-sensing-based techniques have proven practical for determining CRC, however, the methods used are primarily limited to empirical regression based on crop residue indices (CRIs). This study provides a systematic evaluation of empirical regressions and machine learning (ML) algorithms based on their ability to estimate CRC using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data. Unmanned aerial vehicle orthomosaics were used to extracted ground CRC for training Sentinel-2 data-based CRC models. For empirical regression, nine MSI bands, 10 published CRIs, three proposed CRIs, and four mean textural features were evaluated using univariate linear regression. The best performance was obtained by a three-band index calculated using (B2 - B4)/(B2 - B12), with an R-cv(2) of 0.63 and RMSEcv of 6.509%, using a 10-fold cross-validation. The methodologies of partial least squares regression (PLSR), artificial neural network (ANN), Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF) were compared with four groups of predictors, including nine MSI bands, 13 CRIs, a combination of MSI bands and mean textural features, and a combination of CRIs and textural features. In general, ML approaches achieved high accuracy. A PLSR model with 13 CRIs and textural features resulted in an accuracy of R-cv(2) = 0.66 and RMSEcv = 6.427%. An RF model with predictors of MSI bands and textural features estimated CRC with an R-cv(2) = 0.61 and RMSEcv = 6.415%. The estimation was improved by an SVR model with the same input predictors (R-cv(2) = 0.67, RMSEcv = 6.343%), followed by a GPR model based on CRIs and textural features. The performance of GPR models was further improved by optimal input variables. A GPR model with six input variables, three MSI bands and three textural features, performed the best, with R-cv(2) = 0.69 and RMSEcv = 6.149%. This study provides a reference for estimating CRC from Sentinel-2 imagery using ML approaches. The GPR approach is recommended. A combination of spectral information and textural features leads to an improvement in the retrieval of CRC.

TI  - Land Use Change and Its Impacts on Land Surface Temperature in Galle City, Sri Lanka
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the spatiotemporal changes of land use land cover (LULC) and its impact on land surface temperature (LST) in the Galle Municipal Council area (GMCA), Sri Lanka. The same was achieved by employing the multi-temporal satellite data and geo-spatial techniques between 1996 and 2019. The post-classification change detection technique was employed to determine the temporal changes of LULC, and its results were utilized to assess the LST variation over the LULC changes. The results revealed that the area had undergone a drastic LULC transformation. It experienced 38% increase in the built-up area, while vegetation and non-built-up area declined by 26% and 12%, respectively. Rapid urban growth has had a significant effect on the LST, and the built-up area had the highest mean LST of 22.7 degrees C, 23.2 degrees C, and 26.3 degrees C for 1996, 2009, and 2019, correspondingly. The mean LST of the GMCA was 19.2 degrees C in 1996, 20.1 degrees C in 2009, and 22.4 degrees C in 2019. The land area with a temperature above 24 degrees C increased by 9% and 12% in 2009 and 2019, respectively. The highest LST variation (5.5 degrees C) was observed from newly added built-up area, which was also transferred from vegetation land. Meanwhile, the lowest mean LST difference was observed from newly added vegetation land. The results show that the mean annual LST increased by 3.2 degrees C in the last 22 years in GMCA. This study identified significant challenges for urban planners and respective administrative bodies to mitigate and control the negative effect of LST for the long livability of Galle City.

TI  - Improving 3-m Resolution Land Cover Mapping through Efficient Learning from an Imperfect 10-m Resolution Map
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Substantial progress has been made in the field of large-area land cover mapping as the spatial resolution of remotely sensed data increases. However, a significant amount of human power is still required to label images for training and testing purposes, especially in high-resolution (e.g., 3-m) land cover mapping. In this research, we propose a solution that can produce 3-m resolution land cover maps on a national scale without human efforts being involved. First, using the public 10-m resolution land cover maps as an imperfect training dataset, we propose a deep learning based approach that can effectively transfer the existing knowledge. Then, we improve the efficiency of our method through a network pruning process for national-scale land cover mapping. Our proposed method can take the state-of-the-art 10-m resolution land cover maps (with an accuracy of 81.24% for China) as the training data, enable a transferred learning process that can produce 3-m resolution land cover maps, and further improve the overall accuracy (OA) to 86.34% for China. We present detailed results obtained over three mega cities in China, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach for 3-m resolution large-area land cover mapping.

TI  - Superflares and variability in solar-type stars with <i>TESS</i> in the Southern hemisphere
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Superflares on solar-type stars have been a rapidly developing field ever since the launch of Kepler. Over the years, there have been several studies investigating the statistics of these explosive events. In this study, we present a statistical analysis of stellar flares on solar-type stars made using photometric data in 2-min cadence from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite of the whole Southern hemisphere (sectors 1-13). We derive rotational periods for all the stars in our sample from rotational modulations present in the light curve as a result of large starspot(s) on the surface. We identify 1980 stellar flares from 209 solar-type stars with energies in the range of 10(31) -10(36) erg (using the solar flare classification, this corresponds to X1- X100 000) and conduct an analysis into their properties. We investigate the rotational phase of the flares and find no preference for any phase, suggesting the flares are randomly distributed. As a benchmark, we use GOES data of solar flares to detail the close relationship between solar flares and sunspots. In addition, we also calculate approximate spot areas for each of our stars and compare this to flare number, rotational phase, and flare energy. Additionally, two of our stars were observed in the continuous viewing zone with light-curves spanning 1 yr; as a result we examine the stellar variability of these stars in more detail.

TI  - The Retrieval of Total Precipitable Water over Global Land Based on FY-3D/MWRI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Total precipitable water (TPW) is an important key factor in the global water cycle and climate change. The knowledge of TPW characteristics at spatial and temporal scales could help us to better understand our changing environment. Currently, many algorithms are available to retrieve TPW from optical and microwave sensors. There are still no available TPW data over land from FY-3D MWRI, which was launched by China in 2017. However, the TPW product over land is a key element for the retrieval of many ecological environment parameters. In this paper, an improved algorithm was developed to retrieve TPW over land from the brightness temperature of FY-3D MWRI. The major improvement is that surface emissivity, which is a key parameter in the retrieval of TPW in all-weather conditions, was developed and based on an improved algorithm according to the characteristics of FY-3D MWRI. The improvement includes two aspects, one is selection of appropriate ancillary data in estimating surface emissivity parameter Delta epsilon(18.7)/Delta epsilon(23.8) in clear sky conditions, and the other is an improvement of the Delta epsilon(18.7)/Delta epsilon(23.8) estimation function in cloudy conditions according to the band configuration of FY-3D MWRI. Finally, TPW retrieved was validated using TPW observation from the SuomiNet GPS and global distributed Radiosonde Observations (RAOB) networks. According to the validation, TPW retrieved using observations from FY-3D MWRI and ancillary data from Aqua MODIS had the best quality. The root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient between the retrieved TPW and observed TPW from RAOB were 5.47 and 0.94 mm, respectively.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Invasive <i>Lantana camara</i> (<i>Verbenaceae</i>) in Semiarid Savanna Rangeland Ecosystems of South Africa
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive Lantana camara (L. camara) is one of the key drivers of social-ecological and environmental change. Understanding its distribution is critical in determining its impact on the environment and livelihoods and in developing sustainable remediation and rehabilitation strategies. In this study we demonstrate the first comparative assessment of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) satellite data in detecting and mapping of invasive L. camara from other land cover types (i.e., built up, fields/bare patches, grassland, and shrub) in semiarid rangeland ecosystems of South Africa. Discriminant analysis (DA) classification technique was used to detect and characterize the spatial distribution of L. camara using Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 derivatives (i.e., spectral bands, indices, and combined variables). Comparatively, the results show that Sentinel-2 data were able to detect and map L. camara with a high overall accuracy (78.4%) than Landsat 8 OLI, which yielded an accuracy of 65.5%. Further, Student's t-test statistical analysis results showed that Sentinel-2 outperformed Landsat 8 (P < 0.05, Student's t < 0.233) in mapping L. camara from other land cover types. High performance from Sentinel-2 data indicates the relevance and potential of characterizing and profiling invasive species with the new-generation sensors, a previously daunting task, with broadband multispectral sensors.

TI  - Eric Perl's Theophanism: An Option for Agnostics?
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent work in analytic philosophy of religion has seen increased interest in nontheistic, but still non-naturalist (indeed, broadly religious) worldview options. J.L. Schellenberg's Ultimism has been among the most prominent of these. Another interesting option that has yet to receive much attention is the Theophanism advocated by the Neoplatonism scholar Eric Perl. In this paper, I summarize Perl's theophanism (which he describes as being neither theistic nor atheistic) and assess it on two fronts: (a) whether it might be an acceptable philosophical option for agnostics, specifically, and (b) to what extent it is independently defensible philosophically.

TI  - Intrapopulation variation in the behavioral responses of dwarf mongooses to anthropogenic noise
T2  - BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic noise is an increasingly widespread pollutant, with a rapidly burgeoning literature demonstrating impacts on humans and other animals, However, most studies have simply considered if there is an effect of noise, examining the overall cohort response. Although substantial evidence exists for intraspecific variation in responses to other anthropogenic disturbances, this possibility has received relatively little experimental attention with respect to noise. Here, we used field-based playbacks with dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula) to test how traffic noise affects vigilance behavior and to examine potential variation between individuals of different age class, sex, and dominance status. Foragers exhibited a stronger immediate reaction and increased their subsequent vigilance (both that on the ground and as a sentinel) in response to traffic-noise playback compared with ambient-sound playback. Traffic-noise playback also resulted in sentinels conducting longer bouts and being more likely to change post height or location than in ambient-sound playback. Moreover, there was evidence of variation in noise responses with respect to age class and dominance status but not sex. In traffic noise, foraging pups were more likely to flee and were slower to resume foraging than adults; they also tended to increase their vigilance more than adults. Dominants were more likely than subordinates to move post during sentinel bouts conducted in traffic-noise trials. Our findings suggest that the vigilance-foraging trade-off is affected by traffic noise but that individuals differ in how they respond. Future work should, therefore, consider intra-population response variation to understand fully the population-wide effects of this global pollutant.

TI  - An Evaluation of the Flea Index as a Predictor of Plague Epizootics in the West Nile Region of Uganda
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plague is a low incidence flea-borne zoonosis that is often fatal if treatment is delayed or inadequate. Outbreaks occur sporadically and human cases are often preceded by epizootics among rodents. Early recognition of epizootics coupled with appropriate prevention measures should reduce plague morbidity and mortality. For nearly a century, the flea index (a measure of fleas per host) has been used as a measure of risk for epizootic spread and human plague case occurrence, yet the practicality and effectiveness of its use in surveillance programs has not been evaluated rigorously. We sought to determine whether long-term monitoring of the Xenopsylla flea index on hut-dwelling rats in sentinel villages in the plague-endemic West Nile region of Uganda accurately predicted plague occurrence in the surrounding parish. Based on observations spanning similar to 6 yr, we showed that on average, the Xenopsylla flea index increased prior to the start of the annual plague season and tended to be higher in years when plague activity was reported in humans or rodents compared with years when it was not. However, this labor-intensive effort had limited spatial coverage and was a poor predictor of plague activity within sentinel parishes.

TI  - Thick melanomas without lymph node metastases: A forgotten group with poor prognosis
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Although adjuvant therapy is available for melanoma patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases (pN+), this is not the case for thick melanomas without SLN involvement (pN-).Objectives: We assessed overall and relative survival (OS, RS) in patients with >4.0 mm Breslow thickness (BT) pN- and pN + melanomas and <= 4.0 mm pN+ patients. Materials and methods: Clinicopathological data were retrieved from a cohort of >4.0 mm thick and/or pN thorn melanoma patients in The Netherlands from 2000 to 2014. OS and RS was compared using Kaplan-Meier-curves. A Cox-regression-model was developed to assess determinants of OS in >4.0 mm pN-patients.Results: In 54 645 patients, 3940 (7.2%) had >4.0 mm thick melanomas. SLN biopsy was performed in 1150 (29.2%) patients. Five-year OS was 70.5% for >4.0 mm pN- and 48.1% for >4.0 mm pN+ patients (p < 0.001), with a decreasing trend in OS for every mm BT. Five-year OS in 1877 < 4.0 mm pN+ patients was 71.5%, which was not different from >4.0 mm pN- (p = 0.24). Higher age, higher BT category, ulceration and male gender were significantly associated with poor survival in >4.0 mm pN- patients.Conclusions: Thick pN- melanomas have a poor prognosis, comparable to that of less thick pN thorn melanomas, which is not accounted for in current guidelines. We encourage including these high-risk patients in adjuvant trials. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd, BASO similar to The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - Google Earth Engine Open-Source Code for Land Surface Temperature Estimation from the Landsat Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is increasingly important for various studies assessing land surface conditions, e.g., studies of urban climate, evapotranspiration, and vegetation stress. The Landsat series of satellites have the potential to provide LST estimates at a high spatial resolution, which is particularly appropriate for local or small-scale studies. Numerous studies have proposed LST retrieval algorithms for the Landsat series, and some datasets are available online. However, those datasets generally require the users to be able to handle large volumes of data. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is an online platform created to allow remote sensing users to easily perform big data analyses without increasing the demand for local computing resources. However, high spatial resolution LST datasets are currently not available in GEE. Here we provide a code repository that allows computing LSTs from Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 within GEE. The code may be used freely by users for computing Landsat LST as part of any analysis within GEE.

TI  - Non-essential toxic element (Cd, As, Hg and Pb) levels in muscle, liver and kidney of loggerhead sea turtles (<i>Caretta caretta</i>) stranded along the southwestern coasts of Tyrrhenian sea
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-essential toxic metals are environmental pollutants that contaminate the marine ecosystem due to their extensive use and long-range transport (by rivers and air). Their presence into the environment is often linked to the human activity, with an expected bioaccumulation in the food chain. Within the marine animals, sea turtles may be considered as potential sentinel species for environmental assessment because of their long lifetime, habitat use and migratory nature.In this study, non-essential toxic metals in the coastal of Tyrrhenian Sea were monitored, during the 2017-2018 period, using the Mediterranean loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) as indicator species. The levels of Cadmium (Cd), Arsenic (As), Mercury (Hg) and Lead, (Pb) were determined in 30 turtles stranded in different locations along the coasts of Campania region of Southern Daly. After morphometric analysis, the nonessential toxic metal accumulation in loggerhead sea turtle muscle and organs have been measured analysing the total concentrations of metals in samples of liver, kidney, and muscle by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) after microwave assisted digestion with nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. The pattern of contaminants revealed a similar distribution for Pb and total mercury, that were not significantly high in all the analysed matrices. On the contrary, elevated concentrations of total As were found out in all matrices, mainly in muscle (25.7 mg/kg w.w.), and of Cd in liver (1.23 mg/kg w.w.) and kidney (6.82 mg/kg w.w.). These studies allow us to estimate the exposure degree to which these species are subjected.

TI  - Vulnerability Assessment of Buildings due to Land Subsidence Using InSAR Data in the Ancient Historical City of Pistoia (Italy)
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The launch of the medium resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 constellation in 2014 has allowed public and private organizations to introduce SAR interferometry (InSAR) products as a valuable option in their monitoring systems. The massive stacks of displacement data resulting from the processing of large C-B and radar images can be used to highlight temporal and spatial deformation anomalies, and their detailed analysis and postprocessing to generate operative products for final users. In this work, the wide-area mapping capability of Sentinel-1 was used in synergy with the COSMO-SkyMed high resolution SAR data to characterize ground subsidence affecting the urban fabric of the city of Pistoia (Tuscany Region, central Italy). Line of sight velocities were decomposed on vertical and E-W components, observing slight horizontal movements towards the center of the subsidence area. Vertical displacements and damage field surveys allowed for the calculation of the probability of damage depending on the displacement velocity by means of fragility curves. Finally, these data were translated to damage probability and potential loss maps. These products are useful for urban planning and geohazard management, focusing on the identification of the most hazardous areas on which to concentrate efforts and resources.

TI  - Stochastic Resonance Observed in Aerosol Optical Depth Time Series
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the aerosol optical depth time series retrieved from daily satellite Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer measurements. The investigated geographic area includes Italy and the Mediterranean Sea. By performing second- and fourth-order statistics analyses, the dynamics can be decomposed into two sources, the main of which is the annual cycle. The residence time distribution is made of local maxima over an exponential behavior. The two successive peaks are located at about 200 and 600 days. This allows us to hypothesize a stochastic resonance phenomenon in the dynamics of aerosol optical depth. The characteristic periodicity of the resonance is on the annual timescale, and the asymmetric double-well potential is provided by two different regimes for the values of the aerosol optical depth in winter and summer time. This means that a simple, although stochastic, differential equation can represent the time evolution of the optical depth, at least concerning its component related to the annual cycle.

TI  - The Impact of the Control Measures during the COVID-19 Outbreak on Air Pollution in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in Wuhan, China, in January 2020 just before the Spring Festival and subsequent country-wide measures to contain the virus, effectively resulted in the lock-down of the country. Most industries and businesses were closed, traffic was largely reduced, and people were restrained to their homes. This resulted in the reduction of emissions of trace gases and aerosols, the concentrations of which were strongly reduced in many cities around the country. Satellite imagery from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) showed an enormous reduction of tropospheric NO2 concentrations, but aerosol optical depth (AOD), as a measure of the amount of aerosols, was less affected, likely due to the different formation mechanisms and the influence of meteorological factors. In this study, satellite data and ground-based observations were used together to estimate the separate effects of the Spring Festival and the COVID-19 containment measures on atmospheric composition in the winter of 2020. To achieve this, data were analyzed for a period from 30 days before to 60 days after the Spring Festivals in 2017-2020. This extended period of time, including similar periods in previous years, were selected to account for both the decreasing concentrations in response to air pollution control measures, and meteorological effects on concentrations of trace gases and aerosols. Satellite data from TROPOMI provided the spatial distributions over mainland China of the tropospheric vertical column density (VCD) of NO2, and VCD of SO2 and CO. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provided the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The comparison of the satellite data for different periods showed a large reduction of, e.g., NO2 tropospheric VCDs due to the Spring Festival of up to 80% in some regions, and an additional reduction due to the COVID-19 containment measures of up to 70% in highly populated areas with intensive anthropogenic activities. In other areas, both effects are very small. Ground-based in situ observations from 26 provincial capitals provided concentrations of NO2, SO2, CO, O-3, PM2.5, and PM10. The analysis of these data was focused on the situation in Wuhan, based on daily averaged concentrations. The NO2 concentrations started to decrease a few days before the Spring Festival and increased after about two weeks, except in 2020 when they continued to be low. SO2 concentrations behaved in a similar way, whereas CO, PM2.5, and PM10 also decreased during the Spring Festival but did not trace NO2 concentrations as SO2 did. As could be expected from atmospheric chemistry considerations, O-3 concentrations increased. The analysis of the effects of the Spring Festival and the COVID-19 containment measures was complicated due to meteorological influences. Uncertainties contributing to the estimates of the different effects on the trace gas concentrations are discussed. The situation in Wuhan is compared with that in 26 provincial capitals based on 30-day averages for four years, showing different effects across China.

TI  - Screening pomegranate (<i>Punica granatum</i> L.) genotypes for drought tolerance using physiological and phytochemical characteristics
T2  - FRUITS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate physiological, phytochemical, fruit phytonutrients, and fruit yield (FY) of Iranian pomegranate genotypes under drought stress. A split plot experiment was conducted based on a randomized complete block design with three replications, where the three irrigation regimes were allotted to main plots and the ten pomegranate genotypes were allotted to subplots. The three irrigation regimes including control, mild and severe drought stresses were applied from bud burst to fruit harvest, when 25, 50 and 75% of the total available soil moisture was depleted from the root-zone (similar to 40 cm), respectively. The result of present study showed that with increase in drought stress levels fruit yield (FY), relative water content (RWC), total chlorophyll, chlorophyll b, total soluble solids and titratable acidity were decreased, while water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC), catalase, superoxide dismutase, chlorophyll a, total phenol content, and cyanidin-3-glucoside content were increased. The FY was significantly decreased in mild and severe drought stress conditions by 23.71 and 40.40%, respectively compared to the control. The distribution of geno-types on the biplot of principal component analysis under normal condition revealed a high genetic variation among the Iranian pomegranate genotypes. MTS and PSS genotypes, with high FY, proline content, WSC and catalase activity, were identified as preferable and suitable genotypes for both normal and mild stress conditions. In addition, PSS genotype maintained its FY in mild and severe drought stresses, which suggested as a preferable and superior genotype for cultivation in areas under drought stress.

TI  - 60 Years of Glacier Elevation and Mass Changes in the Maipo River Basin, Central Andes of Chile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the central Andes of Chile are fundamental freshwater sources for ecosystems and communities. Overall, glaciers in this region have shown continuous recession and down-wasting, but long-term glacier mass balance studies providing precise estimates of these changes are scarce. Here, we present the first long-term (1955-2013/2015), region-specific glacier elevation and mass change estimates for the Maipo River Basin, from which the densely populated metropolitan region of Chile obtains most of its freshwater supply. We calculated glacier elevation and mass changes using historical topographic maps, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM-X), and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation models. The results indicated a mean regional glacier mass balance of -0.12 +/- 0.06 m w.e.a(-1), with a total mass loss of 2.43 +/- 0.26 Gt for the Maipo River Basin between 1955-2013. The most negative glacier mass balance was the Olivares sub-basin, with a mean value of -0.29 +/- 0.07 m w.e.a(-1). We observed spatially heterogeneous glacier elevation and mass changes between 1955 and 2000, and more negative values between 2000 and 2013, with an acceleration in ice thinning rates starting in 2010, which coincides with the severe drought. Our results provide key information to improve glaciological and hydrological projections in a region where water resources are under pressure.

TI  - Chlorophyll-a concentration assessment using remotely sensed data over multiple years along the coasts of the United Arab Emirates
T2  - EMIRATES JOURNAL OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Arab Emirates (UAE) recently witnessed algal/phytoplankton blooms attributed to the high concentrations of Chlorophyll-a associated with the spread and accumulation of a wide range of organisms with toxic effects that influence ecological and fishing economic activities and water desalination along coastal areas. This research explores the UAE coasts as a case study for the framework presented here. In this research, we argue that advances in satellite remote sensing and imaging of spatial and temporal data offer sufficient information to find the best-fit regression method and relationship between Chlorophyll-a concentration and a set of climatic and biological explanatory variables over time. Three functional forms of regression models were tested and analysed to reveal that the Log-Linear Model found to be the best fit providing the most statistically robust model compared to the Linear and the Generalised Least Square models. Besides, it is useful to identify the factors Sea Surface temperature, Calcite Concentration, Instantaneous Photosynthetically Available Radiation, Normalized Fluorescence Line Height, and Wind Speed that significantly influence Chlorophyll-a concentration. Research results can be beneficial to aid decision-makers in building a best-fit statistical system and models of algal blooms in the study area. The study found results to be sensitive to the study's temporal time-period length and the explanatory variables selected for the analysis.

TI  - A Novel Method Based on Backscattering for Discriminating Summer Blooms of the Raphidophyte (<i>Chattonella</i> spp.) and the Diatom (<i>Skeletonema</i> spp.) Using MODIS Images in Ariake Sea, Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The raphidophyte Chattonella spp. and diatom Skeletonema spp. are the dominant harmful algal species of summer blooms in Ariake Sea, Japan. A new bio-optical algorithm based on backscattering features has been developed to differentiate harmful raphidophyte blooms from diatom blooms using MODIS imagery. Bloom waters were first discriminated from other water types based on the distinct spectral shape of the remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) data derived from MODIS. Specifically, bloom waters were discriminated by the positive value of Spectral Shape, SS (645), which arises from the R-rs(lambda) shoulder at 645 nm in bloom waters. Next, the higher cellular-specific backscattering coefficient, estimated from MODIS data and quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) of raphidophyte, Chattonella spp., was utilized to discriminate it from blooms of the diatom, Skeletonema spp. A new index b(bp-index)(555) was calculated based on a semi-analytical bio-optical model to discriminate the two algal groups. This index, combined with a supplemental Red Band Ratio (RBR) index, effectively differentiated the two bloom types. Validation of the method was undertaken using MODIS satellite data coincident with confirmed bloom observations from local field surveys, which showed that the newly developed method, based on backscattering features, could successfully discriminate the raphidophyte Chattonella spp. from the diatom Skeletonema spp. and thus provide reliable information on the spatial distribution of harmful blooms in Ariake Sea.

TI  - Predictive factors for omitting lymphadenectomy in patients with node-positive breast cancer treated with neo-adjuvant systemic therapy
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A pathologic complete response (pCR) in the axilla occurs in 30%-40% of patients with initially node-positive breast cancer after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Debate persists about whether to perform systematic axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND) in patients with initial node-positive disease and clinical complete response after NACT. We aimed to identify predictive factors of axillary pCR (ypN0) after NACT. This retrospective study analyzed data for all patients with initial biopsy-proven node-positive disease who underwent ALND after NACT between June 2008 and December 2016 at our institution. Clinical and pathologic features, recurrence and specific mortality rates were compared between patients who achieved an axillary pCR and those who did not (ypN0 vs ypN+, respectively). A total of 331 patients were included, of whom 128 (38.7%) became ypN0 after NACT. Among patients with >2 suspicious axillary lymph nodes before treatment, 54 (38%) achieved ypN0 status. The independent predictors of ypN0 were Ki-67 > 30 (OR 1.98; 95% CI, 1.146-3.381), HER2 positivity (OR 2.6; 95% CI, 1.354-5.108), nonluminal molecular-like subtype (OR 4.15; 95% CI, 2.068-5.108), and clinical complete response, defined as negative clinical and ultrasonographic findings (OR 2.8; 95% CI, 1.110-7.081). After a mean follow-up of 61 months, distant disease-free and overall survival rates were higher in patients with ypN0 disease (HR 4.14; 95% CI, 2.03-8.43) than ypN+ patients. Complete clinical response and the presence of nonluminal molecular-like subtypes independently predicted ypN0. Patients meeting these criteria might be suitable form omitting ALND and just performing targeted axillary procedures to patients meeting these criteria.

TI  - An Iterative ICA-Based Reconstruction Method to Produce Consistent Time-Variable Total Water Storage Fields Using GRACE and Swarm Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Observing global terrestrial water storage changes (TWSCs) from (inter-)seasonal to (multi-)decade time-scales is very important to understand the Earth as a system under natural and anthropogenic climate change. The primary goal of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission (2002-2017) and its follow-on mission (GRACE-FO, 2018-onward) is to provide time-variable gravity fields, which can be converted to TWSCs with similar to 300 km spatial resolution; however, the one year data gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO represents a critical discontinuity, which cannot be replaced by alternative data or model with the same quality. To fill this gap, we applied time-variable gravity fields (2013-onward) from the Swarm Earth explorer mission with low spatial resolution of similar to 1500 km. A novel iterative reconstruction approach was formulated based on the independent component analysis (ICA) that combines the GRACE and Swarm fields. The reconstructed TWSC fields of 2003-2018 were compared with a commonly applied reconstruction technique and GRACE-FO TWSC fields, whose results indicate a considerable noise reduction and long-term consistency improvement of the iterative ICA reconstruction technique. They were applied to evaluate trends and seasonal mass changes (of 2003-2018) within the world's 33 largest river basins.

TI  - Breast Cancer Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Observational Clinical Study of the Breast Surgery Clinic at Ospedale Policlinico San Martino - Genoa, Italy
T2  - IN VIVO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: COVID-19 pandemic required a marked re-allocation of healthcare resources, including at Breast Units. A patient-tailored program was developed to assess its efficacy regarding prevention of COVID-19 infection among patients with breast cancer undergoing surgery and healthcare workers (HCWs). Patients and Methods: From March 9th to April 9th 2020, 91 patients were selected for elective surgery by means of: i) Prehospital screening aimed at avoiding hospitalization of symptomatic or suspicious COVID-19 patients, and ii) prioritisation of surgical procedure according to specific disease features. Results: Eighty-five patients (93.4%) were fit for surgery, while five patients (5.5%) were temporarily excluded through 'telephone triage'; another two patients were excluded at in-hospital triage. A total of 71 out of 85 patients (83.5%) were diagnosed with invasive cancer, most of whom were undergoing breast-conserving surgery (61 out of 85 patients, 71.8%). The mean in-hospital stay was 2.2 days (SD=0.7 days). After hospital discharge, no patient needed re-admission due to post-operative complications; moreover, no COVID-19 infection among patients or HCWs was detected. Conclusion: Safe breast cancer surgery was accomplished for both patients and HCWs by means of a careful preoperative selection of patients and in-hospital preventative measures. This screening program can be transferred to high-volume Breast Units and it may be useful in implementing European Community recommendations for prevention of COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Long-term surface water trends and relationship with open water evaporation losses in the Namoi catchment, Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic pressures on natural resources have led to a modification of natural surface water patterns. This has affected the hydrologic cycle at a global scale with multiple environmental and socioeconomic implications. This study evaluates long-term trends in surface water occurrence and related climate variables in a large agricultural catchment of Australia to understand trends in evaporative water losses from open water bodies. Surface water detection was based on a supervised classification of Landsat images between 1988 and 2018 to obtain inundation and surface water frequencies across the catchment, which were compared with other surface water products. Climate trends were based on monthly SILO gridded datasets. Open water evaporation was estimated using the FAO56 methodology and compared with the Penman-Monteith-Leuning Evapotranspiration V2 (PML_V2) product. Evaporation trends were analysed using the Mann Kendall (MK) test and the Sen's slope (SS). Generally, open water frequencies showed significant negative trends, though these varied spatially. The number of dams, on the other hand, had an increasing trend. Temperatures are increasing in the catchment, while rainfall and relative humidity are decreasing, resulting in an overall positive trend for reference evapotranspiration (ETr) across 90% of the catchment. Even though ETr and evaporation per unit area of water show positive trends, lumped open water evaporation showed a negative trend, possibly associated with an average decrease in surface water frequencies. Annual evaporative losses averaged 201.9 GL, exceeding annual total account usage of surface water in the catchment. All the studied changes imply a loss of blue and green water in the catchment, and provide evidence of an overall intensification of the hydrologic cycle as predicted under climate change.

TI  - Cumulative threats to juvenile green turtles in the coastal waters of southern and southeastern Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Management of marine turtles at broad spatial scales is challenging due to the costs and the logistical feasibility of collecting ecological data and information on multiple threats at this scale. Spatially explicit assessments of the exposure of marine turtles to cumulative threats provides an alternative approach by identifying regions that are impacted by multiple threats at broad scales. To inform future management of juvenile green turtles, Chelonia mydas, off the southern and southeastern Brazilian coast we determined their cumulative exposure to five pertinent anthropogenic activities (marine traffic, port areas, and artisanal, trawl and gillnet fisheries). Information on the spatial distribution of juvenile green turtles was obtained by satellite tagging 14 wild-caught turtles in the Paranagua Estuarine Complex, off the Parana coast in southern Brazil and human activity information was obtained from various databases. This allowed us to identify the anthropogenic activities that provide the greatest risk to marine turtles (artisanal fisheries and marine traffic) and five "hotspot" threat areas that require prompt local management intervention to protect marine turtles in the region. These results can be used to inform on the ground efforts where further impact assessments and management interventions can be prioritized and undertaken.

TI  - Mapping the Groundwater Potentiality of West Qena Area, Egypt, Using Integrated Remote Sensing and Hydro-Geophysical Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The integrated use of remote sensing imagery and hydro-geophysical field surveys is a well-established approach to map the hydrogeological framework, and thus explore and evaluate the groundwater potentiality of desert lands, where groundwater is considered as the main source of freshwater. This study uses such integrated approach to map the groundwater potentiality of the desert alluvial floodplain of the Nile Valley west of Qena, Egypt, as alternative water source to the River Nile. Typically ground gradient, faults and their stress field, lateral variation of rock permeability, drainage patterns, watersheds, rainfall, lithology, and soil types are the main factors believed to affect the groundwater recharge and storage from the infiltration of present-time and paleo-runoff. Following this generally accepted approach, different remote sensing data sets (SRTM DEM, Landsat-8, ALOS/PALSAR-1, Sentinel-1, and TRMM) as well as auxiliary maps (geological and soil maps) were used to identify and map these factors and prepare thematic maps portraying the different influences they exert on the groundwater recharge. These thematic maps were overlaid and integrated using weights in a GIS framework to generate the groundwater potentiality map which categorizes the different recharge capabilities into five zones. Moreover, the aeromagnetic data were processed to map the deep-seated structures and estimate the depth to basement rocks that may control the groundwater occurrence. In addition, the vertical electrical sounding (VES) measurements were applied and calibrated with the available borehole data to delineate the subsurface geological and hydrogeological setting as well as the groundwater aquifers. Different geoelectric cross-sections and hydro-geophysical maps were constructed using the borehole information and VES interpretation results to show the lateral extension of the different lithological units, groundwater-bearing zones, water table, and the saturated thickness of the aquifer. The GIS model and geophysical results show that the southwest part of Nag'a Hammadi-El-Ghoneimia stretch has very high recharge and storage potentiality and is characterized by the presence of two groundwater-bearing zones. The shallow groundwater aquifer is located at a depth of 30 m with a saturation thickness of more than 43 m. However, there are NW-SE faults crossing the study area and most likely serve as recharge conduits by connecting the shallow aquifer with the deeper ones. Such aquifers connection has been confirmed by investigating the chemical and isotopic composition of their groundwater.

TI  - Life History Evaluation of <i>Ooencyrtus lucidus</i>, a Newly Described Egg Parasitoid of <i>Bagrada hilaris</i>
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ooencyrtus lucidus Triapitsyn & Ganjisaffar (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) was recently recovered from fresh sentinel eggs of Bagrada hilaris (Burmeister) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in California. In the present study, life history traits of O. lucidus were studied at 26 +/- 0.5 degrees C, 40 +/- 10% RH, and a photoperiod of 14 L: 10 D hours. Results showed that 95.2% of the parasitized eggs yielded successful emergence of adults. The total immature developmental time was 14.27 and 13.95 days for females and males, respectively. The sex ratio of O. lucidus was 0.5 (females/offspring). Mated females laid on average 6.0 eggs per day and 222.7 eggs during their mean ovipositional period of 37.3 days. There was no significant difference in reproduction parameters between mated and non-mated females. The net reproductive rate (R0) was 103.8 females/female/generation, the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was 0.171 females/female/day, the finite rate of increase (lambda) was 1.187 population multiplication/day, the mean generation time (T) was 27.1 days, and the doubling time (DT) was 4.0 days. The highest longevity was observed in mated and non-mated females fed with honey, and they lived for 70.8 and 70.1 days, respectively. Providing females with host eggs in addition to honey, reduced their longevity by 24% in mated and 28% in non-mated individuals. Non-mated females and males deprived of honey only lived for 3.5 and 2.5 days after emergence, respectively. Our results indicate that O. lucidus has sufficient life history traits to make it a promising egg parasitoid for the biological control of B. hilaris.

TI  - Evaluation of the Crosta method for the retrieval of water quality parameters from remote sensing data in the Pearl River estuary
T2  - WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, many algorithms have been developed for the retrieval of water quality parameters using remotely sensed data. However, these algorithms are specific to a certain geographical area and cannot be applied to other areas. In this study, feature-orientated principal component (PC) selection, based on the Crosta method and using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) for the retrieval of water quality parameters (i.e., total suspended sediment concentration (TSM) and chlorophyll a (Chla)), was carried out. The results show that feature-orientated PC TSM, based on the Crosta method, obtained a good agreement with the MERIS-based TSM product for eight Landsat TM images. However, the Chla information, selected using the feature-orientated PC, has a poor agreement with the MERIS-based Chla product. The accuracy of the atmospheric correction method and MERIS product may be the main factors influencing the accuracy of the TSM and Chla information identified by the Landsat TM images using the Crosta method. The findings of this study would be helpful in the retrieval of spatial distribution information on TSM from the long-term historical Landsat image archive, without using coincident ground measurements.

TI  - Using the random forest model and validated MODIS with the field spectrometer measurement promote the accuracy of estimating aboveground biomass and coverage of alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Maintaining the aboveground biomass (AGB) and canopy cover (CC) of grassland is key for sustainable grassland management and rational conservation planning, especially for fragile regions of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). However, the estimation of AGB and CC with land use changes is often challenging due to poor availability of high-quality images of remote sensing or the large-scale field survey data. In this study, we used the transect survey method combining with quadrat measurements with 1200 plant samplings and near surface hyperspectral measurements at 180 sites to validate the MODIS data. An integrative approach combining the plant sampling, near surface hyperspectral measurements, remote sensing data interpretation, random forest modelling and Hurst phenomenon prediction was developed to accurately and efficiently estimate the CC and AGB of the alpine grasslands on the QTP from 2000 to 2017 and their future trends. The results showed: 1) estimation of AGB and CC in different land use types by integrating random forest with multiple factors (NDVI, latitude, longitude and altitude, grassland types) was more accurate; 2) the inter-annual changes of AGB and CC of the alpine grasslands presented significant fluctuations, with an increasing trend in the QTP; 3) the areas with improved vegetation conditions of AGB (66.55%) and CC (64.58%) were much larger than those with degraded vegetation conditions of AGB (33.45%) and CC (35.42%) in past 20 years. 4) there are 60.66% of the AGB and 59.87% of coverage showing sustainability and increasing in the future. Estimating the AGB and CC with multiple factors using the random forest and validated MODIS with the field spectrometer can improve the accuracy. The findings of this study can provide scientific basis for promoting the sustainability of grassland ecosystem through adaptive and rational management on the QTP and worldwide.

TI  - Competitive Segmentation Performance on Near-Lossless and Lossy Compressed Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Image segmentation lies at the heart of multiple image processing chains, and achieving accurate segmentation is of utmost importance as it affects later processing. Image segmentation has recently gained interest in the field of remote sensing, mostly due to the widespread availability of remote sensing data. This increased availability poses the problem of transmitting and storing large volumes of data. Compression is a common strategy to alleviate this problem. However, lossy or near-lossless compression prevents a perfect reconstruction of the recovered data. This letter investigates the image segmentation performance in data reconstructed after a near-lossless or a lossy compression. Two image segmentation algorithms and two compression standards are evaluated on data from several instruments. Experimental results reveal that segmentation performance over previously near-lossless and lossy compressed images is not markedly reduced at low and moderate compression ratios (CRs). In some scenarios, accurate segmentation performance can be achieved even for high CRs.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data for Land Cover Mapping Using W-Net
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a new approach to the fusion of Sentinel 1 (S1) and Sentinel 2 (S2) data for land cover mapping. The proposed solution aims at improving methods based on Sentinel 2 data, that are unusable in case of cloud cover. This goal is achieved by using S1 data to generate S2-like segmentation maps to be used to integrate S2 acquisitions forbidden by cloud cover. In particular, we propose for the first time in remote sensing a multi-temporal W-Net approach for the segmentation of Interferometric Wide swath mode (IW) Sentinel-1 data collected along ascending/descending orbit to discriminate rice, water, and bare soil. The quantitative assessment of segmentation accuracy shows an improvement of 0.18 and 0.25 in terms of accuracy and F1-score by applying the proposed multi-temporal procedure with respect to the previous single-date approach. Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed W-Net based solution have been tested in the National Park of Albufera, Valencia, and we show a performance gain in terms of the classical metrics used in segmentation tasks and the computational time.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes in detail the anthropogenic factors affecting the ecogeomorphological conditions in the the Eastern Kura depression (Kura-Araz lowland and surrounding areas). According to the reviewed literature theoretical base of human effects on geomorphological environment and modern situation of human activity were analyzed in the studied area. On the base of supervised and unsupervised classification of the Landsat images (1976-2017) land use-land cover (LULC) map of the territory was compiled with application of GIS technologies. Six land cover types were distinguished with a geomorphological interpretation executing the classification for the year 1976 and 2017: water, green, bare land, salinity, parcel and urban (settle areas). It was estimated the area, decrease and increase of each land cover type. The dynamic and transformation of land covers were determined with the change detection function. For example, it was defined that the most increasing land cover in the area of transformation since 1976 to 2017 is the sown area. Due to the anthropogenic development of the studied territory, the largest reduction in the area of bare (33.85%) and salinization (25.43%) land covers occurred during this period.

M3  - Article
AB  - The snow cover is greatly diverse in distribution due to landscape, slope, duration, wind, etc. However, the snow build-up and spatial patterns play an important role in the hydrological cycle. These characteristics can be determined through a number of weather station which widely represents the entire glacier and hilly region of Leh-Ladakh to support understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of snow cover. Remotely sensed data overcome these natural and other anthropogenic limitations that hinder data collection. Snow and ice cover has a distinct spectral reflectance from the land surfaces, therefore, shortwave infrared (SWIR-1) bands were used to discriminate these. Snow was extracted by applying Normalized Difference Snow Index and Normalized Difference Snow Thermal Index. In this study, snow and ice of different classes like fresh snow, dirty snow, and blue ice from the optical images were interpreted and Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 images were used to extract both spatial and temporal aspects. Temporal changes of snow and ice in the year of 2015-2017 shows a decline in snow cover area. The accuracy assessment of supervised classification using maximum likelihood and support vector machine accuracy with the Sentinel-2 optical image was compared and it was 94.40%. The landsat-8 image depicted 80.88% accuracy of snow and ice.

TI  - Accuracy assessment of the global TanDEM-X digital elevation model in a mountain environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The past two decades have been prolific in production of global or near-global Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from satellite data. The most recent addition to the family of global DEMs is the TanDEM-X DEM with resolution of 0.4?arc sec. DEMs are essential for a wide range of environmental applications, many of which are related to mountains including studies on natural hazards, forestry or glacier mass changes. However, synthetic aperture radar interferometry used for acquisition of TanDEM-X DEM is especially challenging over steep and irregular mountain surfaces due to shadowing and foreshortening effects. In this study, we assessed the absolute vertical accuracy of TanDEM-X DEM in European mountains. We compared it with both a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and a Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from airborne laser scanning data. Our results indicate that the height error of TanDEM-X DEM expressed as absolute deviation at the 90% quantile is consistent with the 10?m mission specification benchmark. We further concentrated on the absolute height error with respect to environmental characteristics (i.e. forested and non-forested areas, slope, and aspect). The comparison of TanDEM-X DEM with a reference DTM showed a positive vertical offset; however, the mean error differed greatly between forested and non-forested areas. When compared to reference DSM, our results showed a slight underestimation. We observed the highest underestimation in deciduous forests, followed by coniferous forests and non-forested areas. A significant decrease in accuracy was observed with increasing slope, especially for slopes above 10 degrees. In mountains where the imagery was acquired only in one orbit direction (i.e. ascending for Northern hemisphere), the largest TanDEM-X DEM error when compared to DSM was recorded for the west-facing slopes (i.e. slopes facing the sensor); however, the association with terrain orientation diminished in mountains, the imagery of which was acquired from both the ascending and descending orbit. Finally, we evaluated the effect of data acquisition characteristics provided with TanDEM-X DEM as auxiliary data. Our results show that two coverages might not be sufficient in mountain environment. Additional acquisitions, especially those with different acquisition geometry, improved the absolute vertical accuracy of TanDEM-X DEM and eliminated areas of inconsistency. We discourage from using the Height Error Map (HEM) to estimate the error magnitude. On the other hand, auxiliary data (COM, COV) provide valuable information that should be always used in pre-analyses to identify possible problematic areas.

TI  - A First Case Study of CCN Concentrations from Spaceborne Lidar Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present here the first cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration profiles derived from measurements with the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), for different aerosol types at a supersaturation of 0.15%. CCN concentrations, along with the corresponding uncertainties, were inferred for a nighttime CALIPSO overpass on 9 September 2011, with coincident observations with the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe-146 research aircraft, within the framework of the Evaluation of CALIPSO's Aerosol Classification scheme over Eastern Mediterranean (ACEMED) research campaign over Thessaloniki, Greece. The CALIPSO aerosol typing is evaluated, based on data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalysis. Backward trajectories and satellite-based fire counts are used to examine the origin of air masses on that day. Our CCN retrievals are evaluated against particle number concentration retrievals at different height levels, based on the ACEMED airborne measurements and compared against CCN-related retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard Terra and Aqua product over Thessaloniki showing that it is feasible to obtain CCN concentrations from CALIPSO, with an uncertainty of a factor of two to three.

TI  - Effect of Image Fusion on Vegetation Index Quality-A Comparative Study from Gaofen-1, Gaofen-2, Gaofen-4, Landsat-8 OLI and MODIS Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the use of image fusion method has received increasing attention in remote sensing, vegetation cover changes, vegetation indices (VIs) mapping, etc. For making high-resolution and good quality (with low-cost) VI mapping from a fused image, its quality and underlying factors need to be identified properly. For example, same-sensor image fusion generally has a higher spatial resolution ratio (SRR) (1:3 to 1:5) but multi-sensor fusion has a lower SRR (1:8 to 1:10). In addition to SRR, there might be other factors affecting the fused vegetation index (FVI) result which have not been investigated in detail before. In this research, we used a strategy on image fusion and quality assessment to find the effect of image fusion for VI quality using Gaofen-1 (GF1), Gaofen-2 (GF2), Gaofen-4 (GF4), Landsat-8 OLI, and MODIS imagery with their panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) bands in low SRR (1:6 to 1:15). For this research, we acquired a total of nine images (4 PAN+5 MS) on the same (almost) date (GF1, GF2, GF4 and MODIS images were acquired on 2017/07/13 and the Landsat-8 OLI image was acquired on 2017/07/17). The results show that image fusion has the least impact on Green Normalized Vegetation Index (GNDVI) and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) compared to other VIs. The quality of VI is mostly insensitive with image fusion except for the high-pass filter (HPF) algorithm. The subjective and objective quality evaluation shows that Gram-Schmidt (GS) fusion has the least impact on FVI quality, and with decreasing SRR, the FVI quality is decreasing at a slow rate. FVI quality varies with types image fusion algorithms and SRR along with spectral response function (SRF) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, the FVI quality seems good even for small SRR (1:6 to 1:15 or lower) as long as they have good SNR and minimum SRF effect. The findings of this study could be cost-effective and highly applicable for high-quality VI mapping even in small SRR (1:15 or even lower).

TI  - Canopy Height Estimation Using Sentinel Series Images through Machine Learning Models in a Mangrove Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy height serves as a good indicator of forest carbon content. Remote sensing-based direct estimations of canopy height are usually based on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometric data. LiDAR data is scarcely available for the Indian tropics, while Interferometric SAR data from commercial satellites are costly. High temporal decorrelation makes freely available Sentinel-1 interferometric data mostly unsuitable for tropical forests. Alternatively, other remote sensing and biophysical parameters have shown good correlation with forest canopy height. The study objective was to establish and validate a methodology by which forest canopy height can be estimated from SAR and optical remote sensing data using machine learning models i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Symbolic Regression (SR). Here, we analysed the potential of Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence and Sentinel-2 biophysical parameters to propose a new method for estimating canopy height in the study site of the Bhitarkanika wildlife sanctuary, which has mangrove forests. The results showed that interferometric coherence, and biophysical variables (Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Vegetation Cover (FVC)) have reasonable correlation with canopy height. The RF model showed a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 1.57 m and R-2 value of 0.60 between observed and predicted canopy heights; whereas, the SR model through genetic programming demonstrated better RMSE and R-2 values of 1.48 and 0.62 m, respectively. The SR also established an interpretable model, which is not possible via any other machine learning algorithms. The FVC was found to be an essential variable for predicting forest canopy height. The canopy height maps correlated with ICESat-2 estimated canopy height, albeit modestly. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of Sentinel series data and the machine learning models in predicting canopy height. Therefore, in the absence of commercial and rare data sources, the methodology demonstrated here offers a plausible alternative for forest canopy height estimation.

TI  - Data Cube on Demand (DCoD): Generating an earth observation Data Cube anywhere in the world
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To tackle Big Data challenges such as Volume, Variety, and Velocity, the Earth Observations Data Cube (EODC) concept has emerged as a solution for lowering barriers and offering new possibilities to harness the information power of satellite ED data. However, installing, configuring, and managing an EODC instance is still difficult requiring specific knowledge and capabilities. Consequently, facilitating and automating the generation and provision of EODC given specific user's requirements can be beneficial.In response to this issue, this paper presents the Data Cube on Demand (DCoD) approach, a proof-of-concept that aims at facilitating the generation and use of an EODC instance virtually anywhere in the World. Users are only required to specify an area of interest; select the types of sensors between Landsat 5-7-8 and Sentinel-2; choose a desired temporal frame; and provide their email address to receive notifications. Then automatically an empty ODC instance is instantiated and desired data are ingested.The proposed approach has been successfully tested in two sites in Bolivia and DRC in the field of environmental monitoring. It has lowered many complexity barriers of such a new technology; greatly facilitated the generation and use of the Data Cube technology; enhanced data sovereignty; and ultimately can help reaching large adoption and acceptance.

TI  - Maximum Fraction Images Derived from Year-Based Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation (PROBA-V) Data for the Rapid Assessment of Land Use and Land Cover Areas in Mato Grosso State, Brazil
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new approach for rapidly assessing the extent of land use and land cover (LULC) areas in Mato Grosso state, Brazil. The novel idea is the use of an annual time series of fraction images derived from the linear spectral mixing model (LSMM) instead of original bands. The LSMM was applied to the Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation (PROBA-V) 100-m data composites from 2015 (similar to 73 scenes/year, cloud-free images, in theory), generating vegetation, soil, and shade fraction images. These fraction images highlight the LULC components inside the pixels. The other new idea is to reduce these time series to only six single bands representing the maximum and standard deviation values of these fraction images in an annual composite, reducing the volume of data to classify the main LULC classes. The whole image classification process was conducted in the Google Earth Engine platform using the pixel-based random forest algorithm. A set of 622 samples of each LULC class was collected by visual inspection of PROBA-V and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images and divided into training and validation datasets. The performance of the method was evaluated by the overall accuracy and confusion matrix. The overall accuracy was 92.4%, with the lowest misclassification found for cropland and forestland (<9% error). The same validation data set showed 88% agreement with the LULC map made available by the Landsat-based MapBiomas project. This proposed method has the potential to be used operationally to accurately map the main LULC areas and to rapidly use the PROBA-V dataset at regional or national levels.

TI  - Acute coronary artery obstruction following surgical repair of congenital heart disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Acute coronary artery obstruction is a rare complication of congenital heart disease surgery but imposes a high burden of morbidity and mortality. Previous case series have described episodes in specific congenital heart lesions or surgical repairs but have not examined the complication in all-comers to congenital heart surgery. We hypothesize that shorter time from a clinically recognized postoperative sentinel event suggestive of coronary ischemia to diagnosis of coronary obstruction is associated with improved clinical outcomes.Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective review of patients diagnosed with acute coronary artery obstruction by angiography following surgical repair of congenital heart disease between January 2000 and June 2016.Results: In total, 34 patients were identified. The most common procedures associated with coronary artery obstruction were the Norwood procedure, arterial switch operation, and aortic valve repair/replacement. In total, 79% required mechanical circulatory support, 41% died, and 27% were listed for heart transplant. Patients who died or were listed for heart transplant had longer median sentinel-event-to-cardiac-catheterization time (28 [6-168] hours vs 10 [3-56] hours, P = .001), and longer median sentinel-event-to-intervention time (32 [11-350] hours vs 13 [5-59] hours, P = .003). Patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome were at greater risk of death or transplant listing (odds ratio, 9.23, P = .03).Conclusions: Time from clinically relevant postoperative sentinel event to diagnosis of coronary artery obstruction by angiography was associated with transplant-listing-free survival. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for coronary obstruction and consider early catheterization and coronary angiography for patients in whom post-operative coronary compromise is suspected.

TI  - Nasimi's thought and effect in Comparative Literature in Foreign Resources (Analyzing with Goethe's, S. Remiev's and Dafydd ap Gwilym)
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Imadeddin Nasimi is one of the mystical poets of the 14th century as a continuation of the Hurufism movement among Turkish poets. From Nasimi's point of view, ontology has been explained based on theological thought that everything is from the first force, which is equivalent to the whole new soul of the Platonists. The first appearance and the highest manifestation is the originality, the "Word" or the "Word of God," which is called the holy word. A similar view of the origins of Plotinus can found in the poems of other talented medieval and contemporary poets. Nasimi appropriately evaluated in both Eastern and Western literature. Therefore, 2019 was declared the year of Nasimi by UNESCO. He tried to understand God, not through fear, but love and conscience. The greatness of the perfect human personality for the progress of societies can be seen in Nasimi's view.In foreign sources, the philosophical aspect of Nasimi's poems is considered more than his ideological approach. But in this article, the aim of the investigation is that the literary, mystical, and worldview aspects of Nasimi and analyzing the effect of his mystical view on other poets' poems. In this context, Goethe, Dafydd ap Gwilym, Remiev's intellectual approaches, and poems would be analyzed.In the philosophy of ontology, the importance of self-knowledge is a priority. Therefore, based on comparative studies between Nasimi's mystical thought and German, Russian, and English poets, it is possible to understand the constituent elements of the commonality between them. This research will lead to the study of philosophical-mystical themes and the similarity of views between Nasimi and other poets. The use of the research method is the analytical-descriptive method, and their poems compared and criticized. The results of the analysis show that the poets of the Western World influenced by the mystical view of the Eastern world, and the approach of literary celebrities in the world is common to the definition of a perfect human being.

TI  - Evaluation of Conservation Effects Assessment Project Grazing Lands conservation practices on the Cienega Creek watershed in southeast Arizona with AGWA/RHEM modeling tools
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment Tool (AGWA) and the Rangeland Hydrology Erosion Model (RHEM) were used to evaluate conservation practices on the Cienega Creek watershed (CCW) that were implemented under the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) on Grazing Lands. CEAP on Grazing Lands is a multi-agency effort to quantify the environmental effects of conservation practices and programs, and develop the science base for managing rangelands for environmental quality using conservation practices (Spaeth et al. 2013). The evaluation was performed on the CCW and the Empire Ranch, located in southeastern Arizona, where numerous conservation practices have been implemented to achieve their management goals of maintaining desired plant communities and watershed processes. To assess the effects of the conservation practices on long-term soil and water loss, RHEM was applied to the entire CCW using National Resources Inventory (NRI) data. Four analysis periods were selected based on climatic contrasts, conservation spending, and availability of NRI sample points. The CCW results showed that the simulations using RHEM parameters derived from NRI data could be used to demonstrate the impact of climate on vegetation condition and sediment yield. A subsection, dubbed "select treatment areas," of the CCW, which received extensive treatments with brush removal, prescribed burns, and stock ponds, was assessed using remotely sensed data.The select treatment areas were modeled over three different periods, representing preconservation spending, postconservation spending, and later postconservation spending. Remote sensing was capable of detecting and estimating the changes in vegetation cover from brush removal and prescribed burns. Simulations of sediment yield using pre- and posttreatment data indicated a modest reduction in sediment yield. Simulations in the select treatment areas indicated mechanical brush treatments were typically more effective than prescribed burns for improving watershed condition as estimated by reductions in sediment yield, but were more costly to implement. Stock ponds had a larger impact on sediment yield than the land treatments. The assessment demonstrated the utility of remotely sensed estimates of plant growth form and cover for model inputs to estimate changes in runoff and sediment yield with changing cover conditions over large areas.

TI  - Assessment of Spatial and Temporal Trend of Groundwater Salinity in Jaffna Peninsula and Its Link to Paddy Land Abandonment
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinization is an explicit global threat faced by coastal low lands. The increased seawater ingression into groundwater due to various climatic and anthropogenic factors affects functioning of ecosystems, biodiversity and the sustainability of coastal agriculture. This study was undertaken to investigate the changes in groundwater salinity in Jaffna Peninsula over a 20-year period and its relationship with paddy land abandonment. Permanently abandoned paddy areas were mapped using historical Landsat images, while groundwater salinity changes in 63 agricultural wells for the period 1999 to 2019 were analysed. The trend in salinity, including proximity to the coast, was examined. The results showed that approximately 8178 ha (43% of total paddy land) of paddy lands had been permanently abandoned while the groundwater salinity had increased by 1.6-fold over the last two decades. An increasing salinity trend with decreasing distance from the coast was observed. Presently, nearly 59% of the wells showed salinity levels that were unsuitable for crop irrigation. The results underline the need for urgent and effective management of groundwater resources in order to maintain the sustainability of the existing paddy lands and ensure availability of potable water for consumption along the coastal low land areas of Jaffna Peninsula.

TI  - Soil salinity analysis of Urmia Lake Basin using Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A based spectral indices and electrical conductivity measurements
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the significant soil degradation problems especially faced in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. It poses a high threat to soil productivity in agricultural lands. The demand for economic and rapid detection and temporal monitoring of soil salinity has been rising recently. Satellite imagery and remote sensing approaches are the significant tools for accurate prediction and mapping of soil salinity in various regions of the world. This study aims to compare Landsat- 8 OLI and Sentinel-2A derived soil salinity maps of the western part of Urmia Lake in Iran by applying three different salinity indices in conjunction with field measurements. Totally 70 soil samples were collected from top 20 cm of surface soil in October 2016 from an area of 18 km 2 . Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A images were acquired in the same month; both images were atmospherically and radiometrically corrected prior to applying soil salinity indices. After comparing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) value of corresponding pixel for each sample with its electrical conductivity (EC) value, 54 soil samples with various EC ranges were selected for mapping. Among them, 42 samples were used for establishing the regression model and remaining 12 samples were utilized to validate the model. Multiple and linear regression analyses were conducted to correlate the EC data with their corresponding soil salinity spectral index values derived from visible bands of satellite images. The results revealed that soil salinity indices extracted from both Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A visible bands estimated soil salinity with acceptable accuracy of R-2 0.73 and 0.74, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis using both Landsat- 8 OLI and Sentinel-2A data demonstrated higher accuracy with R-2 value of 0.77 and 0.75, respectively, compared to linear regression. This study proves that various soil salinity classes with different EC ranges can be estimated by correlating ground measurement data with satellite data.

TI  - A land systems science approach to assessing forest governance and characterizing the emergence of social forestry in the Western Cascades of Oregon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - National forests in the United States are undergoing a spatially and temporally uneven governance transition in response to Congressional policies, agency mandates, and social and economic pressures, with many moving from a wholly state-led 'dominant federal' model to a more collaborative networked governance model which we refer to as 'social forestry'. While the broad contours of this transition have been observed and studied previously, there have been few attempts to characterize it using quantitative, qualitative, or geospatial methods. Here, we combine a novel remote sensing-based method with qualitative social science research to understand the emergence of social forestry and its implications for land use/land cover change associated with implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) in the Western Cascades of Oregon. We linked time-series satellite data with forest inventory data to track patterns of timber harvest at scales commensurate with timber management decision-making. We then compared these patterns to policy-based expectations. We found a significant disconnect between NWFP policy and actual timber harvest patterns, raising questions about the effectiveness of the NWFP land use allocation system and the 'land sparing' approach to managing tensions between conservation and production. Qualitative research, including semi-structured interviews with federal agency personnel and local stakeholders, shed light on the causal mechanisms and reciprocal relationships driving spatial patterns of timber harvesting, which we discuss in terms of the emergence of social forestry involving complex, place-based negotiations between the federal government and local veto actors advocating for conservation. Findings have implications for US Forest Service public engagement strategies and efforts to establish zones of agreement regarding timber harvesting, as well as broader discussions about the agency's future.

TI  - The role of land use conversion in shaping the land cover of the Central American Dry Corridor
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central American Dry Corridor (CADC) is a trans-border region characterized by climatic and ecological continuities. It is expected to experience rising aridity and severe hydro-climatic events due to climate change. Subsistence agriculture and other rural livelihoods to which land cover is central are widely practiced in this impoverished territory of approximately eleven million people.The CADC's land cover was profiled to determine: a) how it differs from Non-CADC areas, and b) the role of land use in shaping these differences. Spatial autocorrelation analysis using satellite data showed that forest cover is a third less prevalent in the CADC than in the Non-CADC while the share of mosaic vegetation and mosaic cropland is nearly double. A naturally prevalent cover type in the CADC, tropical dry forest (TDF), has been largely eliminated.The significantly lesser proportion of forest and greater percentage of coverage consistent with agriculture and ranching implicate land use conversion, specifically deforestation for agricultural expansion and cattle ranching, in shaping CADC land coverage. The process began in the mid-1800s when small-scale agriculturalists migrated to the region followed by large-scale export crop and beef production, primarily for international markets. Deforestation peaked after WWII, concluding by the 1990s with the conversion of most woodlands. Similar patterns now threaten forests along the Caribbean coast.Traditional land use practices cannot sustain local communities or preserve the resource base, thereby contributing to rural outmigration. Adopting sustainable practices and promoting livelihoods strategies leading to forest regeneration will be fundamental for CC adaptation in the CADC.

TI  - Influence of ENSO on the upper basin of Neuquen river hydrometeorology
T2  - GEOGRAFICANDO
M3  - Article
AB  - The ocean-atmosphere interaction acts as a force for hydrological systems at different time scales, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) being one of them. This paper presents the analysis of hydrometeorological variables and their association with the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), representative of ENSO, in the Upper Basin of Neuquen River (UBNR) for the period 2000-2014; detecting a weak correlation (r of 0,35). Precipitation, temperature and SWE presented weak and moderate associations, with a r lower than 0.44, 0.23 and 0.36 respectively, without a defined behavior for the different phases of ENSO; while the SCA presented a very weak correlation, between -0.07 and 0.14. Correlation between the flow and the ONI was 0.51 for the entire period and 0,31 for the El Nino phases with a 5% of significance, without being significant for La Nina periods.

TI  - Why the paradigm of work-family conflict is no longer sustainable: Towards more empowering social imaginaries to understand women's identities
T2  - GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The paradigm of work-family conflict is challenged by the fluid realities of the actual world. Through an innovative phenomenographic study of women's understanding of their lives, we show that the social imaginary of work-family conflict assumes that vulnerability is a constitutive reality for women. Consequently, with respect to the perspectives through which women are invited to make sense of their lives, the metaphor of conflict enforces a worldview based on traditional gender roles. Organizational policies that rely heavily on a social imaginary of work-family conflict may prove ineffective. On the one hand, they ignore the diversity of morphologies and vocabularies used by women today to understand themselves in relation to their family and workplace. On the other, work-family conflict arises as a product of policy measures and bureaucratic practices rather than as an experiential reality. Policy statements on work-family conflict have a performative character: they communicate a message about women's social status and identity. Therefore, effective organizational policies should integrate vocabularies and assumptions that make women aware of themselves in a confident manner by relying on social imaginaries that encourage agency and empowered participation in the world.

TI  - Determination of the Long-Term Ground Surface Displacements Using a PSI Technique-Case Study on Wrocaw (Poland)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wrocaw is a major city located in the southwestern part of Poland in an aseismic tectonic fault zone. Slow, long-term, vertical displacements have been observed there from the 1930s based on the levelling network measurements with the use of a precise levelling method. Due to the high cost of classic surveys, these were performed at intervals of several decades and the most recent measurement of ground surface displacement was performed in 1999. The main aim of this study is to determine the ground surface displacements on the area of Wrocaw in the 1995-2019 period, the spatio-temporal analysis of deformations and the identification of the potential factors causing these deformations. To determine the ground movements, an advanced PSI technique and data from ERS-2, Envisat, and Sentinel-1 sensors were used. Application of SAR technology for the first time in this area, provided new knowledge about the process of deformation in short time intervals over the entire area of the city. The results verify the hypothesis on the linearity of displacements obtained from historical geodetic observations. The obtained results show that the displacements, which continue to occur in the area of Wrocaw have a cyclic character with 4-5 year long period of subsidence and 2-3 year long periods of stabilization or uplift. The displacement trends indicate that the area of the city gradually subsides in relation to the reference area located on the Fore-Sudetic Block.

TI  - The Clinical Impact of Low-Volume Lymph Nodal Metastases in Early-Stage Cervical Cancer: The Senticol 1 and Senticol 2 Trials
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: With the development of the sentinel node technique in early-stage cervical cancer, it is imperative to define the clinical significance of micrometastases (MICs) and isolated tumor cells (ITCs). Methods: We included all patients who participated in the Senticol 1 and Senticol 2 studies. We analyzed the factors associated with the presence of low-volume metastasis, the oncological outcomes of patients with MIC and ITC and the correlation of recurrences and risk factors. Results: Twenty-four patients (7.5%) had low-volume metastasis. The risk factors associated with the presence of low-volume metastasis were a higher stage (p = 0.02) and major stromal invasion (p = 0.01) in the univariate analysis. The maximum specificity and sensitivity were found at a cutoff of 8 mm of stromal invasion. In multivariate analysis, the higher stage (p = 0.02) and the positive lymphovascular space invasion (p = 0.02) were significantly associated with the MIC and ITC. Patients with low-volume metastasis had similar disease-free survival (DFS) (92.7%) to node-negative patients (93.6%). The addition of adjuvant treatment in presence of low-volume metastasis did not modify the DFS. Conclusions: These results confirm our previous analysis of Senticol 1: the presence of low-volume metastasis did not decrease the DFS in early-stage cervical cancer patients.

TI  - Soil deterioration in the southern Chihuahuan Desert caused by agricultural practices and meteorological events
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semi-arid regions, unregulated land use changes as a result of poor planning, and the expansion of agricultural and livestock activities increase the risk of desertification and other potentially severe environmental impacts. Several consequences of improper land management practices are soil deterioration and erosion, which may be intensified by meteorological events. This paper presents a historical evaluation of the temporal and spatial evolution of soil deterioration in the southern Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. A multi-temporal analysis of the study area during the 1995-2016 period was carried out using satellite data (Landsat series). Two seasons were analyzed to determine the influence of external events such as rainfall and wind: dry and rainy. The identification of soil conditions was based on the Brightness Index (BI) considering the complete satellite data set. The soil conditions were classified into five categories according to their reflectance values: highly deteriorated, deteriorated, in the process of being deteriorated, in good condition and other (clouds, water, non-soil). The change detection maps clearly show a growing trend wherein areas of deteriorated and eroded soil increase over time. Agriculture and strong winds are the two main factors involved in the soil deterioration process of the study region.

TI  - Sentinel-1-Imagery-Based High-Resolution Water Cover Detection on Wetlands, Aided by Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Saline wetlands experience large temporal fluctuations in water supply during the year and are recharged only or mainly through precipitation, meaning they are vulnerable to climate-change-induced aridification. Most passive satellite sensors are unsuitable for continuous wetland monitoring due to cloud cover and their relatively low temporal resolution. However, active satellite sensors such as the C-band synthetic aperture radar of Sentinel-1 satellites offer free, cloud-independent data. We examined surface water cover changes from October 2014 to November 2018 in the strictly protected area (13,000 ha) of the Upper-Kiskunsag Alkaline Lakes region in the Danube-Tisza Interfluve in Hungary, with the aim of helping with nature protection planning. Changes and sensitivity can be defined based on the knowledge of variability. We developed a method for water cover detection based on automatic classification, applying the so-called WEKA K-Means clustering algorithm. For satellite data processing and analysis, we used the Google Earth Engine cloud processing platform. In terms of validation, we compared our results with the multispectral Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere reflectance images using a threshold-based binary classifier (receiver operator characteristics) for the MNDWI data. Using two completely distinct methods operating in distinct wavelength ranges, we obtained adequately matching results, with Spearman's correlation coefficients (rho) ranging from 0.54 to 0.80.

TI  - Analysis of Surface Reflectance Retrieval Over Four Typical Surfaces Via Gaofen-1 Satellite WFV4 Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a basis for the quantitative application of satellite remote sensing, surface reflectance can be retrieved through atmospheric correction methods. Currently, most studies have focused on developing or comparing atmospheric correction methods. However, few studies have quantitatively analyzed the effects of input parameters in an atmospheric correction method on retrieved surface reflectance. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the calibration coefficient, aerosol optical depth (AOD), aerosol type, and satellite zenith angle over four typical surfaces using wide field-of-view sensor four data of the Gao Fen-1 satellite. The results showed that (1) the relative errors of shrub, corn, grass, and soil reflectance increased as the calibration coefficient error increased; (2) the calibration coefficient, AOD, aerosol type, and satellite zenith angle affected corn reflectance retrieval the most, whereas they had the smallest effect on soil reflectance retrieval; and (3) the accuracy of the satellite zenith angle on the retrieved surface reflectance was the least pronounced, whereas the accuracy of aerosol type was the most pronounced.

TI  - Efficacy of Spatial Land Change Modeler as a forecasting indicator for anthropogenic change dynamics over five decades: A case study of Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary, Gujarat, India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic impacts cause Land use and land cover (LULC) changes that adversely disturb the protected area's (PA). A quantitative evaluation of historical and future LULC changes over 50 years (1999-2049) in a highly exploited Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS), Gujarat, India is the primary objective of this study. Maximum likelihood classification (MLC) - a supervised classification technique was applied to classify LULC using Landsat 1999, 2009, and 2019 imagery. Land Change Modeler (LCM) embedded in IDRISI Terrset version 18.21 software incorporated with Multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and Markov chain with eight driver variables has been the centre for LULC monitoring, change assessment and future predictions. Classified LULC map for the year 1999, 2009 and 2019 show an overall accuracy with Kappa coefficient of 0.9879, 0.9625 and 0.9381 was 99.08%, 97.58% and 95.45% respectively. During 1999-2019, vegetation cover decreased from 29389.50 ha to 21207.35 ha while agricultural land increased from 28479.18 ha to 31920.66 ha respectively. The kappa indices (Kno, Klocation, and Kstandard) values are 0.9992, 0.9703, and 0.9493, respectively. The projected LULC map for 2029, 2039, and 2049 depicts that the vegetation cover will further degrade, while agricultural land would be increased. Overall, the study reveals that the anthropogenic interventions and intents would increase in the upcoming future, which will severely disturb the integrity of a diversity rich PA. This integrated approach of LULC modeling and remote sensing offers a reliable method for SWS management and planning; it recommends taking a few regulatory steps to moderate human-induced disturbances in SWS.

TI  - Modelling High-Resolution Actual Evapotranspiration through Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 Data Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 satellite constellation contains most of the spatial, temporal and spectral characteristics required for accurate, field-scale actual evapotranspiration (ET) estimation. The one remaining major challenge is the spatial scale mismatch between the thermal-infrared observations acquired by the Sentinel-3 satellites at around 1 km resolution and the multispectral shortwave observations acquired by the Sentinel-2 satellite at around 20 m resolution. In this study we evaluate a number of approaches for bridging this gap by improving the spatial resolution of the thermal images. The resulting data is then used as input into three ET models, working under different assumptions: TSEB, METRIC and ESVEP. Latent, sensible and ground heat fluxes as well as net radiation produced by the models at 20 m resolution are validated against observations coming from 11 flux towers located in various land covers and climatological conditions. The results show that using the sharpened high-resolution thermal data as input for the TSEB model is a sound approach with relative root mean square error of instantaneous latent heat flux of around 30% in agricultural areas. The proposed methodology is a promising solution to the lack of thermal data with high spatio-temporal resolution required for field-scale ET modelling and can fill this data gap until next generation of thermal satellites are launched.

TI  - Importance of Orography for Greenland Cloud and Melt Response to Atmospheric Blocking
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - More frequent high pressure conditions associated with atmospheric blocking episodes over Greenland in recent decades have been suggested to enhance melt through large-scale subsidence and cloud dissipation, which allows more solar radiation to reach the ice sheet surface. Here we investigate mechanisms linking high pressure circulation anomalies to Greenland cloud changes and resulting cloud radiative effects, with a focus on the previously neglected role of topography. Using reanalysis and satellite data in addition to a regional climate model, we show that anticyclonic circulation anomalies over Greenland during recent extreme blocking summers produce cloud changes dependent on orographic lift and descent. The resulting increased cloud cover over northern Greenland promotes surface longwave warming, while reduced cloud cover in southern and marginal Greenland favors surface shortwave warming. Comparison with an idealized model simulation with flattened topography reveals that orographic effects were necessary to produce area-averaged decreasing cloud cover since the mid-1990s and the extreme melt observed in the summer of 2012. This demonstrates a key role for Greenland topography in mediating the cloud and melt response to large-scale circulation variability. These results suggest that future melt will depend on the pattern of circulation anomalies as well as the shape of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

TI  - Monitoring Water-Related Ecosystems with Earth Observation Data in Support of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 Reporting
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lack of national data on water-related ecosystems is a major challenge to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 targets by 2030. Monitoring surface water extent, wetlands, and water quality from space can be an important asset for many countries in support of SDG 6 reporting. We demonstrate the potential for Earth observation (EO) data to support country reporting for SDG Indicator 6.6.1, 'Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time' and identify important considerations for countries using these data for SDG reporting. The spatial extent of water-related ecosystems, and the partial quality of water within these ecosystems is investigated for seven countries. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 5, 7, and 8 with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) are used to measure surface water extent at 250 m and 30 m spatial resolution, respectively, in Cambodia, Jamaica, Peru, the Philippines, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia. The extent of mangroves is mapped at 30 m spatial resolution using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-1, and SRTM data for Jamaica, Peru, and Senegal. Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A imagery, total suspended solids and chlorophyll-a are mapped over time for a select number of large surface water bodies in Peru, Senegal, and Zambia. All of the EO datasets used are of global coverage and publicly available at no cost. The temporal consistency and long time-series of many of the datasets enable replicability over time, making reporting of change from baseline values consistent and systematic. We find that statistical comparisons between different surface water data products can help provide some degree of confidence for countries during their validation process and highlight the need for accuracy assessments when using EO-based land change data for SDG reporting. We also raise concern that EO data in the context of SDG Indicator 6.6.1 reporting may be more challenging for some countries, such as small island nations, than others to use in assessing the extent of water-related ecosystems due to scale limitations and climate variability. Country-driven validation of the EO data products remains a priority to ensure successful data integration in support of SDG Indicator 6.6.1 reporting. Multi-country studies such as this one can be valuable tools for helping to guide the evolution of SDG monitoring methodologies and provide a useful resource for countries reporting on water-related ecosystems. The EO data analyses and statistical methods used in this study can be easily replicated for country-driven validation of EO data products in the future.

T2  - NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine spatial and temporal variability in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), snow cover and land surface temperature (LST) in Himachal Pradesh between 2001 and 2017 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets. Mann-Kendall trend tests and Sen's slope estimates indicate increasing NDVI trends during the postmonsoon period. Increasing snow cover trend is observed during winter and premonsoon whereas decreasing annual LST trends are observed for Himachal Pradesh. Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) indicate a strong positive correlation between NDVI and LST (PCC = .808) and strong negative correlation between LST and snow cover (PCC = -.809) and NDVI and snow cover (PCC = -.838). Coefficient of determination greater than .90, between MODIS LST and snow cover observations and weather station records, indicate fair representation of ground conditions using the MODIS dataset. Low (2.4 degrees C/1,000 m) and steep (7.1 degrees C/1,000 m) temperature lapse rate is observed during monsoon and winter, respectively.

TI  - Ground Deformation in The Ciloto Landslides Area Revealed by Multi-Temporal InSAR
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are one of the natural hazards that occur annually in Indonesia. A continuous geodetic observation in the landslide prone area is essential to support the precautionary measures. Because of its hilly topography, torrential rainfall and landslide history, the Ciloto district in Indonesia has been affected by ground deformation for an extended period of time. The purpose of our study is to detect significant movement and quantify the kinematics of its motion using the Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis and multi-band SAR images. We utilized the small baseline SDFP technique for processing multi-temporal SAR data, comprising ERS1/2 (1998-1999), ALOS PALSAR (2007-2009), and Sentinel-1 (2014-2018). Based on the detected deformation signal in the Ciloto area, the displacement rates are categorized as very slow movements. Two active main landslide zones; the Puncak Pass and the Puncak Highway area, which show the trend of slow movement progressively increasing or descreasing, were detected. The integration of the velocity rate between InSAR results and ground observations (e.g., terrestrial and GPS) was conducted at the Puncak Highway area from the temporal perspective. Using the polynomial model, we estimated that the area had cumulatively displaced up to -42 cm for 25 years and the type of movements varied from single compound to multiple rotational and compound.

TI  - Water Vapor Retrieval From MODIS NIR Channels Using Ground-Based GPS Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel algorithm for water vapor retrieval from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) near-infrared (NIR) channels is proposed in this research. In contrast to conventional retrieval algorithms based on radiative transfer methods, this algorithm uses the empirical regression functions to calculate precipitable water vapor (PWV). In this article, water vapor data observed from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2017, from 464 GPS stations situated in western North America serve as reference data to determine the relationship between the transmittance of the water vapor absorption channels and atmospheric water vapor content. The model is trained on different subsets of the training data through the bootstrap resampling method. Validation results against PWV observations during the period 2010-2017 from five globally distributed GPS stations illustrate that the algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy of MODIS NIR water vapor data, with root-mean-square error (RMSE) reduction of 22.48% from 7.670 to 5.946 mm for two-channel ratio method and 21.69% from 7.670 to 6.006 mm for three-channel ratio method for MODIS/Terra satellite data, and RMSE reduction of 16.42% from 7.191 to 6.010 mm and 15.26% from 7.191 to 6.094 mm for PWV derived from two-channel and three-channel ratio methods from Aqua, respectively, for MODIS/Aqua satellite data.

TI  - Developing a longline/jig sentinel survey program for an area with limited monitoring and fishing efforts
T2  - Aquaculture and Fisheries
M3  - Article
AB  - Areas, such as coastal eastern Gulf of Maine (GOM), perceived to have low density of target fish species and having high density fixed gear, are often subject to low fishing pressure and not well monitored. This can lead to a shortage of information regarding the fine scale dynamics of groundfish populations. Sentinel surveys are commonly developed for such areas with little monitoring and commercial fishing activity as a cost effective way to collect relevant data for monitoring the dynamics of fish stocks. In this study, we outline an approach that utilizes information from other survey programs and pilot study for designing a survey that satisfies both the wish of fishermen participants to contribute their knowledge and experience in determining groundfish abundance and distribution and the statistical rigor required for stock assessments. Through an analysis of spatial and density distribution of groundfish populations based on data from pilot seasons of the sentinel survey and other monitoring programs, we designed a survey that has good spatial and temporal coverage and captures the spatial variability in species composition and size structure of key species. The spatially explicit data collected in the program can contribute to a better understanding of groundfish stock status in the eastern GOM. The approach, although developed for the coastal eastern GOM, is also applicable to other areas with similar issues.

TI  - The Human Spleen in Malaria: Filter or Shelter?
T2  - TRENDS IN PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The human spleen is an immune sentinel and controls red blood cell (RBC) quality. By mechanically retaining subsets of infected RBCs, the spleen may reduce the pace at which the parasite biomass increases before the adaptive immune response operates. Conversely, the spleen may contribute to malaria pathogenesis, particularly anemia that is associated with splenomegaly. Large spleens may also shelter parasites in chronic carriers. Upon treatment with artemisinins, the spleen clears circulating parasites by pitting and releases 'once-infected' RBCs in circulation. This triggers postartesunate delayed hemolysis and explains the long post-treatment positivity of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2)-based dipsticks. Importantly, splenic retention of RBCs also applies to gametocytes, the clearance of which may be enhanced by stiffening them with drugs, a potential way to block malaria transmission.

TI  - A satellite data driven approach to monitoring and reporting fire disturbance and recovery across boreal and temperate forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The regular and consistent measurements provided by Earth observation satellites can support the monitoring and reporting of forest indicators. Although substantial scientific literature espouses the capabilities of satellites in this area, the techniques are under-utilised in national reporting, where there is a preference for aggregating ad hoc data. In this paper, we posit that satellite information, while perhaps of low accuracy at single time steps or across small areas, can produce trends and patterns which are, in fact, more meaningful at regional and national scales. This is primarily due to data consistency over time and space. To investigate this, we use MODIS and Landsat data to explore trends associated with fire disturbance and recovery across boreal and temperate forests worldwide. Our results found that 181 million ha (9 %) of the study area (2 billion ha of forests) was burned between 2001 and 2018, as detected by MODIS satellites. World Wildlife Fund biomes were used for a detailed analysis across several countries. A significant increasing trend in area burned was observed in Mediterranean forests in Chile (8.9 % yr(-1)), while a significant decreasing trend was found in temperate mixed forests in China (-2.2 % yr(-1)). To explore trends and patterns in fire severity and forest recovery, we used Google Earth Engine to efficiently sample thousands of Landsat images from 1991 onwards. Fire severity, as measured by the change in the normalized burn ratio (NBR), was found to be generally stable over time; however, a slight increasing trend was observed in the Russian taiga. Our analysis of spectral recovery following wildfire indicated that it was largely dependent on location, with some biomes (particularly in the USA) showing signs that spectral recovery rates have shortened over time. This study demonstrates how satellite data and cloud-computing can be harnessed to establish baselines and reveal trends and patterns, and improve monitoring and reporting of forest indicators at national and global scales.

TI  - Emission inventories of rice straw open burning in the Red River Delta of Vietnam: Evaluation of the potential of satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Although rice straw open burning is one of the main sources of air pollution in Asian countries, problems remain in collecting the activity data needed to calculate emission inventories. In Vietnam, the results from traditional data collection methods, which are reported by the Vietnam General Statistics Office high levels of uncertainty. This is largely due to a lack of human and financial resources. To improve upon this, this study critically assessed the benefits of incorporating cultivation area data obtained by the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite in combination with crop production records during the period of 2015-2017. The results suggested that incorporating remote sensing data, especially satellite data, into a process-based crop model can improve the spatial distribution of yield estimates. Satellite data for 2018 were also applied to estimate emissions from rice straw open burning in the Red River Delta, Vietnam, for which official statistics are not otherwise yet available. The results show that a total of 3.24 Mt of burnt rice straw produced 3.82 Mt of CO2, 301 Gg of CO, 29.5 Gg of PM10, and 27 Gg of PM2.5. The estimated emission amounts for the common air pollutants SO2, NOx, and NH3 were 583 tonnes, 7.4 Gg, and 13.3 Gg, respectively. Hydrocarbon emissions were 31 Gg for CH4 and 22.7 Gg for NMVOC. The emission of BC, which is one of the main short-lived climate forcers, totalled 1.6 Gg. Based on these results, satellite data demonstrate great potential for estimating emissions from rice croplands, having the advantages of timely availability and cost competitiveness.

TI  - Lake Ice-Water Classification of RADARSAT-2 Images by Integrating IRGS Segmentation with Pixel-Based Random Forest Labeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes to ice cover on lakes throughout the northern landscape has been established as an indicator of climate change and variability, expected to have implications for both human and environmental systems. Monitoring lake ice cover is also required to enable more reliable weather forecasting across lake-rich northern latitudes. Currently, the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) monitors lakes using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical imagery through visual interpretation, with total lake ice cover reported weekly as a fraction out of ten. An automated method of classification would allow for more detailed records to be delivered operationally. In this research, we present an automatic ice-mapping approach which integrates unsupervised segmentation from the Iterative Region Growing using Semantics (IRGS) algorithm with supervised random forest (RF) labeling. IRGS first locally segments homogeneous regions in an image, then merges similar regions into classes across the entire scene. Recently, these output regions were manually labeled by the user to generate ice maps, or were labeled using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Here, three labeling methods (Manual, SVM, and RF) are applied after IRGS segmentation to perform ice-water classification on 36 RADARSAT-2 scenes of Great Bear Lake (Canada). SVM and RF classifiers are also tested without integration with IRGS. An accuracy assessment has been performed on the results, comparing outcomes with author-generated reference data, as well as the reported ice fraction from CIS. The IRGS-RF average classification accuracy for this dataset is 95.8%, demonstrating the potential of this automated method to provide detailed and reliable lake ice cover information operationally.

TI  - Hyperspectral imaging using multivariate analysis for simulation and prediction of agricultural crops in Ningxia, China
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop identification and classification are the basis of fine agricultural development. Hyperspectral remote sensing has been utilized as a cost-efficient approach. Hyperspectral remote sensing data sensing technology has achieved breakthroughs in modern technologies such as long-term dynamic monitoring of crop growth, crop species damage, and acquisition the agricultural information accurately. The novelty of this paper appears in the simulation and prediction of some crops according to wavelength of bands. In the present study, the hyperspectral curves and sensitive bands of 400 samples for four varieties crops (Red medlar or wolfberry, jujube, watermelons and grape) were collected using a hyperspectral instrument. Some multivariate analyses were used for identifying optimal bands, simulation and prediction of different agricultural crops. Principal component analysis (PCA), load coefficient method (LCM), successive projection algorithm (SPA) partial least-squares regression (PLS), and competitive adaptive reweighting sampling (CARS) methods were used to select characteristic wavelengths using Euclidean distance. High value of Euclidean distance was 15.13, 14.095, 16.305 and 14.10 between medlar & jujube, jujube & watermelons, jujube & watermelons and jujube & grape, respectively; it is appears high in CARS among other multivariate analysis. The results show that these characteristic bands can distinguish four kinds of characteristic crops well, but the effect of CARS extraction for selected crops is the best. For prediction of optimal bands, PLS was proven to be the most accurate model of crop prediction, a prediction was developed by applying the CARS-PLS-DA model based on each pixel at the optimal wavelengths. All data and points that selected for wolfberry prediction is very accurate not missing any points for its prediction; on the other hand, foe melon one point of wolfberry appear in the prediction of melon. For Jujube, some points from other crops interface in its prediction; on the other hand grape doesn't miss any points in its prediction. Prediction of selected crops shows that grape and watermelon have the best crops in specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Cross validation and calibration confirm the possibility of hyperspectral imagine for prediction of all crops especially grape and watermelon. Different multivariate analysis proved its ability to identify optimal bands of diffident species of crops under any conditions. The overall results indicated that hyperspectral imaging could be used for crop identification and prediction for effective classification technique.

TI  - Deciding How to Decide: Cultural Theory and Rule Making in Collaborative Watershed Organizations
T2  - POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing field of collaborative governance has long sought to explain processes of collective decision making. Insights from institutional analysis highlight the influence of rules in shaping collective decisions. Yet, less is known about how such rules are created; in other words, how collaborative organizations decide how to decide. By drawing on concepts from Cultural Theory, we examine the connections between worldviews and decision rules across four collaborative watershed organizations in Ohio, United States. Results from this comparative case analysis indicate correlations between the group dimension of worldview and decision rules about choice, as well as between the grid dimension of worldview and two different types of decision rules, choice and aggregation. These results highlight the explanatory value of integrating aspects of Cultural Theory with the Institutional Analysis and Development framework. Results also suggest how governments might more effectively engage with collaborative organizations.

TI  - Accuracies of Soil Moisture Estimations Using a Semi-Empirical Model over Bare Soil Agricultural Croplands from Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes a semi-empirical model developed to estimate volumetric soil moisture (#v) in bare soils during the dry season (March-May) using C-band (5.42 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery acquired from the Sentinel-1 European satellite platform at a 20 m spatial resolution. The semi-empirical model was developed using backscatter coefficient ( dB) and in situ soil moisture collected fromSiruguppa taluk (sub-district) in the Karnataka state of India. The backscatter coefficients VV and VH were extracted from SAR images at 62 geo-referenced locations where ground sampling and volumetric soil moisture were measured at a 10 cm (0-10 cm) depth using a soil core sampler and a standard gravimetric method during the dry months (March-May) of 2017 and 2018. A linear equation was proposed by combining 0 VV and 0 VH to estimate soil moisture. Both localized and generalized linear models were derived. Thirty-nine localized linear models were obtained using the 13 Sentinel-1 images used in this study, considering each polarimetric channel Co-Polarization (VV) and Cross-Polarization (VH) separately, and also their linear combination of VV + VH. Furthermore, nine generalized linear models were derived using all the Sentinel-1 images acquired in 2017 and 2018; three generalized models were derived by combining the two years (2017 and 2018) for each polarimetric channel; and three more models were derived for the linear combination of 0 VV and 0 VH. The above set of equations were validated and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 0.030 and 0.030 for 2017 and 2018, respectively, and 0.02 for the combined years of 2017 and 2018. Both localized and generalized models were compared with in situ data. Both kind of models revealed that the linear combination of 0 VV + 0 VH showed a significantly higher R2 than the individual polarimetric channels.

TI  - Melanocytic tumors with <i>MAP3K8</i> fusions: report of 33 cases with morphological-genetic correlations
T2  - MODERN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We report a series of 33 skin tumors harboring a gene fusion of the MAP3K8 gene, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase. The MAP3K8 fusions were identified by RNA sequencing in 28 cases and by break-apart FISH in five cases. Cases in which fusion genes were fully characterized demonstrated a fusion of the 5MODIFIER LETTER PRIME part of MAP3K8 comprising exons 1-8 in frame to one of several partner genes at the 3MODIFIER LETTER PRIME end. The fusion genes invariably encoded the intact kinase domain of MAP3K8, but not the inhibitory domain at the C-terminus. In 13 (46%) of the sequenced cases, the 3MODIFIER LETTER PRIME fusion partner was SVIL. Other recurrent 3MODIFIER LETTER PRIME partners were DIP2C and UBL3, with additional fusion partners that occurred only in a single tumor. Clinically, the lesions appeared mainly in young adults (2-59 years of age; median = 18), most commonly involving the lower limbs (55%). Five cases were diagnosed as Spitz nevus, 13 as atypical Spitz tumor, and 15 as malignant Spitz tumor. Atypical and malignant cases more commonly occurred in younger patients. Atypical Spitz tumors and malignant Spitz tumors cases tended to show epidermal ulceration (32%), a dermal component with giant multinucleated cells (32%), and clusters of pigmented cells in the dermis (32%). Moreover, in atypical and malignant cases, a frequent inactivation of CDKN2A (21/26; 77%) was identified either by p16 immunohistochemistry, FISH, or comparative genomic hybridization. Gene expression analysis revealed that MAP3K8 expression levels were significantly elevated compared to a control group of 57 Spitz lesions harboring other known kinase fusions. Clinical follow-up revealed regional nodal involvement in two of six cases, in which sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed but no distant metastatic disease after a median follow-up time of 6 months.

TI  - Influence of Satellite Observation Angle to Tropical Cyclone Intensity Estimation Using the Deviation Angle Variance Technique
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The deviation angle variance (DAV) method was developed to objectively estimate tropical cyclone (TC) intensity from geostationary infrared (IR) brightness temperature data. Here, we demonstrate that improvements of 25% root mean square error (RMSE) in major hurricane intensity estimation (relative to best track) can be obtained by considering the pixel-by-pixel satellite view angle in the estimation. Using data from the Chinese Fengyun 2E and 2F satellites for Super Typhoon Soudelor (2015), we demonstrate how the satellite observation angle can reduce the accuracy of intensity estimation, especially for the strongest TCs. Based on these results, an improved DAV estimator is developed using 12 years (2004-2015) of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-East satellite IR images over the North Atlantic basin.

TI  - Retrieval of Sea Surface Wind Fields Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate sea surface wind field (SSWF) information plays an important role in marine environmental monitoring, weather forecasting, and other atmospheric science studies. In this study, a piecewise linear model is proposed to retrieve SSWF information based on the combination of two different satellite sensors (a microwave scatterometer and an infrared scanning radiometer). First, the time series wind speed dataset, extracted from the HY-2A satellite, and the brightness temperature dataset, extracted from the FY-2E satellite, were matched. The piecewise linear regression model with the highest R-2 was then selected as the best model to retrieve SSWF information. Finally, experiments were conducted with the Usagi, Fitow, and Nari typhoons in 2013 to evaluate accuracy. The results show that: (1) the piecewise linear model is successfully established for all typhoons with high R-2 (greater than 0.61); (2) for all three cases, the root mean square error () and mean bias error (MBE) are smaller than 2.2 m/s and 1.82 m/s, which indicates that it is suitable and reliable for SSWF information retrieval; and (3) it solves the problem of the low temporal resolution of HY-2A data (12 h), and inherits the high temporal resolution of the FY-2E data (0.5 h). It can provide reliable and high temporal SSWF products.

TI  - Mapping the Global Mangrove Forest Aboveground Biomass Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forest ecosystems are distributed at the land-sea interface in tropical and subtropical regions and play an important role in carbon cycles and biodiversity. Accurately mapping global mangrove aboveground biomass (AGB) will help us understand how mangrove ecosystems are affected by the impacts of climatic change and human activities. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) techniques have been proven to accurately capture the three-dimensional structure of mangroves and LiDAR can estimate forest AGB with high accuracy. In this study, we produced a global mangrove forest AGB map for 2004 at a 250-m resolution by combining ground inventory data, spaceborne LiDAR, optical imagery, climate surfaces, and topographic data with random forest, a machine learning method. From the published literature and free-access datasets of mangrove biomass, we selected 342 surface observations to train and validate the mangrove AGB estimation model. Our global mangrove AGB map showed that average global mangrove AGB density was 115.23 Mg/ha, with a standard deviation of 48.89 Mg/ha. Total global AGB storage within mangrove forests was 1.52 Pg. Cross-validation with observed data demonstrated that our mangrove AGB estimates were reliable. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 0.48 and 75.85 Mg/ha, respectively. Our estimated global mangrove AGB storage was similar to that predicted by previous remote sensing methods, and remote sensing approaches can overcome overestimates from climate-based models. This new biomass map provides information that can help us understand the global mangrove distribution, while also serving as a baseline to monitor trends in global mangrove biomass.

TI  - The Capability of Integrating Optical and Microwave Data for Detecting Soil Moisture in an Oasis Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the earth ecosystem, surface soil moisture is an important factor in the process of energy exchange between land and atmosphere, which has a strong control effect on land surface evapotranspiration, water migration, and carbon cycle. Soil moisture is particularly important in an oasis region because of its fragile ecological environment. Accordingly, a soil moisture retrieval model was conducted based on Dubois model and ratio model. Based on the Dubois model, the in situ soil roughness was used to simulate the backscattering coefficient of bare soil, and the empirical relationship was established with the measured soil moisture. The ratio model was used to eliminate the backscattering contribution of vegetation, in which three vegetation indices were used to characterize vegetation growth. The results were as follows: (1) the Dubois model was used to calibrate the unknown parameters of the ratio model and verified the feasibility of the ratio model to simulate the backscattering coefficient. (2) All three vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Vegetation Water Content (VWC), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)) can represent the scattering characteristics of vegetation in an oasis region, but the VWC vegetation index is more suitable than the others. (3) Based on the Dubois model and ratio model, the soil moisture retrieval model was conducted, and the in situ soil moisture was used to analyze the accuracy of the simulated soil moisture, which found that the soil moisture retrieval accuracy is the highest under VWC vegetation index, and the coefficient of determination is 0.76. The results show that the soil moisture retrieval model conducted on the Dubois model and ratio model is feasible.

TI  - Measurement of Cloud Top Height: Comparison of MODIS and Ground-Based Millimeter Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud top height (CTH) is an essential pareter for the general circulation model in understanding the impact of clouds on the Earth's radiation budget and global climate change. This paper compares the CTH products, derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), onboard the Aqua and Terra satellites with ground-based Ka band radar data in Beijing from 2014 to 2017. The aim was to investigate the data accuracy and the difference in CTH measurements between passive satellite data and active ground-based radar data. The results show that MODIS, on average, underestimates CTH relative to radar by -1.08 +/- 2.48 km, but with a median difference of -0.65 km and about 48% of differences are within 1 km. Statistically, MODIS CTHs which are greater than 6 km show lower discrepancy to radar CTH than those of MODIS CTHs less than 4 km. The CTH difference is independent of cloud fraction and cloud layer. It shows strong dependence on cloud depth, decreasing as cloud depth increases. There is a tendency for MODIS to underestimate high thin clouds but overestimate low thin clouds relative to radar. Total ozone, SO2, CO, NO2, aerosol PM10, total water vapor and temperature inversion show unobvious influences in the CTH discrepancy. It is shown that the MODIS CO2-slicing technique performs much better than IRW (infrared window) technique when cloud layer is higher than 2 km. The average difference calculated from all comparisons by CO2-slicing technique and IRW technique is 0.09 +/- 1.58 km, and -2.20 +/- 2.73 km, respectively.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Mapping Using Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Imagery and Four Classification Methods-A Case Study from Dak Nong, Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on land use and land cover (LULC) including forest cover is important for the development of strategies for land planning and management. Satellite remotely sensed data of varying resolutions have been an unmatched source of such information that can be used to produce estimates with a greater degree of confidence than traditional inventory estimates. However, use of these data has always been a challenge in tropical regions owing to the complexity of the biophysical environment, clouds, and haze, and atmospheric moisture content, all of which impede accurate LULC classification. We tested a parametric classifier (logistic regression) and three non-parametric machine learning classifiers (improved k-nearest neighbors, random forests, and support vector machine) for classification of multi-temporal Sentinel 2 satellite imagery into LULC categories in Dak Nong province, Vietnam. A total of 446 images, 235 from the year 2017 and 211 from the year 2018, were pre-processed to gain high quality images for mapping LULC in the 6516 km(2) study area. The Sentinel 2 images were tested and classified separately for four temporal periods: (i) dry season, (ii) rainy season, (iii) the entirety of the year 2017, and (iv) the combination of dry and rainy seasons. Eleven different LULC classes were discriminated of which five were forest classes. For each combination of temporal image set and classifier, a confusion matrix was constructed using independent reference data and pixel classifications, and the area on the ground of each class was estimated. For overall temporal periods and classifiers, overall accuracy ranged from 63.9% to 80.3%, and the Kappa coefficient ranged from 0.611 to 0.813. Area estimates for individual classes ranged from 70 km(2) (1% of the study area) to 2200 km(2) (34% of the study area) with greater uncertainties for smaller classes.

TI  - Integration of Multi-Sensor Data to Estimate Plot-Level Stem Volume Using Machine Learning Algorithms-Case Study of Evergreen Conifer Planted Forests in Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of new methods for estimating precise forest structure parameters is essential for the quantitative evaluation of forest resources. Conventional use of satellite image data, increasing use of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and emerging trends in the use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) highlight the importance of modern technologies in the realm of forest observation. Each technology has different advantages, and this work seeks to incorporate multiple satellite, TLS- and UAS-based remote sensing data sets to improve the ability to estimate forest structure parameters. In this paper, two regression analysis approaches are considered for the estimation: random forest regression (RFR) and support vector regression (SVR). To collect the dependent variable, in situ measurements of individual tree parameters (tree height and diameter at breast height (DBH)) were taken in a Japanese cypress forest using the nondestructive TLS method, which scans the forest to obtain dense and accurate point clouds under the tree canopy. Based on the TLS data, the stem volume was then computed and treated as ground truth information. Topographic and UAS information was then used to calculate various remotely sensed explanatory variables, such as canopy size, canopy cover, and tree height. Canopy cover and canopy shapes were computed via the orthoimages derived from the UAS and watershed segmentation method, respectively. Tree height was computed by combining the digital surface model (DSM) from the UAS and the digital terrain model (DTM) from the TLS data. Topographic variables were computed from the DTM. The backscattering intensity in the satellite imagery was obtained based on L-band (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2)) and C-band (Sentinel-1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR). All satellite (10-25 m resolution), TLS (3.4 mm resolution) and UAS (2.3-4.6 cm resolution) data were then combined, and RFR and SVR were trained; the resulting predictive powers were then compared. The RFR method yielded fitting R-2 up to 0.665 and RMSE up to 66.87 m(3)/ha (rRMSE = 11.95%) depending on the input variables (best result with canopy height, canopy size, canopy cover, and Sentinel-1 data), and the SVR method showed fitting R-2 up to 0.519 and RMSE up to 80.12 m(3)/ha (rRMSE = 12.67%). The RFR outperformed the SVR method, which could delineate the relationship between the variables for better model accuracy. This work has demonstrated that incorporating various remote sensing data to satellite data, especially adding finer resolution data, can provide good estimates of forest parameters at a plot level (10 by 10 m), potentially allowing advancements in precision forestry.

TI  - Mapping Paddy Fields in Japan by Using a Sentinel-1 SAR Time Series Supplemented by Sentinel-2 Images on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy fields play very important environmental roles in food security, water resource management, biodiversity conservation, and climate change. Therefore, reliable broad-scale paddy field maps are essential for understanding these issues related to rice and paddy fields. Here, we propose a novel paddy field mapping method that uses Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series that are robust for cloud cover, supplemented by Sentinel-2 optical images that are more reliable than SAR data for extracting irrigated paddy fields. Paddy fields were provisionally specified by using the Sentinel-1 SAR data and a conventional decision tree method. Then, an additional mask using water and vegetation indexes based on Sentinel-2 optical images was overlaid to remove non-paddy field areas. We used the proposed method to develop a paddy field map for Japan in 2018 with a 30 m spatial resolution. The producer's accuracy of this map (92.4%) for non-paddy reference agricultural fields was much higher than that of a map developed by the conventional method (57.0%) using only Sentinel-1 data. Our proposed method also reproduced paddy field areas at the prefecture scale better than existing paddy field maps developed by a remote sensing approach.

TI  - Neuroendocrine Cancer of the Breast: A Rare Entity
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Neuroendocrine breast cancer (NEBC) is a rare histotype of breast carcinoma that presents, in most cases, positive hormone receptors and negative HER2. Indeed, the analysis of gene expression profiles revealed that NEBC belongs mainly to the luminal subtype. Cases of HER2-positive and triple-negative NEBC are rare. The cardinal treatment of early NEBC is surgery, similar to the treatment of invasive non-special histological type carcinoma. The use of radiotherapy follows the criteria applied in infiltrating breast cancer of non-special histotype. In the post-operative phase, therefore after the surgical treatment of mammary quadrantectomy, or mastectomy associated with homolateral sentinel lymph node removal +/- axillary dissection, based on the histopathological characteristics of the tumor, the use of chemotherapy (anthracycline + taxane) and/or hormone therapy, whether or not associated with anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab) is the rule. Literature data report the use of cisplatin and etoposide, as in small cell lung cancers. Most of the information currently available derive from single case reports or a series of clinical cases; it follows the difficulty of formulating definite recommendations on the correct management of this histological type of breast cancer. This review describes available knowledge on this rare entity to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and offer insights to stimulate exploration of the many aspects still unknown.

TI  - Employing Machine Learning for Detection of Invasive Species using Sentinel-2 and AVIRIS Data: The Case of Kudzu in the United States
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive plants are causing massive economic and environmental troubles for our societies worldwide. The aim of this study is to employ a set of machine learning classifiers for detecting invasive plant species using remote sensing data. The target species is Kudzu vine, which mostly grows in the south-eastern states of the US and quickly outcompetes other plants, making it a relevant and threatening species to consider. Our study area is Atlanta, Georgia and the surrounding area. Five different algorithms: Boosted Logistic Regression (BLR), Naive Bayes (NB), Neural Network (NN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were tested with the aim of testing their performance and identifying the most optimal one. Furthermore, the influence of temporal, spectral and spatial resolution in detecting Kudzu was also tested and reviewed. Our finding shows that random forest, neural network and support vector machine classifiers outperformed. While the achieved internal accuracies were about 97%, an external validation conducted over an expanded area of interest resulted in 79.5% accuracy. Furthermore, the study indicates that high accuracy classification can be achieved using multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery and can be improved while integrating with airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) hyperspectral data. Finally, this study indicates that dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) should be applied cautiously to the hyperspectral AVIRIS data to preserve its utility. The applied approach and the utilized set of methods can be of interest for detecting other kinds of invasive species as part of fulfilling UN sustainable development goals, particularly number 12: responsible consumption and production, 13: climate action, and 15: life on land.

TI  - Race, Caste, and Christianity A Post-Colonial Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MISSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Race and caste are two important historical and social categories that had a significant role during the European colonial period and in the colonies. Christian missionary activities during the colonial period often colluded with the colonial institutions in perpetuating certain accepted worldviews that benefited the colonial authorities. The central argument of this paper is to highlight the impact of a racialized worldview that was prevalent among European colonial powers, its transmission to the colonial context, and its continuing social legacy within Christianity. This paper, through a post-colonial analysis of British mission history and its work in a South Asian context, raises some pertinent questions regarding the tacit role of race and caste in the Christianizing mission. It also argues the need for careful post-colonial analysis of mission practices to challenge reactivation of entrenched structures of discrimination and prejudice.

TI  - Remote estimation of chlorophyll a concentrations over a wide range of optical conditions based on water classification from VIIRS observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimate of surface chlorophyll a concentrations (Chla) by remote sensing presents a number of challenges where inherent and apparent optical properties have significant spatial or temporal variability. Indeed, Chla algorithms for Case 2 waters are often lake or region specific, and they are usually highly sensitive to changes in the dominant chromophoric constituents. This study develops and validates an absorption-specific approach to estimating Chla across an optically heterogeneous dataset. The approach is based on the classification of the optically dominant constituent. We tested this approach with in situ data from Taihu Lake, Poyang Lake, Chaohu Lake, Shitoukoumen Reservoir, Pearl River Estuary and Daya Bay as well as using HydroLight simulated data. The results show an improved performance when compared to most single Chla algorithms. We validated the approach with data from the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Results showed that this absorption-specific approach provided good Chla estimates over clear to very turbid waters with a wide range of optical conditions (R-2 = 0.76, r(RMSE) = 35%, n = 230, p < 0.01).

TI  - Surface Diffuse Solar Radiation Determined by Reanalysis and Satellite over East Asia: Evaluation and Comparison
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, surface diffuse solar radiation (R-dif) has been attracting a growing interest in view of its function in improving plant productivity, thus promoting global carbon uptake, and its impacts on solar energy utilization. To date, very few radiation products provide estimates of R-dif, and systematic validation and evaluation are even more scare. In this study, R-dif estimates from Reanalysis Fifth Generation (ERA5) of European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and satellite-based retrieval (called JiEA) are evaluated over East Asia using ground measurements at 39 stations from World Radiation Data Center (WRDC) and China Meteorological Administration (CMA). The results show that JiEA agrees well with measurements, while ERA5 underestimates R-dif significantly. Both datasets perform better at monthly mean scale than at daily mean and hourly scale. The mean bias error and root-mean-square error of daily mean estimates are -1.21 W/m(2) and 20.06 W/m(2) for JiEA and -17.18 W/m(2) and 32.42 W/m(2) for ERA5, respectively. Regardless of over- or underestimation, correlations of estimated time series of ERA5 and JiEA show high similarity. JiEA reveals a slight decreasing trend at regional scale, but ERA5 shows no significant trend, and neither of them reproduces temporal variability of ground measurements. Data accuracy of ERA5 is more robust than JiEA in time but less in space. Latitudinal dependency is noted for ERA5 while not for JiEA. In addition, spatial distributions of R-dif from ERA5 and JiEA show pronounced discrepancy. Neglect of adjacency effects caused by horizontal photon transport is the main cause for R-dif underestimation of ERA5. Spatial analysis calls for improvements to the representation of clouds, aerosols and water vapor for reproducing fine spatial distribution and seasonal variations of R-dif.

TI  - Radiometric Calibration and Uncertainty Analysis of KOMPSAT-3A Using the Reflectance-Based Method
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, Korea has sustained consistent access to remote sensed data by launching Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-3A (KOMPSAT-3A, K3A)-an updated version of the high-resolution KOMPSAT series. This KOMPSAT-3A required calibration and validation (Cal/Val) before and after its launch to enable proper functional characterization and to maintain the veracity of data collected. The Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) executed the initial prelaunch calibration in the laboratory and we performed the Cal/Val of KOMPSAT-3A during the Launch and Early Operation Phase (LEOP) in the field. Two suitable sites in Korea and Mongolia with stable weather, almost uniform terrain, and near Lambertian diffusion, provided the necessary tarp reflectance to calculate the absolute radiometric calibration coefficients. The surface reflectance was determined using 12 and four well-calibrated reference reflectance tarps employing the FieldSpec((R)) 3(Analytical Spectral Devices Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) Spectroradiometer. Subsequently, the top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance was estimated using radiative transfer code (RTC) software based on the Atmospheric and Topographic Correction (ATCOR). In addition, cross calibration was simultaneously performed at the Libya-4 pseudo invariant calibration site (PICS) for KOMPSAT-3A TOA radiance, using the spectral band adjustment factor (SBAF) compensated Landsat 8 reflectance and the Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) to compute cross calibration coefficients. The results of the KOMPSAT-3A absolute calibration coefficient show that the R-2 values were over 0.99, implying a significant correlation for almost all bands between the TOA radiance and the KOMPSAT-3A spectral band response at both campaign sites. However, this study reveals a difference of less than 5% calibration gains for all bands compared to the prelaunch values, while the cross calibration gain is below 5% in visible bands and above 5% in the near infrared band. An effort to optimize the reliability of the absolute calibration coefficients resorted to the rigorous quantification of uncertainties amongst atmospheric conditions, the digital number (DN), the reflectance tarp, the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), and ozone levels. Therefore, we presumed that the total uncertainty was 4.27%, which conforms to some published results.

TI  - Toward a Standardized Encoding of Remote Sensing Geo-Positioning Sensor Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geolocation information is an important feature of remote sensing image data that is captured through a variety of passive or active observation sensors, such as push-broom electro-optical sensor, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and sound navigation and ranging (SONAR). As a fundamental processing step to locate an image, geo-positioning is used to determine the ground coordinates of an object from image coordinates. A variety of sensor models have been created to describe geo-positioning process. In particular, Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has defined the Sensor Model Language (SensorML) specification in its Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) initiative to describe sensors including the geo-positioning process. It has been realized using syntax from the extensible markup language (XML). Besides, two standards defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ISO 19130-1 and ISO 19130-2, introduced a physical sensor model, a true replacement model, and a correspondence model for the geo-positioning process. However, a standardized encoding for geo-positioning sensor models is still missing for the remote sensing community. Thus, the interoperability of remote sensing data between application systems cannot be ensured. In this paper, a standardized encoding of remote sensing geo-positioning sensor models is introduced. It is semantically based on ISO 19130-1 and ISO 19130-2, and syntactically based on OGC SensorML. It defines a cross mapping of the sensor models defined in ISO 19130-1 and ISO 19130-2 to the SensorML, and then proposes a detailed encoding method to finalize the XML schema (an XML schema here is the structure to define an XML document), which will become a profile of OGC SensorML. It seamlessly unifies the sensor models defined in ISO 19130-1, ISO 19130-2, and OGC SensorML. By enabling a standardized description of sensor models used to produce remote sensing data, this standard is very promising in promoting data interoperability, mobility, and integration in the remote sensing domain.

TI  - Assimilation of <i>GOES-16</i> Radiances and Retrievals into the Warn-on-Forecast System
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing maturity of the Warn-on-Forecast System (WoFS) coupled with the now operational GOES-16 satellite allows for the first time a comprehensive analysis of the relative impacts of assimilating GOES-16 all-sky 6.2-, 6.9-, and 7.3-mu m channel radiances compared to other radar and satellite observations. The WoFS relies on cloud property retrievals such as cloud water path, which have been proven to increase forecast skill compared to only assimilating radar data and other conventional observations. The impacts of assimilating clear-sky radiances have also been explored and shown to provide useful information on midtropospheric moisture content in the near-storm environment. Assimilation of all-sky radiances adds a layer of complexity and is tested to determine its effectiveness across four events occurring in the spring and summer of 2019. Qualitative and object-based verification of severe weather and the near-storm environment are used to assess the impact of assimilating all-sky radiances compared to the current model configuration. We focus our study through the entire WoFS analysis and forecasting cycle (1900-0600 UTC, daily) so that the impacts throughout the evolution of convection from initiation to large upscale growth can be assessed. Overall, assimilating satellite data improves forecasts relative to radar-only assimilation experiments. The retrieval method with clear-sky radiances performs best overall, but assimilating all-sky radiances does have very positive impacts in certain conditions. In particular, all-sky radiance assimilation improved convective initiation forecast of severe storms in several instances. This work represents an initial attempt at assimilating all-sky radiances into the WoFS and additional research is ongoing to further improve forecast skill.

TI  - Assimilating SMOS Brightness Temperature for Hydrologic Model Parameters and Soil Moisture Estimation with an Immune Evolutionary Strategy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological models play an essential role in data assimilation (DA) systems. However, it is a challenging task to acquire the distributed hydrological model parameters that affect the accuracy of the simulations at a grid scale. Remote sensing data provide an ideal observation for DA to estimate parameters and state variables. In this study, a special assimilation scheme was proposed to jointly estimate parameters and soil moisture (SM) by assimilating brightness temperature (TB) from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. Variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrological model and L-band microwave emission of the biosphere model (L-MEB) are coupled as model and observation operators, respectively. The scheme combines two stages of estimators, one for the static model parameters and the other for the dynamic state variables. The estimators approximate the posterior probability distribution of an unknown target through sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and immune evolution strategy are embedded in both stages to solve particle impoverishment problems. To evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme, the estimated SM sets are compared with in-situ observations and SMOS products in Maqu on the Tibetan Plateau. Specifically, the root mean square error decreased from 0.126 to 0.087 m(3)m(-3) for surface SM, with a slight impact on the root zone. The temporal correlation between DA results and in-situ measurements increased to 0.808 and 0.755 for surface SM (+0.057) and root zone SM (+0.040), respectively. The results demonstrate that assimilating TB has tremendous potential as an approach to improve the estimation of distributed model parameters and SMs of surface and root zone at a grid scale, and the immune evolution strategy is effective for increasing the accuracy of approximation in sampling.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of the Multiple Quantile Regression Model for Estimating Spatial Soil Moisture after Filtering Soil Moisture Outliers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of soil moisture (SM) was estimated by a multiple quantile regression (MQR) model with Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and filtered SM data from 2013 to 2015 in South Korea. For input data, observed precipitation and SM data were collected from the Korea Meteorological Administration and various institutions monitoring SM. To improve the work of a previous study, prior to the estimation of SM, outlier detection using the isolation forest (IF) algorithm was applied to the observed SM data. The original observed SM data resulted in IF_SM data following outlier detection. This study obtained an average data removal rate of 20.1% at 58 stations. For various reasons, such as instrumentation, environment, and random errors, the original observed SM data contained approximately 20% uncertain data. After outlier detection, this study performed a regression analysis by estimating land surface temperature quantiles. The soil characteristics were considered through reclassification into four soil types (clay, loam, silt, and sand), and the five-day antecedent precipitation was considered in order to estimate the regression coefficient of the MQR model. For all soil types, the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) values ranged from 0.25 to 0.77 and 1.86% to 12.21%, respectively. The MQR results showed a much better performance than that of the multiple linear regression (MLR) results, which yielded R-2 and RMSE values of 0.20 to 0.66 and 1.08% to 7.23%, respectively. As a further illustration of improvement, the box plots of the MQR SM were closer to those of the observed SM than those of the MLR SM. This result indicates that the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of MQR SM matched the CDF of the observed SM. Thus, the MQR algorithm with outlier detection can overcome the limitations of the MLR algorithm by reducing both the bias and variance.

TI  - The Impact of Reforestation Induced Land Cover Change (1990-2017) on Flood Peak Discharge Using HEC-HMS Hydrological Model and Satellite Observations: A Study in Two Mountain Basins, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the effect of land use and land cover (LULC) type change on watershed hydrological response is essential for adopting applicable measures to control floods. In China, the Grain to Green Program (GTGP) and the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) have had a substantial impact on LULC. We investigate the effect of these conservation efforts on flood peak discharge in two mountainous catchments. We used a series of Landsat images ranging from 1990 to 2016/2017 to evaluate the LULC changes. Further to this, the hydrological responses at the basin and sub-basin scale were generated by the Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) under four LULC scenarios. Between 1990 and 2016/2017, both catchments experienced an increase in forest and urban land by 18% and 2% in Yanhe and by 16% and 8% in Guangyuan, respectively. In contrast, the agricultural land decreased by approximately 30% in Yanhe and 24% in Guangyuan, respectively. The changes in land cover resulted in decrease in flood peak discharge ranging from 14% in Yanhe to 6% in Guangyuan. These findings provide a better understanding on the impact of reforestation induced LULC change on spatial patterns of typical hydrological responses of mountainous catchment and could help to mitigate flash flood hazards in other mountainous regions.

TI  - Detecting changes in multitemporal multispectral Landsat images using spatial frequency-based undecimated wavelet transform fusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in surface water are normally detected by extracting the water features from individual multispectral (MS) images. We present an approach based on pixel fusion of MS and panchromatic (PAN) bands of multitemporal Landsat images to detect the changes in surface water. Spatial frequency and the maximum amplitude selection-based fusion rule on multi-resolution undecimated wavelet transform (UDWT) coefficients for extracting and injecting the spatial and spectral content from MS and PAN images is introduced. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) of 2010 and 2000 images acquired from the US Geological Survey were fused to investigate the potential of the proposed spatial frequency-based UDWT in highlighting the changes. Various component substitution and multi-resolution analysis-based fusion algorithms were also applied. It was observed that UDWT with spatial frequency effectively extracts the spectral information from MS images and the spatial information from PAN images. The performance was evaluated based on visual interpretation and spatial and spectral quality assessment metrics. A high correlation coefficient (0.9992), high contrast similarity (0.99937), high structural similarity index measure (0.9884), less relative average spectral error (23.6426), less root mean squared error (2.2256), relatively less blind referenceless image spatial quality evaluator, natural image quality evaluator, and perception-based image quality evaluator significantly support the proposed fusion technique in yielding the pansharpened image, making it more suitable for detecting the multitemporal changes in remote sensing applications.

M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide, a disturbance in the slope stability causing alteration in the slope profile can be triggered by nature or anthropogenic activities. It is important to monitor the landslide spots so that the devastating effects in resources, human life and economy can be minimized. This paper analyses landslide disasters in Devikulam taluk of Idukki district, Kerala with SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) Interferometry technique considering the torrential rainfall of 2018 (June -August) using Sentinel-1 C band (5.36 GHz) SAR data. Fourteen ground truth landslide locations coincided with interferogram observations. On the CartoDEM derived slope, 22 slides were observed to be located in steep slope, 5 slides in moderate slope and Polinjapalam slide was located in rolling terrain. The overall accuracy of the study in preliminary detection of landslides through the interferogram was computed to be 48.72 %. The vertical displacement was quantified in the range -0.755 m to-0.008 m proving the technique is effective.

TI  - High Aperture Efficiency Array Antenna for Wireless Power Transfer Applications
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a novel array antenna with high aperture efficiency by employing an array element operating in a high-order mode to improve the transmission efficiency of wireless power transmission applications. The proposed array element, operating at a frequency of 5.8 GHz, consists of a square patch with four metallic shorting pins, an extended cavity, and a high dielectric superstrate. The four metallic shorting pins derive the high-order operation, which can enhance the bore-sight gain, resulting in the high aperture efficiency of the array. The extended cavity structure can help further improvement the aperture efficiency and minimize the mutual coupling strength between adjacent elements. The proposed antenna element is extended to 2 x 2 and 4 x 4 arrays, resulting in aperture efficiencies of 74.2% and 80.5%, respectively. For the 2 x 2 array, maximum measured gains of 19.9 dBi in the zx-plane and 18.8 dBi in the zy-plane are observed. For the 4 x 4 array, the maximum measured gains of 24.3 dBi in the zx-plane and 24.5 dBi in the zy-plane are obtained in a full-anechoic chamber. Finally, the transmission efficiency of 6% with a distance of 0.8 m between the transmitter (Tx) and the receiver (Rx) is measured when setting up the wireless power transfer system, which consists of the Tx with the proposed 4 x 4 array and the Rx with a single element.

TI  - Performance Analysis of Open Source Time Series InSAR Methods for Deformation Monitoring over a Broader Mining Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time Series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (TSInSAR) methods have been widely and successfully applied for spatiotemporal ground deformation monitoring. The main groups of methodological approaches are often referred to as Persistent Scatterer (PS), Small Baseline (SB), and hybrid approaches that incorporate PS and SB concepts. While TSInSAR techniques have long been able to provide accurate deformation rates for various applications, their corresponding performance in complex environments such as mining areas has to be investigated. This study focuses on comparing the performance of three open source TSInSAR toolboxes (Stamps, Giant, Mintpy) over an extended region that includes an active opencast coal mine. We present the deformation results of each TSInSAR method on a Sentinel-1 dataset of 125 acquisitions spanning around 2.5 years over the Ptolemaida-Florina coal mine site that is characterized by several environmental and surface deformation conditions. First, a cross-comparison analysis is presented over different land cover classes. The study shows that all TSInSAR methods are capable for generating similar ground deformation results when the area has stable ground scattering conditions and the dataset sufficient temporal sampling. The most controversial results between TSInSAR approaches were found in land cover classes that include medium to high vegetation. An external comparative analysis between the different results from TSInSAR methods and leveling measurements is also performed. Stamps approach presented the best agreement with the in-situ deformation rates. The Giant approach yielded the best cumulative deformation results due to our a priori knowledge of temporal behavior of deformation in the vicinity of the leveling locations. Finally, we discuss the main pros and cons of each TSInSAR approach and we highlight the importance of comparison analysis that can provide insights and can lead to better interpretation of the results.

TI  - Democratic Republic of the Congo Tropical Forest Canopy Height and Aboveground Biomass Estimation with Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Airborne LiDAR Data: The Effect of Seasonal Landsat Image Selection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inventories of tropical forest aboveground biomass (AGB) are often imprecise and sparse. Increasingly, airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and satellite optical wavelength sensor data are used to map tree height and to estimate AGB. In the tropics, cloud cover is particularly prevalent and so several years of satellite observations must be considered. This may reduce mapping accuracy because of seasonal and inter-annual changes in the forest reflectance. In this paper, the sensitivity of airborne LiDAR and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) based dominant canopy height and AGB 30 m mapping is assessed with respect to the season of Landsat acquisition for a similar to 10,000 Km(2) tropical forest area in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A random forest regression estimator is used to predict and assess the 30 m dominant canopy height using LiDAR derived test and training data. The AGB is mapped using an allometric model parameterized with the dominant canopy height and is assessed by comparison with field based 30 m AGB estimates. Experiments are undertaken independently using (i) only a wet season Landsat-8 image, (ii) only a dry season Landsat-8 image, and (iii) both Landsat-8 images. At the study area level there is little reported sensitivity to the season of Landsat image used. The mean dominant canopy height and AGB values are similar between seasons, within 0.19 m and 5 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The mapping results are improved when both Landsat-8 images are used with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values that correspond to 18.8% of the mean study area mapped tree height (20.4 m) and to 41% of the mean study area mapped AGB (204 Mg ha(-1)). The mean study area mapped AGB is similar to that reported in other Congo Basin forest studies. The results of this detailed study are illustrated and the implications for tropical forest tree height and AGB mapping are discussed.

TI  - Contrasted Contribution of Intraseasonal Time Scales to Surface Chlorophyll Variations in a Bloom and an Oligotrophic Regime
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding long-term variations of ocean ecosystems requires untangling the time scales involved in their natural fluctuations. We applied a temporal decomposition procedure to two decades of satellite ocean color observations to characterize the time variability of surface chlorophyll-a (SChl) in the Mediterranean Sea. In order to assess the reliability of the satellite data at capturing intraseasonal, seasonal, and interannual variability, we first show that satellite SChl data compare well with field data of chlorophyll-a fluorescence from the long-term BOUSSOLE time series, at all three time scales. The decomposition procedure is then applied to satellite SChl and to mixing-layer depth (MxLD) data from an ocean reanalysis, both at the scale of the entire Mediterranean Sea. Our results reveal similar amplitude for the seasonal and intraseasonal SChl variations in the northwestern bloom region, together explaining about 90% of the SChl variance. Coherent seasonal SChI variations occur at the scale of the bloom region (similar to 400 km) and are tightly connected with seasonal MxLD changes. Intraseasonal SChl fluctuations occur at smaller spatial scales (similar to 100 km), suggesting they would he generated by storms although they weakly correlate to variations of the MxLD reanalysis. Over the oligotrophic part of the Mediterranean Sea, about 80% of the variability in both SChl and MxLD are explained by basin-scale (similar to 1,000 km) seasonal variations. Intraseasonal variability occurs at much smaller spatial scales, typical of mesoscale activity (similar to 30 km). These results support the hypothesis that seasonal SChI variations are driven by changes in MxLD, while mesoscale activity and storms drive the intraseasonal SChl fluctuations.Plain Language Summary In the context of our changing climate, an ongoing challenge is to be able to reliably detect and attribute trends in ocean color records of surface chlorophyll-a (SChl), which is the only observable variable representative of the state of marine ecosystem available at global scale. However, the magnitude of the natural variability of SChl is much stronger than that of the SChl long-term trend. Furthermore, this natural variability occurs over a large range of unrelated time scales, making it difficult to detect and attribute a climate-driven trend. Here we focus on the variability over temporal scales that have been overlooked because their observation requires continuous measurements, that is, fluctuations that are shorter than seasonal ones. In the case of the Mediterranean Sea, we show that such intraseasonal variations can be as large as seasonal ones and that they may also be less predictable because they likely ensue from processes such as storms or ocean eddies.

TI  - Calibrating land hydrological models and enhancing their forecasting skills using an ensemble Kalman filter with one-step-ahead smoothing
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The abundance of satellite remotely sensed data in the past few decades has provided a great opportunity to improve hydrological models' simulations and their forecasting skills. This, however, requires an advanced data integration strategy, which is usually implemented using a data assimilation approach. In this study, a recently proposed assimilation method, the Unsupervised Weak Constrained Ensemble Kalman Filter (UWCEnKF), is extended to calibrate model parameters simultaneously with the state. The derivation of the new method is based on a One-Step-Ahead (OSA) smoothing formulation of the standard joint state-parameter filtering problem, which results in a dual-type filtering scheme separately updating the state and parameters using two interactive Ensemble Kalman Filters (EnKFs). The new calibration and assimilation method comprises three main steps at each assimilation cycle: (1) calibrate the parameters based on the observations, (2) update the system state based on the calibrated parameters and observations, and (3) enforce the water budget constraint. Numerical experiments based on assimilating multiple datasets simultaneously into a hydrological model are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed approach over different basins and over two testing periods: calibration and forecasting. Assimilation results suggest that the new filtering algorithm successfully improves the simulated water components during both the calibration and forecasting periods. These improvements are the result of the effective assimilation-calibration procedure introduced by the proposed method.

TI  - Land-Use/Land-Cover Changes and Its Contribution to Urban Heat Island: A Case Study of Islamabad, Pakistan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the essential anthropogenic influences on urban climate is land-use/land-cover (LULC) change due to urbanization, which has a direct impact on land surface temperature (LST). However, LULC changes affect LST, and further, urban heat island (UHI) still needs to be investigated. In this study, we estimated changes in LULC from 1993 to 2018, its warming (positive) and cooling (negative) effect, and their contribution to relative LST (RLST) in the city of Islamabad using satellite remote-sensing data. The LULC was classified using a random forest (RF) classifier, and LST was retrieved by a standardized radiative transfer equation (RTE). Our results reveal that the impervious surfaces has increased by 11.9% on the cost of declining barren land, forest land, grass/agriculture land, and water bodies in the last 26 years. LULC conversion contributed warming effects such as forest land, water bodies, and grass/agriculture land transformed into impervious surfaces, inducing a warming contribution of 1.52 degrees C. In contrast, the replacement of barren land and impervious surfaces by forest land and water bodies may have a cooling contribution of -0.85 degrees C to RLST. Furthermore, based on the standardized scale (10%) of LULC changes, the conversion of forest land into impervious surfaces contributed 1% compared to back conversion by -0.2%. The positive contribution to UHI due to the transformation of a natural surface to the human-made surface was found higher than the negative (cooler) contribution due to continued anthropogenic activities. The information will be useful for urban managers and decision makers in land-use planning to control the soaring surface temperature for a comfortable living environment and sustainable cities.

TI  - The feasibility of quantitative parameters of lymphoscintigraphy without significant dermal backflow for the evaluation of lymphedema in post-operative patients with breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose We aimed to evaluate the potential role of quantitative methods associated with lymphoscintigraphy for the assessment of severity of lymphedema post-operatively in patients with breast cancer who did not show definite dermal backflow activity on the lymphoscintigraphy. Methods We evaluated 47 lymphoscintigraphies without dermal backflow in patients with lymphedema who received a mastectomy and axillary dissection or sentinel lymph node dissection for invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The quantitative asymmetry indices (QAIs) of both arms were calculated for each axilla, upper arm, forearm, and the whole arm. The QAI was defined as the radiopharmaceutical uptake ratio of the affected side to the unaffected side. Arm circumference was measured at four locations per arm to identify the maximal circumference difference (MCD) between affected and unaffected sides. Results The total and forearm QAIs of each side arm were significantly higher in the group with above moderate stage lymphedema compared with the mild stage group. Previous radiotherapy also had a significant effect on radiotracer retention expressed as QAI. The MCD was significantly correlated with QAI values of the forearm and the whole arm. The QAI of axillary areas was not significantly correlated with circumferential measurements of the arm. Conclusions The QAIs have significant value for the diagnosis and severity of lymphedema and may therefore potentially be used as an objective tool for the assessment of lymphedema.

TI  - Acceleration Compensation for Estimation of Along-Track Velocity of Ground Moving Target from Single-Channel SAR SLC Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Across-track acceleration is a major source of estimation error of along-track velocity in synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) ground moving-target indication (GMTI). This paper presents the theory and a method of compensating across-track acceleration to improve the accuracy of along-track velocity estimated from single-channel SAR single-look complex data. A unique feature of the proposed method is the utilisation of phase derivatives in the Doppler frequency domain, which is effective for azimuth-compressed signals. The performance of the method was evaluated through experimental data acquired by TerraSAR-X and speed-controlled and measured vehicles. The application results demonstrate a notable improvement in along-track velocity estimates. The amount of along-track velocity correction is particularly significant when a target has irregular motion with a low signal-to-clutter ratio. A discontinuous velocity jump rather than a constant acceleration was also observed and verified through comparison between actual data and simulations. By applying this method, the capability of single-channel SAR GMTI could be substantially improved in terms of accuracy of velocity, and moving direction. However, the method is effective only if the correlation between the actual Doppler phase derivatives and a model derived from the residual Doppler rate is sufficiently high. The proposed method will be applied to X-band SAR systems of KOMPSAT-5 and -6.

TI  - Evolution of Backscattering Coefficients of Drifting Multi-Year Sea Ice during End of Melting and Onset of Freeze-up in the Western Beaufort Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Backscattering coefficients of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of drifting multi-year sea ice in the western Beaufort Sea during the transition period between the end of melting and onset of freeze-up are analyzed, in terms of the incidence angle dependence and temporal variation. The mobile sea ice surface is tracked down in a 1 km by 1 km region centered at a GPS tracker, which was installed during a field campaign in August 2019. A total of 24 Sentinel-1 images spanning 17 days are used and the incidence angle dependence in HH- and HV-polarization are -0.24 dB/deg and -0.10 dB/deg, respectively. Hummocks and recently frozen melt ponds seem to cause the mixture behavior of surface and volume scattering. The normalized backscattering coefficients in HH polarization gradually increased in time at a rate of 0.15 dB/day, whereas the HV-polarization was relatively flat. The air temperature from the ERA5 hourly reanalysis data has a strong negative relation with the increasing trend of the normalized backscattering coefficients in HH-polarization. The result of this study is expected to complement other previous studies which focused on winter or summer seasons in other regions of the Arctic Ocean.

TI  - Axillary Nodal Burden Assessed with Pretreatment Breast MRI Is Associated with Failed Sentinel Lymph Node Identification after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer
T2  - RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: After publication of the findings of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z1071 trial, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been increasingly performed in patients with breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).Purpose: To investigate the pretreatment breast MRI and clinical-pathologic characteristics associated with failed sentinel node identification after NAC in patients with breast cancer.Materials and Methods: Patients who underwent SLNB after NAC between January 2015 and January 2019 were retrospectively identified. Two radiologists independently reviewed the characteristics of axillary nodes (number, perinodal infiltration, cortical thickness, and maximal diameter) at pretreatment breast MRI. The associations of the clinical-pathologic and imaging characteristics of the axillary nodes with sentinel node identification were assessed by using the chi(2) test and/or the chi(2) test for trend and multivariable logistic regression with odds ratio (OR) calculation.Results: A total of 276 women (mean age 6 standard deviation, 48 years 6 9; range, 27-68 years) were included. Sentinel nodes were identified in 252 of the 276 patients (91%). Multivariable analysis showed that higher (stage 3 or 4) clinical T stages (OR = 5.2, P = .004 for radiologist 1; OR = 4.6, P = .01 for radiologist 2), use of a single tracer (OR = 4.3, P = .04 for radiologist 1; OR = 3.9, P = .046 for radiologist 2), a greater number (10 or more) of suspicious axillary nodes (OR = 11.5, P = .002 for radiologist 1; OR = 8.3, P = .01 for radiologist 2), and the presence of perinodal infiltration (OR = 7.0, P = .002 for radiologist 1; OR = 7.5, P = .003 for radiologist 2) were associated with failed sentinel node identification.Conclusion: A greater number of suspicious axillary nodes and the presence of perinodal infiltration at pretreatment MRI, higher clinical T stages, and use of a single tracer were independently associated with failed sentinel node identification after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.

TI  - A Cross-Resolution, Spatiotemporal Geostatistical Fusion Model for Combining Satellite Image Time-Series of Different Spatial and Temporal Resolutions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense time-series with coarse spatial resolution (DTCS) and sparse time-series with fine spatial resolution (STFS) data often provide complementary information. To make full use of this complementarity, this paper presents a novel spatiotemporal fusion model, the spatial time-series geostatistical deconvolution/fusion model (STGDFM), to generate synthesized dense time-series with fine spatial resolution (DTFS) data. Attributes from the DTCS and STFS data are decomposed into trend and residual components, and the spatiotemporal distributions of these components are predicted through novel schemes. The novelty of STGDFM lies in its ability to (1) consider temporal trend information using land-cover-specific temporal profiles from an entire DTCS dataset, (2) reflect local details of the STFS data using resolution matrix representation, and (3) use residual correction to account for temporary variations or abrupt changes that cannot be modeled from the trend components. The potential of STGDFM is evaluated by conducting extensive experiments that focus on different environments; spatially degraded datasets and real Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat images are employed. The prediction performance of STGDFM is compared with those of a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and an enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM). Experimental results indicate that STGDFM delivers the best prediction performance with respect to prediction errors and preservation of spatial structures as it captures temporal change information on the prediction date. The superiority of STGDFM is significant when the difference between pair dates and prediction dates increases. These results indicate that STGDFM can be effectively applied to predict DTFS data that are essential for various environmental monitoring tasks.

TI  - A low-cost GNSS buoy platform for measuring coastal sea levels
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A low-cost Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) buoy platform was developed for measuring coastal sea levels to provide information where logistical, physical and/or financial constraints prevent the application of established tide gauges and satellite altimetry, and where spatially and temporally discrete tidal data are required to support surveys for monitoring coastal morphodynamics. The buoy was constructed from scaffold tubing and four floats, with a central platform for the GNSS receiver and antenna. The overall cost was around 300 pound (buoy parts 100 pound, GPS/logger 200) pound. The single frequency GNSS receiver was set up to record GPS/GLONASS satellite data at 5Hz. Post-processing was carried out with RTKLIB software to derive solutions for sea level. GNSS buoy performance was evaluated against a reference tide gauge using a Van de Casteele test. The RMSE of 1.4 cm, computed from the differences between the GNSS-buoy and reference tide gauge, demonstrates that this low-cost GNSS buoy tide gauge compares well with previous, more expensive GNSS buoys and is suitable for obtaining local-scale coastal sea level data. In addition to providing coastal data at cm accuracy, the results also indicate the presence of high frequency oscillations in the sea level data caused by coastal geometry and wave-induced disturbance.

TI  - Remote vibrometry recognition of nonlinear eigen-states for object coverage of randomly large size
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIBROENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - For objects of "large" vibration size such as waves on the sea surface, the choice of measurement method can create different understandings of system behavior. In one case, laser vibrometry measurements of a vibrating bar in a controlled laboratory setting, variation in probe spot size can omit or uncover crucial structural vibration mode coupling data. In another case, a finite element simulation of laser vibrometry measures a nonlinearly clattering armor plate system of a ground vehicle. The simulation shows that sensing the system dynamics simultaneously over the entire structure reveals more vibration data than point measurements using a small diameter laser beam spot, regardless of the variation of footprint (coverage) boundaries. Furthermore, a simulation method described herein allows calculation of transition probabilities between modes (change-of-state). Wideband results of both cases demonstrate the 1/f trend explained within - that the energy of discrete structural vibration modes tends to decrease with increasing mode number (and frequency), and why. These results quantify the use of less expensive non-imaging classification systems for vehicle identification using the remote sensing of surface vibrations while mitigating spectral response distortion due to coverage variation on the order of the structural wavelength (spectral reduction or elimination).

TI  - Mapping Seasonal Tree Canopy Cover and Leaf Area Using Worldview-2/3 Satellite Imagery: A Megacity-Scale Case Study in Tokyo Urban Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a methodology for developing a high-resolution (2 m) urban tree canopy leaf area inventory in different tree phenological seasons and a subsequent application of the methodology to a 625 km(2) urban area in Tokyo. Satellite remote sensing has the advantage of imaging large areas simultaneously. However, mapping the tree canopy cover and leaf area accurately is still difficult in a highly heterogeneous urban landscape. The WorldView-2/3 satellite imagery at the individual tree level (2 m resolution) was used to map urban trees based on a simple pixel-based classification method. The comparison of our mapping results with the tree canopy cover derived from aerial photography shows that the error margin is within an acceptable range of 5.5% at the 3.0 km(2) small district level, 5.0% at the 60.9 km(2) municipality level, and 1.2% at the 625 km(2) city level. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between the satellite data (vegetation index) and in situ tree-measurement data (leaf area index) to develop a simple model to directly map the tree leaf area from the WorldView-2/3 imagery. The estimated total leaf area in Tokyo urban area in the leaf-on season (633 km(2)) was twice that of the leaf-off season (319 km(2)). Our results also showed that the estimated total leaf area in Tokyo urban area was 1.9-6.2 times higher than the results of the moderate-resolution (30 m) satellite imagery.

TI  - Tsunami Damage Detection with Remote Sensing: A Review
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Tsunamis are rare events compared with the other natural disasters, but once it happens, it can be extremely devastating to the coastal communities. Extensive inland penetration of tsunamis may cause the difficulties of understanding its impact in the aftermath of its generation. Therefore the social needs to technologies of detecting the wide impact of great tsunamis have been increased. Recent advances of remote sensing and technologies of image analysis meet the above needs and lead to more rapid and efficient understanding of tsunami affected areas. This paper provides a review of how remote sensing methods have developed to contribute to post-tsunami disaster response. The evaluations in the performances of the remote sensing methods are discussed according to the needs of tsunami disaster response with future perspective.

TI  - Mapping Natural Forest Remnants with Multi-Source and Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Data for More Informed Management of Global Biodiversity Hotspots
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global terrestrial biodiversity hotspots (GBH) represent areas featuring exceptional concentrations of endemism and habitat loss in the world. Unfortunately, geospatial data of natural habitats of the GBHs are often outdated, imprecise, and coarse, and need updating for improved management and protection actions. Recent developments in satellite image availability, combined with enhanced machine learning algorithms and computing capacity, enable cost-efficient updating of geospatial information of these already severely fragmented habitats. This study aimed to develop a more accurate method for mapping closed canopy evergreen natural forest (CCEF) of the Eastern Arc Mountains (EAM) ecoregion in Tanzania and Kenya, and to update the knowledge on its spatial extent, level of fragmentation, and conservation status. We tested 1023 model possibilities stemming from a combination of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite imagery, spatial texture of S1 and S2, seasonality derived from Landsat-8 time series, and topographic information, using random forest modelling approach. We compared the best CCEF model with existing spatial forest products from the EAM through independent accuracy assessment. Finally, the CCEF model was used to estimate the fragmentation and conservation coverage of the EAM. The CCEF model has moderate accuracy measured in True Skill Statistic (0.57), and it clearly outperforms other similar products from the region. Based on this model, there are about 296,000 ha of Eastern Arc Forests (EAF) left. Furthermore, acknowledging small forest fragments (1-10 ha) implies that the EAFs are more fragmented than previously considered. Currently, the official protection of EAFs is disproportionally targeting well-studied mountain blocks, while less known areas and small fragments are underrepresented in the protected area network. Thus, the generated CCEF model should be used to design updates and more informed and detailed conservation allocation plans to balance this situation. The results highlight that spatial texture of S2, seasonality, and topography are the most important variables describing the EAFs, while spatial texture of S1 increases the model performance slightly. All in all, our work demonstrates that recent developments in Earth observation allows significant enhancements in mapping, which should be utilized in areas with outstanding biodiversity values for better forest and conservation planning.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite several independent observational studies, a comprehensive picture on the aerosol vertical distribution and its spatial gradients has not yet evolved over the Indian subcontinent. The present study analyses around 10 years (June 2006 to December 2016) of version 3 level 3 CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) spaceborne lidar (light detection and ranging) retrieved night time, cloud free vertical extinction profiles (at 532 nm) of composite aerosol, and its major species (dust, polluted dust and smoke) to understand the three-dimensional distribution of aerosols over India. The shape and vertical extent of the extinction profiles varied in space and time. The vertical extent of the aerosol distribution is shallower in the colder seasons compared to that of warmer seasons, which could potentially be due to suppressed convection during colder months. Meridional gradients are observed in the near-surface extinction coefficients (increasing towards north of India). Polluted dust (defined as a mixture of dust and smoke) emerged as the dominant aerosol species over most parts of the study region. Over the north western and central India, dust aerosols contributed the most to the aerosol optical depths and extinction profiles during the summer and monsoon months. Smoke aerosols prevailed over the southern and north eastern parts of India, which are attributed to biomass, agricultural burning, and long-range transport. Boundary layer aerosol optical depths (AOD) contributed to columnar AOD significantly during post-monsoon and winter, while the elevated-AOD had almost an equal share in columnar AOD during the summer and monsoon seasons.

TI  - Clinical-Kidney cancer Topographic distribution of first landing sites of lymphatic metastases from patients with renal cancer
T2  - UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and Objective: Adjuvant studies with checkpoint inhibitors have attracted new interest in accurate pathological lymph node (LN) staging in renal cell carcinoma. Sentinel lymph node (SN) studies in cNO patients revealed the pattern of lymphatic radiotracer drainage from renal tumors. The aim of this study was to describe the location of single- or oligometastatic LN and analyze if the topography of these first landing sites matches the drainage pattern observed in SN studies of renal tumors.Materials and Methods: We collected data from 8 referral centers from 1990 to 2018 of all patients with pT1-4 cNO or cN1 MO renal cell carcinoma with pathologically confirmed single- or oligometastases in locoregional LN. The location of LN metastases, number, size of metastatic LN, and survival were analyzed using descriptive statistics with SPSS version 22 (IBM, Chicago, IL).Results: From 3,794 patients with histologically confirmed pN1, a total of 76 patients (2%) with single- or oligometastatic pN1 were identified, of whom 24 (31.6%) and 52 (68.4%) were cNO and cN1, respectively. On the left side, LN metastases were predominantly located in the para-aortal (48.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 29.22-63.12%) and hilar (31.42%; 95% CI 17.4-49.4%) area. On the right side, metastases located in retrocaval (26.82%; 95% CI 14.7-43.2%), hilar (26.82%; 95% CI 14.7-43.2%), interaortocaval (26.82%; 95% CI 14.7-43.2%), and paracaval (17.07%; 95% CI 7.6-32.6%) LNs. These landing sites exactly matched the lymphatic drainage pattern of intratumorally injected radiotracer reported in SN studies for both sides.Conclusions: Single- or oligometastatic LNs in renal cancer are mainly located in the hilar, retro-, para, and interaortocaval region on the right side and para-aortal region on the left side.

TI  - Utility of Quantitative SPECT/CT Lymphoscintigraphy in Guiding Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Head and Neck Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To investigate the use of advanced SPECT/CT quantification in guiding surgical selection of positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in head and neck melanoma. Methods We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with cutaneous head and neck melanoma who underwent lymphoscintigraphy with SPECT/CT prior to SLN biopsy (SLNB). Quantification of radiotracer uptake from SPECT/CT data was performed using in-house segmentation software. SLNs identified using SPECT/CT were compared to SLNs identified surgically using an intraoperative gamma-probe. A radioactivity count threshold using SPECT/CT for detecting a positive SLN was calculated. Results One hundred and five patients were included. Median number of SLNs detected was 3/patient with SPECT/CT and 2/patient with intraoperative gamma-probe. The hottest node identified by SPECT/CT and intraoperative gamma-probe were identical in 85% of patients. All 20 histologically positive SLNs were identified by SPECT/CT and gamma-probe. On follow-up, all nodal recurrences occurred at lymph node levels with the hottest node identified by SPECT/CT and either the hottest or second hottest node identified by gamma-probe during SLNB. Using our data, a SPECT/CT radioactivity count threshold of 20% would eliminate the unnecessary removal of 11% of SPECT/CT identified nodes and 12% of intraoperatively detected nodes. Conclusion Utilizing SPECT/CT quantification, we propose that a radioactivity count threshold can be developed to help guide the selective removal of lymph nodes in head and neck SLNB. Furthermore, the nodal level containing the hottest node identified by SPECT/CT quantification must be thoroughly investigated for SLNs and undergo careful follow-up and surveillance for recurrence.

TI  - Infrared Soil Moisture Retrieval Algorithm Using Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Data
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Most infrared satellite remote sensors have a higher spatial resolution than microwave satellite sensors. Microwave satellite remote sensing has proven successful for the retrieval of soil moisture (SM) information. In this study, we propose a SM retrieval algorithm based on temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), a function of land surface temperature (LST), and the normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) provided by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We implemented the LST correction with elevation effect. Conversion relationships between TVDI and SM content for a variety of land types were obtained from spatial and temporal collocation of TVDI and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) SM content for 2014. From the comparison with the GLDAS SM for 2015, the proposed TVDI-based SM algorithm showed good performance with CC = 0.609, bias = -0.035 m(3)/m(3), and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) = 0.047 m(3)/m(3), while the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) SMs present CC = 0.637 and 0.741, bias = 0.042 and 0.010 m(3)/m(3), and RMSE = 0.152 and 0.103 m(3)/m(3), respectively. For the in situ SM measurements of the Korea Rural Development Administration (RDA), the proposed TVDI-based SM algorithm yielded CC = 0.556, bias = -0.039 m(3)/m(3), and RMSE = 0.051 m(3)/m(3) excluding the winter season. Consequently, the proposed SM algorithm could contribute to complementing the low spatial resolutions of microwave satellite SM products and low temporal resolutions of GLDAS SM products.

TI  - Assessing Soil Cover Levels during the Non-Growing Season Using Multitemporal Satellite Imagery and Spectral Unmixing Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing cover or winter crops and retaining crop residue on agricultural lands are considered beneficial management practices to address soil health and water quality. Remote sensing is a valuable tool to assess and map crop residue cover and cover crops. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of linear spectral unmixing for estimating soil cover in the non-growing season (November-May) over the Canadian Lake Erie Basin using seasonal multitemporal satellite imagery. Soil cover ground measurements and multispectral Landsat-8 imagery were acquired for two areas throughout the 2015-2016 non-growing season. Vertical soil cover photos were collected from up to 40 residue and 30 cover crop fields for each area (e.g., Elgin and Essex sites) when harvest, cloud, and snow conditions permitted. Images and data were reviewed and compiled to represent a complete coverage of the basin for three time periods (post-harvest, pre-planting, and post-planting). The correlations between field measured and satellite imagery estimated soil covers (e.g., residue and green) were evaluated by coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Overall, spectral unmixing of satellite imagery is well suited for estimating soil cover in the non-growing season. Spectral unmixing using three-endmembers (i.e., corn residue-soil-green cover; soybean residue-soil-green cover) showed higher correlations with field measured soil cover than spectral unmixing using two- or four-endmembers. For the nine non-growing season images analyzed, the residue and green cover fractions derived from linear spectral unmixing using corn residue-soil-green cover endmembers were highly correlated with the field-measured data (mean R-2 of 0.70 and 0.86, respectively). The results of this study support the use of remote sensing and spectral unmixing techniques for monitoring performance metrics for government initiatives, such as the Canada-Ontario Lake Erie Action Plan, and as input for sustainability indicators that both require knowledge about non-growing season land management over a large area.

TI  - Extreme Viral Partitioning in a Marine-Derived High Arctic Lake
T2  - MSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - High-latitude, perennially stratified (meromictic) lakes are likely to be especially vulnerable to climate warming because of the importance of ice in maintaining their water column structure and associated distribution of microbial communities. This study aimed to characterize viral abundance, diversity, and distribution in a meromictic lake of marine origin on the far northern coast of Ellesmere Island, in the Canadian High Arctic. We collected triplicate samples for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viromics from five depths that encompassed the major features of the lake, as determined by limnological profiling of the water column. Viral abundance and virus-to-prokaryote ratios were highest at greater depths, while bacterial and cyanobacterial counts were greatest in the surface waters. The viral communities from each zone of the lake defined by salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen concentrations were markedly distinct, suggesting that there was little exchange of viral types among lake strata. Ten viral assembled genomes were obtained from our libraries, and these also segregated with depth. This well-defined structure of viral communities was consistent with that of potential hosts. Viruses from the monimolimnion, a deep layer of ancient Arctic Ocean seawater, were more diverse and relatively abundant, with few similarities to available viral sequences. The Lake A viral communities also differed from published records from the Arctic Ocean and meromictic Ace Lake in Antarctica. This first characterization of viral diversity from this sentinel environment underscores the microbial richness and complexity of an ecosystem type that is increasingly exposed to major perturbations in the fast-changing Arctic.IMPORTANCE The Arctic is warming at an accelerating pace, and the rise in temperature has increasing impacts on the Arctic biome. Lakes are integrators of their surroundings and thus excellent sentinels of environmental change. Despite their importance in the regulation of key microbial processes, viruses remain largely uncharacterized in Arctic lacustrine environments. We sampled a highly stratified meromictic lake near the northern limit of the Canadian High Arctic, a region in rapid transition due to climate change. We found that the different layers of the lake harbored viral communities that were strikingly dissimilar and highly divergent from known viruses. Viruses were more abundant in the deepest part of the lake containing ancient Arctic Ocean seawater that was trapped during glacial retreat and were genomically unlike any viruses previously described. This research demonstrates the complexity and novelty of viral communities in an environment that is vulnerable to ongoing perturbation.

TI  - Validation of a Primary Production Algorithm of Vertically Generalized Production Model Derived from Multi-Satellite Data around the Waters of Taiwan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Basin-scale sampling for high frequency oceanic primary production (PP) is available from satellites and must achieve a strong match-up with in situ observations. This study evaluated a regionally high-resolution satellite-derived PP using a vertically generalized production model (VGPM) with in situ PP. The aim was to compare the root mean square difference (RMSD) and relative percent bias (Bias) in different water masses around Taiwan. Determined using light-dark bottle methods, the spatial distribution of VGPM derived from different Chl-a data of MODIS Aqua (PPA), MODIS Terra (PPT), and averaged MODIS Aqua and Terra (PPA&T) exhibited similar seasonal patterns with in situ PP. The three types of satellite-derived PPs were linearly correlated with in situ PPs, the coefficients of which were higher throughout the year in PPA&T (r(2) = 0.61) than in PPA (r(2) = 0.42) and PPT (r(2) = 0.38), respectively. The seasonal RMSR and bias for the satellite-derived PPs were in the range of 0.03 to 0.09 and -0.14 to -0.39, respectively, which suggests the PPA&T produces slightly more accurate PP measurements than PPA and PPT. On the basis of environmental conditions, the subareas were further divided into China Coast water, Taiwan Strait water, Northeastern upwelling water, and Kuroshio water. The VPGM PP in the four subareas displayed similar features to Chl-a variations, with the highest PP in the China Coast water and lowest PP in the Kuroshio water. The RMSD was higher in the Kuroshio water with an almost negative bias. The PPA exhibited significant correlations with in situ PP in the subareas; however, the sampling locations were insufficient to yield significant results in the China Coast water.

TI  - Sea Ice Roughness Overlooked as a Key Source of Uncertainty in CryoSat-2 Ice Freeboard Retrievals
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - ESA's CryoSat-2 has transformed the way we monitor Arctic sea ice, providing routine measurements of the ice thickness with near basin-wide coverage. Past studies have shown that uncertainties in the sea ice thickness retrievals can be introduced at several steps of the processing chain, for instance, in the estimation of snow depth, and snow and sea ice densities. Here, we apply a new physical model to CryoSat-2, which further reveals sea ice surface roughness as a key overlooked feature of the conventional retrieval process. High-resolution airborne observations demonstrate that snow and sea ice surface topography can be better characterized by a lognormal distribution, which varies based on the ice age and surface roughness within a CryoSat-2 footprint, than a Gaussian distribution. Based on these observations, we perform a set of simulations for the CryoSat-2 echo waveform over "virtual" sea ice surfaces with a range of roughness and radar backscattering configurations. By accounting for the variable roughness, our new lognormal retracker produces sea ice freeboards that compare well with those derived from NASA's Operation IceBridge airborne data and extends the capability of CryoSat-2 to profile the thinnest/smoothest sea ice and thickest/roughest ice. Our results indicate that the variable ice surface roughness contributes a systematic uncertainty in sea ice thickness of up to 20% over first-year ice and 30% over multiyear ice, representing one of the principal sources of pan-Arctic sea ice thickness uncertainty.Plain Language Summary We have developed a new way of measuring sea ice thickness in the Arctic, by comparing real and simulated data from the European Space Agency satellite: CryoSat-2. Our simulations are guided by aircraft observations that demonstrate sea ice has distinct patterns of surface roughness. Traditional methods ignore or misrepresent the surface roughness, which reduces our confidence in the measured ice thickness by around one third. If we account for the roughness, however, we can extend the capability of Cryosat-2 for measuring both the thinnest smoothest sea ice and thickest roughest ice. These improvements will boost our confidence in derived estimates of the Arctic Ocean's sea ice volume budget and freshwater fluxes, while enhancing the accuracy of sea ice forecasts primed with satellite data.

TI  - A new scattering similarity based metric for ship detection in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar image
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A new paradigm for ship detection in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (Pol-SAR) image is presented. We firstly utilize the scattering similarity parameters to investigate the differences of scattering mechanism between ships and sea clutter. Based on these differences, we propose a novel ship detection metric, denoted as the scattering similarity based metric (SSM), to conduct ship detection task. The distribution model of SSM metric is investigated and modeled by kernel density estimation (KDE). Based on the statistical distribution, an adaptive constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection scheme is implemented. We compare the proposed SSM with two classic polarimetric metrics, i.e., the polarimetric cross-entropy (PCE) and the reflection symmetry metric (RSM). The experimental results conducted on C-band RADARSAT-2 Pol-SAR data demonstrate the feasibility and advantage of the proposed SSM metric both in sea clutter modeling and in ship detection.

TI  - On the Mapping of Burned Areas and Burn Severity Using Self Organizing Map and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we propose an approach based on the use of Sentinel-2 spectral indices and self-organizing map (SOM) to automatically map burned areas and burned severity. These analyses were performed on a test area in Chania, located in Crete, affected by a fire (around 200 ha) that occurred from July 13, 2018 to July 28, 2018. The investigated area is characterized by heterogeneous land cover types made up of natural and agricultural lands. To identify different levels of fire severity without using fixed thresholds, we applied SOM to the three spectral indices normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized burn ratio (NBR), and burned area index for sentinel (BAIS) used to enhance burned areas. This is a particular critical issue because fixed threshold values are generally not suitable for fragmented landscapes, vegetation types, and geographic regions different from those for which they were devised. To cope with this issue, the methodological approach herein proposed is based on three steps: 1) indices computation; 2) maps of the difference of the three indices computed using the data acquired from prefire and postfire occurrences; and 3) unsupervised classification obtained processing all the difference maps using the SOM. The obtained results were validated using an independent data set, which showed high correlation with satellite-based fire severity.

TI  - Volcanic Anomalies Monitoring System (VOLCANOMS), a Low-Cost Volcanic Monitoring System Based on Landsat Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The practice of monitoring active volcanoes, includes several techniques using either direct or remote measurements, the latter being more important for volcanoes with limited accessibility. We present the Volcanic Anomalies Monitoring System (VOLCANOMS), a new, online, low-cost and semiautomatic system based on Landsat imagery. This system can detect permanent and/or temporal thermal anomalies in near-infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) bands. VOLCANOMS allows researchers to calculate several thermal parameters, such as thermal radiance, effective temperature, anomaly area, radiative, gas, convective, and total heat, and mass fluxes. We study the eruptive activity of five volcanoes including Krakatau, Stromboli, Fuego, Villarrica and Lascar volcanoes, comparing field and eruptive data with thermal radiance. In the case of Villarrica and Lascar volcanoes, we also compare the thermal radiance and eruptive activity with seismic data. The thermal radiance shows a concordance with the eruptive activity in all cases, whereas a correlation is observed between thermal and seismic data both, in Villarrica and Lascar volcanoes, especially in the case of long-period seismicity. VOLCANOMS is a new and powerful tool that, combined with other techniques, generates robust information for volcanic monitoring.

TI  - Public health literacy in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic emergency
T2  - SALUD PUBLICA DE MEXICO
M3  - Article
AB  - Health literacy is the process of obtaining knowledge, motivation and individual competencies to understand and access information, express opinions and make decisions with respect to health promotion and maintenance. This applies in different contexts, environments, and throughout life.This conceptual perspective is very necessary in the face of the SARS-CoV-2 virus emergency.This virus produces the Covid- 19 disease, which has become a pandemic of devastating effects not only healthwise, but also, importantly, from an economic, political and social point of view. This essay seeks to establish the scientific evidence-based elements that guide public policies for prevention and control. Some of these elements are: a) epidemiologic intelligence. This includes not only the strategy of public surveillance, but also sentinel and event-based surveillance, as it is impossible to actually identify all positive cases; b) Mitigating measures against the spread of the epidemic, such as social distancing and hygiene, washing hands, quarantine, restricting movement and using masks, among others; c) Measures to suppress transmission when the number of cases is very high, such as strict measures to stay at home; d) strengthening health services 'capacity for medical attention and improving health services' ability to prevent transmission, including the use of diagnostic tests; e) the development of prophylactic vaccines against Covid-19, as well as the development of therapeutic agents. All of these actions must be rapidly implemented, from a multidisciplinary and multisectorial public health perspective, and they absolutely must also be taken with the community's participation as shared responsibility.Therefore, public health literacy is needed.

TI  - Improving satellite rainfall estimation from MSG data in Northern Algeria by using a multi-classifier model based on machine learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary focus in this paper is the estimation of precipitation from MSG images (Meteosat Second Generation) using a machine learning-based multi-classifier model. Learning and validation of the multiclass model is performed using the correspondences between MSG satellite data and radar data. To do this, six classifiers were first combined in order to exploit the full potential of each of these classifiers. These are Random Forest (RF1), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayesian (NB), Weighted k-Nearest Neighbors (WkNN), and the Kmeans ++ algorithm (Kmeans). The application of these classifiers makes it possible to carry out a classification at level 1. A pixel can therefore be assigned to more than one class by the different classifiers. We calculated six certainty coefficients from these classification results. To refine these results, in a second step, a classification at level 2 was performed using the Random Forest classifier (RF2) taking the certainty coefficients as input parameters. Six classes of precipitation intensities are thus obtained: very high precipitation intensities, moderate to high precipitation intensities, moderate precipitation intensities, light to moderate precipitation intensities, light precipitation intensities and no rain. Comparisons between the results of the multi-classifiers model and those obtained by the classifiers used separately show a clear improvement in the quality of classification.Using multiple linear regressions, precipitation rates for the different classes were determined using data from the rain gauges. To validate the model, precipitation amounts were estimated and compared to actual rain gauge data and then compared to the results of a few precipitation estimation methods. The results are very interesting and show superior performance for the elaborated model. Indeed, the coefficient of correlation has a value of 0.93 for developed scheme against 0.46 to 90 for the different techniques presented here for comparison. Also, a better Bias (2.2 mm) and a better RMSD (12 mm) were obtained for developed scheme while the other methods indicate bias between -11 mm to 16 mm and RMSD higher than 14 mm.

TI  - Potential for the Detection of Irrigation Events on Maize Plots Using Sentinel-1 Soil Moisture Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the real timing and flow rates used for crop irrigation are controlled at the scale of individual plots by the irrigator, they are not generally known by the farm upper management. This information is nevertheless essential, not only to compute the water balance of irrigated plots and to schedule irrigation, but also for the management of water resources at regional scales. The aim of the present study was to detect irrigation timing using time series of surface soil moisture (SSM) derived from Sentinel-1 radar observations. The method consisted of assessing the direction of change of surface soil moisture (SSM) between observations and a water balance model, and to use thresholds to be calibrated. The performance of the approach was assessed on the F-score quantifying the accuracy of the irrigation event detections and ranging from 0 (none of the irrigation timing is correct) to 100 (perfect irrigation detection). The study focused on five irrigated and one rainfed plot of maize in South-West France, where the approach was tested using in situ measurements and surface soil moisture (SSM) maps derived from Sentinel-1 radar data. The use of in situ data showed that (1) irrigation timing was detected with a good accuracy (F-score in the range (80-83) for all plots) and (2) the optimal revisit time between two SSM observations was 2-4 days. The higher uncertainties of microwave SSM products, especially when the crop is well developed (normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI) > 0.7), degraded the score (F-score = 69), but various possibilities of improvement were discussed. This paper opens perspectives for the irrigation detection at the plot scale over large areas and thus for the improvement of irrigation water management.

TI  - Linear spectral unmixing for mapping degraded pastures and bare soil in the Amazon
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - This work focused on the mapping and quantification of degraded pastures / bare soil in rural properties of Sao Felix do Xingu/PA, and in discovering spatial clusters for degradation rates, and describing the profile of the properties that were inserted in these clusters. We used scenes from the Landsat 8 satellite in 2017, classified to obtain pasture areas. Then spectral mixture analysis was used in the images to obtain the soil fraction. This fraction was classified and the first class represented the degraded pasture/exposed soil areas. These areas were intersected with the farms and then classified for degraded pasture/exposed soil rates. Sequentially the properties were spatially grouped by hot spot analysis. The total pasture area in 2017 represented 49.8%, while degraded pasture / exposed soil areas totaled 21,621 hectares (2.7%) and were present in 3,643 (64%) of rural properties (5,691), and 3,004 of them had a size of up to 500 ha, being characterized as small properties. There were three hot spot clusters found that concentrated 982 rural properties. Of these properties, 878 of them (89.4%) were also in the group of up to 500 ha. Degraded pastures/exposed soil were predominantly concentrated on small farms.

TI  - Gonorrhea Prevalence Among Young Women and Men Entering the National Job Training Program, 2000-2017
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To examine long-term gonorrhea prevalence trends from a sentinel surveillance population of young people at elevated risk for gonorrhea.Methods. We analyzed annual cross-sectional urogenital gonorrhea screening data from 191 991 women (2000-2017) and 224 348 men (2003-2017) 16 to 24 years of age entering the National Job Training Program, a US vocational training program. We estimated prevalence among women using an expectation-maximization algorithm incorporated into a logistic regression to account For increases in screening test sensitivity; log-binomial regression was used to estimate prevalence among men.Results. The adjusted gonorrhea prevalence among women followed a U-shaped curve, falling from 2.9% to 1.6% from 2000 through 2011 before rising to 2.7% in 2017. The prevalence among men declined from 1.4% to 0.8% from 2003 through 2017. In the case of both women and men, the prevalence was highest across all study years among those who were Black or American Indian/Alaska Native and those who resided in the South or Midwest.Conclusions. Trends among National Job Training Program enrollees suggest that gonorrhea prevalence is rising among young women while remaining low and steady among young men.

TI  - Expansion with transpalatal arch or continuous arch mechanics
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to compare the 3-dimensional force system produced by transpalatal arch (TPA) mechanics with that produced by a continuous arch (CA) on the expansion of maxillary first molars. Methods: A patient's model with 2 molars in 4-mm crossbite had orthodontic appliances bonded to all teeth. The first and the second molars were connected to two 3-dimensional load cells to compare the forces in the transverse and anteroposterior planes (Fx and Fy) and the rotational moments (Mz) produced in both molars by the expanded TPA and by 0.016-in nickel-titanium CA. The data were evaluated using 6 independent t tests, and the net moment at the molar's center of resistance was also calculated. Results: All forces and moments were different at both molars. At the first molar, CA produced Fx of 2.60 N, Fy of -0.08 N, Mz of -5.16 N.mm, and Net Mz of -5.68 N.mm, whereas the TPA produced Fx of 2.87 N, Fy of -0.60 N, Mz of -22.08 N.mm, and Net Mz of -25.09 N.mm. At the second molar, the TPA did not produce significant forces and moments, whereas the CA produced Fx of -1.00 N, Mz of 3.95 N.mm, Fy of -0.84 N, and Net Mz of -0.67 N.mm. Conclusions: Based on our findings in a clinical set up with the specific horseshoe TPA and archwire tested, with the TPA used only on the first molars and the CA used from one second molar to the other, the mechanics produced different expansion forces at the first molar. The TPA produced a larger rotational side effect on the first molar, whereas the CA produced side effects on the second molar.

TI  - Preparation of a multi-modal agent for sentinel lymph node mapping using Evans blue and <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-labeled mannosylated human serum albumin conjugate
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) is important in deciding the resection range during surgery. Tc-99(m)-labeled mannosylated human serum albumin ([Tc-99(m)]Tc-MSA) is a radiopharmaceutical developed for SLN detection by targeting macrophages. Evans blue (EB) is a blue dye binding strongly to albumin and has been used for SLN detection. [Tc-99m]Tc-MSA-EB conjugate was prepared as a multi-modal imaging agent and tested its performance by visual investigation, fluorescence imaging and SPECT/CT for SLN mapping in mice.Methods: EB was mixed with various concentration of MSA to prepare MSA-EB conjugates. The binding efficiencies were determined using thin-layer chromatography. The UV-VIS spectra and molar extinction coefficient of the conjugate were obtained. The fluorescence was monitored at the excitation wavelength range 420-780 nm and the emission wavelength range 520-845 nm. The [Tc-99m]Tc-MSA-EB conjugate and EB were injected into the footpads of normal BALB/c mice to check the lymph node (LN) uptakes. The visible, fluorescence, and SPECT/CT images were obtained after injection.Results: The conjugation of EB with MSA increased by time and was saturated within 10 min. The molar extinction coefficient of the conjugate was 99,259,3/M/cm at 620 nm. The uptake of conjugate into the popliteal LN after injection into the footpads of mice was investigated visually and fluorescence imaging. SPECT/CT images showed that the standardized uptake values of [Tc-99(m)]Tc-MSA-EB conjugate in popliteal LN were about 4 times higher than in sciatic LN at all timepoints. It was confirmed by investigating resected LN that the blue color, fluorescence, and radioactivity of the [Tc-99(m)]Tc-MSA-EB conjugate were retained only on the LN and did not spread to adjoining tissues.Conclusion: [Tc-99m]Tc-MSA-EB conjugate has a great potential as a multi-modal SLN mapping agent which could be detected by visual investigation, fluorescence imaging, and SPECT/CT.

TI  - Improvements of 6S Look-Up-Table Based Surface Reflectance Employing Minimum Curvature Surface Method
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a methodology employing an interpolation technique on the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal (6S) look-up table (LUT) to improve surface reflectance retrieval using Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI). A minimum curvature surface (MCS) technique was used to refine the 6S LUT, and the solar zenith angle (SZA) and viewing zenith angle (VZA) increments were narrowed by 0.5 degrees. The interpolation processing time was relatively short, about 3172 s per channel, and the interpolated xa and xb were well represented by the changes in SZA and VZA. An evaluation of the interpolated xa and xb for six cases revealed a relative mean absolute error of less than 5% for all channels and cases; however, a slight difference was evident for higher values of SZA and VZA. To evaluate the surface reflectance, we compared the surface reflectance derived using 6S LUT with that calculated using 6S only. Application of the interpolated 6S LUT showed a lower relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 0.65% to 9.29% for all channels, than before interpolation. The improvement in surface reflectance measurements increased with the SZA. For a SZA above 75 degrees, the RRMSE improved significantly for all channels (by 11.33-45.1%). In addition, when the MCS method was applied, the surface reflectance measurements improved without spatial discontinuity and showed good agreement with 6S results in a linear profile analyses. Thus, the method proposed can improve LUT based surface reflectance measurements in less time and increase the availability of surface reflectance data based on geostationary satellites.

TI  - Links between <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine and Agr-based quorum sensing for biofilm development in <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> EGD-e
T2  - MICROBIOLOGYOPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes is the causative agent of human listeriosis which has high hospitalization and mortality rates for individuals with weakened immune systems. The survival and dissemination of L. monocytogenes in adverse environments can be reinforced by the formation of biofilms. Therefore, this study aimed to understand the mechanisms underlying listerial biofilm development. Given that both nutrient availability and quorum sensing (QS) have been known as the factors influencing biofilm development, we hypothesized that the signal from a sentinel metabolite S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and Agr-based QS could be synchronous in L. monocytogenes to modulate nutrient availability, the synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs), and biofilm formation. We performed biofilm assays and quantitative real-time PCR to investigate how biofilm volumes and the expression of genes for the synthesis of EPS were affected by SAM supplementation, agr deletion, or both. We found that exogenously applied SAM induced biofilm formation and that the expression of genes encoding the EPS synthesis machineries was regulated by SAM and/or Agr QS. Moreover, the gene transcription of components acting in the methyl cycle for SAM synthesis and Agr QS was affected by the signals from the other system. In summary, we reveal an interconnection at the transcriptional level between metabolism and QS in L. monocytogenes and highlight the critical role of metabolite-oriented QS in biofilm development.

TI  - The Quantitative Estimation of Grazing Intensity on the Zoige Plateau Based on the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Monitoring Technology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grazing intensity (GI) is an important indicator for grazing situations in pastoral areas. However, it has been difficult to be observed directly in the field, due to the randomness and dynamics of the grazing behavior of livestock. Consequently, the lack of actual GI information has become a common issue in studies on quantitatively estimating GI. In this paper, a novel quantitative estimation method is proposed based on the Space-Air-Ground integrated monitoring technology. It systematically integrates GPS tracking technology, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) observation technology, and satellite remote sensing technology. Taking Xiangdong Village on the Zoige Plateau as a study area, the trajectory data and UAV images were acquired by the GPS tracking experiments and UAV observation experiments, respectively. The GI at paddock scale (PGI) was then generated with the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) algorithm and the above data. Taking the generated PGI as training data, an estimation model of GI at region scale (RGI) was constructed by using the time-series satellite remote sensing images and random forest regression algorithm. Finally, the time-series RGI data with a spatial resolution of 10 m in Xiangdong Village were produced by the above model. The accuracy assessment demonstrated that the generated time-series RGI data could reflect the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of actual GI, with a mean absolute error of 0.9301 and r(2) of 0. 8573. The proposed method provides a new idea for generating the actual GI on the ground and the time-series RGI data. This study also highlights the feasibility and potential of using the Space-Air-Ground integrated monitoring technology to generate time-series RGI data with high spatial resolution. The generated time-series RGI data would provide data support for the formulation of policies and plans related to the sustainable development of animal husbandry.

TI  - Global multi-scale grid integer coding and spatial indexing: A novel approach for big earth observation data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the exponentially growing earth observation data of specific sensor-determined resolutions and update frequencies, earth observation has irreversibly arrived in the Big Data era, enabling new insights in science and engineering. With great opportunity comes great challenges regarding efficient and effective data management because earth observation data is of different scales and characterized by complexity in spatial relationships related to the real world. To overcome the challenges is crucial for, for instance, data mining, land surveying, and especially emergency mapping for disaster response. To improve the querying efficiency of big earth observation data, we proposed a novel data management approach: Global Multi-scale Grid Integer Coding and Spatial Indexing. Among our contributions are: (1) proposing Global Multi-scale Grid Integer Coding Model (GMGICM), which presents clustering property in both the scale dimension and spatial dimension, and theoretically facilitates an efficient querying; (2) deliberately applying GMGICM on multi-scale earth observation data spatial indexing, which results in one-dimensional data index, which can be queried using simple B-tree, inversion, and other one-dimensional indexes; (3) designing a strategy to assure the completeness of spatial querying, which is not well solved by existing grid-based coding models. The advantages of our proposed approach have been demonstrated with both simulated and real remote sensing data, with spatial operation 20 times as fast as Geohash and spatial querying 10 times as fast as Oracle Spatial on average. The proposed approach can be easily adapted for three or higher-dimensional earth observation data and bring potential benefit to all big earth observation data analytic projects.

TI  - Glacial Lake Inventory Derived from Landsat 8 OLI in 2016-2018 in China-Pakistan Economic Corridor
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a key hub for trade, is susceptible to glacial lake outburst floods. The distributions and types of glacial lakes in the CPEC are not well documented. In this study, cloud-free imagery acquired using the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager during 2016-2018 was used to delineate the extent of glacial lakes in the mountainous terrain of the CPEC. In the study domain, 1341 glacial lakes (size >= 0.01 km(2)) with a total area of 109.76 +/- 9.82 km(2) were delineated through the normalized difference water index threshold method, slope analysis, and a manual rectification process. On the basis of the formation mechanisms and characteristics of glacial lakes, four major classes and eight subclasses of lakes were identified. In all, 492 blocked lakes (162 end moraine-dammed lakes, 17 lateral moraine-dammed lakes, 312 other moraine-dammed lakes, and 1 ice-blocked lake), 723 erosion lakes (123 cirque lakes and 600 other erosion lakes), 86 supraglacial lakes, and 40 other glacial lakes were identified. All lakes were distributed between 2220 and 5119 m a.s.l. At higher latitudes, the predominate lake type changed from moraine-related to erosion. From among the Gez, Taxkorgan, Hunza, Gilgit, and Indus basins, most glacial lakes were located in the Indus Basin. The number and area of glacial lakes were larger on the southern slopes of the Karakoram range.

TI  - Biomass Burning in Africa: An Investigation of Fire Radiative Power Missed by MODIS Using the 375 m VIIRS Active Fire Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning plays a key role in the interaction between the atmosphere and the biosphere. The nearly two-decade-old Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire product provides critical information (e.g., fire radiative power or FRP) for characterizing fires and estimating smoke emissions. Due to limitations of sensing geometry, MODIS fire detection capability degrades at off-nadir angles and the sensor misses the observation of fires occurring inside its equatorial swath gaps. This study investigates missing MODIS FRP observations using the 375 m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire data across Africa where fire occurs in the majority of vegetation-covered areas and significantly contributes to global biomass-burning emissions. We first examine the FRP relationship between the two sensors on a continental scale and in grids of seven different resolutions. We find that MODIS misses a considerable number of low-intensity fires across Africa, which results in the underestimation of daily MODIS FRP by at least 42.8% compared to VIIRS FRP. The underestimation of MODIS FRP varies largely with grid size and satellite view angle. Based on comparisons of grid-level FRP from the two sensors, adjustment models are established at seven resolutions from 0.05 degrees-0.5 degrees for mitigating the underestimation of MODIS grid FRP. Furthermore, the investigation of the effect of equatorial swath gaps on MODIS FRP observations reveals that swath gaps could lead to the underestimation of MODIS monthly summed FRP by 12.5%. The quantitative information of missing MODIS FRP helps to improve our understanding of potential uncertainties in the MODIS FRP based applications, especially emissions estimation.

TI  - A POI and LST Adjusted NTL Urban Index for Urban Built-Up Area Extraction
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light (NTL) images have been broadly applied to extract urban built-up areas in recent years. However, the typical NTL images provided by Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) and National Polar-Orbiting Partnership's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP/VIIRS) have the drawbacks of low resolution and blooming effect, which bring difficulty for the application of them in urban built-up area extraction. Therefore, this paper proposes the POI (point of interest) and LST (land surface temperature) adjusted NTL urban index (PLANUI) to extract the urban built-up areas with high accuracy. PLANUI is the first urban index to integrate POI and NTL for urban built-up area extraction. In this paper, NPP/VIIRS and Luojia 1-01 images were introduced as the original NTL data and the vegetation adjusted NTL urban index (VANUI) was selected as the comparison item. The threshold method was utilized to extract urban built-up areas from these data. The results show that: (1) Based on the comparison with the reference data, the PLANUI can make up the shortcoming of low resolution and the blooming effect of NTL effectively. (2) Compared with the VANUI, the PLANUI can significantly improve the accuracy of the urban built-up areas extracted and characterize urban features. (3) According to the results based on NPP/VIIRS and Luojia 1-01 images, the PLANUI has extensive applicability, both for regions with different degrees of economic development and NTL data with different resolutions. PLANUI can enhance the features of urban built-up areas with social sensing data and natural remote sensing data, which helps to weaken the NTL blooming effect and improve the extraction accuracy. PLANUI can provide an effective approach for urban built-up area extraction, which plays a certain guiding role for the study of urban structure, urban expansion, and urban planning and governance.

M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal reclamation has been regarded as an effective means to provide space for urban expansion and industrial development in China, given its low cost and flexible utilization. The Chinese government has issued a series of policies to boost or slow down reclamation to cope with varied conditions of domestic and international environments for China's economic development and marine environment problems. This paper aims to improve Chinese sea use management policy by analyzing reclamation area, the introduction of policies, and the impacts of these policies on reclamation from 2002 to 2018. First, statistical data and remote sensing data are used for analyzing the reclamation area and the construction area of the reclaimed land in the coastal areas of China. The results show that China reclaimed 2976.1 km 2 from the sea, of which 910.8 km(2) was constructed for urbanization and industrialization during 2002-2018. Whilst the statistical data from the Sea-Use Bulletin show that 1449.4 km(2) reclamation area was issued sea area user's right. The results indicate an increased trend of annual reclamation area from 2002 to 2015, a relatively stable annual construction area, and a declining construction ratio. Second, we connect the reclamation change and the change of the policy system following a review on the sea use management policy system. The analysis demonstrates that the stability and predictability of the policy system need improvement. Special efforts should be devoted to reinforcing law enforcement supervision and the concept of sustainable sea use should be advocated.

TI  - Comparison of Canopy Closure Estimation of Plantations Using Parametric, Semi-Parametric, and Non-Parametric Models Based on GF-1 Remote Sensing Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy closure (CC) is an important parameter in forest ecosystems and has diverse applications in a wide variety of fields. Canopy closure estimation models, using a combination of measured data and remote sensing data, can largely replace traditional survey methods for CC. However, it is difficult to estimate the forest CC based on high spatial resolution remote sensing images. This study used China Gaofen-1 satellite (GF-1) images, and selected China's north temperate Wangyedian Forest Farm (WYD) and subtropical Gaofeng Forest Farm (GF) as experimental areas. A parametric model (multiple linear regression (MLR)), non-parametric model (random forest (RF)), and semi-parametric model (generalized additive model (GAM)) were developed. The ability of the three models to estimate the CC of plantations based on high spatial resolution remote sensing GF-1 images and their performance in the two experimental areas was analyzed and compared. The results showed that the decision coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative root mean square error (rRMSE) values of the parametric model (MLR), semi-parametric model (GAM), and non-parametric model (RF) for the WYD forest ranged from 0.45 to 0.69, 0.0632 to 0.0953, and 9.98% to 15.05%, respectively, and in the GF forest theR(2), RMSE, and rRMSE values ranged from 0.40 to 0.59, 0.0967 to 0.1152, and 16.73% to 19.93%, respectively. The best model in the two study areas was the GAM and the worst was the RF. The accuracy of the three models established in the WYD was higher than that in the GF area. The RMSE and rRMSE values for the MLR, GAM, and RF established using high spatial resolution GF-1 remote sensing images in the two test areas were within the scope of existing studies, indicating the three CC estimation models achieved satisfactory results.

TI  - A label-noise robust active learning sample collection method for multi-temporal urban land-cover classification and change analysis
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and reliable land-use/land-cover (LULC) change dynamic monitoring is the basis of urban understanding and planning. However, either the training sample shortage or the error accumulation in the multi-temporal processing inevitably restricts the monitoring performance. In this paper, to overcome these problems, we present a label-noise robust active learning method, which automatically collects reliable and informative samples from the images and builds a unified classification system with these augmented samples. In more detail, a Bayesian sample collection process that fuses the unsupervised transition information and the multitemporal land-cover information is designed to provide candidate samples with "from-to" labels. A reliability-based multi-classifier active learning method is then proposed to adaptively allocate the more reliable samples to the classes that are difficulty to classify. Finally, a fusion of the multiple multi-date classifications trained by the selected samples is implemented to identify the change type of interest. The dynamic monitoring results for Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Shiyan in China, two megacities with rapid and obvious urbanization and a small city with relatively slow urbanization, indicate that the proposed method achieves a significantly higher accuracy than the current state-of-the art methods. The sample accuracy verified by the high spatial resolution reference maps endorses the applicability of the sample collection, while the reliability-based active learning further ensures the robustness of the proposed method in the label-noise situation. The presented method was tested in two difficult situations (a small training sample case and a training sample set without joint labeling), so that the robustness and accuracy of the approach can be expected to be of a similar or better quality in cases with more training samples. Given its effectiveness and robustness, the proposed method could be widely applied in LULC change dynamic monitoring.

TI  - Driving Factors and Future Prediction of Land Use and Cover Change Based on Satellite Remote Sensing Data by the LCM Model: A Case Study from Gansu Province, China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and cover change (LUCC) is an important issue affecting the global environment, climate change, and sustainable development. Detecting and predicting LUCC, a dynamic process, and its driving factors will help in formulating effective land use and planning policy suitable for local conditions, thus supporting local socioeconomic development and global environmental protection. In this study, taking Gansu Province as a case study example, we explored the LUCC pattern and its driving mechanism from 1980 to 2018, and predicted land use and cover in 2030 using the integrated LCM (Logistic-Cellular Automata-Markov chain) model and data from satellite remote sensing. The results suggest that the LUCC pattern was more reasonable in the second stage (2005 to 2018) compared with that in the first stage (1980 to 2005). This was because a large area of green lands was protected by ecological engineering in the second stage. From 1980 to 2018, in general, natural factors were the main force influencing changes in land use and cover in Gansu, while the effects of socioeconomic factors were not significant because of the slow development of economy. Landscape indices analysis indicated that predicted land use and cover in 2030 under the ecological protection scenario would be more favorable than under the historical trend scenario. Besides, results from the present study suggested that LUCC in arid and semiarid area could be well detected by the LCM model. This study would hopefully provide theoretical instructions for future land use planning and management, as well as a new methodology reference for LUCC analysis in arid and semiarid regions.

TI  - Earth Observation and Cloud Computing in Support of Two Sustainable Development Goals for the River Nile Watershed Countries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In September 2015, the members of United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with universal applicability of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets. The SDGs are consequential for the development of the countries in the Nile watershed, which are affected by water scarcity and experiencing rapid urbanization associated with population growth. Earth Observation (EO) has become an important tool to monitor the progress and implementation of specific SDG targets through its wide accessibility and global coverage. In addition, the advancement of algorithms and tools deployed in cloud computing platforms provide an equal opportunity to use EO for developing countries with limited technological capacity. This study applies EO and cloud computing in support of the SDG 6 "clean water and sanitation" and SDG 11 "sustainable cities and communities" in the seven Nile watershed countries through investigations of EO data related to indicators of water stress (Indicator 6.4.2) and urbanization and living conditions (Indicators 11.3.1 and 11.1.1), respectively. Multiple approaches including harmonic, time series and correlational analysis are used to assess and evaluate these indicators. In addition, a contemporary deep-learning classifier, fully convolution neural networks (FCNN), was trained to classify the percentage of impervious surface areas. The results show the spatial and temporal water recharge pattern among different regions in the Nile watershed, as well as the urbanization in selected cities of the region. It is noted that the classifier trained from the developed countries (i.e., the United States) is effective in identifying modern communities yet limited in monitoring rural and slum regions.

TI  - Glacier Changes and Their Linkage to the Climate-Topographic Context in the Borohoro Mountains, Tian Shan 1977-2018
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Against the backdrop of climate change and socio-ecological sustainability, studying glacier changes provides essential knowledge to the basic water needs and security for regions and populations under such threats, such as Central Asia. Little attention has focused on glaciers in the northern periphery of the Chinese Tian Shan. This study aims to map a recent glacier inventory and examine the glacier area shrinkage and surface elevation change for the central massif of the Borohoro Mountains in the past 41 years. Using declassified Hexagon images (1977), Landsat 5 TM (1994 and 2007), Sentinel 2A (2018) and altimetry data from the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) over 2003-2009 with the 30-m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model, multi-temporal glacier fluctuations and the influence of topographic and climatic factors were investigated. Results show that the glacier area decreased from 287.5 +/- 8.2 km(2) in 1977 to 215.8 +/- 4.1 km(2) in 2018, at a rate of 0.61 +/- 0.01% year(-1). Glacier disintegration has led to a gradual increase in the number of glaciers and reached 224 glaciers in 2018. The shrinkage was at the highest rate during the 1994-2007 period and the smallest during 1977-1994. Glacier size, hypsometry, and median, maximum, and range of elevation are the most significantly correlated parameters with the relative area change. The surface elevation changes from two of the largest glaciers revealed a stronger thinning on the southern slope compared to the northern slope. These observations of glacier loss are primarily driven by the marked warming trend since the 1970s and confirmed with the overall pattern of glacier retreat in the Tian Shan from previous studies.

TI  - Constraining the Milky Way Mass Profile with Phase-space Distribution of Satellite Galaxies
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimate the Milky Way (MW) halo properties using satellite kinematic data including the latest measurements from Gaia DR2. With a simulation-based 6D phase-space distribution function (DF) of satellite kinematics, we can infer halo properties efficiently and without bias, and handle the selection function and measurement errors rigorously in the Bayesian framework. Applying our DF from the EAGLE simulation to 28 satellites, we obtain an MW halo mass of M = 1.23(-0.18)(+0.21) x 10(12)M(circle dot) and a concentration of c = 9.4(-2.1)(+2.8) with the prior based on the M-c relation. The inferred mass profile is consistent with previous measurements but with better precision and reliability due to the improved methodology and data. Potential improvement is illustrated by combining satellite data and stellar rotation curves. Using our EAGLE DF and best-fit MW potential, we provide much more precise estimates of the kinematics for those satellites with uncertain measurements. Compared to the EAGLE DF, which matches the observed satellite kinematics very well, the DF from the semi-analytical model based on the dark-matter-only simulation Millennium II (SAM-MII) over-represents satellites with small radii and velocities. We attribute this difference to less disruption of satellites with small pericenter distances in the SAM-MII simulation. By varying the disruption rate of such satellites in this simulation, we estimate a similar to 5% scatter in the inferred MW halo mass among hydrodynamics-based simulations.

TI  - Two Genetically Distinct <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> Duffy Binding Protein Alpha Region II (PkDBPαII) Haplotypes Demonstrate Higher Binding Level to Fy(a plus b plus ) Erythrocytes than Fy(a plus b-) Erythrocytes
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasion of human erythrocytes by merozoites of Plasmodium knowlesi involves interaction between the P. knowlesi Duffy binding protein alpha region II (PkDBP alpha II) and Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARCs) on the erythrocytes. Information is scarce on the binding level of PkDBP alpha II to different Duffy antigens, Fy(a) and Fy(b). This study aims to measure the binding level of two genetically distinct PkDBP alpha II haplotypes to Fy(a+b-) and Fy(a+b+) human erythrocytes using erythrocyte-binding assay. The binding level of PkDBP alpha II of Peninsular Malaysian and Malaysian Borneon haplotypes to erythrocytes was determined by counting the number of rosettes formed in the assay. Overall, the Peninsular Malaysian haplotype displayed higher binding activity than the Malaysian Borneon haplotype. Both haplotypes exhibit the same preference to Fy(a+b+) compared with Fy(a+b-), hence justifying the vital role of Fy(b) in the binding to PkDBP alpha II. Further studies are needed to investigate the P. knowlesi susceptibility on individuals with different Duffy blood groups.

TI  - An Explicit and Scene-Adapted Definition of Convex Self-Similarity Prior With Application to Unsupervised Sentinel-2 Super-Resolution
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 satellite, launched by the European Space Agency, plays a critical role in various Earth observation missions. However, the spatial resolutions of Sentinel-2 images are different across its spectral bands, including four bands with a resolution of 10 m, six bands with a resolution of 20 m, and three bands with a resolution of 60 m. To facilitate the effectiveness of analyzing these images, super-resolving of the low-/medium-resolution bands to a higher resolution is desired. As in any image restoration inverse problems, we exploit image self-similarity, a commonly observed property in natural images, which underlies the state-of-the-art techniques, e.g., in image denoising. However, the design of self-similarity priors in nondiagonal inverse problems is challenging; often, a denoiser based on self-similarity is plugged into the iterations of an algorithm, without a guarantee of convergence in general. In this article, for the first time, we introduce a convex and scene-adapted regularizer built explicitly on a self-similarity graph directly learned from the Sentinel-2 images. We then develop a fast algorithm, termed Sentinel-2 super-resolution via scene-adapted self-similarity (SSSS). We experimentally show the superiority of SSSS over four commonly observed scenes, indicating the potential usage of our convex self-similarity regularization in other imaging inverse problems.

TI  - Targeting Pyruvate Carboxylase by a Small Molecule Suppresses Breast Cancer Progression
T2  - ADVANCED SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid metabolism differentiates cancer cells from normal cells and relies on anaplerotic pathways. However, the mechanisms of anaplerosis-associated enzymes are rarely understood. The lack of potent and selective antimetabolism drugs restrains further clinical investigations. A small molecule ZY-444 ((N-4-((5-(4-(benzyloxy)phenyl)-2-thiophenyl)methyl)-N-2-isobutyl-2,4-pyrimidinediamine) is discovered to inhibit cancer cell proliferation specifically, having potent efficacies against tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence. ZY-444 binds to cellular pyruvate carboxylase (PC), a key anaplerotic enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and inactivates its catalytic activity. PC inhibition suppresses breast cancer growth and metastasis through inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin/Snail signaling pathway. Lower PC expression in patient tumors is correlated with significant survival benefits. Comparative profiles of PC expression in cancer versus normal tissues implicate the tumor selectivity of ZY-444. Overall, ZY-444 holds promise therapeutically as an anti-cancer metabolism agent.

TI  - Parallel Subjective Well-Being and Choice Experiment Evaluation of Ecosystem Services: Marine and Forest Reserves in Coastal Oregon, USA
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - There is significant policy and research interest in (a) ecosystem services as a framework for understanding the benefits humans receive from natural systems and (b) subjective well-being as a lens for understanding the effects of public policy decisions. The present study occurred at the intersection of these two fields. Choice experiment and contingent subjective well-being (SWB) models were estimated to understand the potential effects of coastal marine and forest reserves in Oregon, USA. Both models indicated heterogeneity in effects across groups defined by environmental worldview and, for marine reserves, recreation use of reserve areas and employment in the commercial fisheries sector. Methodologically, results suggested that a similar process underlays responses to both types of survey task, with similar model coefficient patterns and frequent consistency in responses. However, differences also were indicated, and differences may be more pronounced in other studies, such as those involving between-subject designs. Contingent SWB is a potentially important measurement approach, but further evaluation is needed, including with respect to the effects of task complexity and evaluation object salience.

TI  - Outpatient treatment of imported uncomplicated <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria: results from a survey among TropNet and GeoSentinel experts for tropical medicine
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Plasmodium falciparum malaria (P.f. malaria) is frequently imported to non-endemic countries. Recommendations on outpatient treatment differ largely due to differences in country-level guidelines and even between tropical medicine referral centres within the same country.Methods: This survey among experts from TropNet or GeoSentinel referral centres for tropical medicine outside malaria endemic areas investigated common practices in P.f. malaria management, selection criteria for outpatient management and diagnostic procedures as a first step for developing a future common and evidence-based approach.Results: A total of 44 referral centres participated. Most of the centres are located in Europe (n = 37). Overall, 27 centres (61%) treat uncomplicated P.f. malaria patients as outpatients, of which eight centres (18%) reported treating >= 75% of patients on an outpatient basis. Seventeen centres (39%) reported treating patients only as inpatients. No single criterion stands out for the decision regarding outpatient treatment, but three groups of factors were identified: (i) clinical criteria including laboratory parameters, clinical condition and tolerance of oral medication; (ii) factors such as patient compliance, reachability by phone and support at home and (iii) patient origin and place of residence as a proxy for possible underlying semi-immunity. The threshold parasitaemia for outpatient treatment varied from 0.1 to 5% with a median of 2%. A median of 0.5% of outpatients were admitted during follow-up. During the last 10 years, 33 complications were reported by nine of the 27 centres and three deaths by one centre.Conclusion: This study gives insight into the heterogeneous management of P.f. malaria patients outside endemic regions. Although there is no consensus among experts, the majority of centres includes outpatient treatment in their clinical routine. However, the lack of evidence-based criteria and established safety for this approach shows the need for prospective studies to define and evaluate criteria and practices for safe outpatient management.

TI  - Nodal recurrence patterns on PET/CT after RTOG-based nodal radiotherapy for prostate cancer
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Biochemical failure after external beam radiotherapy (RT) for node-positive prostate cancer (PCN+) frequently involves nodal recurrences, in most cases out of field. This raises the question if current RTOG-based elective nodal fields can still be considered optimal. Modern diagnostic tools like PSMA PET/CT and choline PET/CT can visualize nodal recurrences with unprecedented accuracy. We evaluated recurrence patterns on PET/CT after RT for PCN+, with the aim to explore options for improved nodal target definition.Methods and materials: Data of all patients treated with curative intent EBRT for PCN+ in NKI-AVL from 2008 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. EBRT comprised 70 Gy to the prostate or 66-70 Gy to the prostate bed, 60 Gy to involved nodes, and 52,5-56 Gy (46 Gy EQD2) to RTOG-based elective nodal fields, in 35 fractions. Locations of recurrences on PET/CT were noted, and nodal locations were correlated with the applied EBRT fields.Results: 42 patients received PSMA (28) or choline (14) PET/CT at biochemical recurrence. 35 patients (83%) had a positive scan. At their first positive scan 17 patients had nodal metastasis, in some cases together with a local recurrence or distant disease. In-field nodal recurrences were uncommon (n = 3). Out-field nodal recurrences occurred more frequently (n = 14), with the majority (n = 12) just above the elective nodal field. These nodes were the single area of detectable failure in 6 patients (14%).Conclusions: Current RT with RTOG-based nodal fields for PCN+ provides good in-field tumour control, but frequent out-field nodal recurrences suggest missed microscopic locations. Expanding elective fields to include the aorta bifurcation may prolong recurrence-free survival. Future research must address whether the potential benefits of this strategy outbalance additional toxicity. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Long-term variation of trochid populations in an Irish sea lough
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snapshot assessments of species, which live for a number of years, are often misleading if they are conducted at an inappropriately short temporal scale. Densities of the trochid gastropods Steromphala umbilicalis (da Costa, 1778) and S. cineraria (Linnaeus, 1758) fluctuated widely between 1996 and 2014 at ten rockyshore sites within Lough Hyne, southwest Ireland. Between 2014 and 2019, the abundance of S. cineraria decreased to levels not seen in the previous two decades. This significant reduction was possibly in response to extreme dissolved oxygen fluctuations related to eutrophication of the semi-enclosed lough. Steromphala umbilicalis showed low density in 2018 and 2019, but this was within the limits of interannual fluctuations. The Lusitanian trochid Phorcus lineatus (da Costa, 1778) was first recorded by us in the lough in the early 2000s, just as it was establishing a flourishing population with densities of c. 6 snails/0.25 m(2). Although this native trochid survived the cold winters of 2009-2012, the population suffered high adult mortality and little recruitment. Between 2013 and 2019, the population increased and the population density stabilized. The increase in P. lineatus reflects its position high on the shore, where air temperatures have risen over the last two decades. It may, therefore, be a sentinel species to detect the effects of climate change. By contrast, the decrease in S. cineraria was related to its shallow subtidal habitat where hypoxia and superoxia have recently become marked in the lough. This trochid, therefore, offers potential as an indicator of eutrophication-associated stress. These temporal variations in trochid species emphasize the need for longer term assessments when estimating the importance of any one species to the ecosystem.

TI  - Adaptive Contrast Enhancement of Optical Imagery Based on Level of Detail (LOD)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The viewing and sharing of remote sensing optical imagery through the World Wide Web is an efficient means for providing information to the general public and decision makers. Since clouds and hazes inevitably limit the contrast and deteriorate visual effects, only cloudless scenes are usually included and presented in existing web mapping services. This work proposes a level-of-detail (LOD) based enhancement approach to present satellite imagery with an adaptively enhanced contrast determined by its viewing LOD. Compared to existing web mapping services, this new approach provides a better visual effect as well as spectral details of satellite imagery for cases partially covered with clouds or cirrocumulus clouds. The full archive of global satellite imagery, either the existing one or the one collected in the future, can be utilized and shared through the Web with the processing proposed in this new approach.

TI  - Analysis of Imported Cases of COVID-19 in Taiwan: A Nationwide Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the early stages of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, containment of disease importation from epidemic areas was essential for outbreak control. This study is based on publicly accessible data on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan extracted from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control website. We analysed the characteristics, infection source, symptom presentation, and route of identification of the 321 imported cases that were identified from 21 January to 6 April 2020. They were mostly returned Taiwanese citizens who had travelled to one or more of 37 countries for tourism, business, work, or study. Half of these cases developed symptoms before arrival, most of the remainder developed symptoms 1-13 days (mean 4.0 days) after arrival, and 3.4% never developed symptoms. Three-quarters of the cases had respiratory symptoms, 44.9% had fever, 13.1% lost smell or taste, and 7.2% had diarrhoea. Body temperature and symptom screening at airports identified 32.7% of the cases. Of the remainder, 27.7% were identified during home quarantining, 16.2% were identified via contact tracing, and 23.4% were reported by hospitals. Under the strict enforcement of these measures, the incidence of locally acquired COVID-19 cases in Taiwan remains sporadic. In conclusion, proactive border control measures are effective for preventing community transmission of this disease.

TI  - Probabilistic River Water Mapping from Landsat-8 Using the Support Vector Machine Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - River water extent is essential for river hydrological surveys. Traditional methods for river water mapping often result in significant uncertainties. This paper proposes a support vector machine (SVM)-based river water mapping method that can quantify the extraction uncertainties simultaneously. Five specific bands of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data were selected to construct the feature set. Considering the effect of terrain, a widely used terrain index called height above nearest drainage, calculated from the 1 arc-second Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM), was also added into the feature set. With this feature set, a posterior probability SVM model was established to extract river water bodies and quantify the uncertainty with posterior probabilities. Three river sections in Northwestern China were selected as the case study areas, considering their different river characteristics and geographical environment. Then, the reliability and stability of the proposed method were evaluated through comparisons with the traditional Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and modified NDWI (mNDWI) methods and validated with higher-resolution Sentinel-2 images. It was found that resultant probability maps obtained by the proposed SVM method achieved generally high accuracy with a weighted root mean square difference of less than 0.1. Other accuracy indices including the Kappa coefficient and critical success index also suggest that the proposed method outperformed the traditional water index methods in terms of river mapping accuracy and thresholding stability. Finally, the proposed method resulted in the ability to separate water bodies from hill shades more easily, ensuring more reliable river water mapping in mountainous regions.

TI  - The Impact of Permafrost Degradation on Lake Changes in the Endorheic Basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) have experienced significant changes, especially the prevailing lake expansion since 2000 in the endorheic basin. The influence of permafrost thawing on lake expansion is significant but rarely considered in previous studies. In this study, based on Landsat images and permafrost field data, the spatial-temporal area changes of lakes of more than 5 km(2) in the endorheic basin on the QTP during 2000-2017 is examined and the impact of permafrost degradation on lake expansion is discussed. The main results are that permafrost characteristics and its degradation trend have close relationships with lake changes. Lake expansion in the endorheic basin showed a southwest-northeast transition from shrinking to stable to rapidly expanding, which corresponded well with the permafrost distribution from island-discontinuous to seasonally frozen ground to continuous permafrost. A dramatic lake expansion in continuous permafrost showed significant spatial differences; lakes expanded significantly in northern and eastern continuous permafrost with a higher ground ice content but slightly in southern continuous permafrost with a lower ground ice content. This spatial pattern was mainly attributed to the melting of ground ice in shallow permafrost associated with accelerating permafrost degradation. Whereas, some lakes in the southern zones of island-discontinuous permafrost were shrinking, which was mainly because the extended taliks arising from the intensified permafrost degradation have facilitated surface water and suprapermafrost groundwater discharge to subpermafrost groundwater and thereby drained the lakes. Based on observation and simulated data, the melting of ground ice at shallow depths below the permafrost table accounted for 21.2% of the increase in lake volume from 2000 to 2016.

TI  - Geomorphologic Characteristics of Sandspit from the Yellow River Estuary: Impact on Land Cover Classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great importance to study the response of land cover classification to micro-geomorphic type, which is an important non-zonal environmental factor. In this study, digital elevation modeling and two pairs of synthetic aperture radar data captured by Landsat8 OLI in 2018 and Landsat5 TM in 2010 were used to interpret the relationship between the land cover classification and geomorphological type for sandspit from the Yellow River estuary, China. The results showed that water accounted for the largest proportion of the total study area (>40%), followed by Tamarix-Suaeda (18.59%), naked tidal-flat (13.25%), Tamarix-Phragmites australis (9.70%), Suaeda (5.35%), Phragmites australis (4.34%), Spartina alterniflora (4.28%), and scattered manmade objects (1.74%). The vegetation communities of the sandspit in the Yellow River delta were affected by the dual effects of seawater and river water, and presented a concentric, annular distribution trend towards the sea. Plants such as Spartina alterniflora and Suaeda heteropera were affected by the ocean and were mostly distributed in the estuarine coastal area. Phragmites australis communities were greatly affected by the river, and were mostly distributed around the river banks and farther away from the coast.

TI  - Model-based reconstruction of the <i>Ulysse</i>-<i>Virginia</i> oil spill, October-November 2018
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to the oil spill caused by the collision between the Ro-Ro ship Ulysse and CSL Virginia on 7th October 2018, the Lagrangian oil spill model MEDSLIK-II was utilized to predict spill transport and fate. Oil drift was forced by the high-resolution sea circulation provided by CMEMS and the ECMWF wind. Successive model runs were restarted 5 times with the distinct overflight- and satellite-derived observations provided by REMPEC and the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission. The results were verified based on the ability to predict the first oil-beaching event that happened near Saint-Tropez (France) in the early afternoon of 16th October. Despite the general consistency among the runs, only the last initialization was able to forecast the oil beaching. Stochastic MEDSLIK-II simulations forced by the historical meteo-oceanographic datasets 2014-2018 revealed that the coastlines between Cap Lardier and the Gulf of Saint-Tropez were among the most impacted areas.

TI  - Potential of Pleiades and WorldView-3 Tri-Stereo DSMs to Represent Heights of Small Isolated Objects
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution stereo and multi-view imagery are used for digital surface model (DSM) derivation over large areas for numerous applications in topography, cartography, geomorphology, and 3D surface modelling. Dense image matching is a key component in 3D reconstruction and mapping, although the 3D reconstruction process encounters difficulties for water surfaces, areas with no texture or with a repetitive pattern appearance in the images, and for very small objects. This study investigates the capabilities and limitations of space-borne very high resolution imagery, specifically Pleiades (0.70 m) and WorldView-3 (0.31 m) imagery, with respect to the automatic point cloud reconstruction of small isolated objects. For this purpose, single buildings, vehicles, and trees were analyzed. The main focus is to quantify their detectability in the photogrammetrically-derived DSMs by estimating their heights as a function of object type and size. The estimated height was investigated with respect to the following parameters: building length and width, vehicle length and width, and tree crown diameter. Manually measured object heights from the oriented images were used as a reference. We demonstrate that the DSM-based estimated height of a single object strongly depends on its size, and we quantify this effect. Starting from very small objects, which are not elevated against their surroundings, and ending with large objects, we obtained a gradual increase of the relative heights. For small vehicles, buildings, and trees (lengths <7 pixels, crown diameters <4 pixels), the Pleiades-derived DSM showed less than 20% or none of the actual object's height. For large vehicles, buildings, and trees (lengths >14 pixels, crown diameters >7 pixels), the estimated heights were higher than 60% of the real values. In the case of the WorldView-3 derived DSM, the estimated height of small vehicles, buildings, and trees (lengths <16 pixels, crown diameters <8 pixels) was less than 50% of their actual height, whereas larger objects (lengths >33 pixels, crown diameters >16 pixels) were reconstructed at more than 90% in height.

TI  - Andean rhapsody. Intertextuality of weaving and raising at the beginning of the second millennium (Antofagasta de La Sierra, Southern Puna of Argentina)
T2  - ARQUEOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This work focuses on the analysis of a textile, by integrating different "layers" (structural, aesthetic, taxonomical), and different observation scales (macro and microscopic). This approach is complemented by an examination of the artefactual and spatio-temporal context associated with the fabric (Antofagasta de la Sierra, ca. 1200 years A.D.). This includes the use of various physico-chemical characterization techniques: X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (SEM-EDS), and particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), as well as forensic studies. Based on an animistic and relational worldview, and supported by historical and ethnographic information from the southern Andean area, an active role (agency) for the different textile features identified in the successive contexts of use/function of the fabric is proposed. These elements materialize the "assembly" of different combined entities in the textile, which is interpreted within the framework of Andean rituality practices, linked with propitiatory offerings.

TI  - Exploring the Spatial Characteristics of Typhoon-Induced Vegetation Damages in the Southeast Coastal Area of China from 2000 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeast coastal area of China (SCAC), a typhoon-prone area with a long coastline, suffers severe damage from typhoons almost every year. Exploring the spatial characteristics of historical typhoon-induced vegetation damage (VD) is crucial to predicting VD after severe typhoon landfalls and improving strategies for vegetation protection and restoration. Remote sensing is an efficient and feasible approach for measuring large-scale VD caused by natural disasters. This paper, by exploring the spatial distribution of VD of every severe landfalling typhoon with Google Earth Engine (GEE), aims to reveal the spatial characteristics of typhoon-induced VD in SCAC. Firstly, the values of disaster vegetation damage index (DVDI), difference in enhanced vegetation index (DEVI), and normalized difference vegetation index (DNDVI) for the 28 selected landing typhoons in SCAC were calculated and compared by using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in GEE. Secondly, every DVDI image was overlaid with land cover, elevation, relative aspect and typhoon path layers in ArcGIS. Thirdly, spatial characteristics of VD were revealed with the aid of spatial statistical analysis. The study found that: (1) DVDI is a more effective index for evaluating VD caused by typhoons. (2) The Pearl River Delta is the most severe VD region. The severe VD regions for four typhoon groups have significantly spatial correlation with typhoon-landing locations. (3) Forests are ranked the first in terms of damaged areas by typhoon in every year, followed by sparse forests. (4) Topography has no influence on VD by a single typhoon event, and relative aspect has no correlation with VD caused by typhoons in SCAC.

TI  - An Improved Cloud Detection Method for GF-4 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are significant barriers to the application of optical remote sensing images. Accurate cloud detection can help to remove contaminated pixels and improve image quality. Many cloud detection methods have been developed. However, traditional methods either rely heavily on thermal infrared bands or clear-sky images. When traditional cloud detection methods are used with Gaofen 4 (GF-4) imagery, it is very difficult to separate objects with similar spectra, such as ice, snow, and bright sand, from clouds. In this paper, we propose a new method, named Real-Time-Difference (RTD), to detect clouds using a pair of images obtained by the GF-4 satellite. The RTD method has four main steps: (1) data preprocessing, including transforming digital value (DN) to Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and orthographic and geometric correction; (2) the computation of a series of cloud indexes for a single image to highlight clouds; (3) the calculation of the difference between a pair of real-time images in order to obtain moved clouds; and (4) confirming the clouds and background by analyzing their physical and dynamic features. The RTD method was validated in three sites located in the Hainan, Liaoning, and Xinjiang areas of China. The results were compared with those of a popular classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results showed that RTD outperformed SVM; for the Hainan, Liaoning, and Xinjiang areas, respectively, the overall accuracy of RTD reached 95.9%, 94.1%, and 93.9%, and its Kappa coefficient reached 0.92, 0.88, and 0.88. In the future, we expect RTD to be developed into an important means for the rapid detection of clouds that can be used on images from geostationary orbit satellites.

TI  - Remote Sensing Retrieval of Total Phosphorus in the Pearl River Channels Based on the GF-1 Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Total phosphorus (TP) concentration is one of the indicators for surface water quality evaluation. In this study, an indirect algorithm was proposed to retrieve TP concentration. This algorithm retrieves the TP concentration in urban waters based on Gaofen-1 (GF-1) remote sensing data. The algorithm uses the correlation between remote-sensing reflectance, optically significant constituents of water (chlorophyll, suspended sediment, and organic matter (excluding algae)), and TP to establish a retrieval model. First, the concentrations of optically active components are retrieved using a semi-analytical model. Second, the correlation between TP and optically active components is used to retrieve the TP concentration in waters. The GF-1 remote sensing data for 7 August 2015 were used to perform remote sensing retrieval of TP concentration in the Pearl River channels in Guangzhou, China. The results show that the TP concentration in most areas of the Front Channel, Western Channel, Guangzhou Channel, and the western part of the Back Channel was higher than 0.2 mg/L, while the TP concentration in the middle and eastern parts of the Back Channel was generally lower than 0.2 mg/L. The mean absolute percentage error of the retrieval is 24.18%. The experimental results show that the model is suitable for remote sensing retrieval of TP in urban waters in Guangzhou.

TI  - Small Arctic rivers mapped from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and ArcticDEM
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Small rivers (< 30 m) are significant components of terrestrial river networks and remote sensing is a necessary tool to study them at the global scale. However, current global hydrography data products generally include only rivers that are wider than 30 m, neglecting smaller waterways and thus limiting our understanding of surface water processes, especially in remote areas. We present a new automated methodology to map two Arctic actively-flowing river networks (Kotuy and Coleen Rivers, with study areas of similar to 12,000 km(2) and 10,000 km2, respectively), including small rivers as narrow as 10 m from Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery and high-resolution ArcticDEM digital elevation data. First, preliminary river network masks were generated by using Gabor filtering and path opening morphological operations on Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) images. Second, ArcticDEM data were employed to simulate surface flow paths, and the resultant drainage networks were used to create river areas of interest (AOI) and subsequently eliminate non-water features outside the river AOI. Third, gaps along remotely sensed small river channels were filled using the ArcticDEM-modeled drainage networks, yielding continuous river networks with high spatial resolution. We compared the 10 m Sentinel-ArcticDEM merged River Network (SARN) with the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and four 30 m Landsat-derived hydrography data products (GSW, GRWL, FROM-GLC 2017, and G3WBM). We conclude: (1) SARNs have similar quality to the> 1st order NHD (> 70% of NHD streams appear in SARNs). (2) At a reach scale, SARNs include more small rivers with the drainage densities at least similar to 4.5 times larger than Landsat-derived hydrography data products. Similarly, coupling ArcticDEM data with 30 m Landsat satellite images increases resultant drainage densities approximately three-fold. (3) At a catchment scale, merging remotely sensed river networks with ArcticDEM-modeled drainage networks significantly improves river connectivity (defined as the longest connected river length) with at least a ten-fold increase over the other hydrography data products examined here. In sum, merging high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery with ArcticDEM data enable effective, continuous mapping of complex fluvial drainage patterns of Arctic rivers.

TI  - Seasonal and Annual Changes of the Regional Tropical Belt in GPS-RO Measurements and Reanalysis Datasets
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The width of the tropical belt has been analyzed with a variety of metrics, often based on zonal-mean data from reanalyses. However, constraining the global and regional tropical width requires both a global spatial-resolving observational dataset and an appropriate metric to take advantage of such data. The tropical tropopause break is arguably such a metric. This study aims to evaluate the performance of different reanalyses and metrics with a focus on depicting regional tropical belt width. We choose four distinct tropopause-break metrics derived from global positioning system radio occultation (GPS-RO) satellite data and four modern reanalyses (ERA-Interim, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and CFSR). We show that reanalyses generally reproduce the regional tropical tropopause break to within 10 degrees of that in GPS-RO data-but that the tropical width is somewhat sensitive (within 4 degrees) to how data are averaged zonally, moderately sensitive (within 10 degrees) to the dataset resolution, and more sensitive (20 degrees over the Northern Hemisphere Atlantic Ocean during June-August) to the choice of metric. Reanalyses capture the poleward displacement of the tropical tropopause break over land and equatorward displacement over ocean during summertime, and the reverse during the wintertime. Reanalysis-based tropopause breaks are also generally well correlated with those from GPS-RO, although CFSR reproduces 14-yr trends much more closely than others (including ERA-Interim). However, it is hard to say which dataset is the best match of GPS-RO. We further find that the tropical tropopause break is representative of the subtropical jet latitude and the Northern Hemisphere edge of the Hadley circulation in terms of year-to-year variations.

TI  - Detection of Lactate Dehydrogenase Elevating Virus in a Mouse Vivarium Using an Exhaust Air Dust Health Monitoring Program
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) continues to be one of the most common contaminants of cells and cell byproducts. As such, many institutions require that tumor cell lines, blood products, and products derived or passaged in rodent tissues are free of LDV as well as other pathogens that are on institutional exclusion lists prior to their use in rodents. LDV is difficult to detect by using a live-animal sentinel health monitoring program because the virus does not reliably pass to sentinel animals. After switching to an exhaust air dust health monitoring system, our animal resources center was able to detect a presumably long-standing LDV infection in a mouse colony. This health monitoring system uses IVC rack exhaust air dust collection media in conjunction with PCR analysis. Ultimately, the source of the contamination was identified as multiple LDV-positive patient-derived xenografts and multiple LDV-positive breeding animals. This case study is the first to demonstrate the use of environmental PCR testing as a method for detecting LDV infection in a mouse vivarium.

TI  - Evaluating the influences of harvesting activity and eutrophication on loss of aquatic vegetations in Taihu Lake, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A rapid degradation of aquatic vegetations in Taihu Lake has roused a wide attention in recent years. Giving large-scale harvesting activity on aquatic vegetation since 2012, whether water eutrophication or the human harvest activity induced the degradation remains controversial and unclear. In this study, based on Landsat and HJ-CCD data acquired from 1984 to 2016 and a 12-year field observation (2005-2016) of water quality, a method was proposed to quantitatively assess impacts of harvesting activity and water quality change on degradations of both floating-leaved aquatic vegetation (FAV) and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in Taihu Lake. First, areas of FAV and SAV covers from 1984 to 2016 in Taihu Lake were mapped using the satellite data, and then the mapped areas were modified to those on a reference date by using phenological curves of FAV and SAV covers. Next, correlations between water quality data and FAV and SAV covers were analyzed by using Pearson correlation analysis based on the data before implementing the human harvesting activity (i.e., before 2012), and multiple general linear models were established based on the selected water quality variables with p-value < 0.01 for estimating covers of FAV and SAV from 2012 to 2016. Finally, based on the predicted areas of FAV and SAV covers by the models and the modified areas mapped from satellite data, the influences of water eutrophication and the human harvesting activity on the degradation of FAV and SAV covers were quantitatively assessed. The results indicated that (1) FAV cover exhibited a significant increase from 1984 to 2011 and then a rapid decrease, while SAV cover increased significantly before 2003 and then obviously declined; (2) water level (WL) and total nitrogen (TN) showed significantly negative correlations with FAV and SAV covers, while secchi disk depth (SDD) and SDD/WL had significantly positive correlations with FAV and SAV covers; (3) the human harvesting activity made a major contribution to the loss of FAV cover, and the degradation of SAV cover was mainly due to an increased lake eutrophication and deteriorated underwater light environment. The findings derived from this study could offer a guidance for Taihu Lake ecological restoration and effective management.

TI  - Impact of land use and urbanization on river water quality and ecology in a dam dominated basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving water quality and ecological status is an important foundation for sustainability development. Increasing human activity and the corresponding land use change lead to the deterioration of river water quality (WQ) and water ecology (WE), but the pathway is complex, especially in dam dominated basins with the altered streamflow by the joint regulation of multiple dams and sluices that leads to changes in WQ seasonally. However, the research on this issue is inadequate and it is urgently needed since a large number of dams and sluices have been built worldwide for socioeconomic benefits, putting the basin's WQ and WE under pressure. Based on water ecological experiment, a framework was proposed to assess the impact of land use (LU) and urbanization on WQ and WE in different scenarios derived from human activities (low, and intense) and seasonality (winter, and summer) in a dam dominated basin. The framework was applied to the Shaying River Basin located in the Central China as a case study. The remote sensing of Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS images and Geographic Information System (GIS) were combined by using the support vector machine classification method to extract the land use patterns and to map the spatial distribution diagrams of WQ and WE indicators based on in-situ experimental data. A canonical correlation analysis method and Pearson correlation testing were adopted to evaluate the impact of LU and urbanization on WQ and WE in the basin. Results showed that LU and urbanization had a great impact on WE compared to WQ due to the slow reaction of ecosystem in the basin. Because the former was resulted by long-term regulation of dams and sluices, and the latter was related to the short-term changes of river environment. Moreover, the former was attributed to the latter largely. LU and urbanization impact on WQ had a significant seasonality with higher impact in winter than in summer, and the seasonality of the impact was weakened as the disturbance of LU and urbanization increased. The seasonal variation of WE indicators was almost not significant in our study due to their adaptability to surrounding environment. Our results provide insights to water resources management and ecological restoration in the Shaying River Basin and other similar basins with intensive dams and sluices.

TI  - Forest fire spread model based on the grey system theory
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate prediction of forest fire spread is very essential for minimizing its effects. Although many models have been developed to predict the forest fire spread, all these models require several parameters, sometimes, cannot be obtained in a real time. In this paper, the grey system theory was applied for forest fire spread model developing. By preprocessing and fusing the MODIS remote sensing data, the sequence data of the grey model can be confirmed. After making precision comparison among least square estimation algorithm, least square interpolation algorithm and ER algorithm, forest fire spread GM(1, 1) model was developed with ER algorithm and precision of the model was evaluated at the same time. The results showed that the fitting precision and predicting precision of the model were both high, of which the one-level model made up 50%, the two-level 25% and the model between the one-level and the two-level 25%. The prediction accuracy of forest fire spreading model was tested to meet the requirement of modeling. GM(1, 1) model provided a new approach for the study of forest fire spread simulation.

TI  - MAIAC Thermal Technique for Smoke Injection Height From MODIS
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new algorithm to derive smoke plume height (H-a) using the thermal contrast from the rising mixture of aerosol and emitted gases in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 11-mu m channel. Validation shows good agreement with the wind-corrected Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR)-MISR Interactive Explorer (MINX) values, with about 60% of the MODIS Terra thermal retrievals within 500 m of MISR H-a and 450 m lower on average. The bias is expected because the thermal technique represents an effective rather than a top plume height from MISR MINX. The comparison of MODIS Aqua retrievals with Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) shows similar statistics, with a standard deviation of 458 m for the mean plume height and 216 m lower on average. H-a is part of the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) MODIS Collection 6 suite of products (MCD19), accessible via the Land Product Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC). Aerosol injection height is reported in the daily MAIAC atmospheric product MCD19A2 along with the cloud mask (CM), column water vapor, aerosol optical depth (AOD), AOD uncertainty, and aerosol type, at 1-km resolution on a global sinusoidal grid. Despite some limitations, the vastly increased coverage from MODIS observations makes it a valuable data set complementing the established MISR and CALIOP products.

TI  - Temporal and spatial changes and their driving forces of vegetation cover in Horqin Sandy Land in recent 40 years
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Horqin Sandy Land is a key area 14 the project of desertification prevention and control in China. In recent years, ecological engineering construction, human activities and vegetation growth in this area have been affected by climate change to some extent. Understanding dynamic change of regional vegetation can provide scientific basis for the comprehensive control of the sandy land and reasonable construction of ecological engineering. Consequently, the spatialtemporal variations and their driving factors of NDVI in Horqin Sandy Land were analyzed based on the dataset of NOAA-NDVI and MODIS-NDVI from 1981 to 2015, as well as meteorological and socio-economic data. The results showed that from 1981 to 2015, NDVI showed a fluctuating increase trend (with a growth rate of 0.00114 a(-1)). Spatially, areas with increasing NDVI (accounting 14 68.8% area) were mainly located in the southeast margin and part of the central region, while NDVI of the northwest margin of the study area was decreasing. The change process of NDVI in desertification areas of different degrees was first decreased (1981-2000) and then increased (2001-2015), indicating that vegetation destroyed in the early stage was restored in the later stage. Results of driving force analysis showed that precipitation and temperature were the factors driving NDVI changes in some areas of Horqin Sandy Land. Population change and the implementation of ecological engineering drove the spatial-temporal change of vegetation in this region. However, economic development was not a major factor driving vegetation change in this area.

TI  - Evaluating Responses of Temperature Regulating Service to Landscape Pattern Based on 'Source-Sink' Theory
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal remote sensing provides a method to describe spatial heterogeneity of the "urban heat island" effect and to evaluate the function of temperature regulation. Rapid urbanization and heatwave events with increasing frequencies need a quantitative analysis on the supply and demand for an urban temperature regulating service, which is a gap in urban heat island (UHI) studies in rapidly urbanizing cities. In order to study the quantitative relationship between landscape metrics (including area index and shape index) and temperature regulating service, this study applied a temperature regulating service in an urban thermal environment study based on the "source-sink" landscape theory in western Shenzhen in different periods. The identification of source and sink landscapes is based on the spatial relationship of unusual surface features derived from Landsat-5 and -8 and the consideration of the temperature difference. We found that the source landscapes at different periods provide temperature regulating services for different distances, which directly lead to the difference between the theoretical service value based on the Alternative Cost Method and the actual service value considering demand, changing in the same trend. The results show that the supply distance of temperature regulating services in 2005, 2010, and 2013 is 150 m, 180 m, and 210 m, respectively. The temperature regulating service value is 3.043, 3.273, and 4.308 billion yuan in 2005, 2010, and 2013, which is lower than the estimation value without considering supply and demand (16.638, 23.728, and 37.495 billion yuan, respectively). The value of the temperature regulating service has a positive correlation with the increase of the patch area index. With the gradual complexity of the shape, the service value increases first and then decreases. Moreover, the landscapes with the smallest shape index and area index have the shortest distance for service supplying. The assessment of the temperature regulating service needs to consider the presence of demand landscapes. Furthermore, the interaction of landscapes under different conditions requires further consideration. The setting of the cooling landscape shape and area for mitigating the "urban heat island" effect can provide references to urban planners and policymakers in the practice of urban climate adaptation and regulation.

TI  - Identifying Forest Fire Driving Factors and Related Impacts in China Using Random Forest Algorithm
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reasonable forest fire management measures can effectively reduce the losses caused by forest fires and forest fire driving factors and their impacts are important aspects that should be considered in forest fire management. We used the random forest model and MODIS Global Fire Atlas dataset (2010 similar to 2016) to analyse the impacts of climate, topographic, vegetation and socioeconomic variables on forest fire occurrence in six geographical regions in China. The results show clear regional differences in the forest fire driving factors and their impacts in China. Climate variables are the forest fire driving factors in all regions of China, vegetation variable is the forest fire driving factor in all other regions except the Northwest region and topographic variables and socioeconomic variables are only the driving factors of forest fires in a few regions (Northwest and Southwest regions). The model predictive capability is good: the AUC values are between 0.830 and 0.975, and the prediction accuracy is between 70.0% and 91.4%. High fire hazard areas are concentrated in the Northeast region, Southwest region and East China region. This research will aid in providing a national-scale understanding of forest fire driving factors and fire hazard distribution in China and help policymakers to design fire management strategies to reduce potential fire hazards.

TI  - Metatranscriptomic analysis of adaptive response of anammox bacteria <i>Candidatus</i> 'Kuenenia stuttgartiensis' to Zn(II) exposure
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Zn(II) is frequently detected in biological nitrogen removal systems treating high-strength wastewater (e.g., landfill leachate), yet the cellular defense strategies of anammox bacteria against Zn(II) cytotoxicity is largely unknown. To uncover survival mechanisms under Zn(II) stress, responses of enriched anammox bacteria Candidatus 'Kuenenia stuttgartiensis' under exposure of various levels of Zn (II) were investigated through metatranscriptomic sequencing. Although increasing Zn(II) levels (50, 100 and 150 mg/L) resulted in decreasing anammox activities (86.1 +/- 0.8%, 66.1 +/- 1.4% and 43.9 +/- 1.5% of the control, respectively), the viable cells in anammox sludge remained stable. Candidatus 'K. stuttgartiensis' possesses a complex network of regulatory systems to confer cells with the ability against Zn(II) toxicity, including functions related to substrate degradation, Zn(II) efflux, chelation, DNA repair, protein degradation, protein synthesis and signal transduction processes. Particularly, in order to maintain Zn(II) homeostasis, Candidatus 'K. stuttgartiensis' upregulated genes encoding RND efflux family (czcA, czcB, czcC, kustd1923 and kuste2279) for exporting Zn(II) actively. These heavy metal exporting genes could act as "sentinel genes" to detect the initial stage of Zn(II) inhibition on anammox bacteria, which might be beneficial to develop a diagnostic approach to predict the risk of operational failure when Zn(II) shock occurs.

TI  - Lichen cover mapping for caribou ranges in interior Alaska and Yukon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research indicates that the effects of climate warming, including shrub expansion and increased fire frequency may lead to declining lichen abundance in arctic tundra and northern alpine areas. Lichens are important forage for caribou (Rangifer tarandus), whose populations are declining throughout most of North America. To clarify how lichen cover might affect caribou resource selection, ecologists require better data on the spatial distribution and abundance of lichen. Here, we use a combination of field data and satellite imagery to model lichen cover for a 583 200 km(2) area that fully encompasses nine caribou ranges in interior Alaska and Yukon. We aggregated data from in situ vegetation plots, aerial survey polygons and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery to align with 30 m resolution Landsat pixels. We used these data to train a random forest model with a suite of environmental and spectral predictors to estimate lichen cover. We validated our lichen cover model using reserved training data and existing external datasets, and found that reserved data from aerial survey polygons (R-2 = 0.77) and UAV imagery (R-2 = 0.71) provided the best fit. We used our lichen cover map to evaluate the influence of estimated lichen cover on caribou resource selection in the Fortymile Herd from 2012 to 2018 during summer and winter. In both seasons, caribou avoided lichen-poor areas (0%-5% lichen cover) and showed stronger selection as lichen cover increased to similar to 30%, above which selection leveled off. Our results suggest that terrestrial lichen cover is an important factor influencing caribou resource selection in northern boreal forests across seasons. Our lichen cover map goes beyond existing maps of lichen abundance and distribution because it incorporates extensive field data for model training and validation and estimates lichen cover over a much larger spatial extent. We expect our landscape-scale map will be useful for understanding trends in lichen abundance and distribution, as well as for caribou research, management and conservation.

TI  - Performance of models predicting residual lymph node disease in melanoma patients following sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Among melanoma patients with a tumor-positive sentinel node biopsy (SNB), approximately 20% harbor disease in non-sentinel nodes (nSN), as determined by a completion lymph node dissection (CLND). CLND lacks a survival benefit and has high morbidity. This study assesses predictive factors for nSN metastasis and validates five models predicting nSN metastasis.Methods: Patients with invasive melanoma were identified from the BC Cancer Agency (2005-2015). Clinicopathological data were collected from 296 patients who underwent a CLND after a positive SNB. Multivariate analysis was completed to assess predictive variables in the study population. Five models were externally validated using overall model performance (Brier score [calibration and discrimination]) and discrimination (area under the ROC curve [AUC]).Results: Seventy-three patients had nSN metastasis at the time of CLND. The variable most predictive of nSN involvement was lymphovascular invasion (odds ratio [OR] 3.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67 -9.54; p = 0.002). The highest discrimination was Lee et al. (2004) (AUC 0.68 [95% CI 0.61-0.75]), Rossi et al. (2018) (AUC 0.68 [95% CI 0.57-0.77]), and Bertolli et al. (2019) (AUC 0.68 [95% CI 0.60-0.75]). Rossi et al. (2018) had the lowest overall model performance (Brier score 0.44). Rossi et al. (2018) and Bertolli et al. (2019) had the ability to stratify patients to a risk of nSN involvement up to 99% and 95%, respectively.Conclusion: Bertolli et al. (2019) had amongst the highest overall model performance, was the most clinically meaningful and is recommended as the preferred model for predicting nSN metastasis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We present evidence of volcano-tectonic interactions at Sabancaya volcano that we relate to episodic magma injection and high regional fluid pore pressures. We present a surface deformation time series at Sabancaya including observations from ERS-1/2, Envisat, Sentinel-1, COSMO-SkyMed, and TerraSAR-X that spans June 1992 to February 2019. These data show deep-seated inflation northwest of Sabancaya from 1992-1997 and 2013-2019, as well as creep and rupture on multiple faults. Afterslip on the Mojopampa fault following a 2013 M-W 5.9 earthquake is anomalously long lived, continuing for at least 6 years. The best fit fault plane for the afterslip is right-lateral motion on an EW striking fault at 1 km depth. We also model surface deformation from two 2017 earthquakes (M-W 4.4 and M-W 5.2) on unnamed faults, for which the best fit models are NW striking normal faults at 1-2 km depth. Our best fit model for a magmatic inflation source (13 km depth, volume change of 0.04 to 0.05 km(3) yr(-1)) induces positive Coulomb static stress changes on these modeled fault planes. Comparing these deformation results with evidence from satellite thermal and degassing data, field observations, and seismic records, we interpret strong pre-eruptive seismicity at Sabancaya as a consequence of magmatic intrusions destabilizing tectonic faults critically stressed by regionally high fluid pressures. High fluid pressure likely also promotes fault creep driven by static stress transfer from the inflation source. We speculate that combining high pore fluid pressures with sufficiently large, offset magmatic inflation can promote strong earthquakes during volcanic unrest.

TI  - Crop Monitoring Using Satellite/UAV Data Fusion and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-destructive crop monitoring over large areas with high efficiency is of great significance in precision agriculture and plant phenotyping, as well as decision making with regards to grain policy and food security. The goal of this research was to assess the potential of combining canopy spectral information with canopy structure features for crop monitoring using satellite/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data fusion and machine learning. Worldview-2/3 satellite data were tasked synchronized with high-resolution RGB image collection using an inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at a heterogeneous soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) field. Canopy spectral information (i.e., vegetation indices) was extracted from Worldview-2/3 data, and canopy structure information (i.e., canopy height and canopy cover) was derived from UAV RGB imagery. Canopy spectral and structure information and their combination were used to predict soybean leaf area index (LAI), aboveground biomass (AGB), and leaf nitrogen concentration (N) using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), and extreme learning regression (ELR) with a newly proposed activation function. The results revealed that: (1) UAV imagery-derived high-resolution and detailed canopy structure features, canopy height, and canopy coverage were significant indicators for crop growth monitoring, (2) integration of satellite imagery-based rich canopy spectral information with UAV-derived canopy structural features using machine learning improved soybean AGB, LAI, and leaf N estimation on using satellite or UAV data alone, (3) adding canopy structure information to spectral features reduced background soil effect and asymptotic saturation issue to some extent and led to better model performance, (4) the ELR model with the newly proposed activated function slightly outperformed PLSR, RFR, and SVR in the prediction of AGB and LAI, while RFR provided the best result for N estimation. This study introduced opportunities and limitations of satellite/UAV data fusion using machine learning in the context of crop monitoring.

TI  - Lymphoscintigraphy and radio-guided neck dissection in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUON
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The development of erratic distribution of cervical metastases from oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) bypassing the typical metastatic pattern can possibly challenge the role of the classic neck dissection. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of lymphoscintigraphy (LS) and radio-guided neck dissection as a simple and widely accessible method with a favorable cost/benefit ratio, able to improve the OSCC staging and possibly to tailor the surgical approach to cervical lymph node dissection.Methods: From June 2015 to December 2018, 16 patients (5 women, 11 men, median age 59.5 +/- 12.5 years) with cNO (10) and cN+ (6) OSCC were enrolled. The day before surgery all patients underwent LS with acquisition of planar and SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography)/CT images, after a peritumoral injection of Tc-99(m)-Nanocoll (R) (median 74 +/- 1.2 MO Patients underwent tumor excision and a radioguided neck dissection, using a portable gamma camera. The sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were isolated and separately analyzed in 200-micron sections and pancytokeratin immunohistochemistry assessment, looking for micro metastases. reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).Results: A homolateral lymphatic spread on LS was observed in all cases, whereas in 5 cases (31.3%) lymphatic drainage was contralateral to the OSCC site. In one cNO patient, a skip micrometastasis has been identified in a SLN.Conclusion: The results of the present study may suggest a role of LS and radioguided neck dissection in detecting the real lymphatic spread of OSCC, in order to improve the ontological assessment and to tailor the neck dissection.

TI  - First Reported Use of Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) Technique for Targeted Excision of Suspicious Axillary Lymph Nodes in Early Stage Breast Cancer - Evaluation of Feasibility and Review of Current Recommendations
T2  - IN VIVO
M3  - Review
AB  - Background/Aim: The purpose of this study was to evaluate, whether radio frequency identification (RFID) labeling of axillary lymph nodes (LNs) for the use of targeted resection is feasible in primary breast cancer patients with suspicious LNs. Patients and Methods: We analyzed 10 consecutive patients where RFID technique was used for intraoperative detection of suspicious LNs without preceding neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). We compared the specifics of these procedures to 10 consecutive sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB) in the cN0 situation. Results: Intraoperative detection rate (DR) for the RFID-labeled target lymph node (TLN) was 100%. Perioperative complications were infrequent and comparable to SLNB. Average time for location of the RFID labeled TLN was quicker than for the SLN. In 71.4% the chip bearing TLN equaled a SLN. Conclusion: The use of the RFID technique for intraoperative localization of axillary LNs for targeted excision seems feasible. RFID technique for targeted axillary dissection (TAD) following NACT should be investigated in a prospective manner.

TI  - An Evaluation of Citizen Science Smartphone Apps for Inland Water Quality Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and widespread monitoring of inland and coastal water quality occurs through the use of remote sensing and near-surface water quality sensors. A new addition is the development of smartphone applications (Apps) to measure and record surface reflectance, water color and water quality parameters. In this paper, we present a field study of the HydroColor (HC, measures RGB reflectance and suspended particulate matter (SPM)) and EyeOnWater (EoW, determines the Forel-Ule scale-an indication to the visual appearance of the water surface) smartphone Apps to evaluate water quality for inland waters in Eastern Australia. The Brisbane river, multiple lakes and reservoirs and lagoons in Queensland and New South Wales were visited; hyperspectral reflection spectra were collected and water samples were analysed in the laboratory as reference. Based on detailed measurements at 32 sites, covering inland waters with a large range in sediment and algal concentrations, we find that both water quality Apps are close, but not quite on par with scientific spectrometers. EoW is a robust application that manages to capture the color of water with accuracy and precision. HC has great potential, but is influenced by errors in the observational procedure and errors in the processing of images in the iPhone. The results show that repeated observations help to reduce the effects of outliers, while implementation of camera response functions and processing should help to reduce systematic errors. For both Apps, no universal conversion to water quality composition is established, and we conclude that: (1) replicated measurements are useful; (2) color is a reliable monitoring parameter in its own right but it should not be used for other water quality variables, and; (3) tailored algorithms to convert reflectance and color to composition could be developed for lakes individually.

TI  - Thermal response to patch characteristics and configurations of industrial and mining land in a Chinese mining city
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial and mining land is an important heat source in mining cities, however this heat has not been separated from that of built-up land in most studies of the thermal environment. This study measures the response of land surface temperature (LST) to patch characteristics and the configurations of four sub-classified industrial and mining land parcels in Wu'an, a mining city in China. We use Landsat-8 and ZY03 satellite imagery to obtain the LST and land use type. A heating rate index (T-m) is defined as the increase in LST per 1 ha increase in patch area. Multivariate regression analyses is used to analyse the relationship between thermal indicators and landscape metrics, both at the patch and village scales. Our results indicate that, at the patch scale, the mean LST (LSTm) can be described well by nonlinear binary functions of the area and landscape shape index (LSI), with different forms for each type of industrial and mining land patch. When the LSI does not vary, LSTm increases with increasing area, within area thresholds (0-50 ha for smelter or processing lands, and 5-30 ha for mining lands), while for a constant area, the LSTm decreased with increasing LSI. Below the critical LSI (similar to 2.2), more complex patch shape had lower T-m values. Above the critical LSI, T-m do not increase or decrease as LSI increased. At the village scale, patch configuration of industrial and mining land has an effect on (LSTv). The landscape percentage and aggregation index are both directly correlated with the LST of villages that contained industrial and mining land. Our findings show that the degree of LSTv response to a land patch configuration metrics change is, in order, iron and smelter land > coal processing land > coal mining land > iron ore mining land. This study provides an improved understanding of the thermal environmental response to mining activities, and can serve as a reference for future industrial layouts and land use planning in mining cities.

TI  - Is long-term PM<sub>1</sub> exposure associated with blood lipids and dyslipidemias in a Chinese rural population?
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Air pollution has been shown to be associated with blood lipid levels. However, studies on long-term ambient particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 1 mu m (PM1) exposure in high-exposure areas are still limited. This study aimed to explore the associations among long-term PM1 exposure, blood lipids and dyslipidemias.Methods: Baseline data of The Henan Rural Cohort study was used in present study, including a total of 39,259 participants aged from 18 to 79 years. Daily levels of PM1 were estimated by a spatiotemporal model using ground-level measurements of PM1, satellite remote sensing data and other predictors, according to participants' home addresses. Individual exposure to PM1 was the 3-year average before baseline investigation. Linear regression and logistic regression models were applied to examine the associations among PM1, blood lipids ((total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)), and prevalence of dyslipidemias.Results: The 3-year concentration of PM1 was 55.7 +/- 2.1 mu g/m(3). Each 1 mu g/m(3) increment of PM1 was associated with an increase of 0.21% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.11%-0.31%) in TC and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.61%-0.90%) in LDL-C, while decrease of 2.68% (95% CI: 2.43%-2.93%) in TG and 0.47% (95% CI: 0.35%-0.59%) in HDL-C. Each 1 mu g/m(3) increase in PM1 was associated with 6% (95% CI: 4%-8%), 3% (95% CI: 2%-5%) and 5% (95% CI: 3%-7%) higher risks of hypercholesterolemia, hyperbetalipoproteinemia and hypoalphalipoproteinemia. Sex, age and BMI statistically modified the associations between PM1 with blood lipid levels and dyslipidemias.Conclusions: Higher PM1 exposure was associated with adverse changes of blood lipid levels and dyslipidemias. Males, older and overweight participants were susceptive to the adverse effects of PM1.

TI  - The Appointment of the History Philosophy in Comprehending Modern Civilizational Challenges in a Post-Pandemic Society
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - A retrospective look at social theory shows that the need for philosophical and historical research arises at the junction of significant historical events when qualitative changes in social processes occur. At the beginning of the emergence of bourgeois social relations, when old ideas about society and people were destroyed, when instead of a religious understanding of the world, completely new views on the surrounding social environment were needed, it was philosophical and historical concepts that could help society find the desired confidence in the future. Such a function of the philosophical and historical worldview can be extremely relevant even in the conditions of the crisis phenomena of the present, when in the era of a pandemic, society is stratified and a global crisis is emerging in all its manifestations. Modem globalization, covering all spheres of public life - economics, politics, culture, has forced mankind to once again find itself in the win of a historical turn, during which contradictions between different states, peoples and civilizations have intensified and deepened. The main objective of the study is to characterize the purpose of the philosophy of history in understanding modern civilizational challenges in a post-pandemic society.

TI  - Where Dysphagia Begins: Polypharmacy and Xerostomia.
T2  - Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Xerostomia, the subjective sensation of dry mouth, contributes to dysarthria, dysphagia, and diminished quality of life. Polypharmacy is a known and modifiable risk factor for xerostomia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of dry mouth, the relationship between dry mouth and other oral conditions, and the impact of polypharmacy on dry mouth.METHODS: This study was a retrospective cross-sectional study of all patients seen in fiscal year (FY) 2015 (October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015) at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS), a tertiary care US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital. Patients diagnosed with xerostomia were identified using ICD-9 codes (527.7, 527.8, R68.2) and Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) codes (87715008, 78948009).RESULTS: Of all the patients seen at VAPAHCS during FY 2015, 138 had a diagnostic code for xerostomia; of those patients, 84 had at least 1 documented speech, dentition, or swallowing (SDS) problem, and 55 (39.9%) were taking ≥ 12 medications, more than twice as many patients as in any one of the other groups studied (0-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-11 medications taken). Although 4,971 total patients seen at VAPAHCS had documented SDS problems during FY 2015, of those patients only 77 (1.5%) had an additional recorded diagnosis of xerostomia.CONCLUSIONS: Heightened physician awareness regarding the signs and symptoms of and risk factors for xerostomia is needed to improve health care providers' ability to diagnose dry mouth. Polypharmacy also must be considered when developing new strategies for preventing and treating xerostomia.

TI  - Management of diabetes and hypertension in people with multiple sclerosis
T2  - MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND RELATED DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: We aimed to determine the adequacy of disease control and intensity of treatment for diabetes and hypertension in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) as compared to individuals without MS using the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance System (CPCSSN).Methods: We identified individuals aged >= 18 years, with >= 1 record in the CPCSSN data as of March 31, 2016. We applied a validated case definition to identify individuals with MS, hypertension and diabetes. Hypertension was defined as controlled if the average blood pressure was <140/90, while diabetes was defined as controlled if the average HbA1c was <= 7%. Treatment intensity for each condition was described as the number of related drugs prescribed per patient. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine the association between MS and (i) hypertension control (BP <140/90), or (ii) diabetes control (HbA1c <= 7%) accounting for age, sex, region of residence, body mass index, number of physician visits in the last two years, and depression.Results: : Among 971,799 individuals meeting the inclusion criteria, 2926 (0.3%) had MS of whom 666 (22.8%) had hypertension and 298 (10.2%) had diabetes. On univariate analysis, as compared to persons without MS, persons with MS had 25% increased odds of achieving good control of hypertension (OR 1.26; 95%CI: 1.05-1.33), and 31% increased odds of achieving good diabetes control (1.31; 95%CI: 1.00-1.71). On multivariable analysis, persons with MS no longer had increased odds of achieving good control of hypertension (OR 1.04; 95%CI: 0.79-1.37) or diabetes control (OR 1.15; 95%CI: 0.76-1.74). In a sensitivity analysis using an HbA1c <= 7%, individuals with MS had increased odds of achieving the target (OR 1.57; 95%CI: 1.02-2.44). The mean (SD) number of anti-hypertensive medications used was lower among persons with MS (0.18 [0.81]) than among persons without MS (0.40 [1.35], p = 0.001). The mean (SD) number of medications used for diabetes did not differ between persons with MS (2.4 [1.9]) and without MS (2.5 [1.8], p = 0.56).Conclusion: : In the Canadian primary care setting, comorbid MS does not adversely affect the control of hypertension or diabetes.

TI  - On Parameterizing Soil Evaporation in a Direct Remote Sensing Model of ET: PT-JPL
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing models that measure evapotranspiration directly from the Penman-Monteith or Priestley-Taylor equations typically estimate the soil evaporation component over large areas using coarse spatial resolution relative humidity (RH) from geospatial climate datasets. As a result, the models tend to underperform in dry areas at local scales where moisture status is not well represented by surrounding areas. Earth observation sensors that monitor large-scale global dynamics (e.g., MODIS) afford comparable spatial coverage and temporal frequency, but at a higher spatial resolution than geospatial climate datasets. In this study, we compared soil evaporation parameterized with optical and thermal indices derived from MODIS to RH-based soil evaporation as implemented in the Priestley Taylor-Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model. We evaluated the parameterizations by subtracting PT-JPL transpiration from observation-based flux tower evapotranspiration in agricultural fields across the contiguous United States. We compared the apparent thermal inertia (ATI) index, land surface water index (LSWI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and a new index derived from red and shortwave infrared bands (soil moisture divergence index [SMDI]). Relationships were significant at the 95% confidence band. LSWI and SMDI explained 18-33% of variance in 8-day soil evaporation. This led to a 3-11% increase in explained ET variance. LSWI and SMDI tended to perform better at the irrigated sites than RH. LSWI and SMDI led to markedly better performance over other indices at a seasonal time step. L-band microwave backscatter can penetrate clouds and can distinguish soil from canopy moisture content. We are presently fusing red-SWIR-RADAR to improve soil evaporation estimation.

TI  - Protected Areas from Space Map Browser with Fast Visualization and Analytical Operations on the Fly. Characterizing Statistical Uncertainties and Balancing Them with Visual Perception
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite huge progress in applying Earth Observation (EO) satellite data to protected areas, managers still lack the right tools or skills to analyze the data and extract the necessary knowledge. In this paper a set of EO products are organized in a visualization and analysis map browser that lowers usage barriers and provides functionalities comparable to raster-based GIS. Normally, web map servers provide maps as pictorial representations at screen resolution. The proposal is to use binary arrays with actual values, empowering the JavaScript web client to operate with the data in many ways. Thanks to this approach, the user can analyze big data by performing queries and spatial filters, changing image contrast or color palettes or creating histograms, time series profiles and complex calculations. Since the analysis is made at screen resolution, it minimizes bandwidth while maintaining visual quality. The paper explores the limitations of the approach and quantifies the statistical validity of some resampling methods that provide different visual perceptions. The results demonstrate that the methods known for having good visual perception, the mode for categorical values and the median for continuous values, have admissible statistical uncertainties.

TI  - Effects of Formalin Fixation on Trace Element Concentrations in Bottlenose Dolphin (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) Tissues
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Odontocetes are considered ideal sentinel species to monitor environmental trace element concentrations. Although frozen tissues are preferable for trace element analysis, formalin-fixed tissues are often the only samples available; however, it is uncertain whether formalin fixation alters tissue trace element concentrations. To explore whether formalin-fixed tissues could be utilized for toxicology studies, concentrations of 14 trace elements (arsenic [As], cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, mercury, manganese, nickel, lead, selenium, tin, vanadium, and zinc [Zn]) were measured in frozen and formalin-fixed bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) tissues following short-term (6 wk; tissues: blubber, liver, and lung) and long-term preservation (3-7 yr; tissues: blubber, brain, kidney, liver, lung, and skin) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Following both short-term and long-term preservation, there were significant differences in tissue trace element concentrations between preservation methods. Some trace elements were found in greater concentrations in frozen tissues compared with formalin-fixed tissues, suggesting leaching (e.g., mean As concentrations were between 1.4 and 7.6 times greater in frozen tissues). In contrast, other trace elements were found in greater concentrations in formalin-fixed tissues compared with frozen tissues, suggesting contamination (e.g., mean Zn concentrations were up to 8.7 times higher in some formalin-fixed tissues). Our results suggest that it may be possible to account for the effects of formalin fixation for some trace elements, but leaching and contamination should be carefully considered.

TI  - On the retrieval of aerosol optical depth over cryosphere using passive remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of aerosol information over the cryosphere introduces large uncertainties to our understanding of phenomenon, known as the Arctic Amplification (AA) and its feedback mechanisms. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) describes the optical characteristics of aerosol loading. This paper describes a novel algorithm, which retrieves AOD above snow-covered regions from the measurements of the up-welling radiation at the top of atmosphere, observed by the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instruments. The algorithm optimizes the generic eXtensible Bremen Aerosol/cloud and surfacE parameters Retrieval (XBAER) approach for longer wavelengths over the cryosphere. The algorithm utilizes the characteristics of solar bidirectional distribution properties of snow and aerosol at wavelength 3.7 mu m to derive above-snow-AOD. Since the impact of fine-mode aerosol on 3.7 mu m is ignorable, the retrieved AOD in this manuscript represents mainly coarse-mode dominated part. A novel method to extract the solar reflection part at 3.7 mu m is presented and used in the surface parameterization. Two aerosol types (sea salt-dominated and dust-dominated) are used and the best-fit type is derived by an iterative procedure, using a LookUp-Table (LUT) approach. Sensitivity studies of the impact on the retrieved AOD using XBAER algorithm, which investigate the impacts of aerosol type, snow surface emissivity and potential cloud contamination under typical AATSR observation conditions, are presented. The sensitivity studies show that the surface parametrization and aerosol typing are suitable for the retrieval of above-snow-AOD over the Arctic snow-covered region. AOD observations retrieved in this study from AATSR (2002-2012) observation collocated with those from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites over Greenland show good agreement. 72.1% of the match-ups fall into the expected error envelope of (+/- 0.15AOD +/- 0.025). The AATSR derived above-snow-AOD at 0.55 mu m research product has also been compared with Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) aerosol product, the Mineral Aerosols Profiling from Infrared Radiances (MAPIR) derived Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) AOD research product, and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) AOD simulations over Greenland on April 2011. The comparison reveals that all datasets show similar patterns for the AOD above Greenland. The AOD is smaller in central Greenland and larger over the coastline regions. The XBAER derived above-snow-AOD has improved coverage, as compared to that of the existing AATSR aerosol product. The transition between above-snow-AOD and AOD derived over surrounding ocean surfaces does not indicate any systematic errors. Two aerosol transport events have been well-captured by the XBAER derived above-snow-AOD research product. The new algorithm is also applied to the SLSTR onboard Sentinel-3 demonstrating new SLSTR above-snow-AOD data products, and its value for research in the changing AOD during the period of Arctic Amplification.

TI  - Metformin: Sentinel of the Epigenetic Landscapes That Underlie Cell Fate and Identity
T2  - BIOMOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - The biguanide metformin is the first drug to be tested as a gerotherapeutic in the clinical trial TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin). The current consensus is that metformin exerts indirect pleiotropy on core metabolic hallmarks of aging, such as the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 and AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian Target Of Rapamycin signaling pathways, downstream of its primary inhibitory effect on mitochondrial respiratory complex I. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, metformin can exert regulatory effects on components of the biologic machinery of aging itself such as chromatin-modifying enzymes. An integrative metabolo-epigenetic outlook supports a new model whereby metformin operates as a guardian of cell identity, capable of retarding cellular aging by preventing the loss of the information-theoretic nature of the epigenome. The ultimate anti-aging mechanism of metformin might involve the global preservation of the epigenome architecture, thereby ensuring cell fate commitment and phenotypic outcomes despite the challenging effects of aging noise. Metformin might therefore inspire the development of new gerotherapeutics capable of preserving the epigenome architecture for cell identity. Such gerotherapeutics should replicate the ability of metformin to halt the erosion of the epigenetic landscape, mitigate the loss of cell fate commitment, delay stochastic/environmental DNA methylation drifts, and alleviate cellular senescence. Yet, it remains a challenge to confirm if regulatory changes in higher-order genomic organizers can connect the capacity of metformin to dynamically regulate the three-dimensional nature of epigenetic landscapes with the 4th dimension, the aging time.

TI  - Regional Recognition and Classification of Active Loess Landslides Using Two-Dimensional Deformation Derived from Sentinel-1 Interferometric Radar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification and classification of landslides is a preliminary and crucial work for landslide risk assessment and hazard mitigation. The exploitation of surface deformation velocity derived from satellite synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) is a consolidated and suitable procedure for the recognition of active landslides over wide areas. However, the calculated displacement velocity from InSAR is one-dimensional motion along the satellite line of sight (LOS), representing a major hurdle for landslide type and failure mechanism classification. In this paper, different velocity datasets derived from both ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data are employed to analyze the surface ground movement of the Huangshui region (Northwestern China). With global warming, precipitation in the Huangshui region, geologically belonging to the loess basin in the eastern edge of Qing-Tibet Plateau, has been increasing, often triggering a large number of landslides, posing a potential threat to local citizens and natural and anthropic environments. After processing both SAR data geometries, the surface motion was decomposed to obtain the two-dimensional displacements (vertical and horizontal E-W). Thus, a classification criterion of the loess landslide types and failure mode is proposed, according to the analysis of deformation direction, velocities, texture, and topographic characteristics. With the support of high-resolution images acquired by remote sensing and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), 14 translational slides, seven rotational slides, and 10 loess flows were recognized in the study area. The derived results may provide solid support for stakeholders to comprehend the hazard of unstable slopes and to undertake specific precautions for moderate and slow slope movements.

TI  - Analysis of ecological resilience to evaluate the inherent maintenance capacity of a forest ecosystem using a dense Landsat time series
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The inherent maintenance capacity of forest ecosystems is an important indicator to evaluate environmental quality. The development of remote sensing time series analysis provides a new perspective and methodology to evaluate such maintenance capacities, that take account of the gradual and subtle changes contained in forest growth over long time periods. This study analyzed forest ecosystem resilience, to evaluate the inherent maintenance capacity of a forest ecosystem in Hengdong County, Hunan Province, China, using a dense Landsat time series from 1988 to 2018. The key resilience metrics of disturbance magnitude (M), degree of resilience, and recovery rate (RR) were developed, to describe forest ecosystem resilience. These metrics were derived using a dynamic time warping algorithm, based on calculations of the distance among the inter-annual time series, which detected forest disturbance-regrowth dynamics. Through this methodology, we obtained an overall accuracy of 87.14% (in the degree of resilience) for the spatio-temporal resilience characteristics of the forest ecosystem. Disturbance was ever-present and 59.72% of the change processes varied within a relatively small range. Furthermore, we found RR to increase concomitantly with M and large M values caused a decreased degree of resilience, indicating a very small likelihood of forest greenness restoration under large M values in the red soil erosion region. We also found that the degree of resilience and RR showed an overall increasing trend, indicating an enhancement in the inherent maintenance capacity of the ecosystem. Our methodology provides a significant potential for the evaluation of the regional environmental quality, while providing insights into the comprehensive management of soil erosion in forest ecosystems.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-1 & 2 time series for predicting wheat and rapeseed phenological stages
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the global context of population growth and climate change, monitoring crops is necessary to sustain agriculture and conserve natural resources. While many studies have demonstrated the ability of optical and SAR remotely sensed data to estimate crop parameters, these data have not been compared or combined to predict crop phenological stages. Despite the high sensitivity of SAR polarimetric data to crop phenological stages, no study has used high temporal resolution data. The freely available SAR Sentinel-1 (S-1) and optical Sentinel-2 (S2) time series provide a unique opportunity to monitor crop phenology at a high spatial resolution on a weekly basis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of S-1 data alone, S-2 data alone, and their combined use to predict wheat and rapeseed phenological stages. We first analyzed temporal profiles of spectral bands, vegetation indices and leaf area index (LAI) derived from S-2 data, and backscattering coefficients and polarimetric indicators derived from S-1 data. Then, an incremental procedure was used to estimate the contribution of S-1 and S-2 features to the classification of principal and secondary phenological stages of wheat and rapeseed. Results for both crops showed that the classification obtained with combined S-1 & 2 data (mean kappa = 0.53-0.82 and 0.74-0.92 for wheat and rapeseed, respectively) was more accurate than those obtained with S-2 data alone (mean kappa = 0.54-0.75 and 0.67-0.86 for wheat and rapeseed, respectively) or S-1 data alone (mean kappa = 0.48-0.61 and 0.61-0.64 for wheat and rapeseed, respectively). Combining S-1 & 2 data allowed better identification of the beginning and end of tillering for wheat and the beginning and end of ripening for rapeseed. Among S-2 features, the most important were LAI for wheat and the NDVI for rapeseed. For both crops, the S2REP index was one of the most important vegetation indices, while MCARI was less important. For S-1 features, results highlighted the large contribution of the backscatter ratio (sigma degrees VH:sigma degrees VV) and the value of using polarimetric indicators (Shannon entropy and span) to monitor rapeseed and wheat phenology. The main novelties of this work are the use of S-1 polarimetric indicators to identify phenological stages of wheat and rapeseed and the mapping of wheat and rapeseed secondary phenological stages using remotely sensed data.

TI  - Studying the Applicability of X-Band SAR Data to the Network-Scale Mapping of Pavement Roughness on US Roads
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The traveling public judges the quality of a road mostly by its roughness and/or ride quality. Hence, mapping, monitoring, and maintaining adequate pavement smoothness is of high importance to State Departments of Transportation in the US. Current methods rely mostly on in situ measurements and are, therefore, time consuming and costly when applied at the network scale. This paper studies the applicability of satellite radar remote sensing data, specifically, high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired at X-band, to the network-wide mapping of pavement roughness of roads in the US. Based on a comparison of high-resolution X-band Cosmo-SkyMed images with road roughness data in the form of International Roughness Index (IRI) measurements, we found that X-band radar brightness generally increases when pavement roughness worsens. Based on these findings, we developed and inverted a model to distinguish well maintained road segments from segments in need of repair. Over test sites in Augusta County, VA, we found that our classification scheme reaches an overall accuracy of 92.6%. This study illustrates the capacity of X-band SAR for pavement roughness mapping and suggests that incorporating SAR into DOT operations could be beneficial.

AB  - The research and improvement of methods to be used for deformation measurements from space is a challenge. From the previous 20 years, time series Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry techniques have proved for their ability to provide millimeter-scale deformation measurements over time. This paper aims to provide a review of such techniques developed in the last twenty years. We first recall the background of interferometric SAR (InSAR). We then provide an overview of the InSAR time series methods developed in the literature, describing their principles and advancements. Finally, we highlight challenges and future perspectives of the InSAR in the Big Data era.

TI  - Comparison of a spatial, spatial and hybrid methods for predicting inter-rill and rill soil sensitivity to erosion at the field scale
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion prediction and conservation planning require detailed soil data under different environmental conditions. When such data are needed at the field scale, aspatial and spatial models could be used to predict soil erosion processes. This study was conducted to develop spatial models including geostatistical models (i.e. ordinary kriging (OK) and cokriging (CK)) and hybrid geostatistical models (i.e. multiple linear regression-kriging (MLRK) and artificial neural network-kriging (ANNK)) for estimating WEPP baseline soil sensitivity to erosion parameters for calcareous agricultural soils in northwest Iran. Inter-rill and rill erosion simulation experiments were carried out at 100 locations at the field scale with 3 replications. At each location, the soil properties (organic matter, calcium carbonate equivalent, sand, silt, clay, base infiltration rate) were measured and auxiliary data obtained from attributes derived from digital elevation models (elevation, slope, stream power index, wetness index and sediment transport index) and remote sensing data (three visible bands, NIR, SWIR (5 and 7 bands), NDVI indices). The MLR and ANN models were used to estimate baseline inter-rill soil sensitivity to erosion (K-ib) and rill soil sensitivity to erosion (K-rb and tau(cb)) using two types of input data. For the first type of prediction models (type I), the measured soil properties and auxiliary data were used, whereas for the second type of models (type II), principal components (PCs) based on the soil and auxiliary data were used. In comparison to the models that were developed here, the WEPP inter-rill and rill soil sensitivity to erosion models showed a relatively poor performance. The ANN models developed here predicted K-ib, K-rb and tau(cb) parameters better than the MLR models using both types of data (type I and II). Moreover, the results indicated that the ANNK model was the most appropriate spatial or hybrid model for predicting soil sensitivity to erosion parameters.

TI  - The resilience of coastal marshes to hurricanes: The potential impact of excess nutrients
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Hurricanes pose an increasing threat to coastal environments as the intensity and severity of hurricanes are predicted to increase under the changing climate. Coastal wetlands are effective nature-based defenses of coastal cities against storms. However, the ecosystems themselves are also susceptible to the impacts of hurricanes, which are highly complex and not fully understood. Here we utilize multi-decadal satellite data archives (Landsat 1984-2014 and MODIS 2005-2015) and long-term coast-wide field-based environmental data (1978-2018) to investigate the impacts of hurricanes Katrina (2005), Gustav (2008), and Isaac (2012) on the coastal marshes in Louisiana, USA, where the hurricanes made landfall. While the hurricanes had immediate impacts on the marshes' biomass and area at an ecosystem scale, general recovery was observed in the next one and two years. We also found that the most severe damage always occurred in the intermediate and brackish marshes of the Breton Sound basin, where the nitrogen concentration in the water was significantly higher compared to areas with less damage (P < 0.01). Because excess nutrient can reduce the marshes' root growth and degrade their root mat, we posit that the long-term nutrient enrichment in the area, which resulted from the diverted Mississippi River water, has increased the marshes' susceptibility to hurricanes. The results highlight the resilience of coastal marsh ecosystems against hurricanes, but also underline the profound synergistic effects of climatic and anthropogenic factors on the sustainability of coastal ecosystems, which have important implications for coastal management under the current climate trend.

TI  - Automatic Lineament Extraction Method in Mineral Exploration Using CANNY Algorithm and Hough Transform
T2  - GEOTECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Copper mineralization in Kahang porphyry mining district as a tectonically active region in the center of Iran, at the middle of Urmia-Dokhtar magmatic assemblage (UDMA), has been drastically controlled by structural lineaments. Determination of these footprint features is a good guide to identify the location of ore occurrences. One way to recognize lineaments is to process satellite imagery along with geophysical data. Although the visual extraction of lineaments from such data set is the most common method, automatic methods for detecting lineaments can highly reduce user errors and runtime. The most efficient automated methods in this regard are those that simultaneously take edge detection filters with lineament extraction algorithms into consideration. In this work, the CANNY algorithm was employed as an edge-detector filter at first and later Hough transform was used to extract linear features from satellite imagery and geophysical magnetometry data. The proposed methods were implemented on the high-resolution imagery data collected by QuickBird satellite along with ground-based magnetometry data to extract the shallow and deep-seated lineaments. After investigating and plotting this structural controller in a map, the dominant orientation was in the NE-SW direction perpendicular to the UDMA. Generated lineament density map also indicated that the eastern, southeast, and western portions of the area had high potential for porphyry copper mineralization.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of MODIS Chlorophyll-a with Genetic Programming in South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is one of the major indicators for water quality assessment and recent developments in ocean color remote sensing have greatly improved the ability to monitor Chl-a on a global scale. The coarse spatial resolution is one of the major limitations for most ocean color sensors including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), especially in monitoring the Chl-a concentrations in coastal regions. To improve its spatial resolution, downscaling techniques have been suggested with polynomial regression models. Nevertheless, polynomial regression has some restrictions, including sensitivity to outliers and fixed mathematical forms. Therefore, the current study applied genetic programming (GP) for downscaling Chl-a. The proposed GP model in the current study was compared with multiple polynomial regression (MPR) to different degrees (2(nd)-, 3(rd)-, and 4(th)-degree) to illustrate their performances for downscaling MODIS Chl-a. The obtained results indicate that GP with R-2 = 0.927 and RMSE = 0.1642 on the winter day and R-2 = 0.763 and RMSE = 0.5274 on the summer day provides higher accuracy on both winter and summer days than all the applied MPR models because the GP model can automatically produce appropriate mathematical equations without any restrictions. In addition, the GP model is the least sensitive model to the changes in the input parameters. The improved downscaling data provide better information to monitor the status of oceanic and coastal marine ecosystems that are also critical for fisheries and fishing farming.

TI  - Using GRanD Database and Surface Water Data to Constrain Area-Storage Curve of Reservoirs
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Basic information on global reservoirs is well documented in databases such as GRanD (Global Reservoir and Dam) and ICOLD (International Commission on Large Dams). However, though playing a critical role in estimating reservoir storage variations from remote sensing or hydrological models, area-storage curves of reservoirs are not conveniently obtained nor publicly shared. In this paper, we combine the GRanD database and Landsat-based global surface water extent (GSW) data to derive area-storage curves of reservoirs. The reported storage capacity in the GRanD database and water surface area from GSW data were used to constrain the area-storage curve. The proposed method has the potential to derive area-storage curves of reservoirs larger than 1 km(2) archived in the GRanD database. The derived curves are validated with in situ reservoir data collected in US and China, and the results show that in situ records are well captured by the derived curves both in large and small reservoirs with various shapes. The derived area-storage curves could be employed to advance global monitoring or modeling of reservoir storage dynamics.

TI  - Where does land use matter most? Contrasting land use effects on river quality at different spatial scales
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the influence of land-use activities on river quality has been a key focus of river monitoring programs worldwide. However, defining which land-use spatial scale is relevant remains elusive. In this study, therefore, we contrasted the influence of land use on river quality using three types of landuse estimators, namely circular buffers around a monitoring site, circular buffers upstream of the monitoring site and the entire watershed area upstream of the monitoring site. The land-use percentage compositions within the Usa-Kikuletwa River catchment in northeastern Tanzania were quantified using Landsat-8 satellite images with a maximum mapping resolution of 30 m. Redundancy analysis models and generalized linear models were used to evaluate the influence of land use on macroinvertebrate assemblages and physico-chemical water quality at different spatial scales in the dry and wet seasons. Overall, a substantial fraction of variation in physico-chemical water quality, macroinvertebrate taxon richness, Chao-1 and TARISS (Tanzania River Scoring System) score could be explained by land use of the entire watershed area upstream of the monitoring site in the dry and wet seasons. However, macroinvertebrate abundances showed strong links with more local land-use patterns within 100 m and 2 km radii. Circular buffers upstream of monitoring sites were more informative for macroinvertebrate assemblages than circular buffers around the monitoring sites. However, the latter did correlate well with physico-chemical water quality variables. Land-use variables correlated across spatial scales (i.e., 100 m up to 2 km radii), but not with the land use in the entire watershed area above the monitoring site. Our results indicate that physico-chemical water quality variables and macroinvertebrates may respond differently to land-uses at different scales. More importantly, our results illustrate that the choice regarding spatial land-use metrics can bias conclusions of environmental impact studies in river systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Analysis of Thermal Pollution of Volga-Uralian Steppe Landscapes Caused by Exploitation of Oil Deposits
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Flares for combustion of associated petroleum gas (APG) are the main sources of thermal impact on landscapes during the exploitation of oil deposits. The object of this study is the Volga-Uralian steppe region producing 22% of the volume of Russian oil, which leads to the formation of high volumes of combusted APG. Our research was aimed at identification of the real amount of active sources of APG combustion and assessment of thermal pollution of ambient landscapes. On the basis of special analysis of Landsat satellite images, 112 thermal points are detected on the key territory of 77 000 km(2). It is established that one active flare increases the temperature of the surface and surface air layer by more than 8 degrees in a radius of 30 to 350 m from the open fire. Operation of one flare results in a temperature increase over an area of 0.085 km(2), on average, supporting the formation of so-called heat islands. APG combustion of 112 flares can increase the temperature in an area of >10 km(2). This process leads both to heating of areas of the atmosphere and pollution of vast areas. A smoking gas trail from one flare can reach 11 km in length and can disperse up to 3 km in width spanning an area of >30 km(2). The formation of areas of microclimate changes is one of the effects of APG combustion.

TI  - Geospatial Assessment of Water-Migration Scenarios in the Context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6, 11, and 16
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Communities and countries around the world are gearing up efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda goals and targets. In this paper, the water and migration scenarios are explained with a focus on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6 (water-related), 11 (urbanization), and 16 (peace and political stability). The study has two phases. The first phase illustrates the application of geospatial data and tools to assess the water-migration interlinkages (nexus) by employing a case study approach. Three case studies, Lake Chad, the Aral Sea region, and the Nile Delta, representing various geographic and socio-political settings, were selected to perform the multitemporal analysis. For this analysis, a mixed toolset framework that combined algorithmic functions of digital image processing, the Landsat sensor data, and applied a geographic information system (GIS) platform was adopted. How water-related events directly or indirectly trigger human migration is described using spatial indicators such as water spread and the extent of urban sprawl. Additionally, the geospatial outputs were analyzed in tandem with the climate variables such as temperature, precipitation data, and socio-economic variables such as population trends and migration patterns. Overall, the three case studies examined how water and climate crisis scenarios influence migration at a local and regional scale. The second phase showcases global-scale analysis based on the Global Conflict Risk Index (GCRI). This indicator reflects on the risks and conflicts with environmental, social, and political aspects and comments on the connection of these dimensions with migration. Together, the two phases of this paper provide an understanding ofthe interplay of water-related events on migration by applying the geospatial assessment and a proxy global index. Additionally, the paper reiterates that such an understanding can serve to establish facts and create evidence to inform sustainable development planning and decision making, particularly with regard to SDGs 6, 11, and 16. Targets such as 6.4 (managing water stress), 6.5 (transboundary challenges) and, 11.B (adaptation and resilience planning) can benefit from the knowledge generated by this geospatial exercise. For example, the high GCRI values for the African region speak to SDG targets 11.B (integrated policies/plans) and 16.7 (decision support systems for peaceful societies). Two key highlights from the synthesis: (a) migration and urbanization are closely interconnected, and (b) the impact of water and climate crisis is comparatively high for rural-urban migration due to the considerable dependence of rural communities on nature-based livelihoods. In conclusion, geospatial analysis is an important tool to study the interlinkages between water and migration. The paper presents a novel perspective toward widening the scope of remote sensing data and GIS toward the implementation of the SDG Agenda.

TI  - Central Pathology Review in SENTIX, a Prospective Observational International Study on Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients with Early-Stage Cervical Cancer (ENGOT-CX2)
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality of pathological assessment is crucial for the safety of patients with cervical cancer if pelvic lymph node dissection is to be replaced by sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. Central pathology review of SLN pathological ultrastaging was conducted in the prospective SENTIX/European Network of Gynaecological Oncological Trial (ENGOT)-CX2 study. All specimens from at least two patients per site were submitted for the central review. For cases with major or critical deviations, the sites were requested to submit all samples from all additional patients for second-round assessment. From the group of 300 patients, samples from 83 cases from 37 sites were reviewed in the first round. Minor, major, critical, and no deviations were identified in 28%, 19%, 14%, and 39% of cases, respectively. Samples from 26 patients were submitted for the second-round review, with only two major deviations found. In conclusion, a high rate of major or critical deviations was identified in the first round of the central pathology review (28% of samples). This reflects a substantial heterogeneity in current practice, despite trial protocol requirements. The importance of the central review conducted prospectively at the early phase of the trial is demonstrated by a substantial improvement of SLN ultrastaging quality in the second-round review.

TI  - Assessment of New Satellite Missions within the Framework of Numerical Weather Prediction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Confidence in the use of Earth observations for monitoring essential climate variables (ECVs) relies on the validation of satellite calibration accuracy to within a well-defined uncertainty. The gap analysis for integrated atmospheric ECV climate monitoring (GAIA-CLIM) project investigated the calibration/validation of satellite data sets using non-satellite reference data. Here, we explore the role of numerical weather prediction (NWP) frameworks for the assessment of several meteorological satellite sensors: the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR2), microwave humidity sounder-2 (MWHS-2), microwave radiation imager (MWRI), and global precipitation measurement (GPM) microwave imager (GMI). We find departures (observation-model differences) are sensitive to instrument calibration artefacts. Uncertainty in surface emission is identified as a key gap in our ability to validate microwave imagers quantitatively in NWP. The prospects for NWP-based validation of future instruments are considered, taking as examples the microwave sounder (MWS) and infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer-next generation (IASI-NG) on the next generation of European polar-orbiting satellites. Through comparisons with reference radiosondes, uncertainties in NWP fields can be estimated in terms of equivalent top-of-atmosphere brightness temperature. We find NWP-sonde differences are consistent with a total combined uncertainty of 0.15 K for selected temperature sounding channels, while uncertainties for humidity sounding channels typically exceed 1 K.

TI  - Study on characteristics of internal solitary waves in the Malacca Strait based on Sentinel-1 and GF-3 satellite SAR data
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the characteristics of internal solitary waves happened in the Malacca Strait is an urgent problem for submarine, ship navigation and marine engineering. Based on SAR remote sensing data obtained from the high spatial resolution Sentinel-1 and GF-3, the internal solitary wave characteristics of the Malacca Strait are investigated. By use of 20 Sentinel-1 SAR images from June 2015 to December 2016 and 24 GF-3 images from April 2018 to March 2019, the spatial distribution characteristics of internal solitary wave s are statistically analyzed. It is found that the internal solitary waves are usually in the form of wave packets and single solitary waves, and the maximum crest length of the leading wave can reach 39 km. The amplitude and group velocity of internal solitary wave s can be calculated by the inversion model of high-order nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation, and the calculated amplitude of the internal solitary wave s and the propagation group velocity of the wave packets range from 4.7 m to 23.9 m and 0.12 m/s to 0.40 m/s, respectively. The range of phase velocity of single internal solitary waves obtained by KdV equation is 0.26 m/s to 0.60 m/s. In general, the amplitude and the velocity of internal solitary wave s in Malacca strait are related to the topography.

TI  - Development and Testing of a Clear-Sky Data Selection Algorithm for FY-3C/D Microwave Temperature Sounder-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fengyun (FY)-3C/D microwave temperature sounder-2 (MWTS-2) is similar to the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A), except it lacks two window channels located at 23.8 GHz and 31.4 GHz. This makes a clear-sky data determination challenging for the MWTS-2 due to the unavailability of cloud liquid water path (LWP) retrievable from the two window channels. The purpose of this study is to develop a clear-sky data selection algorithm for the FY-3C/D MWTS-2 based on the bias-removed differences between observations and model simulations of the MWTS-2 50.3-GHz channel 1 (or equivalently AMSU-A channel 3). First, a point is defined as a temporal clear-sky (cloudy) point if the bias-removed difference between observed and simulated brightness temperatures is smaller than or equal to (greater than) 2 K. Then, a temporal clear-sky (cloudy) point is defined as a final clear-sky (cloudy) point if all points within its 60-km (100-km) radial distance are temporal clear-sky (cloudy) points. Finally, if the mean value of the bias-removed differences between observations and simulations in the 100-km circle from a temporal cloudy point are smaller than or equal to (greater than) 2 K, all temporal clear-sky points within this circle are (not) taken as the final clear-sky points. Applications of this algorithm to FY-3C MWTS-2 and MetOp-B AMSU-A lead to the following conclusions: (i) more than 70% (95%) of the clear-sky (cloudy) data points are successfully identified from both AMSU-A and MWTS-2 observations; (ii) the algorithm-selected clear-sky data points were located in clear-sky areas in the GOES-15 imager, and (iii) the bias-removed differences between observations and model simulations of MWTS-2 channel 1 well reveals the eye, the eyewall, and the spiral rainband structure of Super Typhoon Halong (2014).

TI  - Automatic Processing of Aerial LiDAR Data to Detect Vegetation Continuity in the Surroundings of Roads
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The optimization of forest management in the surroundings of roads is a necessary task in term of wildfire prevention and the mitigation of their effects. One of the reasons why a forest fire spreads is the presence of contiguous flammable material, both horizontally and vertically and, thus, vegetation management becomes essential in preventive actions. This work presents a methodology to detect the continuity of vegetation based on aerial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, in combination with point cloud processing techniques. Horizontal continuity is determined by calculating Cover Canopy Fraction (CCF). The results obtained show 50% of shrubs presence and 33% of trees presence in the selected case of study, with an error of 5.71%. Regarding vertical continuity, a forest structure composed of a single stratum represents 81% of the zone. In addition, the vegetation located in areas around the roads were mapped, taking into consideration the distances established in the applicable law. Analyses show that risky areas range from a total of 0.12 ha in a 2 m buffer and 0.48 ha in a 10 m buffer, representing a 2.4% and 9.5% of the total study area, respectively.

TI  - Toxicogenomics in a soil sentinel exposure to Zn nanoparticles and ions reveals the comparative role of toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic mechanisms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO
M3  - Article
AB  - A critical question for read across of the hazards of nanomaterials is the degree to which their mechanisms of action differ from those of their bulk chemical constituents. It has been established that metal and metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) can be accumulated by invertebrate species. Moreover, it has been hypothesised that the observed toxicity resulting on exposure to these nanomaterials is most likely to be associated with the releases of ions from external or internal dissolution leading ultimately to toxicity. However, mechanistic confirmation of the similar modes of action for metal oxide nanomaterials and metal ions in studies invertebrates are largely lacking. Therefore, here we present a toxicogenomic study using exposed individuals of the earthworm Eisenia fetida from a single genetic lineage. We compared gene expression and pathway responses through RNA-seq analysis at equitoxic concentrations (EC50 for reproduction) of ZnO NPs and ionic Zn. We found similar transcriptomic effects for both Zn forms with genetic signatures of tight control of cytosolic Zn concentrations through expression changes of genes encoding several Zn transporters. Activation and regulation of JUN, MAP and JNK kinases indicated a cellular response to the increased Zn concentrations of both forms with compound binding terms also enriched. Our results illustrate the need to consider both toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic mechanisms in the development of adverse outcome pathways for nanomaterials.

TI  - Identification of Shift in Sowing and Harvesting Dates of Rice Crop (<i>L.</i> <i>Oryza sativa</i>) through Remote Sensing Techniques: A Case Study of Larkana District
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to determine the impact of climate variability on rice crops in terms of sowing and harvesting dates and crop period. The identification of sowing and harvesting dates were spotted by mask identification, variations in land surface temperature (LST) on a temporal scale in the respective months, and a field-level social inquiry. The study was conducted during a time period (1994-2017), in which geo-referenced crop samples, farmer's perception survey data, Landsat satellite images, and climate data of district Larkana were used. The analysis of satellite imageries revealed that on 20 June 1994, the rice was transplanted on 14.7% of the area of the region while it was only 7.1% of the area in 2017. Similarly, the area under rice crop in the first week of July 1994 was 18.3% compared to 8.15% during the same period in 2017. However, in the first week of October 2017, the rice crop was standing on 46.8% of the area while it was on 34.6% of the area during the year 1994 on the same date. This LST variation depicts a delay in the sowing and harvesting of the rice crop. This changing pattern is further confirmed through mean LST. Mean LST (degrees C) has been increasing in the sowing period of rice crop from 31.9 degrees C in June 1994 to 35.8 degrees C in June 2017, and from 32.8 degrees C in July 1994 to 36.8 degrees C in July 2017. Furthermore, the LST decreased during the harvesting period of rice crop from 31 degrees C in October 1994 to 28.6 degrees C in October 2017. The present study quantifies a delay of 15-30 days in sowing and harvesting dates of the rice crop in the district due to climate variability.

TI  - Forest Disturbances in Polish Tatra Mountains for 1985-2016 in Relation to Topography, Stand Features, and Protection Zone
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - For more than four centuries, the Tatra Mountains were affected by many factors, such as forest and pastoral management, mining and metallurgy, windthrows, snow avalanches, and bark beetle outbreaks. Due to the availability of the long-running Landsat program enabling acquisition of spatially and spectrally consistent information, it is possible to the use these data for forest disturbance analysis. The main aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between the frequency of disturbances detected over the period of 1985-2016 and selected topographic features, such as elevation, exposure, and slope, derived from a digital elevation model (DEM); stand features, such as vegetation community type, age, structure, and degree of naturalness of the stand; and the management protection zone, which was extracted from thematic layers of the Tatra National Park (TNP). Using the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), we detected forest disturbances in each year and analyzed them in the context of these topographic features, forest stand characteristics, and the management protection zone. We observed that forest stands in the lower montane zone, slopes between 10 degrees-30 degrees, and eastern exposures were primarily affected by disturbances. These consisted of artificially planted spruce stands aged between 51 and 100 years old.

TI  - Impact of the Lysine-urethane Adhesive TissuGlu® on Postoperative Complications and Interventions After Drain-free Mastectomy
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: The influence of a polyurethane-based tissue adhesive (TissuGlu (R)) on common complications following breast surgery was investigated. Patients and Methods: Within a Randomized-Controlled-Trial 70 women (n=35 TissuGlu (R), n=35 drain) underwent a mastectomy with or without sentinel lymph node excision (SLNE), followed by a 90-day postoperative follow-up. Results: Postoperative interventions: Non-inferiority of the application of TissuGlu (R) was seen. Pain-Level/Hospitalization: A statistically significant pain reduction from day four onwards (p<0.001) and a shorter hospitalization period (p<0.001) was observed. In contrast, the TissuGlu (R) group showed increased mean puncture incidence (p=0.013), and increased puncture volume (p=0.021). Conclusion: Application of the polyurethane-based tissue adhesive TissuGlu (R) after mastectomy, with or without SLNE, showed potential for improvement of the clinical outcome. In contrast, high intervention rates and increased puncture volume, caused by recurring seromas following application of the surgical adhesive TissuGlu (R), have a negative impact on the patient-specific convalescence.

TI  - Evaluating Simulated RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) Compact Polarimetry for Open-Water and Flooded-Vegetation Wetland Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When severe flooding occurs in Canada, the Emergency Geomatics Service (EGS) is tasked with creating and disseminating maps that depict flood extents in near real time. EGS flood mapping methods were created with efficiency and robustness in mind, to allow maps to be published quickly, and therefore have the potential to generate high-repeat water products that can enhance frequent wetland monitoring. The predominant imagery currently used is synthetic aperture radar (SAR) from RADARSAT-2 (R2). With the commissioning phase of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) complete, the EGS is adapting its methods for use with this new source of SAR data. The introduction of RCM's circular-transmit linear-receive (CTLR) beam mode provides the option to exploit compact polarimetric (CP) information not previously available with R2. The aim of this study was to determine the most effective CP parameters for use in mapping open water and flooded vegetation, using current EGS methodologies, and compare these products to those created by using R2 data. Nineteen quad-polarization R2 scenes selected from three regions containing wetlands prone to springtime flooding were used to create reference flood maps, using existing EGS tools. These scenes were then used to simulate 22 RCM CP parameters at different noise floors and spatial resolutions representative of the three RCM beam modes. Using multiple criteria, CP parameters were ranked in order of importance and entered into a stepwise classification procedure, for evaluation against reference R2 products. The top four CP parameters -m-chi-volume or m-delta-volume, RR intensity, Shannon Entropy intensity (SEi), and RV intensity-achieved a maximum agreement with baseline R2 products of upward of 98% across all 19 scenes and three beam modes. Separability analyses between flooded vegetation and other land-cover classes identified four candidate CP parameters-RH intensity, RR intensity, SEi, and the first Stokes parameter (SV0)-suitable for flooded-vegetation-region growing. Flooded-vegetation-region-growing CP thresholds were found to be dependent on incidence angle for each of these four parameters. After region growing using each of the four candidate CP parameters, RH intensity was deemed best to map flooded vegetation, based on our evaluations. The results of the study suggest a set of suitable CP parameters to generate flood maps from RCM data, using current EGS methodologies that must be validated further as real RCM data become available.

TI  - Fiducial Reference Measurements for validation of Sentinel-2 and Proba-V surface reflectance products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many derived Earth Observation products share surface reflectance as a common step in their processing chains. This makes the maintenance and improvement of surface reflectance product quality of fundamental importance to ensure information derived from these downstream products can be trusted. Despite this, the literature is relatively light on the implementation of validation methodologies designed for surface reflectance. In response to the need to improve general EO validation methodologies, the concept of fiducial reference measurements (FRM) was created that would produce validation data that is fully characterised and independent, with associated uncertainties, and traceable to SI.This paper describes a field campaign designed to produce surface reflectance validation data, in line with the FRM ideology, for validating the Sentinel-2 L2A (S2) and Proba-V S1-TOC (Proba) surface reflectance products. The key methodological procedures are outlined in detail to facilitate uptake of FRM methods in future validation studies. These include the calibration and characterisation of field instruments, the field measurement protocol, and uncertainty propagation.Comparison of S2 with field measurements showed agreement within the stated uncertainties present for all bands and locations at the pixel and area scales. The Proba comparison results demonstrated a general disagreement within the stated uncertainties. However, there is a lack of uncertainty information provided by the product as well as publicly available product uncertainty requirements which mean that it is difficult to assess this fully. The aim of this practical demonstration of FRM-based surface reflectance validation, that utilises metrological practices for uncertainty characterisation, is to encourage the adoption of these procedures in future land surface reflectance validation studies and operational activities.

TI  - Mapping Paleohydrology of the Ephemeral Kuiseb River, Namibia, from Radar Remote Sensing
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kuiseb River is one of the major ephemeral rivers of Western Namibia, setting the northern limit of the Namib Sand Sea and outflowing in the Atlantic Ocean at Walvis Bay. Such ephemeral rivers are of the highest importance for the country since they are related both to recent past climatic conditions and to potential water resources. Using high-resolution radar images from the Japanese ALOS-2 satellite, we mapped for the first time the numerous channels hidden under the surface aeolian sediments: while the non-permanent tributaries of the Kuiseb River appear north of its present-day bed, a wide paleochannel system running westward, assumed by previous studies, could be clearly observed in the interdune valleys in the south. Radar-detected channels were studied during fieldwork in May 2019, which produced both subsurface ground-penetrating radar profiles and high-resolution drone-generated digital elevation models. It allowed us to confirm the existence of the "Paleo-Kuiseb" drainage system, a remnant of the Holocene history of the Kuiseb River, moving northward under the progression of the Namib Sand Sea. Our observations also contribute to the explanation of the young age of the linear dunes at the northern edge of the Namib Sand Sea, which are currently active and are pushing the Kuiseb River course toward the north.

TI  - Locating Forest Management Units Using Remote Sensing and Geostatistical Tools in North-Central Washington, USA
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we share an approach to locate and map forest management units with high accuracy and with relatively rapid turnaround. Our study area consists of private, state, and federal land holdings that cover four counties in North-Central Washington, USA (Kittitas, Okanogan, Chelan and Douglas). This area has a rich history of landscape change caused by frequent wildfires, insect attacks, disease outbreaks, and forest management practices, which is only partially documented across ownerships in an inconsistent fashion. To consistently quantify forest management activities for the entire study area, we leveraged Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, LANDFIRE existing vegetation types and disturbances, monitoring trends in burn severity fire perimeters, and Landsat 8 Burned Area products. Within our methodology, Sentinel-2 images were collected and transformed to orthogonal land cover change difference and ratio metrics using principal component analyses. In addition, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Relativized Burn Ratio index were estimated. These variables were used as predictors in Random Forests machine learning classification models. Known locations of forest treatment units were used to create samples to train the Random Forests models to estimate where changes in forest structure occurred between the years of 2016 and 2019. We visually inspected each derived polygon to manually assign one treatment class, either clearcut or thinning. Landsat 8 Burned Area products were used to derive prescribed fire units for the same period. The bulk of analyses were performed using the RMRS Raster Utility toolbar that facilitated spatial, statistical, and machine learning tools, while significantly reducing the required processing time and storage space associated with analyzing these large datasets. The results were combined with existing LANDFIRE vegetation disturbance and forest treatment data to create a 21-year dataset (1999-2019) for the study area.

TI  - A Comparative Study of Water Indices and Image Classification Algorithms for Mapping Inland Surface Water Bodies Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A comparative study of water indices and image classification algorithms for mapping inland water bodies using Landsat imagery was carried out through obtaining 24 high-resolution (<= 5 m) and cloud-free images archived in Google Earth with the same (or +/- 1 day) acquisition dates as the Landsat-8 OLI images over 24 selected lakes across the globe, and developing a method to generate the alternate ground truth data from the Google Earth images for properly evaluating the Landsat image classification results. In addition to the commonly used green band-based water indices, Landsat-8 OLI's ultra-blue, blue, and red band-based water indices were also tested in this research. Two unsupervised (the zero-water index threshold H0 method and Otsu's automatic threshold selection method) and one supervised (the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) method) image classification algorithms were employed for conducting the image classification. Through comparing a total of 2880 Landsat image classification results with the alternate ground truth data, this study showed that (1) it is not necessary to use some supervised image classification methods for extracting water bodies from Landsat imagery given the high computational cost associated with the supervised image classification algorithms; (2) the unsupervised classification algorithms such as the H0 and Otsu methods could achieve comparable accuracy as the KNN method, although the H0 method produced more large error outliers than the Otsu method, thus the Otsu method is better than the H0 method; and (3) the ultra-blue band-based AWEI(nsuB) is the best water index for the H0 method, and the ultra-blue band-based MNDWI2uB is the best water index for both the Otsu and KNN methods.

TI  - Deep Learning Segmentation and Classification for Urban Village Using a Worldview Satellite Image Based on U-Net
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unplanned urban settlements exist worldwide. The geospatial information of these areas is critical for urban management and reconstruction planning but usually unavailable. Automatically characterizing individual buildings in the unplanned urban village using remote sensing imagery is very challenging due to complex landscapes and high-density settlements. The newly emerging deep learning method provides the potential to characterize individual buildings in a complex urban village. This study proposed an urban village mapping paradigm based on U-net deep learning architecture. The study area is located in Guangzhou City, China. The Worldview satellite image with eight pan-sharpened bands at a 0.5-m spatial resolution and building boundary vector file were used as research purposes. There are ten sites of the urban villages included in this scene of the Worldview image. The deep neural network model was trained and tested based on the selected six and four sites of the urban village, respectively. Models for building segmentation and classification were both trained and tested. The results indicated that the U-net model reached overall accuracy over 86% for building segmentation and over 83% for the classification. The F-1-score ranged from 0.9 to 0.98 for the segmentation, and from 0.63 to 0.88 for the classification. The Interaction over Union reached over 90% for the segmentation and 86% for the classification. The superiority of the deep learning method has been demonstrated through comparison with Random Forest and object-based image analysis. This study fully showed the feasibility, efficiency, and potential of the deep learning in delineating individual buildings in the high-density urban village. More importantly, this study implied that through deep learning methods, mapping unplanned urban settlements could further characterize individual buildings with considerable accuracy.

TI  - On a Flood-Producing Coastal Mesoscale Convective Storm Associated with the Kor'easterlies: Multi-Data Analyses Using Remotely-Sensed and In-Situ Observations and Storm-Scale Model Simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A flood-producing heavy rainfall event occurred at the mountainous coastal region in the northeast of South Korea on 5-6 August 2018, subsequent to extreme heat waves, through a quasi-stationary mesoscale convective system (MCS). We analyzed the storm environment via a multi-data approach using high-resolution (1-km) simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and in situ/satellite/radar observations. The brightness temperature, from the Advanced Himawari Imager water vapor band, and the composite radar reflectivity were used to identify characteristics of the MCS and associated precipitations. The following factors affected this back-building MCS: low-level convergence by the Korea easterlies (Kor'easterlies), carrying moist air into the coast; strong vertical wind shear, making the updraft tilted and sustained; coastal fronts and back-building convection bands, formed through interactions among the Kor'easterlies, cold pool outflows, and orography; mid-level advection of cold air and positive relative vorticity, enhancing vertical convection and potential instability; and vigorous updraft releasing potential instability. The pre-storm synoptic environment provided favorable conditions for storm development such as high moisture and temperature over the coastal area and adjacent sea, and enhancement of the Kor'easterlies by expansion of a surface high pressure system. Upper-level north-northwesterly winds prompted the MCS to propagate south-southeastward along the coastline.

TI  - Compounding Benefits of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Perineal Melanoma A Population-Based Retrospective Cohort Analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in the treatment of melanoma is known to provide valuable prognostic information. However, there is no literature describing an overall or disease-specific survival (DDS) benefit of SLNB. In the perineum, melanoma is often more advanced at presentation with current treatment guidelines translated from nonanatomic specific melanoma. As a result, there is little understanding surrounding the role of SLNB in melanoma of the perineum. Our objective is to better understand the therapeutic benefits of SLNB in perineal melanoma. Methods The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program is a large population-based cancer registry including survival data from millions of patients in the United States. The registry was used to generate patient data for analysis from 2004 to 2016. Inclusion criteria included melanoma of the perineum; Breslow depth of 0.80 mm or greater and less than 0.80 mm with ulceration; SLNB or no intervention; clinically negative nodal disease; and available overall survival data. Results For 879 patients from 2004 to 2016 with perineal melanoma, significant predictors of reduced survival include older than 75 years, Clark level IV-V, Breslow depth of greater than 4.00 mm, positive ulceration status, regional and distant nodal micrometastases, and clinically positive nodes on presentation. Aggregates for overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were improved with implementation of SLNB. The 5-year survival rates with SLNB versus no SLNB were 54.0% and 43.0% for OS (P= 0.001) and 57.8% and 53.1% for DSS (P= 0.044). Stratification by Breslow depth yielded significant OS and DSS advantage for greater than 1.00 to 2.00 mm (21.3% benefit,P=0.021, and 16.8% benefit,P= 0.044) and greater than 4.00 mm (30.3% benefit,P= 0.005, and 21.0% benefit,P= 0.007) Breslow depths. Conclusions and Relevance Sentinel lymph node biopsy may provide therapeutic benefits in addition to prognostic information for melanoma of the perineum through an increase in 5-year OS.

TI  - Assessing Typhoon-Induced Canopy Damage Using Vegetation Indices in the Fushan Experimental Forest, Taiwan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyclonic windstorms profoundly affect forest structure and function throughout the tropics and subtropics. Remote sensing techniques and vegetation indices (VIs) have improved our ability to characterize cyclone impacts over broad spatial scales. Although VIs are useful for understanding changes in forest cover, their consistency on detecting changes in vegetation cover is not well understood. A better understanding of the similarities and differences in commonly used VIs across disturbance events and forest types is needed to reconcile the results from different studies. Using Landsat imagery, we analyzed the change between pre- and post-typhoon VI values (Delta VIs) of four VIs for five typhoons (local name of cyclones in the North Pacific) that affected the Fushan Experimental Forest of Taiwan. We found that typhoons varied in their effect on forest canopy cover even when they had comparable trajectories, wind speeds, and rainfall. Most VIs measured a decrease in forest cover following typhoons, ranging from -1.18% to -19.87%; however, the direction of Delta VI-topography relationships varied among events. All typhoons significantly increased vegetation heterogeneity, and Delta VI was negatively related to pre-typhoon VI across all typhoons. Four of the five typhoons showed that more frequently affected sites had greater VI decreases. VIs ranged in their sensitivity to detect typhoon-induced changes in canopy coverage, and no single VI was most sensitive across all typhoons. Therefore, we recommend using VIs in combination-for example Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), when comparing cyclone-disturbance-induced changes in vegetation cover among disturbances and across forests.

TI  - Simple regression models to estimate light interception in wheat crops with Sentinel-2 and a handheld sensor
T2  - CROP SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Capture of radiation by crop canopies drives growth rate, grain set, and yield. Since the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green area (fAPAR(g)) correlates with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), remote sensors have been used to monitor vegetation. With a 10-m spatial resolution and 5-d revisiting time, the recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite is a promising tool for fAPAR(g) monitoring. However, the available algorithm to estimate fAPAR(g) is based on simulations of canopy interception of several vegetation types and was never tested in field crops. Handheld sensors, such as GreenSeeker, are another alternative to estimate fAPAR(g). Our objectives were (a) to test the ability of indices derived from Sentinel-2 and GreenSeeker NDVI to capture fAPAR(g) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crops, (b) to compare these sensors' performance against the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and (c) to compare our Sentinel-2 model estimations with the available algorithm. In wheat fields in the southwest Argentinean Pampas, on several sampling dates, we measured fAPAR(g) with a quantum light sensor and NDVI with a GreenSeeker. We regressed fAPAR(g) measurements with vegetation indices from the different sources and selected the best models. Sentinel-2 and GreenSeeker NDVI precisely estimated fAPAR(g), with a performance similar to MODIS (p < .05; RMSD = 0.09, 0.11, and 0.08; R-2 = .89, .88, and .95, respectively). The available algorithm to estimate fAPAR(g) with Sentinel-2 yielded biased estimations, mainly in the lower range of fAPAR(g). These results suggest that simple models may provide fAPAR(g) estimations with Sentinel-2 and GreenSeeker in wheat crops with an accuracy suitable for agricultural applications.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Application to the Surface Characterization of Small Water Bodies in Wetlands
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing indicators to monitor environmental change in wetlands with the aid of Earth Observation Systems can help to obtain spatial data that is not feasible with in situ measures (e.g., flooding patterns). In this study, we aim to test Sentinel-2A/B images suitability for detecting small water bodies in wetlands characterized by high diversity of temporal and spatial flooding patterns using previously published indices. For this purpose, we used medium spatial resolution Sentinel-2A/B images of four representative coastal wetlands in the Valencia Region (East Spain, Mediterranean Sea), and on three different dates. To validate the results, 60 points (30 in water areas and 30 in land areas) were distributed randomly within a 20 m buffer around the border of each digitized water polygon for each date and wetland (600 in total). These polygons were mapped using as a base map orthophotos of high spatial resolution. In our study, the best performing index was the NDWI. Overall accuracy and Kappa index results were optimal for -0.30 threshold in all the studied wetlands and dates. The consistency in the results is key to provide a methodology to characterize water bodies in wetlands as generalizable as possible. Most studies developed in wetlands have focused on calculating global gain or loss of wetland area. However, inside of wetlands which hold protection figures, the main threat is not necessarily land use change, but rather water management strategies. Applying Sentinel-2A/B images to calculate the NDWI index and monitor flooded area changes will be key to analyse the consequence of these management actions.

TI  - Impact of Changes in Clinical Microbiology Laboratory Location and Ownership on the Practice of Infectious Diseases
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of onsite clinical microbiology laboratories in hospitals is decreasing, likely related to the business model for laboratory consolidation and labor shortages, and this impacts a variety of clinical practices, including that of banking isolates for clinical or epidemiologic purposes. To determine the impact of these trends, infectious disease (ID) physicians were surveyed regarding their perceptions of offsite services. Clinical microbiology practices for retention of clinical isolates for future use were also determined. Surveys were sent to members of the Infectious Diseases Society of America's (IDSA) Emerging Infections Network (EIN). The EIN is a sentinel network of ID physicians who care for adult and/or pediatric patients in North America and who are members of IDSA. The response rate was 763 (45%) of 1,680 potential respondents. Five hundred forty (81%) respondents reported interacting with the clinical microbiology laboratory. Eighty-six percent of respondents thought an onsite laboratory very important for timely diagnostic reporting and ongoing communication with the clinical microbiologist. Thirty-five percent practiced in institutions where the core microbiology laboratory has been moved offsite, and an additional 7% (n = 38) reported that movement of core laboratory functions offsite was being considered. The respondents reported that only 24% of laboratories banked all isolates, with the majority saving isolates for less than 30 days. Based on these results, the trend toward centralized core laboratories negatively impacts the practice of ID physicians, potentially delays effective implementation of prompt and targeted care for patients with serious infections, and similarly adversely impacts infection control epidemiologic investigations.

TI  - Quantifying Seagrass Distribution in Coastal Water with Deep Learning Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems are critically affected by seagrass, both economically and ecologically. However, reliable seagrass distribution information is lacking in nearly all parts of the world because of the excessive costs associated with its assessment. In this paper, we develop two deep learning models for automatic seagrass distribution quantification based on 8-band satellite imagery. Specifically, we implemented a deep capsule network (DCN) and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to assess seagrass distribution through regression. The DCN model first determines whether seagrass is presented in the image through classification. Second, if seagrass is presented in the image, it quantifies the seagrass through regression. During training, the regression and classification modules are jointly optimized to achieve end-to-end learning. The CNN model is strictly trained for regression in seagrass and non-seagrass patches. In addition, we propose a transfer learning approach to transfer knowledge in the trained deep models at one location to perform seagrass quantification at a different location. We evaluate the proposed methods in three WorldView-2 satellite images taken from the coastal area in Florida. Experimental results show that the proposed deep DCN and CNN models performed similarly and achieved much better results than a linear regression model and a support vector machine. We also demonstrate that using transfer learning techniques for the quantification of seagrass significantly improved the results as compared to directly applying the deep models to new locations.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article reveals the imaginative and emotionally expressive potential of Russian impersonal sentences in fiction. It is based Vasily Belov's story "The Same Old Thing". The key phrase of the story, which is an impersonal sentence, is examined. The article analyzes the functions of the impersonal predicates most frequently used in the story, of various types of impersonal sentences, of dialectal and colloquial forms of impersonality. Special attention is paid to the role of impersonal-genitive constructions in the formation of ideological and imaginative content of the story. The article notes that varieties of the semantic and grammatical category of impersonality help the author convey Ivan Afrikanovich Drynov's - the protagonist's - feelings and views. The combination of impersonal constructions and comparisons, the high frequency of impersonal sentences in particular fragments of the story help create a deeper and more meaningful narrative.

T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Omadacycline is a broad-spectrum aminomethylcycline approved in October 2018 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired pneumonia as both an oral and intravenous once-daily formulation. In this report, the activities of omadacycline and comparators were tested against 49,000 nonduplicate bacterial isolates collected prospectively during 2016 to 2018 from medical centers in Europe (24,500 isolates, 40 medical centers [19 countries]) and the United States (24,500 isolates, 33 medical centers [23 states and all 9 U.S. census divisions]). Omadacycline was tested by broth microdilution following the methods in Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute document M07 (Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard, 11th ed., 2018). Omadacycline (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mg/liter) inhibited 98.6% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at <= 0.5 mg/liter, including 96.3% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates and 99.8% of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates. Omadacycline potency was comparable for Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mg/liter), viridans group streptococci (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mg/liter), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC50/90, 0.12/ 0.25 mg/liter), regardless of species and susceptibility to penicillin, macrolides, or tetracycline. Omadacycline was active against all Enterobacterales tested (MIC50/90, 1/8 mg/liter; 87.5% of isolates were inhibited at <= 4 mg/liter) except Proteus mirabilis (MIC50/90, 16/> 32 mg/liter) and indole-positive Proteus spp. (MIC50/90, 8/32 mg/liter) and was most active against Escherichia coli (MIC5(0/90), 0.5/2 mg/liter), Klebsiella oxytoca (MIC50/90, 1/2 mg/liter), and Citrobacter spp. (MIC50/90, 1/4 mg/liter). Omadacycline inhibited 92.4% of Enterobacter cloacae species complex and 88.5% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates at <= 4 mg/liter. Omadacycline was active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mg/liter), regardless of beta-lactamase status, and against Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, <= 0.12/0.25 mg/liter). The potent activity of omadacycline against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria indicates that omadacycline merits further study in serious infections in which multidrug resistance and mixed Grampositive and Gram-negative bacterial infections may be a concern.

TI  - Decision Tree Algorithms for Developing Rulesets for Object-Based Land Cover Classification
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Decision tree (DT) algorithms are important non-parametric tools used for land cover classification. While different DTs have been applied to Landsat land cover classification, their individual classification accuracies and performance have not been compared, especially on their effectiveness to produce accurate thresholds for developing rulesets for object-based land cover classification. Here, the focus was on comparing the performance of five DT algorithms: Tree, C5.0, Rpart, Ipred, and Party. These DT algorithms were used to classify ten land cover classes using Landsat 8 images on the Copperbelt Province of Zambia. Classification was done using object-based image analysis (OBIA) through the development of rulesets with thresholds defined by the DTs. The performance of the DT algorithms was assessed based on: (1) DT accuracy through cross-validation; (2) land cover classification accuracy of thematic maps; and (3) other structure properties such as the sizes of the tree diagrams and variable selection abilities. The results indicate that only the rulesets developed from DT algorithms with simple structures and a minimum number of variables produced high land cover classification accuracies (overall accuracy > 88%). Thus, algorithms such as Tree and Rpart produced higher classification results as compared to C5.0 and Party DT algorithms, which involve many variables in classification. This high accuracy has been attributed to the ability to minimize overfitting and the capacity to handle noise in the data during training by the Tree and Rpart DTs. The study produced new insights on the formal selection of DT algorithms for OBIA ruleset development. Therefore, the Tree and Rpart algorithms could be used for developing rulesets because they produce high land cover classification accuracies and have simple structures. As an avenue of future studies, the performance of DT algorithms can be compared with contemporary machine-learning classifiers (e.g., Random Forest and Support Vector Machine).

TI  - Applying LiDAR to Quantify the Plant Area Index Along a Successional Gradient in a Tropical Forest of Thailand
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term monitoring of vegetation is critical for understanding the dynamics of forest ecosystems, especially in Southeast Asia's tropical forests, which play a significant role in the global carbon cycle and have continually been converted into various stages of secondary forests. In Thailand, long-term monitoring of forest dynamics during the successional process is limited to plot scales assuming from the distinct structure of successional stages. Our study highlights the potential of coupling airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology and stand age data derived from Landsat time-series to track back forest succession, and infer patterns in the plant area index (PAI) recovery. Here, using LIDAR data, we estimated the PAI of the 510 sample plots of a seasonal evergreen forest dispersed over the study area in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, capturing a successional gradient of tropical secondary forests. The sample plots age was derived from the available Landsat time-series dataset (1972-2017). We developed a PAI recovery model during the first 42 years of the succession process. We investigated the relationship between the model residuals and PAI values with topographic factors, such as elevation, slope, and topographic wetness index. The results show that the PAI increased non-linearly (pseudo-R(2)of 0.56) during the first 42 years of forest succession, and all three topographic factors have less influence on PAI variability. These results provide valuable information of the spatio-temporal PAI patterns during the successional process and help understand the dynamics of tropical secondary forests in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. Such information is essential for forest management and local, regional, and global PAI synthesis. Moreover, our results provide significant information for ground-based spatial sampling strategies to enable more accurate PAI measurements.

TI  - Monitoring the Recent Activity of Landslides in the Mailuu-Suu Valley (Kyrgyzstan) Using Radar and Optical Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Asian mountain regions are prone to multiple types of natural hazards, often causing damage due to the impact of mass movements. In spring 2017, Kyrgyzstan suffered significant losses from a massive landslide activation event, during which also two of the largest deep-seated mass movements of the former mining area of Mailuu-Suu-the Koytash and Tektonik landslides-were reactivated. This study consists of the use of optical and radar satellite data to highlight deformation zones and identify displacements prior to the collapse of Koytash and to the more superficial deformation on Tektonik. Especially for the first one, the comparison of Digital Elevation Models of 2011 and 2017 (respectively, satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery-based) highlights areas of depletion and accumulation, in the scarp and near the toe, respectively. The Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry analysis identified slow displacements during the months preceding the reactivation in April 2017, indicating the long-term sliding activity of Koytash and Tektonik. This was confirmed by the computation of deformation time series, showing a positive velocity anomaly on the upper part of both landslides. Furthermore, the analysis of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index revealed land cover changes associated with the sliding process between June 2016 and October 2017. In addition, in situ data from a local meteorological station highlighted the important contribution of precipitation as a trigger of the collapse. The multidirectional approach used in this study demonstrated the efficiency of applying multiple remote sensing techniques, combined with a meteorological analysis, to identify triggering factors and monitor the activity of landslides.

TI  - Could honey bees signal the spread of antimicrobial resistance in the environment?
T2  - LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The honey bee has long been known to be a bioindicator of environmental pollution and the use of antimicrobials in the beekeeping industry is strictly regulated. For these reasons, this paper was aimed to evaluate for the first time the role of Apis mellifera as a possible indicator of environmental antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The study isolated and analysed the resistance patterns of Enterobacteriaceae from a pool of honey bee guts located in five different environmental sites (ES), where different antimicrobial selective pressures were hypothesized. In all, 48 isolates were considered for identification and underwent analyses of AMR to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefazolin, ceftazidime, tetracycline, imipenem, enrofloxacin, amikacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In all, 12 isolates out of 48 (25%) showed resistance to at least one antimicrobial drug. There were no significant differences between the resistance rates observed in the ESs, even if the highest percentage of resistance was found in ES4. Resistances to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resulted significantly higher than those detected towards the other antimicrobials. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is not commonly used in beekeeping but it is extensively used in animals and in humans, suggesting an environmental origin of this resistance and supporting the hypothesis that honey bees could be used as indicators of AMR spread in the environment.Significance and Impact of the Study In this study, a possible role of honey bees as indicator of environmental antimicrobial resistance is hypothesized. Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from bees living in different environmental sites (ES) where different antimicrobial selective pressures were hypothesized. Even if no differences between the resistances in the five ES were observed, the resistance rates for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, compared to other antimicrobials, were significantly higher. Since amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is not used in beekeeping but it is extensively used in animals and in humans, an environmental origin of this resistance is suggested that supports our hypothesis.

M3  - Article
AB  - It has been revealed from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications MERRA analyses, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS/Terra satellite imageries, Naval Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System NAAPS model outputs, Cloud -Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations CALIPSO imageries, Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory HYSPLIT model trajectories, atmospheric soundings, and observational records of dust emission that there were multiple dust storms in the far western parts of India from 12 to 15 June 2018 due to thunderstorms. This led to the lifting of the dust from the surface. The entry of dust into the upper air was caused by the generation of a significant amount of turbulent kinetic energy as a function of strong wind shear generated by the negative buoyancy of the cooled air aloft and the convective buoyancy in the lower planetary boundary layer. Elevated dust reached a significant vertical height and was advected towards the northern/northwestern/northeastern parts of India. In the meantime, this dust was carried by northwesterly winds associated with the jets in the upper level, which advected dust towards the skies over Nepal where rainfall was occurring at that time. Consequently, this led to the muddy rain in Nepal.

TI  - The impact of exurban development on forested areas in Kurgan City, Russia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exurban communities-a significant form of urban sprawl-can transform natural land cover. Exurban development refers to an expansion of communities located outside a city and its suburbs. One of the main reasons these settlements develop is a desire by residents to live closer to nature and developers' recognition of the profitability of addressing this desire. Additionally, exurbs can become prosperous regions settled by people with high income. However, exurban development not only directly affects community patterns, but also species patterns, habitat reduction and disconnection, as well as land cover and land use alterations. The purpose of this paper is a quantitative analysis of the land cover transformation and forest fragmentation in Post-Soviet Russia, based on an empirical case study of the city of Kurgan. This case study also contributes to the overall research of urban sprawl in Russian provinces by adding to the discussion of homeowners' behavior, regional environmental policies, and their role concerning the impacts of exurban settlements on the natural environment. This paper uses remote sensing imagery, census data, and primary data to analyze land cover change due to the emergence of exurban communities around Kurgan, Russia, with specific emphasis on the changes to native vegetation resulting from human behavior and stakeholder preferences.

TI  - Impact of urban and industrial features on land surface temperature: Evidences from satellite thermal indices
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface transformations associated to the urbanization has impacted local climates and terrestrial surface energy processes. The occurrence of higher temperatures in urbanized areas when compared to rural and natural areas is called surface urban heat island (SUHI). The aim of this work was to investigate different remote sensing thermal indices and their impact in an urbanized and industrialized city in Southeast Brazil. This municipality constitutes an interesting case of middle-sized city, between two big cities, that might be currently undergoing unsustainable growth. Landsat satellite images were used to derive the thermal indices based on Land Surface Temperature (LST). The results showed that high LST values were concentrated in urban and industrial areas, with buildings, impermeable pavements and sparse vegetation. Urbanized and poorly vegetated areas showed high SUHI intensity. Vegetated areas had the best thermal comfort in town. Industries and parking lots were frequently classified as SUHI and were also considered as urban hot spots. The type of materials used in constructing these areas seems to be a reason for the higher temperatures. Further studies are needed in order to better understand the thermal conductivity of those materials and to plan how to reduce temperature in such areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the 30-year record of Landsat satellite imagery to better understand the patterns and processes of land loss/gain and recent changes in marshland vegetation green cover in coastal wetlands of Breton Sound basin of southeastern Louisiana. Impacted by both Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Gustav in 2008, this vast estuary area just south of New Orleans was mapped at 30 m resolution in 5-year intervals from 1985 to 2017 using the Landsat Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVD. Results revealed an entirely new picture of marshland change prior to Hurricanes Katrina and Gustav in the Breton Sound basin. Following decades of extensive wetland loss resulting largely from gas and oil well drilling and canal construction, this analysis estimated gains in land area between 1985 and 2005 (pre-Katrina) of 247 km(2) across all subbasins of Breton Sound. The largest proportional increases in marshland areas were mapped from dNDWI analysis in the subbasins of Bayou la Loutre, Bayou Pointe-en-Pointe, and Bayou Terre Aux Boeufs, all surrounding the outer Mississippi River Gulf Outlet Canal. Brackish salinity areas were among the first of Louisiana's coastal wetlands to succumb to the hurricane storm surges of 2005 and 2008, as Landsat dNDWI analysis estimated that about 245 km2 of wetlands in the Breton Sound basin were lost to open water from the impacts of Hurricanes Katrina and Gustay. However, combined dNDWI and dNDVI analysis indicated that gains in marshland area and green vegetation cover have occurred at a yearly rate of increase after 2008 comparable to the period between 1985 and 2005. Specific areas of rapid land gain were detected in River aux Chenes and Bayou Bienvenue subbasins, and Bayou Plaquemines and Bayou la Loutre in brackish to saltwater marshland types on the outer margins of Breton Sound basin.

TI  - Changes in Vegetation Phenology and Productivity in Alaska Over the Past Two Decades
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding trends in vegetation phenology and growing season productivity at a regional scale is important for global change studies, particularly as linkages can be made between climate shifts and the vegetation's potential to sequester or release carbon into the atmosphere. Trends and geographic patterns of change in vegetation growth and phenology from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data sets were analyzed for the state of Alaska over the period 2000 to 2018. Phenology metrics derived from the MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series at 250 m resolution tracked changes in the total integrated greenness cover (TIN), maximum annual NDVI (MAXN), and start of the season timing (SOST) date over the past two decades. SOST trends showed significantly earlier seasonal vegetation greening (at more than one day per year) across the northeastern Brooks Range Mountains, on the Yukon-Kuskokwim coastal plain, and in the southern coastal areas of Alaska. TIN and MAXN have increased significantly across the western Arctic Coastal Plain and within the perimeters of most large wildfires of the Interior boreal region that burned since the year 2000, whereas TIN and MAXN have decreased notably in watersheds of Bristol Bay and in the Cook Inlet lowlands of southwestern Alaska, in the same regions where earlier-trending SOST was also detected. Mapping results from this MODIS time-series analysis have identified a new database of localized study locations across Alaska where vegetation phenology has recently shifted notably, and where land cover types and ecosystem processes could be changing rapidly.

TI  - The role of preoperative computerized tomography (CT) scan of the cornrow pelvis and groin in the management of clinically early staged vulva squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) commonly metastasises through groin lymphatics. However, the use of pre-operative imaging in detecting inguinal nodal metastasis before staging surgery or to triage patients for sentinel node biopsy remains unclear. Here, we investigated if pre-operative CT scan, the imaging choice in our cancer centre, influences the overall course of VSCC management in those patients without clinical evidence of groin lymphadenopathy.Method. The study comprised of a prospective cohort of 225 patients with VSCC who underwent staging surgery within a regional tertiary gynaecological cancer centre. Comprehensive information of the cohort's demography, clinicopathological variables and outcome data were collected and analysed. Findings of pre-operative imaging were compared with histological findings of inguinal lymph nodes following groin lymphadenectomy. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS V24.Results. Pre-operative CT scan was performed on 116 (56.6%) patients. The sensitivity and specificity of crosssectional imaging in detecting groin lymphatic metastasis were 59.1% and 77.8%, respectively; while the positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 61.9% and 75.7%, respectively. In patients who had sentinel inguinal nodes biopsy, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of CT scan in detecting inguinal node metastasis were 30.0%, 85.7%, 33.3% and 83.7%, respectively. There was no difference in disease-free and overall survival in those who received pre-operative imaging when compared to those who did not.Conclusion. Pre-operative CT scan may be omitted in early stage VSCC prior to surgical staging as it does not affect overall management and surgical outcomes. (C) 2020 Elsevier inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Application of learning vector quantization and different machine learning techniques to assessing forest fire influence factors and spatial modelling
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses forest-fire susceptibility (FFS) in Fars Province, Iran using three geographic information system (GIS)-based machine-learning algorithms: boosted regression tree (BRT), general linear model (GLM), and mixture discriminant analysis (MDA). Recently, BRT, GLM, and MDA have become important machine-learning algorithms and their use has been enriched by application to various fields of research. A database of historical FFs identified using Landsat-8 OLI and MODIS satellite images (at 358 locations) and ten influencing factors (elevation, slope, topographical wetness index, aspect, distance from urban areas, annual mean temperature, land use, distance from road, annual mean rainfall, and distance from river) were input into a GIS. The 358 sites were divided into two sets for training (70%) and validation (30%). BRT, GLM, and MDA models were used to analyze the spatial relationships between the factors influencing FFs and the locations of fires to generate an FFS map. The prediction success of each modelled FFS map was determined with the help of the ROC curve, accuracy, overall accuracy, True-skill statistic (TSS), F-measures, corrected classify instances (CCI), and K-fold cross-validation (4-fold). The accuracy results of training and validation dataset in the BRT (AUC = 88.90% and 88.2%) and MDA (AUC = 86.4% and 85.6%) models are more effective than the GLM (AUC = 86.6% and 82.5%) model. Also, the outcome of the 4-fold measure confirmed the results from the other accuracy measures. Therefore, the accuracies of the BRT and MDA models are satisfactory and are suitable for FFS mapping in Fars Province. Finally, the well-accepted neural network application of learning-vector quantization (LVQ) reveals that land use, annual mean rainfall, and slope angle were the most useful determinants of FFS. The resulting FFS maps can enhance the effectiveness of planning and management of forest resources and ecological balances in this province.

TI  - A modern assessment of the surgical pathologic spread and nodal dissemination of endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To examine the risk of nodal metastases in a contemporary cohort of women based on pathologic risk factors including histology, depth of invasion, tumor grade, and lymphovascular space invasion.Methods. Women with endometrial cancer who underwent hysterectomy from 2004 to 2016 who were registered in the National Cancer Database were analyzed. Patients were stratified by T stage: T1A (<50% myometrial invasion), T1B (>50% myometrial invasion) and 12 (cervical involvement). Lymph node metastases were assessed in relation to tumor T stage and grade, and further stratified by lymphovascular space invasion.Results. We identified 161,960 patients. The rate of nodal metastases within the endometrioid histology cohort was 22% for T1A cancers, 12.8% for T1B cancers and 19.9% for T2 cancers. For stage PA cancers, the percent of patients with positive nodes increased from 1.1% for grade 1 cancers, to 2.9% for grade 2 cancers to 4.8% for grade 3 cancers. The corresponding rates of nodal metastases for stage T1B cancers were 8.6%, 13.7%, and 16.9%, respectively. For T1A cancers without lymphovascular space invasion, nodal metastases ranged from 0.6% in those with grade 1 cancers to 3.0% for grade 3 cancers. The corresponding risk of nodal disease ranged from 11.8% to 13.9% for T1A cancers with lymphovascular space invasion.Conclusions. There was a sequential increase in the risk of lymph node metastases based on depth of uterine invasion, tumor grade, and the presence of lymphovascular space invasion. The overall rate of nodal metastasis is lower than reported in the original GOG 33. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Role of Quaternary glacial-outburst megaflood paleochannel deposits in a basalt-dominated aquifer system in the West Plains area of eastern Washington, USA
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Approximately 2 km(2) of sand- and gravel-rich Pleistocene glacial-outburst megaflood sediment has accumulated in a series of five subparallel paleochannels that are an important component of a basalt-dominated aquifer system on the semiarid, ~450-km(2) West Plains area. Located near Spokane, Washington (USA), the West Plains paleochannel deposits have been used for artificial storage and recovery wells and for planned and passive stormwater disposal in this rapidly growing area. Recent recognition of perfluorooctanoic acid contamination and excessive drawdowns have led to the closure of multiple municipal wells on the West Plains, highlighting the challenges of developing a sustainable groundwater supply in this complex aquifer system. Geologic and hydrogeologic data, from more than 1,400 water-well reports, surface exposures, existing groundwater geochemistry reports, and modeling, reveal the interconnections between the paleochannel deposits and surrounding basalt flows in three dimensions (3D). Initially incised into the Miocene Columbia River Basalt and excavated by Pleistocene glacial-outburst megaflooding, the West Plains paleochannels are projected in unprecedented 3D. This study's modeled interactions between the more highly hydraulically conductive (100x) paleochannel sedimentary deposits and surrounding basalt beds provide insight into C-14 ages and tritium values that had been measured previously. Sediment-filled closed depressions at the bases of the paleochannels, which are features likely formed by turbulent bursts ('kolks') during peak megaflood flows, are potentially promising groundwater storage sites. However, because of the relatively higher permeability of the unconfined paleochannel deposits, the closed depressions also are potential conduits for infiltration of contamination to deeper parts of the aquifer system.

TI  - <i>The Peaceful Scenes of Military Life</i>: The First Cycle of Stories by Nikolai Naumov
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the cycle The Peaceful Scenes of Military Life and its place in Nikolai Naumov's literary work, which was continually combined with his civil service. The author of the article analyzes the mechanisms linking the stories of this cycle and helping Naumov to create the multi-faceted image of a Siberian soldier and Siberia as a specific locus. He also investigates the genre, ideological and aesthetic features of Naumov's literary work that are forming in this cycle under the influence of ideas of St. Petersburg Siberian circle. The analysis showed that, in this cycle, Naumov created a bright type of a Siberian, or rather some of its variants: carriers of national consciousness, traditions, universal values, according to Naumov preserved in their purest form in Siberia, and people with an emerging new type of consciousness, focused on individualism. In addition, the heroes of the cycle can be divided into two groups according to their social status, origin, worldview and belonging to the Siberian region: (1) Siberian soldiers who came the army from the peasant and philistine environment and (2) their commanders belonging to the nobility who came to Siberia from central Russia on duty. Naumov emphasizes the striking contrast between them, which shapes as hidden hostility and conflict. The narrator's (and author's) sympathy (but not idealization) is invariably addressed to Siberian soldiers. The other significant points of the poetics of cyclization in The Peaceful Scenes of Military Life are the macro-plot, the common range of topics and problems, which allow Naumov to escape from the documentary narrative (this is how the theme of the Siberian peasantry was mainly interpreted by both metropolitan and Siberian writers) towards the artistic narration uniting the specific and the universal, the momentary and the eternal, circumstances and personal morality and psychology into a deep image of the world. Such a peculiar artistic embodiment of one of the most acute topics of Russian public life in the second half of the 19th century-the themes of Siberia and Siberian-organically fits into the general channel of the evolution of Russian literature of the period, testifying to the powerful socio-historical and cultural potential of this topic, whose development in the indicated way gives start to Naumov's service to Siberia.

TI  - Landslide Mapping and Susceptibility Assessment Using Geospatial Analysis and Earth Observation Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The western part of Crete Island has undergone serious landslide events in the past. The intense rainfalls that took place in the September 2018 to February 2019 period provoked extensive landslide events at the northern part of Chania prefecture, along the motorway A90. Geospatial analysis methods and earth observation data were utilized to investigate the impact of the various physical and anthropogenic factors on landslides and to evaluate landslide susceptibility. The landslide inventory map was created based on literature, aerial photo analysis, satellite images, and field surveys. A very high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and land cover map was produced from a dense point cloud and Earth Observation data (Landsat 8), accordingly. Sentinel-2 data were used for the detection of the recent landslide events and offered suitable information for two of them. Eight triggering factors were selected and manipulated in a GIS-based environment. A semi-quantitative method of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) was applied to evaluate the landslide susceptibility index (LSI) both for Chania prefecture and the motorway A90 in Chania. The validation of the two LSI maps provided accurate results and, in addition, several susceptible points with high landslide hazards along the motorway A90 were detected.

TI  - Intraseasonal Kelvin Waves in the Equatorial Indian Ocean and Their Propagation into the Indonesian Seas
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intraseasonal oceanic variations in the Indian Ocean are prominent mode of variability affecting evolution of the Indian Ocean Dipole, the semiannual Wyrtki jets, and the Indonesian throughflow. This study describes the structure and propagation of wind-forced intraseasonal Kelvin waves along the equator in the Indian Ocean and their penetration into the Indonesian seas. For this purpose, we use an unprecedented multiyear (2004-2016) moored velocity time series data set from the equatorial central and eastern Indian Ocean, moored time series from Lombok, Makassar, and Ombai straits; satellite altimetry, and other oceanic and atmospheric data products. The waves are generated by zonal wind fluctuations with periods of approximately 20-90 days. They propagate eastward along the equator at speeds close to that of a second baroclinic mode (with estimates ranging between 1.3 and 1.7 ms(-1) depending on method) and have an exponential latitudinal decay scale away from the equator of similar to 250 km. Phase also propagates upward, implying downward energy propagation, consistent with wind energy source at the surface. As the waves encounter the coast of Sumatra, they partially reflect into Rossby waves that radiate energy westward back into the ocean interior. Some wave energy also propagates southward along the coasts of Sumatra and Java and can be traced into Lombok, Ombai, and Makassar straits at lags of about 2-3 weeks. The implications of these results for understanding variability in the Indian Ocean and its connectivity with the Indonesian seas are discussed.Plain Language Summary We investigate Indian Ocean equatorial Kelvin waves on weekly to monthly timescales and their propagation into the Indonesian seas. For this purpose, we use ocean current velocity data from an unprecedented number of moorings during 2004-2016, plus satellite data and other data sets. Consistent with theoretical expectations, the wave structures decay exponentially away from the equator to the north and south, with a decay scale of approximately 250 km. The phase of the zonal current variations propagates eastward and upward consistent with eastward and downward energy propagation expected for Kelvin waves forced by surface winds. When the waves encounter the west coast of Sumatra, they partially reflect into Rossby waves that propagate westward back into the interior of the ocean. Some energy also continues poleward as coastal waves along Sumatra and Java. These waves eventually make their way into Lombok, Ombai, and Makassar straits in the Indonesian seas, affecting the velocity there. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding broader regional circulation patterns in the Indian Ocean.

The shipborne gravity campaign, described in this article, is the beginning of a series of gravimetry measurements in the Polish Exclusive Economy Zone. The campaign was conducted in the area where the accuracy of geoid determination is crucial for the safety of navigation on numerous intersecting ships' routes. The vicinity of the seashore, various depths, and short-lasting campaign enabled determination of the level of measurement accuracy that can be obtained depending on the conditions. Internal data consistency was estimated as well as an attempt to compute external accuracy. The data were compared with satellite data available for the region. We identified which of the differences are related to the influence of external factors.

TI  - Bioconversion of citrus peel wastes into bioflocculants and their application in the removal of microcystins
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the mechanism for converting citrus peel wastes (CPW) into bioflocculants using Math:genes Pecans subsp. phenolicus ZY-16 was analysed. The results demonstrated that the ZY-16 strain could produce various lignocellulolytic enzymes, containing cellulase, hemicellulase, pectinase, protease, and ligninase, enhancing the hydrolysis of citrus peel wastes. Molecular distillation removes antimicrobial limonene, which could inhibit bioflocculant production. The optimal fermentation conditions with the highest bioflocculant yield (3.49 g/14 were 38.79 g/L of CPW, 35.54 degrees C, and pH 4.48. Furthermore, the bioflocculant was used to eliminate microcystins for the first time, and the highest removal efficiency (90.05%) was achieved at a pH of 3.0, after 800 mg/L of bioflocculant was added into the microcystins solution (10 mg/L) for 60 min.Therefore, this paper demonstrated that CPW could be a cost-effective feedstock for the production of bioflocculants, which have potential application in microcystin removal.

TI  - Application conditions and impact factors for various vegetation indices in constructing the LAI seasonal trajectory over different vegetation types
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a required input for various ecological and crop models. To investigate the application conditions of various vegetation indices (VIs), especially the VIs constructed by red-edge band (VIRE) for estimating LAI, six VIs derived from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) data were used to construct LAI seasonal trajectory for different vegetation types at 15 sites. The PROSAIL model combined with the Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) method was adopted to explore the influences and physical basis of canopy biophysical and non-canopy variables on the construction of LAI seasonal trajectory using VIs. For deciduous forests, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) had the highest sensitivity to LAI when LAI < 2, while the RE normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIRE) had the highest sensitivity when LAI > 2. For evergreen forests, there were no obvious differences among the sensitivities of six VIs to LAI when LAI < 5, while the RE chlorophyll index (CIRE) had the highest sensitivities when LAI > 5. For crops, all the VIs had the similar sensitivities at LAI < 3, while the CIRE and MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) were most sensitive to LAI variations at LAI > 3. For all three types of vegetation, the VI RE maintained relatively high sensitivity to LAI over the whole range of LAI, especially at high LAI values. The VIs were most affected by chlorophyll content (Cab) and average leaf inclination angle (ALA); their total contribution was about 85%. However, the influence of ALA on VI RE was relatively weak, implying that the VI RE had the potential to establish a universal model for LAI estimation among different vegetation types. Therefore, the optimal VIs over different ranges of LAI were suggested to estimate LAI. In addition, the VI RE should be a preferred choice for estimating LAI to reduce the simulation errors of seasonal LAI, if the RE band is available.

TI  - Distinguishing and mapping of aquatic vegetations and yellow algae bloom with Landsat satellite data in a complex shallow Lake, China during 1986-2018
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global lakes have suffered from algae blooms and loss or expansion of aquatic vegetations in recent decades. Remote sensing is considered as an effective approach to monitor aquatic vegetations and algae blooms. However, individual spectral index is unable to separate them due to the similarity in spectral features. In this paper, spectral characteristics analyses were conducted to find suitable spectral indices for distinguishing emergent vegetation, submerged aquatic vegetation and floating yellow algae in a complex aquatic environment, Ulansuhai Lake, China. It was found that near infrared band was appropriate to extract open water, and short-wave infrared band was suitable for extracting emergent vegetation, whereas the green and red bands were the characteristic spectra for distinguishing submerged aquatic vegetation and yellow algae. Hence, we firstly used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to extract open water, and the emergent vegetation spectral index (EVSI) to extract emergent vegetation. Then, a new developed macroalgae index (MAI) was used for distinguishing submerged aquatic vegetation and yellow algae. The applicability of the spectral indices was tested against both in situ measurements and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. The results indicated that the combination of these spectral indices was an effective method to separate aquatic vegetations and yellow algae. The proposed method was then applied to time-series Landsat images for investigating the seasonal and inter annual dynamics of aquatic vegetations and yellow algae and their responses to air temperature in the Ulansuhai Lake. The results show that emergent vegetation area increased from May to its maximum in July. The submerged aquatic vegetation area gradually increased from May to its maximum coverage in August, and decreased from late September. The yellow algae appeared in late May, and reached its maximum area in June or July, and disappeared in October. The long-term variation analyses showed that emergent vegetation area increased from 1986 to 2014, and was decreasing from 2014. The area of submerged aquatic vegetation increased during 1986-2008, and sharply decreased from 2009 to 2013, followed by a significant increasing from 2014. The yellow algae bloom mainly outbroke during the period of 1998 to 2010. We also found that the yellow algae area was more sensitive to short term mean temperature, while the area of emergent vegetation was sensitive to longer timescale of temperature. The submerged aquatic vegetation area had no significant correlation with air temperature. Besides, our study also indicated that the MAI concept can be extendable and applicable to other high-resolution satellite sensors (e.g., GF-2 PMS) and other regions with different algae blooms (e.g., Yellow Sea).

TI  - A framework for large-scale mapping of human settlement extent from Sentinel-2 images via fully convolutional neural networks
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Human settlement extent (HSE) information is a valuable indicator of world-wide urbanization as well as the resulting human pressure on the natural environment. Therefore, mapping HSE is critical for various environmental issues at local, regional, and even global scales. This paper presents a deep-learning-based framework to automatically map HSE from multi-spectral Sentinel-2 data using regionally available geo-products as training labels. A straightforward, simple, yet effective fully convolutional network-based architecture, Sen2HSE, is implemented as an example for semantic segmentation within the framework. The framework is validated against both manually labelled checking points distributed evenly over the test areas, and the OpenStreetMap building layer. The HSE mapping results were extensively compared to several baseline products in order to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed HSE mapping framework. The HSE mapping power is consistently demonstrated over 10 representative areas across the world. We also present one regional-scale and one country-wide HSE mapping example from our framework to show the potential for upscaling. The results of this study contribute to the generalization of the applicability of CNN-based approaches for large-scale urban mapping to cases where no up-to-date and accurate ground truth is available, as well as the subsequent monitor of global urbanization.

TI  - CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration, A Critical Factor Influencing the Relationship between Solar-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence and Gross Primary Productivity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The uncertainty of carbon fluxes of the terrestrial ecosystem is the highest among all flux components, calling for more accurate and efficient means to monitor land sinks. Gross primary productivity (GPP) is a key index to estimate the terrestrial ecosystem carbon flux, which describes the total amount of organic carbon fixed by green plants through photosynthesis. In recent years, the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which is a probe for vegetation photosynthesis and can quickly reflect the state of vegetation growth, emerges as a novel and promising proxy to estimate GPP. The launch of Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) further makes it possible to estimate GPP at a finer spatial resolution compared with Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) and SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY). However, whether the relationship between GPP and SIF is linear or non-linear has always been controversial. In this research, we proposed a new model to estimate GPP using SIF and the atmospheric CO2 concentration from OCO-2 as critical driven factors simultaneously (SIF-CO2-GPP model). Evidences from all sites show that the introduction of the atmospheric CO2 concentration improves accuracies of estimated GPP. Compared with the SIF-CO2-GPP linear model, we found the SIF-GPP model overestimated GPP in summer and autumn but underestimated it in spring and winter. A series of simulation experiments based on SCOPE (Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy) was carried out to figure out the possible mechanism of improved estimates of GPP due to the introduction of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These experiments also demonstrate that there could be a non-linear relationship between SIF and GPP at half an hour timescale. Moreover, such relationships vary with CO2 concentration. As OCO-2 is capable of providing SIF and XCO2 products with identical spatial and temporal scales, the SIF-CO2-GPP linear model would be implemented conveniently to monitor GPP using remotely sensed data. With the help of OCO-3 and its successors, the proposed SIF-CO2-GPP linear model would play a significant role in monitoring GPP accurately in large geographical extents.

TI  - Optimal Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i> L.) Land Suitability Using GIS-Based Multicriteria Analysis and Sentinel-2 Multitemporal Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soybean is regarded as one of the most produced crops in the world, presenting a source of high-quality protein for human and animal diets. The general objective of the study was to determine the optimal soybean land suitability and conduct its mapping based on the multicriteria analysis. The multicriteria analysis was based on Geographic Information System (GIS) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) integration, using Sentinel-2 multitemporal images for suitability validation. The study area covered Osijek-Baranja County, a 4155 km(2) area located in eastern Croatia. Three criteria standardization methods (fuzzy, stepwise and linear) were evaluated for soybean land suitability calculation. The delineation of soybean land suitability classes was performed by k-means unsupervised classification. An independent accuracy assessment of calculated suitability values was performed by a novel approach with peak Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values, derived from four Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images. Fuzzy standardization with the combination of soil and climate criteria produced the most accurate suitability values, having the top coefficient of determination of 0.8438. A total of 14.5% of the study area (602 km(2)) was determined as the most suitable class for soybean cultivation based on k-means classification results, while 64.3% resulted in some degree of suitability.

TI  - Lossy Compression of Multispectral Satellite Images with Application to Crop Thematic Mapping: A HEVC Comparative Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing applications have gained in popularity in recent years, which has resulted in vast amounts of data being produced on a daily basis. Managing and delivering large sets of data becomes extremely difficult and resource demanding for the data vendors, but even more for individual users and third party stakeholders. Hence, research in the field of efficient remote sensing data handling and manipulation has become a very active research topic (from both storage and communication perspectives). Driven by the rapid growth in the volume of optical satellite measurements, in this work we explore the lossy compression technique for multispectral satellite images. We give a comprehensive analysis of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) still-image intra coding part applied to the multispectral image data. Thereafter, we analyze the impact of the distortions introduced by the HEVC's intra compression in the general case, as well as in the specific context of crop classification application. Results show that HEVC's intra coding achieves better trade-off between compression gain and image quality, as compared to standard JPEG 2000 solution. On the other hand, this also reflects in the better performance of the designed pixel-based classifier in the analyzed crop classification task. We show that HEVC can obtain up to 150:1 compression ratio, when observing compression in the context of specific application, without significantly losing on classification performance compared to classifier trained and applied on raw data. In comparison, in order to maintain the same performance, JPEG 2000 allows compression ratio up to 70:1.

TI  - Relationship of patient age to tumor factors and outcomes among patients undergoing sentinel node biopsy for melanoma
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Patient age has been intermittently associated with demographics and outcomes in cutaneous melanoma. We looked at the association of age and patient demographics, tumor features, and melanoma-related outcomes in patients undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for melanoma.Methods: We reviewed demographics (age, gender), tumor features (mean Breslow thickness, ulceration, SLN positivity rates), and outcomes (all-site relapse, progression to stage IV, death from melanoma, complications) from a university-based prospective database of 1633 patients. Patients were grouped by decade of age and the impact of age was examined by univariable and multivariable analyses.Results: Increasing age was directly associated with number of patients referred for SLN biopsy, male gender, head and neck (H&N) tumor location, mean Breslow thickness, tumor ulceration, and with all -site relapse, progression to stage IV, death from melanoma and complication rates. Increasing age was indirectly associated with SLN positivity rates. Comparing ages <30 with ages >60, these trends reached statistical significance for male gender, H&N location, SLN positivity, all-site relapse, progression to stage IV (development of metastases) and death from melanoma.Conclusions: Referrals for SLN biopsy increase with increasing patient age, yet increasing age is associated with lower SLN positivity rates. This occurs despite the fact that older patients have thicker, more ulcerated tumors, and higher melanoma-related relapse and death rates. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Mapping of Senescent Leaf C:N Ratio in the Sundarbans Reserved Forest Using Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) of senescent leaf is a crucial functional trait and indicator of litter quality that affects belowground carbon and nitrogen cycles, especially soil decomposition. Although mapping the C:N ratio of fresh mature canopies has been attempted, few studies have attempted to map the C:N ratio of senescent leaves, particularly in mangroves. In this study, four machine learning models (Stochastic Gradient Boosting, SGB; Random Forest, RF; Support Vector Machine, SVM; and Partial Least Square Regression, PLSR) were compared for testing the predictability of using the Landsat TM 5 (LTM5) and Landsat 8 to map spatial and temporal distribution of C:N ratio of senescent leaves in Sundarbans Reserved Forest (SRF), Bangladesh. Surface reflectance of bands, texture metrics of bands and vegetation indices of LTM5 and Landsat 8 yearly composite images were extracted using Google Earth Engine for 2009-2010 and 2019. We found SGB, RF and SVM were significant different from PLSR based on MAE, RMSE, and R-2 (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that remote sensing data, such as Landsat TM data, can be used to map the C:N ratio of senescent leaves in mangroves with reasonable accuracy. We also found that the mangroves had a high spatial variation of C:N ratio and the C:N ratio map developed in the current study can be used for improving the biogeochemical and ecosystem models in the mangroves.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Multi-Criteria Evaluation for Malaria Risk Mapping to Support Indoor Residual Spraying Prioritization in the Central Highlands of Madagascar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) in Madagascar classifies Malagasy districts into two malaria situations: districts in the pre-elimination phase and districts in the control phase. Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is identified as the main intervention means to control malaria in the Central Highlands. However, it involves an important logistical mobilization and thus necessitates prioritization of interventions according to the magnitude of malaria risks. Our objectives were to map the malaria transmission risk and to develop a tool to support the Malagasy Ministry of Public Health (MoH) for selective IRS implementation. For the 2014-2016 period, different sources of remotely sensed data were used to update land cover information and substitute in situ climatic data. Spatial modeling was performed based on multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) to assess malaria risk. Models were mainly based on environment and climate. Three annual malaria risk maps were obtained for 2014, 2015, and 2016. Annual parasite incidence data were used to validate the results. In 2016, the validation of the model using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed an accuracy of 0.736; 95% CI [0.669-0.803]. A free plugin for QGIS software was made available for NMCP decision makers to prioritize areas for IRS. An annual update of the model provides the basic information for decision making before each IRS campaign. In Madagascar and beyond, the availability of the free plugin for open-source software facilitates the transfer to the MoH and allows further application to other problems and contexts.

TI  - The 2018 Long Rainy Season in Kenya: Hydrological Changes and Correlated Land Subsidence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The wettest 2018 long rainy season (March to May (MAM)) resulted in daily intensive rainfall events in East Africa that have seriously affected the environment and economy in many countries. Land subsidence is one of the environmental disasters that has occurred due to the long rainy season in Kenya for many years. However, it has received limited scientific attention. In this paper, we incorporate hydrological (soil moisture active-passive (SMAP) and loading models) and geodetic data (global positioning system (GPS) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)) to study hydrological changes and their associated subsidence potential in Kenya. Results show that widespread subsidence of more than 20 mm was associated with the MAM season in Kenya during 2018, based on SBAS InSAR measurements. The high values of land subsidence were well correlated with the areas of intense flooding during the MAM season. The widespread subsidence during the wet season has implications for the stability of the earth's surface during the season rather than creating the possibility of potential stresses along active faults. These stresses may trigger seismicity that is expected to pose risks to urban features. The results of the current study can help governmental authorities to adopt proper urban planning that avoids or minimizes the risks of land subsidence in the areas of sinkholes.

TI  - A PolSAR Scattering Power Factorization Framework and Novel Roll-Invariant Parameter-Based Unsupervised Classification Scheme Using a Geodesic Distance
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a generic scattering power factorization framework (SPFF) for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data to directly obtain $N$ scattering power components along with a residue power component for each pixel. Each scattering power component is factorized into similarity (or dissimilarity) using elementary targets and a generalized volume model. The similarity measure is derived using a geodesic distance between pairs of $4\times 4$ real Kennaugh matrices. In standard model-based decomposition schemes, the $3\times 3$ Hermitian-positive semi-definite covariance (or coherency) matrix is expressed as a weighted linear combination of scattering targets following a fixed hierarchical process. In contrast, under the proposed framework, a convex splitting of unity is performed to obtain the weights while preserving the dominance of the scattering components. The product of the total power (Span) with these weights provides the nonnegative scattering power components. Furthermore, the framework, along with the geodesic distance ( ${GD}$ ) is effectively used to obtain specific roll-invariant parameters such as scattering-type parameter ( $\alpha _{GD}$ ), helicity parameter ( $\tau _{GD}$ ), and purity parameter ( $P_{GD}$ ). A $P_{GD}/\alpha _{GD}$ unsupervised classification scheme is also proposed for PolSAR images. The SPFF, the roll invariant parameters, and the classification results are assessed using C-band RADARSAT-2 and L-band ALOS-2 images of San Francisco.

TI  - Sand and dust storm sources identification: A remote sensing approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the sand and dust storm (SDS) events have become one of the most critical environmental challenges around the world. Identification of the sources not only helps to monitor and predict the processes of dust storms, but also it contributes to the reduction of its negative impacts and management of this phenomenon in a better manner. Identifying the sources based on field observation is impossible due to the vast extent of these lands, as well as the limitation of access to most of their areas, so remote sensing data can be used as a reliable alternative. The primary objective of this study is developing a comprehensive approach for sand and dust storm source identification and surveying their changing trend during a specific period via remotely sensed data. For this purpose, to generate wind erosion sensitivity maps based on the vegetation cover, soil moisture and land cover, Landsat8 data from 2013 to 2015 were acquired. After undergoing pre-processing on Landsat data with the help of spectral vegetation indexes and classification, wind erosion sensitivity maps were obtained for vegetation, soil moisture, and land use. To obtain a potential dust source map, the previously generated maps were integrated with geology and soil roughness information through multi-criteria evaluation to produce a wind erosion sensitivity map. Then, the synoptic data and air-quality information data were collected and using statistical analysis and MODIS data, local dust and sand events were identified, which were then validated based on HYSPLIT air flow simulation model to ensure that airflow trajectory and erodible lands are in physical contact. Based on the contact areas between airflow and the terrain besides applying non-erodible masks on them, the wind erosion risk was mapped. Next, the wind erosion risk map and the wind erosion sensitivity map via fuzzy multi-criteria assessment through linear weighted method were combined, then based on stratified-random sampling, probable SDS sources were identified. To validate the identified SDS sources and survey their trend, time series and synoptic data were utilized and vegetation cover, soil moisture and land surface temperature (LST) trend in specified areas for 15 years were monitored. Validation results showed high accuracy in identifying the areas; moreover, they confirmed the significant decrease in the vegetation cover, soil moisture and LST in the SDS sources during the study period (the last 15 years). Our results showed the high capability of time series analysis of remotely sensed data. LST as a climatic parameter has a crucial role to identify and validate the SDS sources. For instance, in areas with high SDS frequency, a significant decrease in LST is observable and confirmed by AOD analysis results. In this research, we integrated the most critical data that can be effective in identifying dust sources. To validate these sources, we used time series satellite data to measure the power of these data. Finally, we proposed the whole procedure as a complete process. Hence, the applied method in this research can be used as a comprehensive approach for future studies in SDS source identification by remotely sensed data.

TI  - Ubiquitous GIS-Based Forest Fire Susceptibility Mapping Using Artificial Intelligence Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to prepare forest fire susceptibility mapping (FFSM) using a ubiquitous GIS and an ensemble of adaptive neuro fuzzy interface system (ANFIS) with genetic (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms (ANFIS-GA-SA) and an ensemble of radial basis function (RBF) with an imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) (RBF-ICA) model in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, Iran. The forest fire areas were determined using MODIS satellite imagery and a field survey. The modeling and validation of the models were performed with 70% (183 locations) and 30% (79 locations) of forest fire locations (262 locations), respectively. In order to prepare the FFSM, 10 criteria were then used, namely altitude, rainfall, slope angle, temperature, slope aspect, wind effect, distance to roads, land use, distance to settlements and soil type. After the FFSM was prepared, the maps were designed and implemented for web GIS and mobile application. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC)- area under the curve (AUC) index was used to validate the prepared maps. The ROC-AUC results showed an accuracy of 0.903 for the ANFIS-GA-SA model and an accuracy of 0.878 for the RBF-ICA model. The results of the spatial autocorrelation showed that the occurrence of fire in the study area has a cluster distribution and most of the spatial dependence is related to the distance to settlement, soil and rainfall variables.

TI  - Landscape transformation processes in two large and two small cities in Egypt and Jordan over the last five decades using remote sensing data
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Research has tackled the physical expansion of urban growth and concomitant rural-urban transformation of land use in many parts of the world, but this phenomenon remained largely overlooked in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. To fill this knowledge gap, this study investigated land use changes from the 1970s to 2018 in the cities of Luxor and Cairo in Egypt, and of Aqaba and Amman in Jordan using different Landsat datasets. Land cover classifications were performed using the Maximum Likelihood Algorithm and Spectral Angle Mapper. In all four cities peri-urban green areas shrunk or shifted due to increased expansion of built-up areas. The largest reductions of pea-urban green areas were observed for Amman and Luxor, which decreased by 122.4 km(2) and 17.2 km(2), respectively, over the study period. For Cairo, an increase of peri-urban green area by 29 km(2) was detected, but its location shifted over the last five decades due to urban expansion. In 2018, green areas (urban and peri-urban) on a per-capita basis were 4.6, 12, 91, and 142 m(2)/capita for Aqaba, Cairo, Amman, and Luxor, respectively. Land cover changes reflected critical political events like the so-called "Arab Spring", international treaties, recent migration waves and population growth. Rapid increases in urban built-up area put pressure on scarce land and water resources in the peri-urban fringes, thereby potentially leading to environmental stress. Effective city planning is needed to address the multiple challenges and competing interests of urban and peri-urban environments.

TI  - A physically-based modelling framework for operational forecasting of river ice breakup
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting river ice breakup is critical for supporting emergency responses to river ice-related flooding along rivers in the northern hemisphere. However, due to complex river ice processes, forecasting river ice breakup is more challenging than predicting open-water flood conditions. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms and characteristics of breakup processes and in forecasting breakup timing using empirical methods at the local scale, fewer advances have been made in understanding and forecasting breakup using physically-based models, particularly at the catchment scale. In this study, we present a physically-based coupled hydrological and water temperature modelling framework for breakup prediction in cold region catchments in real time. The modelling framework was applied for operational forecasting of the 2019 breakup event along the Athabasca River at Fort McMurray in Alberta. Further model validation was performed by hindcasting the 2016, 2017 and 2018 breakup events. The model shows promising results for predicting the ice cover breakup with an average error of about 5 days, demonstrating its usefulness in real-time operational forecasting. Importantly, the model generates breakup progression at the catchment scale, providing an advantage over existing site specific breakup prediction methods.

TI  - Sensitivity analysis of an XCO<sub>2</sub> retrieval algorithm for high-resolution short-wave infrared spectra
T2  - OPTIK
M3  - Article
AB  - A sensitivity analysis, based on the Greenhouse-gases Monitoring Instrument (GMI) on Chinese Gaofen 5 satellite, is described considering four input parameters that affect the retrievals of the dry air column-averaged mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2). The analysis is based on synthetic spectra (centered around 0.765 and 1.575 mu m) produced by SCIATRAN. The input parameters considered include the profiles of temperature and pressure, as well as the surface albedo and aerosols. The main findings are temperature errors of 1 K and pressure errors of 2 hPa lead to XCO2 retrieval errors of less than 0.25%. The uncertainties in albedo (ranging from 0.03 to 1.0) or surface types lead to less than 2.0% retrieval error. Considering three aerosol types (urban, rural and maritime), we investigated the retrieval errors in XCO2 that were induced by incorrect assumptions on the aerosol optical thickness (AOT). For AOT values ranging from 0.02 to 1.0, the retrieval errors are less than 6.0% if aerosols are completely neglected in the retrieval. The presented results provide a basis for rational utilization of the a priori database and are conducive to increasing the inversion accuracy.

TI  - Effects of freshwater crayfish on influenza A virus persistence in water
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Several investigations have recently assessed the ability of some aquatic invertebrates to act as tools for avian influenza A virus (IAV) surveillance as well as their potential role(s) in IAV ecology. Because of this, as well as the high IAV seroprevalence rates noted in select mesocarnivores that commonly inhabit aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats, we evaluated the effects that freshwater crayfish have on IAV in water at three dose levels and monitored for the presence of IAV in crayfish tissues (gill and green gland) and haemolymph at multiple time points. At relatively high, medium and low (approximately 10(4), 10(3) and 10(2) EID50/ml, respectively) doses, mesocosms containing crayfish (Orconectes sp.) had less detectable IAV RNA present when final water samples were assayed (9 days post-contact [DPC]). In general, containers without crayfish present had nearly three-fold greater quantities of viral RNA at 9 DPC. A varying number of RNA positive samples were detected for the three crayfish sample types collected. Gill tissue produced the largest number of positive non-water samples (n = 26), with the highest quantities detected from crayfish sampled on 1 and 4 DPC (10(3.5) EID50 equivalent/ml). On a few occasions, gill (n = 8) and haemolymph samples (n = 1) produced higher quantities of viral RNA than their respective water samples or water samples collected 1-2 DPC earlier, but these differences were typically minor. Based upon water samples, statistical models indicated that the interaction of dose and crayfish exposure days explained most of the variation in these data. Future efforts should address if crayfish exposed to IAV-laden water have the capacity to successfully transmit IAVs to mammals and birds which frequently prey upon them.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Short-term peripheral venous catheter-related bloodstream infection (PVCR-BSI) rates have not been systematically studied in resource-limited countries, and data on their incidence by number of device days are not available. Methods: Prospective, surveillance study on PVCR-BSI conducted from September 1, 2013, to May 31, 2019, in 727 intensive care units (ICUs), by members of the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC), from 268 hospitals in 141 cities of 42 countries of Africa, the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. For this research, we applied definition and criteria of the CDC NHSN, methodology of the INICC, and software named INICC Surveillance Online System. Results: We followed 149,609 ICU patients for 731,135 bed days and 743,508 short-term peripheral venous catheter (PVC) days. We identified 1,789 PVCR-BSIs for an overall rate of 2.41 per 1,000 PVC days. Mortality in patients with PVC but without PVCR-BSI was 6.67%, and mortality was 18% in patients with PVC and PVCR-BSI. The length of stay of patients with PVC but without PVCR-BSI was 4.83 days, and the length of stay was 9.85 days in patients with PVC and PVCR-BSI. Among these infections, the microorganism profile showed 58% gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (16%), Klebsiella spp (11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), Enterobacter spp (4%), and others (20%) including Serratia marcescens. Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant gram-positive bacteria (12%). Conclusions: PVCR-BSI rates in INICC ICUs were much higher than rates published from industrialized countries. Infection prevention programs must be implemented to reduce the incidence of PVCR-BSIs in resource-limited countries.

TI  - Water runoff and economic activity: The impact of water supply shocks on growth
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper attempts to fill a gap in a growing literature examining the global economic implications of weather shocks. Past research has found significant, robust impacts of hotter temperatures on reducing economic growth. While rainfall is important for agriculture, impacts on aggregate economic activity remain elusive. In this paper, I argue that rainfall is a poor indicator of water availability, particularly in urban contexts. Instead, I find that changes in water runoff significantly impact economic growth. Results show that years in which runoff is significantly lower than average, local economic activity growth is depressed. This impact is strongest in middle-income regions, where runoff 1 or 2 standard deviation below normal levels reduces GDP growth by 0.4-0.6% and 1.3-2.5%. I examine two mechanisms, agricultural production and hydropower dependence. Globally, agricultural production is depressed by below average runoff shocks, although the resulting impact on GDP is likely low. Regions which are more urban and rely more on hydropower production in their energy mix are significantly more sensitive to these runoff shocks. With climate change expected to increase the variability of water runoff, these shocks are expected to become more frequent in the future and in some regions may significantly hamper growth.

TI  - Retrieving global surface soil moisture from GRACE satellite gravity data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive microwave radiometry from space through missions such as the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites is the most reliable means for mapping global surface soil moisture (SSM). Nonetheless, microwave SSM retrievals are uncertain over densely vegetated surfaces or areas with high radio frequency interference. This paper presents a new observationally driven approach to remote sensing of global SSM based on the terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) data acquired from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite. This approach rests on a physically based, yet parsimonious, model based on the Richards' equation and the assumption that the TWSA temporal rate of change (dS/dt) approximates the land surface net water flux (NWF) as the surface boundary condition. The GRACE-based SSM is found to be in a reasonable agreement with in-situ data and highly correlated with the SMAP and SMOS retrievals, especially over wet regions where the assumption of NWF approximate to dS/dt holds valid. The GRACE retrievals contain new SSM information relative to the microwave satellite data and provide a potential solution to improve the microwave data over densely vegetated surfaces or areas with high radio frequency interference.

TI  - Multispectral Models from Bare Soil Composites for Mapping Topsoil Properties over Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reflectance of light across the visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared (VIS-NIR-SWIR, 0.4-2.5 mu m) spectral region is very useful for investigating mineralogical, physical and chemical properties of soils, which can reduce the need for traditional wet chemistry analyses. As many collections of multispectral satellite data are available for environmental studies, a large extent with medium resolution mapping could be benefited from the spectral measurements made from remote sensors. In this paper, we explored the use of bare soil composites generated from the large historical collections of Landsat images for mapping cropland topsoil attributes across the European extent. For this task, we used the Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3) for generating two bare soil composites of 30 m resolution (named synthetic soil images, SYSI), which were employed to represent the median topsoil reflectance of bare fields. The first (framed SYSI) was made with multitemporal images (2006-2012) framed to the survey time of the Land-Use/Land-Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) soil dataset (2009), seeking to be more compatible to the soil condition upon the sampling campaign. The second (full SYSI) was generated from the full collection of Landsat images (1982-2018), which although displaced to the field survey, yields a higher proportion of bare areas for soil mapping. For evaluating the two SYSIs, we used the laboratory spectral data as a reference of topsoil reflectance to calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient. Furthermore, both SYSIs employed machine learning for calibrating prediction models of clay, sand, soil organic carbon (SOC), calcium carbonates (CaCO3), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and pH determined in water, using the gradient boosting regression algorithm. The original LUCAS laboratory spectra and a version of the data resampled to the Landsat multispectral bands were also used as reference of prediction performance using VIS-NIR-SWIR multispectral data. Our results suggest that generating a bare soil composite displaced to the survey time of soil observations did not improve the quality of topsoil reflectance, and consequently, the prediction performance of soil attributes. Despite the lower spectral resolution and the variability of soils in Europe, a SYSI calculated from the full collection of Landsat images can be employed for topsoil prediction of clay and CaCO3 contents with a moderate performance (testing R-2, root mean square error (RMSE) and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) of 0.44, 9.59, 1.77, and 0.36, 13.99, 1.54, respectively). Thus, this study shows that although there exist some constraints due to the spatial and temporal variation of soil exposures and among the Landsat sensors, it is possible to use bare soil composites for mapping key soil attributes of croplands across the European extent.

TI  - Airborne Lidar Sampling Pivotal for Accurate Regional AGB Predictions from Multispectral Images in Forest-Savanna Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise accounting of carbon stocks and fluxes in tropical vegetation using remote sensing approaches remains a challenging exercise, as both signal saturation and ground sampling limitations contribute to inaccurate extrapolations. Airborne LiDAR Scanning (ALS) data can be used as an intermediate level to radically increase sampling and enhance model calibration. Here we tested the potential of using ALS data for upscaling vegetation aboveground biomass (AGB) from field plots to a forest-savanna transitional landscape in the Guineo-Congolian region in Cameroon, using either a design-based approach or a model-based approach leveraging multispectral satellite imagery. Two sets of reference data were used: (1) AGB values collected from 62 0.16-ha plots distributed both in forests and savannas; and (2) an AGB map generated form ALS data. In the model-based approach, we trained Random Forest models using predictors from recent sensors of varying spectral and spatial resolutions (Spot 6/7, Landsat 8, and Sentinel 2), along with biophysical predictors derived after pre-processing into the Overland processing chain, following a forward variable selection procedure with a spatial 4-folds cross validation. The models calibrated with field plots lead to a systematic overestimation in AGB density estimates and a root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) of up to 65 Mg.ha(-1) (90%), whereas calibration with ALS lead to low bias and a drop of similar to 30% in RMSPE (down to 43 Mg.ha(-1), 58%) with little effect of the satellite sensor used. Decomposing bias along the AGB density range, we show that multispectral images can (in some specific cases) be used for unbiased prediction at landscape scale on the basis of ALS-calibrated statistical models. However, our results also confirm that, whatever the spectral indices used and attention paid to sensor quality and pre-processing, the signal is not sufficient to warrant accurate pixelwise predictions, because of large relative RMSPE, especially above (200-250 t/ha). The design-based approach, for which average AGB density values were attributed to mapped land cover classes, proved to be a simple and reliable alternative (for landscape to region level estimations), when trained with dense ALS samples.

TI  - Intertidal topography mapping using the waterline method from Sentinel-1 &-2 images: The examples of Arcachon and Veys Bays in France
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal flats lying as a buffer zone between land and sea provide critical services including protection against storm surges and coastal flooding. These environments are characterized by a continuous redistribution of sediment and changes in topography. Sea level rise, anthropogenic pressures, and their related stressors have a considerable impact on these areas and are expected to put them under more stress; hence the increased need for frequent and updated topography maps. Comparing to traditional surveying approaches, spaceborne remote sensing is able to provide topography maps more frequently with a lower cost and a higher coverage. The latter is currently considered as an established tool for measuring intertidal topography. In this study, an improved approach of the waterline method was developed to derive intertidal Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). The changes include a faster, more efficient and quasi-automatic detection and post-processing of waterlines. The edge detection technique consists in combining a k-means based segmentation and an active contouring procedure. This method was designed to generate closed contours in order to enable an automatization of the postprocessing of the extracted waterlines. The waterlines were extracted from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images for two bays located on the French Coast: the Arcachon lagoon and the Bay of Veys. DEMs were generated for the Arcachon Bay between 2015 and 2018, and for the Bay of Veys between 2016 and 2018 using satellite acquisitions made during summer (low storm activity period). The comparison of the generated DEMs with lidar observations showed an error of about 19-25 cm. This study also demonstrated that the waterline method applied to Sentinel images is suitable for monitoring the morpho-sedimentary evolution in intertidal areas. By comparing the DEMs generated between 2016 and 2018, the Arcachon Bay and the Bay of Veys experienced net volume losses of 1.12 x 10(6) m(3) and 0.70 x 10(6) m(3) respectively. The generated DEMs provide useful and needed information for several scientific applications (e.g., sediment balance, hydrodynamic modelling), but also for authorities and stakeholders for coastal management and implementation of ecosystem protection policies.

TI  - Satellite-derived sea surface temperature fronts in a river-influenced coastal upwelling area off central-southern Chile
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The variability of thermal fronts in eastern ocean boundaries has received increased attention because of being active regions of vertical fluxes of tracers and biological activity. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) images from three distinct satellite products are used to identify areas with enhanced surface thermal gradients (i.e. SST fronts) in the coastal ocean off central-southern Chile. The main objective is to evaluate their use in the study of SST frontal variability in a river-influenced continental shelf. In contrast with previous studies focused on the mesoscale structure of the upwelling front, this study highlights the importance of using high spatial resolution (i.e. 1 km) satellite products to resolve the small-scale surface thermal gradients on a relatively narrow continental shelf impacted by freshwater river outflows. An improved approach, merging Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery from Aqua and Terra satellites (MODIS-AT), increases the percentage of available SST data for the computation of SST gradients and frontal probability over these shelf waters. Overall, SST data from all three sources (Pathfinder, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), and MODIS) resolve the major mesoscale frontal features along the offshore limit of the continental shelf. However, MODIS-AT considerably improves the detection of SST fronts over the continental shelf, especially during winter and spring when river outflows are important on the dynamics of coastal flows. A case study off the Itata River mouth reveals high spatio-temporal variability of thermal fronts over the continental shelf, which is not well detected from GOES and Pathfinder data. The analysis of MODIS-AT images is highly recommended for studies of thermal fronts over shelf waters. In contrast, the use of GOES imagery improves the monitoring of the mesoscale frontal activity farther offshore. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The West African Sahel Cropland map (WASC30) is a new 30-m cropland extent product for the nominal year of 2015. We used the computing resources provided by Google Earth Engine (GEE) to fit and apply Random Forest models for cropland detection in each of 189 grid cells (composed of 100 km(2), hence a total of similar to 1.9 x 10(6) km(2)) across five countries of the West African Sahel (Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Senegal). Landsat-8 surface reflectance (Bands 2-7) and vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, SAVI, and MSAVI), organized to include dry-season and growing-season band reflectances and vegetation indices for the years 2013-2015, were used as predictors. Training data were derived from an independent, high-resolution, visually interpreted sample dataset that classifies sample points across West Africa using a 2-km grid (similar to 380,000 points were used in this study, with 50% used for model training and 50% used for model validation). Analysis of the new cropland dataset indicates a summed cropland area of similar to 316 x 10(3) km(2) across the 5 countries, primarily in rainfed cropland (309 x 10(3) km(2)), with irrigated cropland area (7 x 10(3) km(2)) representing 2% of the total cropland area. At regional scale, the cropland dataset has an overall accuracy of 90.1% and a cropland class (rainfed and irrigated) user's accuracy of 79%. At bioclimatic zones scale, results show that land proportion occupied by rainfed agriculture increases with annual precipitation up to 1000 mm. The Sudanian zone (600-1200 mm) has the highest proportion of land in agriculture (24%), followed by the Sahelian (200-600 mm) and the Guinean (1200 +) zones for 15% and 4%, respectively. The new West African Sahel dataset is made freely available for applications requiring improved cropland area information for agricultural monitoring and food security applications.

TI  - Monitoring 10-m LST from the Combination MODIS/Sentinel-2, Validation in a High Contrast Semi-Arid Agroecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Downscaling techniques offer a solution to the lack of high-resolution satellite Thermal InfraRed (TIR) data and can bridge the gap until operational TIR missions accomplishing spatio-temporal requirements are available. These techniques are generally based on the Visible Near InfraRed (VNIR)-TIR variable relations at a coarse spatial resolution, and the assumption that the relationship between spectral bands is independent of the spatial resolution. In this work, we adopted a previous downscaling method and introduced some adjustments to the original formulation to improve the model performance. Maps of Land Surface Temperature (LST) with 10-m spatial resolution were obtained as output from the combination of MODIS/Sentinel-2 images. An experiment was conducted in an agricultural area located in the Barrax test site, Spain (39 degrees 03 ' 35 '' N, 2 degrees 06 ' W), for the summer of 2018. Ground measurements of LST transects collocated with the MODIS overpasses were used for a robust local validation of the downscaling approach. Data from 6 different dates were available, covering a variety of croplands and surface conditions, with LST values ranging 300-325 K. Differences within +/- 4.0 K were observed between measured and modeled temperatures, with an average estimation error of +/- 2.2 K and a systematic deviation of 0.2 K for the full ground dataset. A further cross-validation of the disaggregated 10-m LST products was conducted using an additional set of Landsat-7/ETM+ images. A similar uncertainty of +/- 2.0 K was obtained as an average. These results are encouraging for the adaptation of this methodology to the tandem Sentinel-3/Sentinel-2, and are promising since the 10-m pixel size, together with the 3-5 days revisit frequency of Sentinel-2 satellites can fulfill the LST input requirements of the surface energy balance methods for a variety of hydrological, climatological or agricultural applications. However, certain limitations to capture the variability of extreme LST, or in recently sprinkler irrigated fields, claim the necessity to explore the implementation of soil moisture or vegetation indices sensitive to soil water content as inputs in the downscaling approach. The ground LST dataset introduced in this paper will be of great value for further refinements and assessments.

TI  - A SPECTRAL AGROMETEOROLOGICAL MODEL FOR ESTIMATING SOYBEAN GRAIN PRODUCTIVITY IN MATO GROSSO, BRAZIL
T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used spectral data integrated with the agrometeorological model by Doorenbos and Kassam to estimate soybean grain productivity in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. In the developed model, spectral data were used instead of meteorological data and biophysical parameters of the crop. For this purpose, the products of real and potential evapotranspiration (MOD16), normalized difference vegetation index - NDVI (MOD13Q1), and leaf area index (MOD15A2H) from the MODIS satellite were used, in addition to sunstroke data obtained by using the visible channel from the satellite GOES IMAGER. The results obtained showed that, with the proposed methodology, it was possible to follow the development of soybean cultivation throughout the cycle and to estimate production and productivity in the study area. Willmott's agreement index was 0.99 and 0.96 and Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.99 and 0.84 for production and productivity, respectively.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 40th Joint Annual Scientific Meeting of the American-Urogynecologic-Society (AUGS) and the International-Urogynecological-Association (IUGA)
CL  - Nashville, TN
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare temporal trends of urogynecologic mesh medical device reports with sentinel U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notices and to examine all linked reports of patient death. METHODS: The Reed Tech Navigator is an online tool used to extract and analyze data in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. We used FDA product codes to search for reports of synthetic mesh for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Reports with "death" listed as a patient event were queried further. RESULTS: There were 43,970 medical device reports involving urogynecologic mesh reported to the FDA between August 2000 and January 2019, with most occurring after the 2011 FDA communication (n=43,018, 97.8%). Of these medical device reports, 64.6% (n=28,422) were for SUI products, 27.0% (n=11,876) were for transvaginal POP products, and 8.4% (n=3,672) were for transabdominal POP products. Peak reporting occurred in 2013, which corresponded with the first major plaintiff verdicts and class action vaginal mesh settlement. There were 645 (1.5%) medical device reports of death, with 49.3% (n=318) having no cause of death identified. Only four (0.6%) could be directly attributed to the initial surgery. CONCLUSION: Since 2011, urogynecologic mesh has been the focus of thousands of medical device reports annually, although the data submitted are often incomplete. Few reported deaths are directly attributable to mesh products, and the majority lack sufficient information to draw causal conclusions. A high-quality registry is necessary to improve our understanding of the patient effect from urogynecologic mesh products.

TI  - Spectral harmonization and red edge prediction of Landsat-8 to Sentinel-2 using land cover optimized multivariate regressors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-sensor remote sensing applications consistently gain importance, boosted by a growing number of freely available earth observation data, increasing computing capacity, and increasingly complex algorithms that need as temporally dense data as possible. Using data provided by different sensors can greatly improve the temporal resolution of time series, fill data gaps and thus improve the quality of land cover monitoring applications. However, multi-sensor approaches are often adversely affected by different spectral characteristics of the sensing instruments, leading to inconsistencies in downstream products. Spectral harmonization, i.e., the transformation of one sensor into the spectral domain of another sensor, may reduce these inconsistencies. It simplifies workflows, increases the reliability of subsequently derived multi-sensor products and may also enable the generation of new products that are not possible with the initial spectral definition. In this paper, we compare the effect of multivariate spectral harmonization techniques on the inter-sensor reflectance consistency and derived products such as spectral indices or land cover classifications. We simulated surface reflectance data of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A from airborne hyperspectral data to eliminate any sources of error originating from unequal acquisition geometries, illumination or atmospheric state. We evaluate different methods based on linear, quadratic and random forest regression as well as linear interpolation, and predict not only matching but also unilaterally missing bands (red edge). We additionally consider material-dependent spectral characteristics in the harmonization process by using separate transformation functions for spectral clusters of the input dataset. Our results suggest that spectral harmonization is useful to improve multi-sensor consistency of remote sensing data and subsequently derived products, especially if multiple transformation functions are incorporated. There is a strong dependency between harmonization performance and the similarity of source and target sensor's spectral characteristics. For spectrally transforming Landsat-8 to Sentinel-2A, we achieved the lowest radiometric inter-sensor deviations with 50 spectral clusters and linear regression. Based on simulated data, deviations are below 1.7% reflectance within the red edge spectral region and below 0.3% reflectance for the remaining bands (RMSE). Regarding spectral indices, our results show a reduction of inter-sensor deviation (vegetation pixels only) to 38% of the initial error for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and to 43% for EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index). Furthermore, we computed the REIP (Red Edge Inflection Point) with an accuracy of 3.1 nm from Sentinel-2 adapted Landsat-8 data. An exemplary multispectral classification use case revealed an increasing inter-sensor consistency of classification results from 92.3% to 97.3% mean error. Applied to time series of real Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data, we observed similar trends, albeit intermingled with non-sensor-induced inconsistencies.

AB  - In 2016, the proportion of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates with reduced susceptibility to azithromycin rose to 3.6%. A phylogenetic analysis of 334 N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected in 2016 revealed a single, geographically diverse lineage of isolates with MICs of 2 to 16 mu g/ml that carried a mosaic-like mtr locus, whereas the majority of isolates with MICs of >= 16 mu g/ml appeared sporadically and carried 23S rRNA mutations. Continued molecular surveillance of N. gonorrhoeae isolates will identify new resistance mechanisms.

TI  - Integrating National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Airborne Remote Sensing and In-Situ Data for Optimal Tree Species Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping tree species composition and diversity is a critical step towards spatially explicit and species-specific ecological understanding. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a valuable source of open ecological data across the United States. Freely available NEON data include in-situ measurements of individual trees, including stem locations, species, and crown diameter, along with the NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) airborne remote sensing imagery, including hyperspectral, multispectral, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data products. An important aspect of predicting species using remote sensing data is creating high-quality training sets for optimal classification purposes. Ultimately, manually creating training data is an expensive and time-consuming task that relies on human analyst decisions and may require external data sets or information. We combine in-situ and airborne remote sensing NEON data to evaluate the impact of automated training set preparation and a novel data preprocessing workflow on classifying the four dominant subalpine coniferous tree species at the Niwot Ridge Mountain Research Station forested NEON site in Colorado, USA. We trained pixel-based Random Forest (RF) machine learning models using a series of training data sets along with remote sensing raster data as descriptive features. The highest classification accuracies, 69% and 60% based on internal RF error assessment and an independent validation set, respectively, were obtained using circular tree crown polygons created with half the maximum crown diameter per tree. LiDAR-derived data products were the most important features for species classification, followed by vegetation indices. This work contributes to the open development of well-labeled training data sets for forest composition mapping using openly available NEON data without requiring external data collection, manual delineation steps, or site-specific parameters.

TI  - Remote sensing for monitoring and mapping Land Productivity in Italy: A rapid assessment methodology
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a remote sensing-based methodology for the Land Productivity (LP) rapid assessment and monitoring of status and trends at national and sub-national scales. This methodology aims at supporting national and international policies to achieve the Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) target in the framework of the UN Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 15.3). The work was performed using the NASA-MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as proxy indicator of LP status and trends in Italy for 16 years (2000-2015). The assessment of the LP status was based on the pixel mean and standard deviation values of yearly LP values. The LP trends of the yearly time series were computed using Mann-Kendall (MK) and Contextual MK (CMK) tests providing a monitoring indicator for land productivity change. The amount of land with valid increasing and decreasing trends is estimated assuming the 95% significance level of trends in the areas with "good" NDVI pixel reliability. The area of increasing and decreasing LP are estimated for the national territory and for different land covers. The widespread observed increasing LP variations were correlated to the progressive renaturalization of lands subsequent to the decrease of agricultural activities and increasing precipitation trends in the winter season. Decreasing LP affected very limited areas and hot spots were correlated to changes of seasonal precipitation and anthropic activities. The areas and municipalities most affected by LP changes are identified and may support, in the framework of SDG 15.3 and LDN, the identification of policy initiatives.

TI  - Remote Sensing for Precision Agriculture: Sentinel-2 Improved Features and Applications
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - The use of satellites to monitor crops and support their management is gathering increasing attention. The improved temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution of the European Space Agency (ESA) launched Sentinel-2 A + B twin platform is paving the way to their popularization in precision agriculture. Besides the Sentinel-2 A + B constellation technical features the open-access nature of the information they generate, and the available support software are a significant improvement for agricultural monitoring. This paper was motivated by the challenges faced by researchers and agrarian institutions entering this field; it aims to frame remote sensing principles and Sentinel-2 applications in agriculture. Thus, we reviewed the features and uses of Sentinel-2 in precision agriculture, including abiotic and biotic stress detection, and agricultural management. We also compared the panoply of satellites currently in use for land remote sensing that are relevant for agriculture to the Sentinel-2 A + B constellation features. Contrasted with previous satellite image systems, the Sentinel-2 A + B twin platform has dramatically increased the capabilities for agricultural monitoring and crop management worldwide. Regarding crop stress monitoring, Sentinel-2 capacities for abiotic and biotic stresses detection represent a great step forward in many ways though not without its limitations; therefore, combinations of field data and different remote sensing techniques may still be needed. We conclude that Sentinel-2 has a wide range of useful applications in agriculture, yet still with room for further improvements. Current and future ways that Sentinel-2 can be utilized are also discussed.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent trends, the spectro-radiometer technique has proved its significance in the development of spectral library of earth's surface materials to support the hyperspectral image interpretation and analysis. To enhance the efficiency of hyperspectral image classification, acquisition of spectral signature must be carried out. A practical study was carried out on Muthupet mangrove forest, Tamil Nadu, India. According to remote sensing data, the selected study shows as contiguous lagoon, and Avicennia marina (95 % occupancy) is the majority community of the study area followed by Acanthus ilicifolius, and Aegiceras corniculatum. It is the first attempt to develop the spectral library for mangrove true species, and mangrove associates for the Muthupet lagoon, Tamil Nadu, India. With detailed field visits, by using the analytic spectral device (ASD), the spectral library built for prominent 6 true mangrove species such as Acanthus ilicifolius, Aegiceras corniculatum, Avicennia marina, Excoecaria agallocha, Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata) in connection to that 5 mangrove associates Salicornia brachiata, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Suaeda martima, Suaeda monoica, and Azims tetracantha. The reflectance and absorption of each species was observed, and built a spectral library of mangroves species. It is found that Acanthus ilicifolius provides high reflectance than others. This spectral library can be useful for mangroves species identification using hyperspectral data.

TI  - Assessing Soil Erosion Hazards Using Land-Use Change and Landslide Frequency Ratio Method: A Case Study of Sabaragamuwa Province, Sri Lanka
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to identify the vulnerable landscape areas using landslide frequency ratio and land-use change associated soil erosion hazard by employing geo-informatics techniques and the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model. Required datasets were collected from multiple sources, such as multi-temporal Landsat images, soil data, rainfall data, land-use land-cover (LULC) maps, topographic maps, and details of the past landslide incidents. Landsat satellite images from 2000, 2010, and 2019 were used to assess the land-use change. Geospatial input data on rainfall, soil type, terrain characteristics, and land cover were employed for soil erosion hazard classification and mapping. Landscape vulnerability was examined on the basis of land-use change, erosion hazard class, and landslide frequency ratio. Then the erodible hazard areas were identified and prioritized at the scale of river distribution zones. The image analysis of Sabaragamuwa Province in Sri Lanka from 2000 to 2019 indicates a significant increase in cropping areas (17.96%) and urban areas (3.07%), whereas less dense forest and dense forest coverage are significantly reduced (14.18% and 6.46%, respectively). The average annual soil erosion rate increased from 14.56 to 15.53 t/ha/year from year 2000 to 2019. The highest landslide frequency ratios are found in the less dense forest area and cropping area, and were identified as more prone to future landslides. The river distribution zones Athtanagalu Oya (A-2), Kalani River-south (A-3), and Kalani River- north (A-9), were identified as immediate priority areas for soil conservation.

TI  - Seroprevalence and incidence of <i>Leptospira</i> spp. in domestic dogs in the Southeast region of Sao Paulo State, Brazil
T2  - PESQUISA VETERINARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Leptospira and domestic dogs can act as host of some serovars. In order to analyze the transmission dynamics in a dog population, with and without immunization, a longitudinal study was carried out with a focus to evaluate antibody response and to identify serovars. Blood samples were collected in three consecutive years (2015 to 2017) from 331, 373 and 347 dogs respectively. The dog seroprevalence in each year was 11%, 7% and 14%, respectively, and the incidence in 2016 was 5% and in 2017, 14%. The most frequent serovars were Cynopteri and Butembo in 2015, Cynopteri, Butembo and Hardjoprajitno in 2016, and Canicola and Butembo in 2017. Dogs can play a role as sentinel animals and hosts of Leptospira serovars. The percentage of seropositive dogs due to vaccination was higher than the previous years without immunization and lower than in previous years for other serovars, which we interpret as evidence for the importance of immunization. These parameters associated with active canine population control are important for prevention and control of leptospirosis not only in dogs but alsoto inhibit the transmission between dogs and humans.

TI  - Sentinel surveillance of selected veterinary and public health pathogens in camel population originating from Southern Punjab province, Pakistan
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - An extended range of host susceptibility including camel has been evidenced for some of the important veterinary and public health pathogens, such as brucellosis, peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and bluetongue (BT). However, in disease endemic settings across many parts of the globe, most of the disease control interventions accounts for small and large ruminants, whereas unusual hosts and/or natural reservoirs, such as camels, remain neglected for disease control measures including routine vaccination. Such a policy drawback not only plays an important role in disease epizootiology particularly in settings where disease is endemic, but also serves an obstacle in disease control and subsequent eradication in future. With this background, using pre-validated ELISA and molecular assays [multiplex PCR, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and real-time (rt)-PCR], we conducted a large-scale pathogen- and antibody-based surveillance for brucellosis, peste des petits ruminants and bluetongue in camel population (n = 992) originating from a wide geographical region in southern part of the Punjab province, Pakistan. Varying in each of the selected districts, the seroprevalence was found to be maximum for bluetongue [n=697 (70.26%, 95% CI: 67.29-73.07)], followed by PPR [n = 193 (19.46%, 95% CI: 17.07-22.09)] and brucellosis [n = 66 (6.65%, 95% CI: 5.22-8.43)]. Odds of seroprevalence were more significantly associated with pregnancy status (non-pregnant, OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.86-5.63, p<0.01), farming system (mixed-animal, OR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.56-4.29, p<0.01), breed (Desi, OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.28-4.03, p<0.01) and farmer education (illiterate, OR= 3.17, 95% CI: 1.45-6.93, p<0.01) for BTV, body condition (normal, OR = 3.54, 95% CI: 1.92-6.54, p<0.01) and breed (Desi, OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.09-4.40, p<0.01) for brucellosis, and feeding system for PPR (grazing, OR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.79-4.22, p<0.01). Among the total herds included (n = 74), genome corresponding to BT virus (BTV) and brucellosis was detected in 14 (18.92%, 95 CI: 11.09-30.04) and 19 herds (25.68%, 95% CI: 16.54-37.38), respectively. None of the herds was detected with genome of PPR virus (PPRV). Among the positive herds, serotype 1, 8 and 11 were detected for BTV while all the herds were exclusively positive to B. abortus. Taken together, the study highlights the role of potential disease reservoirs in the persistence and transmission of selected diseases in their susceptible hosts and, therefore, urges necessary interventions (e.g., inclusion of camels for vaccine etc.) for the control of diseases from their endemic setting worldwide.

AB  - Background: The risk of periprocedural stroke after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) ranges from 3% to 8%. Although cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPD) are widely utilized in transcatheter aortic valve replacement, there are currently no Food and Drug Administration approved CEPDs for use in TEVAR. We report our initial experience with the off-label use of a dual-filter CEPD in patients undergoing TEVAR.Methods: Two patients at high risk for embolic stroke underwent TEVAR for descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (DTAAs) at a single institution. A dual-filter CEPD (Sentinel; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) was used in an off-label fashion in both cases. Patient 1 was a 62-year-old woman with a 6.2-cm DTAA, extending from the left subclavian artery (LSCA) to the diaphragm (Zones 3-5) and associated with extensive atherosclerotic disease of the aortic arch. Patient 2 was a 78-year-old woman with a 6.3-cm DTAA, extending from the LSCA (Zone 2) to the sixth intercostal space (Zone 4) with associated mural thrombus. Given the proximity of the aneurysm to the LSCA, a left carotid-subclavian bypass was performed for planned LSCA coverage.Results: Through a percutaneous right radial artery approach using a 6F sheath, the Sentinel dual-filter CEPD was delivered over a 0.014 '' guidewire into the thoracic aorta. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the 2 filters were sequentially deployed in the innominate and left common carotid arteries, respectively. Appropriately sized devices were successfully delivered and deployed in the proximal and distal landing zones, respectively. Two devices were used for each patient. Completion angiograms showed successful exclusion of the DTAAs in both cases, without evidence of endoleak. The CEPD filters were retrieved in standard fashion without difficulty. Pathology demonstrated successful capture of embolic debris and fibrin clot in both patients. Neither patient exhibited neurological deficits or device-related complications. Both patients remained neurologically intact at 1- and 2-month follow-up, respectively. Surveillance angiograms revealed successful exclusion of the aneurysm without any evidence of endoleak.Conclusions: We report the novel off-label use of a dual-filter CEPD in 2 patients undergoing TEVAR. Pathological confirmation of embolic debris in the filters makes this a potential tool for stroke prevention during TEVAR in high-risk patients.

TI  - Detection of Crop Seeding and Harvest through Analysis of Time-Series Sentinel-1 Interferometric SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is more sensitive to the dielectric properties and structure of the targets and less affected by weather conditions than optical sensors, making it more capable of detecting changes induced by management practices in agricultural fields. In this study, the capability of C-band SAR data for detecting crop seeding and harvest events was explored. The study was conducted for the 2019 growing season in Temiskaming Shores, an agricultural area in Northern Ontario, Canada. Time-series SAR data acquired by Sentinel-1 constellation with the interferometric wide (IW) mode with dual polarizations in VV (vertical transmit and vertical receive) and VH (vertical transmit and horizontal receive) were obtained. interferometric SAR (InSAR) processing was conducted to derive coherence between each pair of SAR images acquired consecutively in time throughout the year. Crop seeding and harvest dates were determined by analyzing the time-series InSAR coherence and SAR backscattering. Variation of SAR backscattering coefficients, particularly the VH polarization, revealed seasonal crop growth patterns. The change in InSAR coherence can be linked to change of surface structure induced by seeding or harvest operations. Using a set of physically based rules, a simple algorithm was developed to determine crop seeding and harvest dates, with an accuracy of 85% (n = 67) for seeding-date identification and 56% (n = 77) for harvest-date identification. The extra challenge in harvest detection could be attributed to the impacts of weather conditions, such as rain and its effects on soil moisture and crop dielectric properties during the harvest season. Other factors such as post-harvest residue removal and field ploughing could also complicate the identification of harvest event. Overall, given its mechanism to acquire images with InSAR capability at 12-day revisiting cycle with a single satellite for most part of the Earth, the Sentinel-1 constellation provides a great data source for detecting crop field management activities through coherent or incoherent change detection techniques. It is anticipated that this method could perform even better at a shorter six-day revisiting cycle with both satellites for Sentinel-1. With the successful launch (2019) of the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) with its tri-satellite system and four polarizations, we are likely to see improved system reliability and monitoring efficiency.

T2  - Harefuah
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Klausenberg Rebbe (Rabbi Yekutiel Yehudah Halberstam, of righteous memory) from the Sanz Chassidic dynasty, founded Sanz Medical Center - Laniado Hospital in 1976. He had lost his wife and eleven children in the Holocaust. The rabbi had a vision and initially received permission to open a maternity hospital to serve his community. Sanz Medical Center - Laniado Hospital is named after two brothers, Alphonse and Ya'akov Avraham Laniado, who were from the city of Haleb (Aleppo), Syria. They immigrated to Switzerland, where they managed a family bank. In their will, they specified that their estate be used to found a hospital named "Laniado" in Eretz Israel. The brothers provided the preliminary funds to found the hospital, while the remaining funds were collected by the Klausenberg Rebbe of the Sanz dynasty. In addition, a friends association has been established in Israel and around the world, headed by the "International Board of Trustees", which is responsible for the continued flow of funds to the various needs of the hospital. The hospital is a public non-profit institution under the supervision of an international board of trustees. The hospital is founded on Jewish law in every detail. Sanz Medical Center - Laniado Hospital never goes on strike, and treats every individual regardless of religion, race, or nationality. The medical center uses the most modern methods: its instruments, equipment, and expert staff have given the Sanz Medical Center its reputation as one of the leading hospitals in Israel. The Admor (the late Klausenberger Rebbe) expressed his vision for creating a hospital in his founding statement: "To strive as far as possible to ease the pain and suffering of the patients and to improve their emotional and spiritual state." Sanz Medical Center - Laniado Hospital has adopted as its motto the Admor's worldview: "The hospital will aid every person. In this hospital, the staff will work as professionals without forgetting the most important aspects of compassion, warmth, and empathy for the patient."

TI  - Neonatal Compartment Syndrome and Compound Presentation at Birth.
T2  - Journal of hand surgery global online
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Neonatal compartment syndrome is a rare condition. Early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention are paramount to optimize outcome. Time to fasciotomy is the most important prognostic factor. The purposes of this study were to describe a case presentation of neonatal compartment syndrome associated with a compound birth presentation and to perform a literature review. In this case, the neonate's fingers were noted to be present on maternal cervical examination 24 hours before delivery. The patient then was noted to have a sentinel skin lesion. A diagnosis of neonatal compartment syndrome was suspected, and she underwent urgent fasciotomy. Literature review identified a total of 60 patients from 26 studies. Most patients were managed operatively. All patients presented with a sentinel skin lesion, emphasizing the importance of this clinical sign in diagnosis. Manometry is not routinely performed and no standards are available for acceptable pressure gradients.

TI  - A multiscale analysis of the effect of urban expansion on PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in China: Evidence from multisource remote sensing and statistical data
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely and effective evaluation of the effect of urban expansion on PM2.5 concentrations is highly important for an understanding of urban-environment sustainability in China. However, studies examining the effect of urban expansion on PM2.5 concentrations at multiple administrative scales from different perspectives are still lacking. In this study, multisource remote sensing data were used to define urban spatial expansion and urban socioeconomic expansion, respectively. The effect of urban expansion on PM2.5 concentrations was then evaluated and compared at the regional, urban agglomeration, and metropolitan scales. The results showed that China's economic urban expansion lagged far behind urban spatial expansion from 2000 to 2015. There is a bidirectional long-term Granger causal relationship between urban expansion and PM2.5 concentrations across different scales. A short-term Granger causality test proved that urban expansion is still at the stage of aggravating PM2.5 concentrations. Variance decomposition analysis results indicated that the contribution of urban socioeconomic expansion in explaining PM2.5 concentrations was higher than urban spatial expansion with the increase in scales. The aggregation effect has become an important means for urban socioeconomic expansion to affect PM2.5 concentrations. In addition, PM2.5 concentrations can be reduced by the technical progress effect of urban spatial expansion across different scales. The Chinese government should consider the impact of different urban expansion modes on PM 25 concentrations. Moreover, the technical progress effect will play an important role in decoupling urban spatial expansion and PM2.5 concentrations in China.

TI  - Change Detection Based on Artificial Intelligence: State-of-the-Art and Challenges
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Change detection based on remote sensing (RS) data is an important method of detecting changes on the Earth's surface and has a wide range of applications in urban planning, environmental monitoring, agriculture investigation, disaster assessment, and map revision. In recent years, integrated artificial intelligence (AI) technology has become a research focus in developing new change detection methods. Although some researchers claim that AI-based change detection approaches outperform traditional change detection approaches, it is not immediately obvious how and to what extent AI can improve the performance of change detection. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art methods, applications, and challenges of AI for change detection. Specifically, the implementation process of AI-based change detection is first introduced. Then, the data from different sensors used for change detection, including optical RS data, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, street view images, and combined heterogeneous data, are presented, and the available open datasets are also listed. The general frameworks of AI-based change detection methods are reviewed and analyzed systematically, and the unsupervised schemes used in AI-based change detection are further analyzed. Subsequently, the commonly used networks in AI for change detection are described. From a practical point of view, the application domains of AI-based change detection methods are classified based on their applicability. Finally, the major challenges and prospects of AI for change detection are discussed and delineated, including (a) heterogeneous big data processing, (b) unsupervised AI, and (c) the reliability of AI. This review will be beneficial for researchers in understanding this field.

T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important parameter for investigating the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to global change. It is of great significance to analyze the variation of WUE and its response to meteorological factors for research of carbon water cycling and regional scientific management of water resources. Based on MODIS GPP and ET remote sensing data, meteorological data and land cover data in 2000 and 2014, we analyzed the spatial-temporal change of vegetation WUE and the relationship between vegetation WUE and key meteorological factors in Sanjiang Plain. We further examined the change characteristics of WUE foreach vegetation type in terms of land cover change. Annual mean variation of WUE in Sanjiang Plain showed a fluctuated decreasing trend. The mean annual vegetation WUE was 1.44 g C . kg(-1) H2O. Monthly variation of WUE roughly showed a mono-peak curve. While WUE was lower from January to March and from November to December, it was higher in growing season (May to September). The seasonal WUE was highest in summer, followed by autumn, spring and winter. The intra-annual change of WUE for each vegetation type showed a double peak curve, with the peak being mainly distributed in April - June and September. The averaged WUE values of different vegetation types ranked as mixed forest >coniferous forest >broadleaf forest >grassland >Cultivated land>permanent wetland. Vegetation WUE in Sanjiang Plain was positively correlated with pre-cipitation, relative humidity and vapor pressure, but negatively correlated with temperature and sunshine hours. With the reduction of cultivated land area, the WUE of cultivated land increased by 11.1%. With the increased area of deciduous broadleaved forest and grassland, vegetation WUE increased by 12.8% and 15.9%, respectively.

TI  - High-Resolution Fengyun-4 Satellite Measurements of Dynamical Tropopause Structure and Variability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamical tropopause is the interface between the stratosphere and the troposphere, whose variation gives indication of weather and climate changes. In the past, the dynamical tropopause height determination mainly depends on analysis and diagnose methods. While, due to the high computational cost, it is difficult to obtain tropopause structures with high spatiotemporal resolution in real time by these methods. To solve this problem, the statistical method is used to establish the dynamical tropopause pressure retrieval model based on Fengyun-4A geostationary meteorological satellite observations. Four regression schemes including random forest (RF) regression are evaluated. By comparison with GEOS-5 (the Goddard Earth Observing System Model of version 5) and ERA-Interim (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis-Interim) reanalysis, it is found that among the four schemes, the RF-based retrieval model is most accurate and reliable (RMSEs (root mean square errors) are 25.99 hPa and 43.05 hPa, respectively, as compared to GEOS-5 and ERA-Interim reanalysis). A series of sensitivity experiments are performed to investigate the contributions of the predictors in the RF-based model. Results suggest that 6.25 mu m channel information representing the distributions of the potential vorticity and water vapor in upper troposphere has the greatest contribution, while 10.8 and 12 mu m channels information have relatively weak influences. Therefore, a simplified model without involving a brightness temperature of 10.8 and 12 mu m can be adopted to improve the calculation efficiency.

TI  - An integrated approach to modeling urban growth using modified built-up area extraction technique
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Prediction of urban growth is often crucial in urban planning decisions. In this paper, we integrated the whole process of urban growth prediction by SLEUTH simulation for Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan area of Bangladesh for the year of 2035. SLEUTH requires a rigorous preparation of five data inputs, i.e., slope, exclusion area, urban extent, road network and hillshade. This paper improvised the preparation of urban extent input using both Landsat-8 and Landsat-5 imagery. To increase the accuracy of urban area extraction from Landsat-8 images, we integrated normalized difference vegetation index and modified normalized difference water index with normalized difference built-up index. In the case of normalized difference built-up index, we used the principal component image of band 6 and 7 of Landsat-8 to include the effects of both bands. This technique to extract the built-up area increased the overall accuracy by 17.28% point. SLEUTH model ran through three calibration phases-coarse, fine and final-and an additional calibration was run to generate the forecasting coefficients. After the calibration phase, the best fit coefficient values were determined to run the prediction mode. The predicted outputs were derived as percentiles of development probability, from which a probability of above 90% was selected in this study. The prediction reveals that the urban extent of the study area is likely to increase by 158.66% from 2015 to 2035, and the designated conservation areas will significantly decrease during the same time period. This paper will provide researchers with an accurate and structured methodology to predict urban growth.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal and spatial continuity of remote sensing data is flawed due to cloudiness, sensor malfunction or atmospheric pollution. Different methods have been presented to estimate missing values in remote sensing data. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a spatio-temporal gap filling algorithm developed by Weiss et al. (2014). This algorithm is interesting and worthy for further evaluation because it achieves high accuracy while maintaining the computational complexity considerably low. To conduct a comprehensive evaluation, we applied the algorithm to MODIS (Land Surface Temperature (LST) and evapotranspiration (ET)) and TRMM (precipitation) time series and investigate the effects of several factors including seasonality, variable type, gap size and surface characteristics through simulation scenarios. The performances were discussed using qualitative and quantitative assessments based on different simulation scenarios. A crucial finding of this study is a subtle structural deficiency of the algorithm. In particular, the algorithm outputs highly erroneous estimations when dealing with pixels with values mostly between zero and one. Such unexpected errors were observed in the seasonal assessment of land surface temperature estimations. In addition, according to the results of this study, the algorithm was sensitive to the variable type; however there was no correlation between the studied gap sizes and the error values. Among the three studied variables, LST and ET missing values were restored very accurately while estimations of precipitation missing values were more erroneous. The results also exhibit that in heterogeneous areas with complex topography, the errors of estimations were higher than homogeneous regions and areas with less complex topography. Based on the results, the algorithm should be used with caution in the discrete parameters like precipitation and area with abrupt variations. Furthermore, the design of the method may be refined for such datasets which include values with range between zero and one.

TI  - The Use of Remote Sensing Analysis for Evaluating the Impact of Development Projects in the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has long been valued as a data source for monitoring environmental indicators and detecting trends in ecosystem stress from anthropogenic causes such as deforestation, river dams and air and water pollution. More recently, remote sensing analyses have been applied to evaluate the impacts of environmental projects and programs on reducing environmental stresses. Such evaluation has focused primarily on the change in above-surface vegetation such as forests. This study uses remote sensing ocean color products to evaluate the impact on reducing marine pollution of the Global Environment Facility's (GEF) portfolio of projects in the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem. Chlorophyll concentration was derived from satellite images over a time series from the 1990s, when GEF projects began, until the present. Results show a 50% increase in chlorophyll until 2011 followed by a 34% decrease until 2019, showing a potential delayed effect of pollution control efforts. The rich time series data is a major advantage to using geospatial analysis for evaluating the impacts of environmental interventions on marine pollution. However, one drawback to the method is that it provides insights into correlations but cannot attribute the results to any particular cause, such as GEF interventions.

TI  - Radiation Therapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer: An ASTRO Clinical Practice Guideline
T2  - PRACTICAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Several sentinel phase III randomized trials have recently been published challenging traditional radiation therapy (RT) practices for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). This American Society for Radiation Oncology guideline reviews the evidence for thoracic RT and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for both limited-stage (LS) and extensive-stage (ES) SCLC.Methods: The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened a task force to address 4 key questions focused on indications, dose fractionation, techniques and timing of thoracic RT for LS-SCLC, the role of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) compared with conventional RT in stage I or II node negative SCLC, PCI for LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC, and thoracic consolidation for ES-SCLC. Recommendations were based on a systematic literature review and created using a consensus-building methodology and system for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength.Results: The task force strongly recommends definitive thoracic RT administered once or twice daily early in the course of treatment for LS-SCLC. Adjuvant RT is conditionally recommended in surgically resected patients with positive margins or nodal metastases. Involved field RT delivered using conformal advanced treatment modalities to postchemotherapy volumes is also strongly recommended. For patients with stage I or II node negative disease, SBRT or conventional fractionation is strongly recommended, and chemotherapy should be delivered before or after SBRT. In LS-SCLC, PCI is strongly recommended for stage II or III patients who responded to chemoradiation, conditionally not recommended for stage I patients, and should be a shared decision for patients at higher risk of neurocognitive toxicities. In ES-SCLC, radiation oncologist consultation for consideration of PCI versus magnetic resonance surveillance is strongly recommended. Lastly, the use of thoracic RT is strongly recommended in select patients with ES-SCLC after chemotherapy treatment, including a conditional recommendation in those responding to chemotherapy and immunotherapy.Conclusions: RT plays a vital role in both LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC. These guidelines inform best clinical practices for local therapy in SCLC. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.

TI  - Seasonal heterogeneity in aerosol optical properties over the subtropical humid region of northern India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - First-ever measurements and study of aerosol optical properties from a subtropical humid region of the eastern part of the central Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), Gorakhpur (26.75 degrees N, 83.38. E, 85 m amsl) is presented. Four years, March 2014-February 2018, of columnar aerosol optical measurements, using a Multi-wavelength solar radiometer (MWR), are analyzed to examine temporal and seasonal heterogeneity in aerosol optical properties, and to ascertain aerosol types over the study region along with their seasonal contribution. Average columnar aerosol optical depth at 500 nm (AOD(500)) is 0.65 +/- 0.27, with highest seasonal mean (0.73 +/- 0.30) during pre-monsoon (PM) and lowest seasonal mean (0.59 +/- 0.25) during monsoon (M) season. During PM season, more than 50% of AOD500 values are greater than 0.7 indicating high aerosol loading over the study region. Large variability in Angstr_om exponent (a alpha) and atmospheric turbidity (beta) from 0.12 to 2.26 and 0.05 to 1.34, with mean value of 0.92. 0.27 and 0.37. 0.14, respectively, indicates heterogeneous aerosol emission sources and turbid atmosphere over the study region. Higher a (>1) during post-monsoon (PoM) and winter (W) seasons indicate predominance of fine mode aerosols whereas lower alpha (<0.7) during PM season indicate prevalence of coarser mode aerosols over the study region. Aerosols of urban/industrial and biomass burning origins (UB) have maximum contribution during PoM (71.4%) and W (56.2%) seasons, while more than 25% of mixed type (MT) aerosols are observed throughout the study period with maximum contribution observed during M (63%) season. AOD retrieved from MWR and that from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) compare reasonably well with a correlation coefficient of 0.66.

TI  - Short-Term Ecogeomorphic Evolution of a Fluvial Delta from Hindcasting Intertidal Marsh-Top Elevations (HIME)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how delta islands grow and change at contemporary, interannual timescales remains a key scientific goal and societal need, but the high-resolution, high frequency morphodynamic data that would be most useful for this are as yet logistically prohibitive. The recorded water levels needed for relative elevation analysis are also often lacking. This paper presents a new approach for hindcasting intertidal marsh-top elevations (HIME) to resolve ecogeomorphic change, even in a young, rapidly changing fluvial delta setting, at sub-decadal temporal resolution and at the spatial resolution of widely available optical remote sensing imagery (e.g., 30 m Landsat). The HIME method first calculates: (i) the probability of land exposure in a set of historical imagery from a user-defined discrete timespan (e.g., months or years); (ii) the probability of water level non-exceedance from water level records, which need not be complete nor coincident with the imagery; and (iii) the systematic variation in local mean water level with distance along the primary hydraulic gradient. The HIME method then combines these inputs to estimate a marsh-top elevation map for each historical timespan of interest. The method was developed, validated, applied, and results analyzed to investigate time-lapse evolution of the Wax Lake Delta in Louisiana, USA, every three years, over two decades (1993-2013). The hindcast maps of delta island extents and elevations evidenced ecogeomorphic system self-organization around four stable attractors, or elevation platforms, at about -0.3 m (subtidal), 0.2 m, 0.4 m, and 0.9 m (supratidal) NAVD88. The HIME results also yielded a time series of net subaerial sediment accumulation, and specific locations and magnitudes of gains and losses, at scales from 30 m to delta-wide (similar to 100 km(3)) and 6 to 21 years. Average subaerial net sediment accumulation at the Wax Lake Delta (WLD) was estimated as 0.6 cm/yr during the study period. Finally, multiple linear regression models were successfully trained on the HIME elevation maps to model evolving delta island morphologies based on simple geometric factors, such as distance down-delta and position on a delta island; the models also successfully reproduced an average delta topset slope of 1.4 cm. Overall, this study's development and application of the HIME method added detailed insights to recent, transient ecogeomorphological change at the WLD, and demonstrated the potential of the new approach for accurately reconstructing past intertidal topographies and dynamic change.

TI  - Satellite interferometric data for landslide intensity evaluation in mountainous regions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MTInSAR) data offer a valuable support to landslide mapping and to landslide activity estimation in mountain environments, where in situ measures are sometimes difficult to gather. Nowadays, the interferometric approach is more and more used for wide-areas analysis, providing useful information for risk management actors but at the same time requiring a lot of efforts to correctly interpret what satellite data are telling us. In this context, hot-spot-like analyses that select and highlight the fastest moving areas in a region of interest, are a good operative solution for reducing the time needed to inspect a whole interferometric dataset composed by thousands or millions of points. In this work, we go beyond the concept of MTInSAR data as simple mapping tools by proposing an approach whose final goal is the quantification of the potential loss experienced by an element at risk hit by a potential landslide. To do so, it is mandatory to evaluate landslide intensity. Here, we estimate intensity using Active Deformation Areas (ADA) extracted from Sentinel-1 MTInSAR data. Depending on the localization of each ADA with respect to the urban areas, intensity is derived in two different ways. Once exposure and vulnerability of the elements at risk are estimated, the potential loss due to a landslide of a given intensity is calculated. We tested our methodology in the Eastern Valle d'Aosta (north-western Italy), along four lateral valleys of the Dora Baltea Valley. This territory is characterized by steep slopes and by numerous active and dormant landslides. The goal of this work is to develop a regional scale methodology based on satellite radar interferometry to assess the potential impact of landslides on the urban fabric.

TI  - Water Quality Properties Derived from VIIRS Measurements in the Great Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Refined empirical algorithms for chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, using the maximum ratio of normalized water-leaving radiance nL(w)(lambda) at the blue and green bands, and Secchi depth (SD) from nL(w)(lambda) at 551 nm, nL(w)(551), are proposed for the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite in the Great Lakes. We demonstrated that water quality properties and phytoplankton production can be successfully monitored and assessed using the new regional Chl-a and SD algorithms, with reasonably accurate estimates of Chl-a and SD from the VIIRS-SNPP ocean color data in the Great Lakes. VIIRS-derived Chl-a and SD products using the proposed algorithms provide the temporal and spatial variabilities in the Great Lakes. Overall, Chl-a concentrations are generally low in lakes Michigan and Huron, while Chl-a data are highest in Lake Erie. The seasonal pattern shows that overall low Chl-a concentrations appear in winter and high values in June to September in the lakes. The distribution of SD in the Great Lakes is spatially and temporally different from that of Chl-a. The SD data are generally lower in summer and higher in winter in most of the Great Lakes. However, the highest SD in Lake Erie appears in summer, and lower values in winter. Significantly high values in Chl-a, and lower values in SD, in the nearshore regions, such as Thunder Bay, Saginaw Bay, and Whitefish Bay, can be related to the very shallow bathymetry and freshwater inputs from the land. The time series of VIIRS-derived Chl-a and SD data provide strong interannual variability in most of the Great Lakes.

TI  - Automated Procurement of Training Data for Machine Learning Algorithm on Ship Detection Using AIS Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of convolutional neural network (CNN) optimized for object detection, led to significant developments in ship detection. Although training data critically affect the performance of the CNN-based training model, previous studies focused mostly on enhancing the architecture of the training model. This study developed a sophisticated and automatic methodology to generate verified and robust training data by employing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and automatic identification system (AIS) data. The extraction of training data initiated from interpolating the discretely received AIS positions to the exact position of the ship at the time of image acquisition. The interpolation was conducted by applying a Kalman filter, followed by compensating the Doppler frequency shift. The bounding box for the ship was constructed tightly considering the installation of the AIS equipment and the exact size of the ship. From 18 Sentinel-1 SAR images using a completely automated procedure, 7489 training data were obtained, compared with a different set of training data from visual interpretation. The ship detection model trained using the automatic training data obtained 0.7713 of overall detection performance from 3 Sentinel-1 SAR images, which exceeded that of manual training data, evading the artificial structures of harbors and azimuth ambiguity ghost signals from detection.

TI  - Previremic Identification of Ebola or Marburg Virus Infection Using Integrated Host-Transcriptome and Viral Genome Detection
T2  - MBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Outbreaks of filoviruses, such as those caused by the Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg (MARV) virus, are difficult to detect and control. The initial clinical symptoms of these diseases are nonspecific and can mimic other endemic pathogens. This makes confident diagnosis based on clinical symptoms alone impossible. Molecular diagnostics for these diseases that rely on the detection of viral RNA in the blood are only effective after significant disease progression. As an approach to identify these infections earlier in the disease course, we tested the effectiveness of viral RNA detection combined with an assessment of sentinel host mRNAs that are upregulated following filovirus infection. RNAseq analysis of EBOV-infected nonhuman primates identified host RNAs that are upregulated at early stages of infection. NanoString probes that recognized these host-response RNAs were combined with probes that recognized viral RNA and were used to classify viral infection both prior to viremia and postviremia. This approach was highly successful at identifying samples from nonhuman primate subjects and correctly distinguished the causative agent in a previremic stage in 10 EBOV and 5 MARV samples. This work suggests that unified host response/viral fingerprint assays can enable diagnosis of disease earlier than testing for viral nucleic acid alone, which could decrease transmission events and increase therapeutic effectiveness.IMPORTANCE Current molecular tests that identify infection with high-consequence viruses such as Ebola virus and Marburg virus are based on the detection of virus material in the blood. These viruses do not undergo significant early replication in the blood and, instead, replicate in organs such as the liver and spleen. Thus, virus begins to accumulate in the blood only after significant replication has already occurred in those organs, making viremia an indicator of infection only after initial stages have become established. Here, we show that a multianalyte assay can correctly identify the infectious agent in nonhuman primates (NHPs) prior to viremia through tracking host infection response transcripts. This illustrates that a single-tube, sample-to-answer format assay could be used to advance the time at which the type of infection can be determined and thereby improve outcomes.

TI  - Twenty-First-Century Climate Change Hot Spots in the Light of a Weakening Sun
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite measurements over the last three decades show a gradual decrease in solar output, which can be indicative as a precursor to a modern grand solar minimum (GSM). Using a chemistry-climate model, this study investigates the potential of two GSM scenarios with different magnitude to counteract the climate change by projected anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the twenty-first century. To identify regions showing enhanced vulnerability to climate change (hot spots) and to estimate their response to a possible modern GSM, a multidimensional metric is applied that accounts for-in addition to changes in mean quantities-seasonal changes in the variability and occurrence of extreme events. We find that a future GSM in the middle of the twenty-first century would temporarily mitigate the global mean impact of anthropogenic climate change by 10%-23% depending on the GSM scenario. A future GSM would, however, not be able to stop anthropogenic global warming. For the GHG-only scenario, our hot-spot analysis suggests that the midlatitudes show a response to rising GHGs below global average, while in the tropics, climate change hot spots with more frequent extreme hot seasons will develop during the twenty-first century. AGSM would reduce the climate change warming in all regions. The GHG-induced warming in Arctic winter would be dampened in a GSM due to the impact of reduced solar irradiance on Arctic sea ice. However, even an extreme GSM could only mitigate a fraction of the tropical hot-spot pattern (up to 24%) in the long term.

TI  - Temporal Calibration of an Evaporation-Based Spatial Disaggregation Method of SMOS Soil Moisture Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The resolution of current satellite surface soil moisture (SM) estimates is very low, of tens of kilometers, which proves to be insufficient for various agricultural and hydrological applications. Amongst the existing downscaling approaches of remotely sensed SM, DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on a Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) improves the resolution of SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) soil moisture data using soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) estimates at high resolution (HR) and a SEE(SM) model implemented at low resolution (LR). Defined as the ratio of actual to potential soil evaporation, SEE can be derived from the remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The current version of DISPATCH uses a linear SEE(SM) model. This study aims at improving the SEE(SM) model and testing different calibration strategies, to ultimately have more robust and better downscaled SM products. A nonlinear SEE(SM) model is introduced and its influence on the derived HR SM products is studied over a range of conditions. Each model, linear and nonlinear, is calibrated from remote sensing data on a daily and a multi-date basis. The approaches were tested over two mixed dry and irrigated areas in Catalonia, Spain, and over one dry area in Morocco. When using the linear model, better statistical results were generally obtained using a daily calibration (current version of DISPATCH), most notably over one Spanish site. However, the best results were systematically obtained for an annually calibrated nonlinear model, in terms of all metrics considered: correlation coefficient, slope of the linear regression, bias, unbiased root mean square error. In particular, when using the annually calibrated nonlinear SEE (SM) model, the temporal slope of the linear regression between disaggregated and in situ soil moisture increased to 1.16 and 0.75 for one Spanish site and for the Moroccan site (as opposed to 0.44 and 0.58, respectively, when using the linear model with a daily calibration). The temporal correlation coefficient increased to 0.47 and 0.54 over the Spanish sites (as opposed to 0.18 and 0.27, respectively, when using the linear model with a daily calibration). Those contrasted results indicate compensation effects between the model type and the calibration strategy. Taking into account studies that report the strong nonlinear behavior of the SEE with respect to SM, the introduction of the nonlinear SEE(SM) model in DISPATCH, combined with a multi-date calibration, is proven to perform significantly better under various conditions, leading to more robust disaggregated SM products. The SEE modeling based on the nonlinear SM model, with a multi-date calibration, could be integrated into the CATDS-Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnees SMOS as a future product, as well as into existing evapotranspiration models, which are based on a combination of thermal and microwave data.

TI  - Stability of 12 T-helper cell-associated cytokines in human serum under different pre-analytical conditions
T2  - CYTOKINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cytokines are soluble and readily analyzed signaling molecules which reveal vital cues about the state of the immune system. As such, they serve in diagnosis and monitoring of immune-related disorders, where strictly controlled handling of the samples including storage and freeze/thawing procedures are required. In basic research and clinical trials, human serum samples can be left for long-term storage before processing. Storage space is commonly limited in scientific laboratories, which require storage of fewer but larger aliquots of patient serum samples. There are also practical limitations to the number of analytes to be processed at the same time. Further, new findings and technological progress might prompt analysis of hitherto unconsidered or undetectable molecules. Repeated freeze/thawing of serum samples is therefore a likely scenario, raising the question of the stability of the measured analytes under such conditions. To address this question, we subjected serum samples with spiked-in T-helper cell associated cytokines to several cycles of freeze/thawing under different conditions, including storage at -20 degrees C or -80 degrees C and thawing at 4 degrees C, 22 degrees C, and 37 degrees C, respectively. The concentration of TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-17F, and IL-22 decreased after storage at room temperature for 4 h before freezing. Generally, storage at -20 degrees C resulted in reduced cytokine concentrations. This contrasts storage at -80 degrees C, which gave stable analyte concentrations; unaffected by repeated freeze/thaw cycles. The study presented here highlights the need for sentinel samples with known cytokine concentrations as internal control for the freeze/thaw process.

TI  - FROM INDIGENOUS RATIONALITY TO HYBRID NATURES
T2  - HUMANIDADES & INOVACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - This article addresses indigenous rationality about nature and the emergence of a hybrid perspective. For indigenous rationality, nature is seen as an extension of the home, composed of symbolic conceptions (traditional knowledge, beliefs, values, beings and spirits), not only as a supplier of material resources (food, housing, etc.). It is a rationality with and not against nature, because it seeks the protection of natural elements, in a logic of coevolution with nature. However, as culture is dynamic, indigenous peoples, whether by necessity or imposition, seek to adapt to a conception of cultural hybridism and worldview. In she, is possible that tradition and modernity live side by side or in a combined way, resulting in new structures. The emergence of a hybrid perspective allows indigenous peoples can dialogue in the same terms as non-indigenous society, strengthening the struggle for their rights, territories and cultures.

TI  - Assessing effects of legacy nuclear waste on plants: Sensitive fern (<i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>) gametophyte viability at the Chalk River site
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the effects of chronic exposure to environmental radiological contamination on the reproductive fitness of sensitive fern (Onoclea sensibilis) by quantifying viability in haploid gametophytes of spores collected from ferns from background and contaminated areas of the Chalk River site. Dose rates measured in situ at field sites ranged from 60 to 849 mu Gy h(-1), with effects possible at the more contaminated sites (greater than 400 mu Gy h(-1)). Fern spores were also irradiated from 1 to 1000 Gy to develop dose-response curves. We found no effects on gametophyte viability at the most contaminated areas of the Chalk River site, where we estimated growing season doses of 0.3-3.7 Gy. Dose-response curves show evidence of hormesis, with an increase in gametophyte viability up to 10 Gy, followed by a rapid decline to no viable gametophytes at doses of 1000 Gy. The sensitive fern is not a radiosensitive plant species, but effects do occur within the normal range (10-1000 Gy) of most plant species, making it useful as a sentinel species from a community perspective. Sensitive fern spore germination is high and stable over field dose ranges, with effects primarily on gametophyte viability. This method shows promise as an effects monitoring tool for sites with radiological contamination.

TI  - Optical and Physical Characteristics of Aerosol Vertical Layers over Northeastern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The optical and physical characteristics of the aerosol vertical layers over Northeastern China (NEC) are investigated using the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Level 2 layer products from 2007 to 2014. To better examine the spatial and temporal variations in the characteristics of aerosols over NEC, the region is divided into three parts (Heilongjiang province, Jilin province, and Liaoning province) to analyze the inter-annual and seasonal variations of nine selected aerosol parameters in each part during night and day times. The results reveal that the values of aerosol optical depth (AOD) increase year by year, over the whole NEC, being relatively high over the Liaoning (LN) province; this might be induced by higher levels of economic development and agricultural activity. The highest AOD values appear in summer, which is plausibly related to the temperate monsoon climate in NEC. Higher AOD values exist during the daytime than at night; this is intuitively the result of higher daytime anthropogenic activities. The base altitude of the lowest aerosol layer (BAL) and the top altitude of the highest aerosol layer (TAH) varied significantly due to the topography of NEC. The number of aerosol layers (N) is relatively large over LN, which might be caused by a relatively stronger atmospheric convection over this landscape. The thickness of the lowest aerosol layer (TLL) bore little relationship with the topography of NEC. The AOD proportion of the lowest aerosol layer (PAODL) is high (0.70 to 0.85 for the entire NEC), indicating that aerosols are mainly concentrated in the lowest layer of the atmosphere. The volume depolarization ratio of the lowest aerosol layer (VDRL) is large during spring and winter due to the presence of dust aerosols. The color ratio of the lowest aerosol layer (CRL) is large during the day due to relatively more human activities taking place than at night. Moreover, there is a significantly positive linear correlation between N and TAH, and a negative logarithm correlation between N and PAODL over NEC. The results of this study could provide researchers and the government departments with detailed and certain optical and physical information about aerosol layers over NEC, to help in the treatment of air pollution over NEC.

TI  - Propagated Uncertainty Models Arising From Device, Environment, and Target for a Small Laser Spot Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry and its Verification in the South China Sea
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This contribution identifies the uncertainty sources influencing the component uncertainties for an airborne LiDAR bathymetry (ALB) measurement and presents the models for various component uncertainties (arising from the device, environment, and target for ALBs). Since various instrumental and environmental factors introduce vertical and horizontal uncertainties in ALB data, these uncertainties should be first analyzed and then precisely modeled to ensure the accuracy of the measurements. For this purpose, ten different effects that influence the accuracy of ALB data are systematically analyzed and modeled for four aspects in this article: the device aspect (laser pointing deflection, trajectory uncertainty, and boresight/lever arm offset), environmental aspect (atmospheric limitation, refraction on the sea surface, refraction in water, scattering in water, and water level fluctuation), target aspect (irregular bottom), and other aspect (accuracy of coordinate transformation model). In addition, the effect of the laser spot size is also discussed. To verify the presented uncertainty models, an ALB survey was operated around Yuanzhi Island in the South China Sea. For a water depth of 10 m, the theoretical overall root-sum-squares (RSS) for ten different effects of an ALB system (approximately 34 cm calculated using the total vertical uncertainty (TVU) models) is generally in accordance with the actual performance of the ALB data (approximately 39 cm) performance. The difference is mainly attributed to the limited accuracy of the ground truth data, and the difference between the water depth and laser ranging is reasonable. In this process, the topography data in the same region captured by a shipborne multibeam echo sounder (MBES) were used as the ground truth. The results indicated that for the typical ALB system, the laser pointing uncertainty and refraction uncertainty on the sea surface are primary uncertainty sources and should be corrected in a higher priority to meet the seafloor topographic accuracy demand of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) Standards for Hydrographic Surveys (S-44). The proposed uncertainty models can be used not only to guide the actual measurement of an ALB system but also to provide the uncertainty correction reference for ALB data postprocessing.

TI  - An Integrative Information Aqueduct to Close the Gaps between Satellite Observation of Water Cycle and Local Sustainable Management of Water Resources
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The past decades have seen rapid advancements in space-based monitoring of essential water cycle variables, providing products related to precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture, often at tens of kilometer scales. Whilst these data effectively characterize water cycle variability at regional to global scales, they are less suitable for sustainable management of local water resources, which needs detailed information to represent the spatial heterogeneity of soil and vegetation. The following questions are critical to effectively exploit information from remotely sensed and in situ Earth observations (EOs): How to downscale the global water cycle products to the local scale using multiple sources and scales of EO data? How to explore and apply the downscaled information at the management level for a better understanding of soil-water-vegetation-energy processes? How can such fine-scale information be used to improve the management of soil and water resources? An integrative information flow (i.e., iAqueduct theoretical framework) is developed to close the gaps between satellite water cycle products and local information necessary for sustainable management of water resources. The integrated iAqueduct framework aims to address the abovementioned scientific questions by combining medium-resolution (10 m-1 km) Copernicus satellite data with high-resolution (cm) unmanned aerial system (UAS) data, in situ observations, analytical- and physical-based models, as well as big-data analytics with machine learning algorithms. This paper provides a general overview of the iAqueduct theoretical framework and introduces some preliminary results.

TI  - Changes in Water Surface Area of the Lake in the Steppe Region of Mongolia: A Case Study of Ugii Nuur Lake, Central Mongolia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ugii Nuur Lake is not only one of the small hydrologically closed lakes located in the Orkhon River Basin in Central Mongolia but also the most vulnerable area for global climate change. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impacts of recent global climate change on the water surface area. The data we analyzed were various measured hydro-meteorological variables of the lake basin and the lake surface area, which was estimated from Landsat series satellite data from 1986 to 2018. The methods we used were Mann-Kendall (MK), Innovative trend analysis method (ITAM), Sen's slope estimator test, correlation, and regression analysis. The variation of lake water surface area has a strong positive correlation with the change of the lake water level (r = 0.95). The Mann-Kendall trend analysis has indicated that under a significant decrease in total annual precipitation (Z = -0.902) and inflow river discharge (Z = -5.392) and a considerable increase in total annual evaporation (Z = 4.385) and annual average air temperature (Z = 4.595), the surface area of the Ugii Nuur Lake has decreased sharply (Z = -6.021). The total annual evaporation (r = -0.64) and inflow river discharge (r = 0.67) were the essential hydro-meteorological factors affecting the surface area of the Ugii Nuur Lake. The lake surface area decreased by 13.5% in 2018 compared with 1986. In the near future, it is vital to conduct scientific studies considering the volume of lake water, groundwater, and the anthropogenic impact.

TI  - Street-Scale Analysis of Population Exposure to Light Pollution Based on Remote Sensing and Mobile Big Data-Shenzhen City as a Case
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most studies on light pollution are based on light intensity retrieved from nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing with less consideration of the population factors. Furthermore, the coarse spatial resolution of traditional NTL remote sensing data limits the refined applications in current smart city studies. In order to analyze the influence of light pollution on populated areas, this study proposes an index named population exposure to light pollution (PELP) and conducts a street-scale analysis to illustrate spatial variation of PELP among residential areas in cites. By taking Shenzhen city as a case, multi-source data were combined including high resolution NTL remote sensing data from the Luojia 1-01 satellite sensor, high-precision mobile big data for visualizing human activities and population distribution as well as point of interest (POI) data. Results show that the main influenced areas of light pollution are concentrated in the downtown and core areas of newly expanded areas with obvious deviation corrected like traditional serious light polluted regions (e.g., ports). In comparison, commercial-residential mixed areas and village-in-city show a high level of PELP. The proposed method better presents the extent of population exposure to light pollution at a fine-grid scale and the regional difference between different types of residential areas in a city.

TI  - Google Earth Engine for the Detection of Soiling on Photovoltaic Solar Panels in Arid Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The soiling of solar panels from dry deposition affects the overall efficiency of power output from solar power plants. This study focuses on the detection and monitoring of sand deposition (wind-blown dust) on photovoltaic (PV) solar panels in arid regions using multitemporal remote sensing data. The study area is located in Bhadla solar park of Rajasthan, India which receives numerous sandstorms every year, carried by westerly and north-westerly winds. This study aims to use Google Earth Engine (GEE) in monitoring the soiling phenomenon on PV panels. Optical imageries archived in the GEE platform were processed for the generation of various sand indices such as the normalized differential sand index (NDSI), the ratio normalized differential soil index (RNDSI), and the dry bare soil index (DBSI). Land surface temperature (LST) derived from Landsat 8 thermal bands were also used to correlate with sand indices and to observe the pattern of sand accumulation in the target region. Additionally, high-resolution PlanetScope images were used to quantitatively validate the sand indices. Our study suggests that the use of freely available satellite data with semiautomated processing on GEE can be a useful alternative to manual methods. The developed method can provide near real-time monitoring of soiling on PV panels cost-effectively. This study concludes that the DBSI method has a comparatively higher potential (89.6% Accuracy, 0.77 Kappa) in the detection of sand deposition on PV panels as compared to other indices. The findings of this study can be useful to solar energy companies in the development of an operational plan for the cleaning of PV panels regularly.

TI  - Soil Moisture-Vegetation-Carbon Flux Relationship under Agricultural Drought Condition using Optical Multispectral Sensor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought is triggered by a depletion of moisture content in the soil, which hinders photosynthesis and thus increases carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere. The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between soil moisture (SM) and vegetation activity toward quantifying CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. To this end, the MODerate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), an optical multispectral sensor, was used to evaluate two regions in South Korea for validation. Vegetation activity was analyzed through MOD13A1 vegetation indices products, and MODIS gross primary productivity (GPP) product was used to calculate the CO2 flux based on its relationship with respiration. In the case of SM, it was calculated through the method of applying apparent thermal inertia (ATI) in combination with land surface temperature and albedo. To validate the SM and CO2 flux, flux tower data was used which are the observed measurement values for the extreme drought period of 2014 and 2015 in South Korea. These two variables were analyzed for temporal variation on flux tower data as daily time scale, and the relationship with vegetation index (VI) was synthesized and analyzed on a monthly scale. The highest correlation between SM and VI (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.82) was observed at a time lag of one month, and that between VI and CO2 (r = 0.81) at half month. This regional study suggests a potential capability of MODIS-based SM, VI, and CO2 flux, which can be applied to an assessment of the global view of the agricultural drought by using available satellite remote sensing products.

TI  - Alprazolam use among a sample of Australians who inject drugs: Trends up to six years post regulatory changes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Alprazolam is a high potency triazolobenzodiazepine that is associated with a disproportionate amount of harm compared to other benzodiazepines. In Australia, amid growing concerns of extra-medical use and harms, alprazolam was up-scheduled from Schedule 4 (prescription only) to Schedule 8 (controlled drug) on 1 February 2014, with further restrictions introduced on 1 February 2017. This study aims to examine the impact of these regulatory changes among cross-sectional samples of people who inject drugs (PWID), from 2011-2019.Methods: Data were obtained from the 2011-2019 Illicit Drug Reporting System, comprising cross-sectional samples of PWID recruited annually from Australian capital cities (approximately similar to 900 per year).Results: By 2019, the proportion of PWID who reported past six-month use of non-prescribed (17%) and prescribed (4%) alprazolam had halved compared to 2011 (39% and 13%, respectively), with no evidence of an increase in use of other sedative substances. Following the up-scheduling of alprazolam in 2014, there was an increase in the median last price paid for 2 mg of diverted alprazolam ($5AUD pre-rescheduling versus $7AUD post rescheduling), with 61% of those able to answer reporting that diverted alprazolam had become 'more difficult' to obtain post versus pre-rescheduling. The correlates associated with non-prescribed alprazolam use remained relatively consistent pre- and post-regulatory change, with past-month criminal activity, past six-month opioid agonist therapy and past six-month use of non-prescribed other benzodiazepines associated with non-prescribed alprazolam use in both the 2013 and 2018 samples.Conclusions: Regulatory changes appear to have resulted in sustained reductions in alprazolam use amongst our annual cross-sectional sentinel samples of PWID, although a considerable minority (17%) continued to report non-prescribed use in 2019. To achieve further reductions in non-prescribed use and associated harms, these regulatory changes need to be coupled with other interventions, such as direct consumer engagement and harm reduction messaging. Our findings suggest that people receiving opioid agonist therapy remain a key target population for such interventions.

TI  - Adequate sentinel node harvest is associated with low false negative rate in breast cancer managed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and targeted axillary dissection
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: After neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for clinically node-positive breast cancer (NPBC), targeted axillary dissection (TAD) reduces the false negative rate (FNR) of axillary node sampling. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is indicated if the clipped node cannot be identified. Prior studies have indicated that a sentinel lymph node harvest (SLNH) of >= 3 also leads to low FNR. We investigated the performance of SLNH thresholds at inferring the status of the axilla during TAD.Methods: Retrospective review of the Legacy Health System Tumor Registry was performed. We identified NPBC patients between 2011 and 2016 managed with NAC and TAD.Results: In 29 patients, the FNR of the SLNB component of TAD was 11% with SLNH of >= 3; with SLNH of <= 2 nodes the FNR was 20%.Conclusions: In patients with NPBC receiving NAC, adequate SLNH is associated with acceptably low FNR. The decision to pursue ALND for clip identification should be made on a case-by-case basis. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Deglaciation Rate of Selected Nunataks in Spitsbergen, Svalbard-Potential for Permafrost Expansion above the Glacial Environment
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spitsbergen has recently experienced a continuous deglaciation process, linked to both glacier front retreat and lowering of the glacier surface. This process is accompanied by permafrost aggradation from the top of the slopes down to the glacier. Here, the authors determine the rate of permafrost expansion in this type of vertical profile. To this end, seven nunataks across the island were analysed using Landsat satellite imagery, a high-resolution digital elevation model (ArcticDEM), and geoinformation software. Over the last 24-31 years, new nunataks gradually emerged from the ice cover at an average linear rate of 0.06 m a(-1) per degree of increment of the slope of the terrain at an average altitude of approximately 640 m a.s.l. The analysis showed that the maximum rate of permafrost expansion down the slope was positively correlated with the average nunatak elevation, reaching a value of approximately 10,000 m(2) a(-1). In cold climates, with a mean annual air temperature (MAAT) below 0 degrees C, newly exposed land is occupied by active periglacial environments, causing permafrost aggradation. Therefore, both glacial and periglacial environments are changing over time concomitantly, with permafrost aggradation occurring along and around the glacier, wherever the MAAT is negative.

TI  - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome as Sentinel for Harmful Hand Activities at Work A Nationwide Danish Cohort Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Evaluate incidence rates (IRs) of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as sentinels to identify job groups with high hand-wrist exposures. Methods: A nationwide register-based cohort study of all born in Denmark. During follow-up 2010 to 2013, we identified first-time CTS diagnoses. We established job groups, calculated sex-specific age-standardized IRs (SIRs) per job group. We linked occupational codes with a job exposure matrix, calculated mean hand load estimate per job group, and plotted hand load against the SIRs. Results: We followed 1,171,580 men and 1,137,854 women for 4,046,851 and 3,994,987 person-years; identified 4405 cases among men, 7858 among women; obtained crude IRs of 10.9 and 19.7 per 10,000 person-years. For both sexes, there was a positive association between SIRs and hand load. Conclusions: Higher SIRs pointed to job groups with higher hand load. Elevated SIRs of CTS may serve as sentinels of harmful hand activities.

TI  - Elevation and Climate Effects on Vegetation Greenness in an Arid Mountain-Basin System of Central Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain-basin systems (MBS) in Central Asia are unique and complex ecosystems, wherein their elevation gradients lead to high spatial heterogeneity in vegetation and its response to climate change. Exploring elevation-dependent vegetation greenness variation and the effects of climate factors on vegetation has important theoretical and practical significance for regulating the ecological processes of this system. Based on the MODIS NDVI (remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index), and observed precipitation and temperature data sets, we analyzed vegetation greenness and climate patterns and dynamics with respect to elevation (300-3600 m) in a typical MBS, in Altay Prefecture, China, during 2000-2017. Results showed that vegetation exhibited a greening (NDVI) trend for the whole region, as well as the mountain, oasis and desert zones, but only the desert zone reached significant level. Vegetation in all elevation bins showed greening, with significant trends at 400-700 m and 2600-3500 m. In summer, lower elevation bins (below 1500 m) had a nonsignificant wetting and warming trend and higher elevation bins had a nonsignificant drying and warming trend. Temperature trend increased with increasing elevation, indicating that warming was stronger at higher elevations. In addition, precipitation had a significantly positive coefficient and temperature a nonsignificant coefficient with NDVI at both regional scale and subregional scale. Our analysis suggests that the regional average could mask or obscure the relationship between climate and vegetation at elevational scale. Vegetation greenness had a positive response to precipitation change in all elevation bins, and had a negative response to temperature change at lower elevations (below 2600 m), and a positive response to temperature change at higher elevations. We observed that vegetation greenness was more sensitive to precipitation than to temperature at lower elevations (below 2700 m), and was more sensitive to temperature at higher elevations.

TI  - Assessment of lymphatic flow based on the sentinel node concept in early gastric adenocarcinoma that satisfies expanded endoscopic resection criteria
T2  - GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Even though indications for endoscopic resection (ER) in early gastric cancer are determined based on the potential risk of lymph node metastasis, the criteria for ER remain controversial. Sentinel node (SN) mapping for early gastric cancer can help determine regional lymphatic flow patterns. The aim of this study was to assess lymphatic flow according to the SN concept in patients with early gastric cancer, especially those who satisfy the expanded criteria for ER. Methods We retrospectively enrolled 301 patients diagnosed with pT1 adenocarcinoma who had undergone gastrectomy with SN mapping and had no lymphovascular invasion. Patients were categorized into six groups based on oncological assessment. We analyzed lymphatic flow, including the number of identified SN and SN basin, and the rate of SN metastasis in each group. Results Of the 301 patients, 128 (42.5%) met the criteria for ER, with 18 in the absolute group and 110 in the expanded group; 173 (57.5%) were assigned to the surgical group. SN metastasis rate tended to be higher in surgical group patients than in ER criteria patients. In the expanded criteria group, the sub-group of patients with intramucosal, undifferentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 20 mm or less had a significantly greater number of identified SNs (p = 0.013) and SN basins (p = 0.032). Furthermore, SN metastasis was observed only in this group. Conclusions Patients with intramucosal, nonulcerated, undifferentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 20 mm or less could develop a lymphatic network. For these patients, careful follow-up is required after ER.

TI  - Satellite image fusion based on modified central force optimization
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, optimization has become a brand methodology for different applications. One of the most promising fields for application of optimization is the image processing field, especially image fusion. A new effective deterministic optimization technique is the modified central force optimization (MCFO) that overcomes the low convergence rate drawback of the central force optimization (CFO). In this paper, the MCFO is applied with standard image fusion methods as a novel brand to improve the fusion efficiency either qualitatively or quantitatively. Intensity-hue-saturation (IHS), high-pass filtering (HPF), and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) are powerful standard techniques for satellite image fusion that are implemented with MCFO optimization in this paper. They are performed on satellite panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images. The target of using the MCFO is to reduce some spectral and spatial distortions that may occur without optimization. Different qualitative indices have been used to validate the proposed approach comprising optimization for satellite image fusion.

TI  - Long Term Interferometric Temporal Coherence and DInSAR Phase in Northern Peatlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands of northern temperate and cold climates are significant pools of stored carbon. Understanding seasonal dynamics of peatland surface height and volume, often referred to as mire breathing or oscillation, is the key to improve spatial models of material flow and gas exchange. The monitoring of this type of dynamics over large areas is only feasible by remote sensing instruments. The objective of this study is to examine the applicability of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) to characterize seasonal dynamics of peatland surface height and water table (WT) over open raised bog areas in Endla mire complex in central Estonia, characteristic for northern temperate bogs. Our results show that InSAR temporal coherence, sufficient for differential InSAR (DInSAR), is preserved in the open bog over more than six months of temporal baseline. Moreover, the coherence which is lost in a dry summer, make a recovery in autumn correlate with WT dynamics. The relationship between the coherence from a single master image and the corresponding WT difference is described by the second degree polynomial regression model (Root Mean Squared Error RMSE = 0.041 for coherence magnitude). It is also demonstrated that DInSAR phase is connected to bog surface dynamics and reveals differences between bogs and for ecotopes within a bog. These findings suggest that InSAR long term temporal coherence could be used to describe seasonal bog WT dynamics and differentiate between mire types and ecotopes within a bog. Moreover, DInSAR analysis has the potential to characterize seasonal mire surface oscillation which may be important for assessing the capacity of water storage or restoration success in northern temperate bogs.

TI  - The Body as Place in Time(s): Concepts of the Female Body in Medieval Japan
T2  - KRONOSCOPE-JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF TIME
M3  - Article
AB  - The body reflects the various timescales of human existence, such as physical processes and cosmological patterns.This paper seeks to demonstrate conceptualizations of the female body in medieval Japan, using source texts specifically concerned with menstruation. Its investigative use of medical, religious and literary sources serves to address a variety of the dimensions of human existence. Medical writings such as the 14th century Man'anpo and the Toni'sho, both compiled by the monk physician Kajiwara Shozen, deal with the female cycle as a physical phenomenon in correlation with natural cyclical patterns. The female cycle is not only connected to questions of reproduction and sexuality, but also to larger scale cosmological time frames, such as the cycle of the moon or the tides. Instructions given for the treatment of irregularities, along with preventive measures, take into consideration the large-scale time frame in resonance with the micro-level of the body.Medical knowledge is complemented by religious texts, such as the Blood Bowl Sutra (Ketsubonkyo), that contextualize the perception of the female body within a religious dimension. The Buddhist worldview that permeates medical and literary texts of this era is also reflected in ideas about the female body. The varying physical, cosmological and religious chronomorphologies of the body reflect a multiplicity of time frames in medieval Japan.

TI  - Estimation of water volume in ungauged, dynamic floodplain lakes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes play a crucial role in retaining water and altering biogeochemical processes on floodplains. Existing strategies and algorithms for estimation of water storage are insufficient for dynamic floodplain lakes due to the scarcity of available observations. Combining a time series of open water area with a fine spatial-temporal resolution by integrating Landsat and MODIS observations of Poyang Lake (China) with digital elevation models, and limited gauge data, generated water storage estimates as a function of surface hydrological connectivity. Despite possessing a relatively small portion of Poyang Lake's water volume, the floodplain lakes occupy a large part of the surface water area, especially in the low water period. Floodplain lakes, in particular, those distributed in the upper delta contribute to relieving drought conditions in Poyang Lake.

TI  - Monitoring 2011-2020 Traffic Patterns in Wuhan (China) with COSMO-SkyMed SAR, Amidst the 7th CISM Military World Games and COVID-19 Outbreak
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vehicle detection from satellite imagery can support different applications, such as security and situational awareness. In the civilian domain, it can provide quantitative evidence to investigate urban mobility and traffic patterns in cities. Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can help in detecting vehicles in (almost) all weather conditions and during the day and night. In this study, the capability of SAR StripMap imaging mode data to monitor traffic is analyzed using the case study of Wuhan, China. In ordinary times, the bridges crossing the Yangtze river are the key infrastructure allowing for urban mobility in Wuhan. More recently, the city has been the first in the world to be put in lockdown due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Using a very long time series of 294 COSMO-SkyMed StripMap HIMAGE mode scenes collected from 2011 to 2020, we detected vehicles on seven bridges, estimated their speed, and analyzed the traffic pattern over time. Vehicles are detected based on their azimuth shift caused by their across-track motion. Our goal is to monitor the variations in traffic instead of single-car detection. The results from 2011 to 2019 show a general increase in the number of vehicles crossing the bridges, as new infrastructure was built over the years. Variations in detected vehicle numbers were especially found during the two events of the 7th International Military Sports Council (CISM) Military World Games in October 2019, and the COVID-19 lockdown in early 2020. These events were therefore used for internal validation of our assessment of traffic patterns. On the other side, TomTom traffic index data were used for external validation. The results and their comparison with TomTom data prove the effectiveness of our method in detecting traffic patterns, but also demonstrate that mostly large vehicles (e.g., trucks or buses) are detected. Future work should be carried out to improve the detection rate of smaller vehicles.

TI  - Changes in China's water resources in the early 21st century
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearly 19% of the world's population lives in China, yet the country contains only 7% of the planet's fresh water. Combining remotely sensed data and ground-based measurements, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of recent changes in China's water resources. Beginning in the 21st century, glaciers in western China have been melting at very high rates; lakes on the Tibetan Plateau have been expanding rapidly, but lakes in other regions have been severely impacted by humans; and groundwater in the North China Plain is increasingly being depleted. Overall, the nation's water resources have been decreasing at an annual rate of ~9.6 billion cubic meters. Precipitation was the dominant factor controlling the observed changes in water resources, but human activities and rising temperatures have also been major drivers in the decline of water resources in the North China Plain and Tibet, respectively. From a global perspective, the changes in China's water resources are among the most pronounced on Earth, and water policies should be re-evaluated and revised in light of the findings presented here.

TI  - Derivation of consistent, continuous daily river temperature data series by combining remote sensing and water temperature models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Scarcity of water temperature data in rivers may limit a diversity of studies considering this property, which regulates many physical, chemical, and biological processes. We present a robust method to generate a consistent, continuous daily river water temperature (RWT) data series for medium and large rivers using the combined techniques of remote sensing and water temperature modelling. In order to validate our approach, we divided this study into two parts: (i) we evaluated methods to derive RWT from Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 TIRS imagery; and (ii) we evaluated the calibration and validation of river temperature models, using these data, to generate the continuous RWT data series. A 1.2 km section of the White River located near Hazleton, IN, USA, was selected to assess this method mainly due to river width and data availability. We tested three methods to retrieve RWT from Landsat 7 and four from Landsat 8, and we also applied a simple thermal sharpening technique. For Landsat 7, the methods showed bias and RMSE of 0.01-0.46 degrees C and 1.32-1.84 degrees C, while for Landsat 8, the methods showed bias and RMSE of 0.08-1.27 degrees C and 1.74-2.17 degrees C, and in both cases, the best results were found applying the radiative transfer equation with NASA's Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator. For the second part of the validation process, we compared a stochastic model and a hybrid model, air2stream, using as input two datasets: the RWT data derived from Landsat 7 only, and a combined dataset of both Landsat 7 and 8 derived RWT. The air2stream model outperformed the stochastic model when calibrated with Landsat 7 data only, with RMSE of 1.83 degrees C, but both models showed similar results when calibrated with the combined Landsat data, when air2stream showed RMSE of 1.58 degrees C. Due to its physical basis, better calibration procedure, and higher consistency, air2stream was considered the best model for deriving the continuous RWT data series. When compared to the measured daily mean RWT data, there was no observed tendency in under or overestimating the RWT in low or high temperature conditions by the modelled series. While further tests are needed in order to evaluate if our approach can be applied to analyse past behaviour and present trends, and the impacts of climate change on the temperature of rivers, the consistent results indicate that this approach has the potential to be applied in rivers with no measured temperature data, for example, in the spatial modelling of longitudinal profiles of rivers and the modelling of tributary river temperatures.

TI  - Predator defense is shaped by risk, brood value and social group benefits in a cooperative breeder
T2  - BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Predation is a major cause of mortality and nest failure in birds. Cooperative predator defense can enhance nest success and adult survival but, because it is inherently risky, dynamic risk assessment theory predicts that individuals modify defense behavior according to the risk posed by the predator. Parental investment theory, on the other hand, predicts that reproductive payoffs (brood value) determine investment in nest defense. We propose that, in cooperative breeders, fitness benefits deriving from the survival of other group members may additionally influence defense behavior (social group benefits theory). We tested predictions of these theories in the cooperatively breeding purple-crowned fairy-wren, Malurus coronatus, where brood value is higher for breeders, but social group benefits more important for helpers. We recorded experimentally induced individual defense behaviors in response to predator models presented near nests, representing differing levels of threat to nests and adults. As predicted, 1) individuals engaged in less risky defenses when encountering a more dangerous predator (dynamic risk assessment theory); 2) individuals defended older broods more often, and breeders defended more than helpers (parental investment theory); and 3) helpers were more likely to respond to a predator of adults (social group benefits theory). Our findings highlight that predator defense in cooperative breeders is complex, shaped by the combination of immediate risk and multiple benefits.

TI  - Clinical Description and Outcomes of Australian Children With Invasive Group A Streptococcal Disease
T2  - PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Invasive group A streptococcal disease is a severe infection with a high case fatality rate, estimated to cause more than 150,000 deaths per year worldwide. The clinical presentation of this infection is variable, and early diagnosis can be challenging. There are few data on its short- and longer-term outcomes, especially in children. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical presentation, management and short- and longer-term outcomes of invasive group A streptococcal disease in children in Australia.Methods:We undertook a prospective surveillance study of children with laboratory-confirmed invasive group A streptococcus disease admitted to 7 sentinel tertiary and quaternary pediatric hospitals in Australia between July 2016 and June 2018. We collected demographic and clinical data and contacted patients 6 months after discharge to assess longer-term outcomes.Results:We enrolled 181 children, 7 days to 16 years of age. The principal site of invasive infection was blood (126 children, 69.6%), and the most frequent clinical presentation was pneumonia in 46 children (25.4%). Twenty-six children developed streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (14.4%), and 74 had severe disease (40.9%), including 71 admitted to the intensive care unit. Five children died (2.8%). At discharge and 6 months, 29.3% and 15.2% of the children had persisting health problems, respectively.Conclusions:Invasive group A streptococcal infection in Australian children is frequently severe and has a high long-term morbidity burden, highlighting the need for strengthened clinical care pathways, epidemiologic surveillance and prevention strategies.

TI  - Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Versus Blue Dye or Radioisotope Regarding Detection Rate of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Nodes Removed in Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
T2  - Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Meta-Analysis
M3  - Systematic Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Either blue dye (BD) or radioisotope (RI) is mainly used for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer patients. Unlike the BD, RI has lower false-negative rate of SLNB. However, its lymphoscintigraphy, difficulty in preoperative injection, and undetected sentinel lymph nodes in some cases cause surgeons to rely only on BD. Currently, indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence method (ICG-SLNB) is increasingly used as an alternative to the conventional mapping methods in many centers. This systematic review compared ICG with the conventional method of BD or RI in terms of detection rate of SLNB and the number of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) removed in.METHODS:  We searched all relevant studies published between January 2000 and October 2019. All data on for evaluation of SLN detection rate, number of SLNs removed per patient, and tumor positive rate of SLNB were extracted.RESULTS: A total of 30 studies, including 4,216 SLN procedures were retrieved. There was a statistically significant difference between ICG and BD method in terms of SLN detection rate (OR, 6.73; 95% CI, 4.20-10.78). However, there was no significant difference between ICG and RI in this regard (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.40-2.03). The number of SLNs removed per patient were 2.35 (1.46-5.4), 1.92 (1.0-3.64), and 1.72 (1.35-2.08) for ICG, BD, and RI, respectively. Only in 8 studies, the tumor positive rates in SLNB could be analyzed (ICG, 8.5-20.7%; BD, 12.7-21.4%; RI, 11.3-16%).CONCLUSION: ICG-SLNB could be an additional or an alternative method for axillary node mapping in breast cancer.<br />.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of evapotranspiration, gross primary productivity, and water use efficiency of cropland in agroecosystems and their relation to the water-saving project in the Shiyang River Basin of Northwestern China
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use efficiency over crop area (WUEc), defined as the ratio of carbon gain (i.e., gross primary productivity over crop area; GPPc) to water consumption (i.e., evapotranspiration over crop area; ETc) at the agroecosystems scale, is a critical variable linking the carbon and water cycles. In this study, the spatiotemporal patterns and trend characteristics of ETc, GPPc, and WUEc in agroecosystems over the period of 2000-2014 across the Shiyang River Basin in northwestern China were assessed with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) global products, and the impact of a water-saving project on WUEc is discussed. Results indicate that the spatiotemporal variability of ETc, GPPc, and WUEc were very common and similarly related to climatic variables and water allocation laws. It suggests that variations in climatic factors and the water-saving project controlled photosynthesis and ETc simultaneously; they changed the hydrological cycle by adjusting ETc. Based on a 15-year assessment, 97.25% of the basin showed a positive trend for WUEc. After the water-saving project launched in 2006, ETc was reduced by 23 mm yr(-1) (7.3%), while WUEc increased by 0.11 g C kg(-1) H2O (7.2%). The WUEc was significantly correlated with precipitation, and it was mainly determined by ETc rather than GPPc. The limitation of this research is the fact that the driving factors are not quantitatively characterized, especially at the basin scale. However, this research will not only aid in predictions about the influence of climate change and human activity on carbon and water fluxes but also provide scientific guidance to regulate water resources allocation, and this guidance can be applied to other arid regions around the world.

TI  - Impacts of ENSO events on forest fire weather of China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The ENSO events affect climate and fire danger of China. It would be helpful for improving fire danger forecast to understand the impacts of ENSO events on fire weather for various ecological zones in the country. We calculated the fire weather index ( FWI) using the daily climatic dataset ( V3.0) of international exchange weather stations in China during 1951-2016. The burned areas in forests for each ecological zone in 2001-2016 were derived from MODIS fire products. Temperature, precipitation, FWI and burned areas in fire season were estimated for each ecological zone by ENSO events ( weak, medium, strong, and super strong El Nino events and weak, medium, and strong La Nina events). The results showed that there were 19 El Nino events and 14 La Nina events during 1950-2016. The average daily maximum temperature of the spring fire season increased significantly in the northwestern region with the influence of strong or super strong El Nino event , while the temperature reduced significantly in the medium El Nino event 14 mid-temperate semi-arid grassland. Precipitation in fire season generally increased in El Nino events in southern and southwestern forest regions. It would be reduced in most areas affected by the low and medium intensity La Nina event, but be increased during the strong La Nina event. The fire weather indices of southern forest regions decreased due to the weak El Nino event. The FWI of the northern forest regions increased with the strong or super strong El Nino event, and reduced in the southern and southwestern forest areas. There was a significant spatial difference on the FWI for some ecological zones with the impacts of the El Nino/La Nina events. The burned areas showed a consistent change trend with seasonal severity rating ( SSR) during 2001-2016 when the SSR changed significantly for the regions of deciduous broad-leaved forest in humid/semihumid areas of warm temperate zone , broad-leaved forest in the middle north subtropical humid areas, and broad-leaved forest in tropical and subtropical humid areas. The burned areas in the rest regions were not affected by the ENSO events.

TI  - Monitoring Invasion Process of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> by Seasonal Sentinel-2 Imagery and an Object-Based Random Forest Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the late 1990s, the exotic plant Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), was introduced to the Zhangjiang Estuary of China for tidal zone reclamation and protection. However, it invaded rapidly and has caused serious ecological problems. Accurate information on the seasonal invasion of S. alterniflora is vital to understand invasion pattern and mechanism, especially at a high temporal resolution. This study aimed to explore the S. alterniflora invasion process at a seasonal scale from 2016 to 2018. However, due to the uncertainties caused by periodic inundation of local tides, accurately monitoring the spatial extent of S. alterniflora is challenging. Thus, to achieve the goal and address the challenge, we firstly built a high-quality seasonal Sentinel-2 image collection by developing a new submerged S. alterniflora index (SAI) to reduce the errors caused by high tide fluctuations. Then, an object-based random forest (RF) classification method was applied to the image collection. Finally, seasonal extents of S. alterniflora were captured. Results showed that (1) the red edge bands (bands 5, 6, and 7) of Sentinel-2 imagery played critical roles in delineating submerged S. alterniflora; (2) during March 2016 to November 2018, the extent of S. alterniflora increased from 151.7 to 270.3 ha, with an annual invasion rate of 39.5 ha; (3) S. alterniflora invaded with a rate of 31.5 ha/season during growing season and 12.1 ha/season during dormant season. To our knowledge, this is the first study monitoring S. alterniflora invasion process at a seasonal scale during continuous years, discovering that S. alterniflora also expands during dormant seasons. This discovery is of great significance for understanding the invasion pattern and mechanism of S. alterniflora and will facilitate coastal biodiversity conservation efforts.

TI  - An Integrated Study to Delineate the Groundwater Potential Zones Using Geospatial Approach of Sidhi Area, Madhya Pradesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface and groundwater resources are depleting over time, therefore, it becomes essential to monitor and preserve these resources and also to protect their quality. Remote sensing and GIS has become an important tool of hydrological studies in recent times which helps in assessing and mapping of ground-water resources. The remote sensing and GIS approach are well known and widely used techniques to integrate contributing hydrogeological factors namely, geology, geomorphology, lineaments density, drainage density, soil type, slope and land use/land cover. A study was conducted to delineate the groundwater potential zones in a part of Sidhi area, Madhya Pradesh using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Landsat 8 satellite data and Aster DEM is integrated with toposheets for systematic mapping. All thematic layers were integrated, overlaid and analysed using GIS software. Groundwater potential zone is delineated and to interpret thematic layer, appropriate weights assigned to topographical features for assessing the potential zone. The zones are divided into high, moderate and low groundwater potential zones. The study reveals that 21.36% of the area has high potential, 48.12% moderate and 30.51% low potential zone for groundwater occurrence. The result of this study suggests that the favourable potential zones would prove to be very helpful for better planning and management of groundwater resources in the study area.

TI  - Comparison of lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) for sentinel lymph node detection in endometrial cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundEndometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer, and lymph node metastasis is one of the most important prognostic factors. Increasing evidence shows that sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is an effective alternative to comprehensive lymphadenectomy. Single photon emission CT with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) is associated with a high SLN detection rate.ObjectiveTo compare the clinical efficacy of SPECT/CT with that of lymphoscintigraphy in detecting SLNs in patients with endometrial cancer.MethodsBetween May 2014 and October 2018, 151 patients with endometrial cancer were enrolled in this study at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Kagoshima University Hospital. Inclusion criteria were patients with endometrial cancer, older than 18 years, and with pre-operative International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging of I and II. All patients underwent pre-operative CT, and patients with suspected peritoneal dissemination and lymph node metastasis were excluded from this study. Pelvic SLNs were detected by injection of tecnetium-99m-labeled phytate into the uterine cervix. The number and locations of SLNs detected using lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT were evaluated. JMP software (version 14, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA) was used for statistical analysis.ResultsA total of 151 patients who underwent pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT were included in the study. The median age was 57 years (range 24-79), and the median body mass index was 24.3 kg/m(2) (range 16-40). The final pathology was as follows: 135 (89%) endometrioid carcinoma, 11 (7%) serous carcinoma, one (1%) clear cell carcinoma, and four (3%) other histotypes. Based on SPECT/CT, 204 pelvic SLNs were detected. The bilateral pelvic SLN detection rate was better for SPECT/CT (43% (65/151)) than for lymphoscintigraphy (32% (48/151)) (p<0.0001). The overall pelvic SLN detection rate (at least one pelvic SLN detected) was also better with SPECT/CT (77% (16/151)) vs lymphoscintigraphy (68% (102/151)) (p<0.0001). The distribution of SLN locations detected using SPECT/CT was as follows: external iliac, 91 (45%); obturator, 61 (30%); common iliac, 28 (14%); internal iliac, 19 (9%); para-aortic, 2 (1%); parametrium, 2 (1%), and presacral, 1 (1%). The SLN detection rate using SPECT/CT was significantly worse in patients of advanced age (p<0.0001).DiscussionOverall and bilateral SLN detection rate was better with SPECT/CT than with lymphoscintigraphy in patients with stage I/II endometrial cancer.

TI  - Comparison of lymphatic complications between sentinel node navigation surgery and pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients with cervical cancer
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) has been frequently used in early cervical cancer. However, the incidence and potential reduction of lymphatic complications following the removal of the sentinel lymph node remain unknown. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of lymphatic complications post sentinel node navigation surgery in patients with early cervical cancer.Methods: A total of 167 patients, including 70 and 97 patients who had undergone SNNS and pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLA), respectively, were enrolled in this study. We compared the lymphatic complications (lower extremity lymphedema and pelvic lymphocele) between the SNNS and PLA groups.Results: The median number of sentinel lymph nodes removed was 2 (range: 1-14). Among the 70 patients in the SNNS group, there were 0 (0%) and 3 (4.3%) occurrences of lower extremity lymphedema and pelvic lymphocele, respectively. The occurrences of lower extremity lymphedema and pelvic lymphocele were significantly lower in the SNNS group than in the PLA group, despite circumflex iliac node removal.Conclusions: The occurrence of lymphatic complications (lower extremity lymphedema and pelvic lymphocele) was significantly lower in the SNNS group than in the PLA group. We found that SNNS, and not PLA, was the best treatment option for preventing the development of lower extremity lymphedema and pelvic lymphocele, despite circumflex iliac node preservation.

T2  - TAIWANESE JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Lymph node (LN) metastasis is among the important prognostic factors for survival in endometrial cancer (EC). This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of lymphatic complications following lymphadenectomy in patients with EC.Materials and methods: EC patients were retrospectively evaluated. Lower extremity lymphedema (LEL) and pelvic lymphocele (PL) were evaluated according to the International Society of Lymphology guidelines and the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, respectively.Results: A total of 289 patients were enrolled. Surgery was performed via laparotomy and laparoscopy in 200 (69.2%) and 89 (30.8%) patients, respectively. LEL and PL occurred in 43 (14.9%) and 33 (11.4%) patients, respectively. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, circumflex iliac node (CIN) removal (odds ratio [OR]: 3.22; 95% CI: 1.43-7.98; P = 0.004) was an independent risk factor for LEL, while the surgical approach (OR: 4.46; 95% CI: 1.13-29.9; P = 0.004) was an independent risk factor for PL.Conclusion: CIN dissection was a significant risk factor for LEL, while laparotomy was an independent risk factor for PL compared to laparoscopy in EC patients. This suggests that laparoscopic surgery combined with sentinel lymph node navigation surgery will prevent lymphatic complications in low-risk EC patients.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF THE CHANGES IN WATER SURFASE AREA BASED ON THE USE OF ARCHIVES SATELLITE IMAGES OF LANDSAT SATELLITES (ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE ERTIS RIVER)
T2  - NEWS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN-SERIES OF GEOLOGY AND TECHNICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation of the surface waters and their rational use is one of the pressing problems throughout the world. In our country, monitoring the regulation of the flow and flooding of the floodplains is also an actual issue. This article examines the remote sensing processing technique for studying the water surface, reflecting the changes that occurred in size and in time, which allows the assessment at a new level.To determine the technique for studying the surface water researches, the analysis of published materials on modern methods of monitoring the natural water bodies based on data from the use of satellite imagery archives was carried out, and the possibilities of their application to study floodplain flooding dynamics were studied. As a result of the analysis, a technique based on the use of global surface water research data (Global Surface Water Explorer) of the European Commission research center was determined. The global surface water data set (GSWE) uses three million archival satellite images of Landsat to quantify flooding over 32 years (from 1984 to 2015) with a spatial resolution of 30 m.The analysis of the results obtained showed the presence of the problem for their use in the technique of monitoring the areas of the water surface of the river Ertis floodplain associated with a large number of raster cells with a NoData value (no data) for individual months of individual years. Despite the problems, as a result of analyzing the data of the annual level (Yearly Water Classification), the areas of the water surface were determined, which consists of the area of permanent (permanent water) and seasonal water surface (seasonal water) of the Ertis river floodplain plots.The purpose of the article is to obtain water surface data by using Landsat satellite imagery archives to monitor area dynamics.The presented results demonstrate a high potential for various applications requiring the information on the dynamics of the surface waters.

TI  - How much variation in land surface phenology can climate oscillation modes explain at the scale of mountain pastures in Kyrgyzstan?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate oscillation modes can shape weather across the globe due to atmospheric teleconnections. We built on the findings of a recent study to assess whether the impacts of teleconnections are detectable and significant in the early season dynamics of highland pastures across five rayons in Kyrgyzstan. Specifically, since land surface phenology (LSP) has already shown to be influenced by snow cover seasonality and terrain, we investigated here how much more explanatory and predictive power information about climatic oscillation modes might add to explain variation in LSP. We focused on seasonal values of five climate oscillation indices that influence vegetation dynamics in Central Asia. We characterized the phenology in highland pastures with metrics derived from LSP modeling using Landsat NDVI time series together with MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data: Peak Height (PH), the maximum modeled NDVI and Thermal Time to Peak (TTP), the quantity of accumulated growing degree-days based on LST required to reach PH. Next, we calculated two metrics of snow cover seasonality from MODIS snow cover composites: last date of snow (LDoS), and the number of snow covered dates (SCD). For terrain features, we derived elevation, slope, and TRASP index as linearization of aspect. First, we used Spearman's rank correlation to assess the geographical differentiation of land surface phenology metrics responses to environmental variables. PH showed weak correlations with TTP (positive in western but negative in eastern rayons), and moderate relationships with LDoS and SCD only in one northeastern rayon. Slope was weakly related to PH, while TRASP showed a consistent moderate negative correlation with PH. A significant but weak negative correlation was found between PH and SCAND JJA, and a significant weak positive correlation with MEI MAM. TTP showed consistently strong negative relationships with LDoS, SCD, and elevation. Very weak positive correlations with TTP were found for EAWR DJF, AMO DJF, and MEI DJF in western rayons only. Second, we used Partial Least Squares regression to investigate the role of oscillation modes altogether. PLS modelling of TTP showed that thermal time accumulation could be explained mostly by elevation and snow cover metrics, leading to reduced models explaining 55 to 70% of observed variation in TTP. Variable selection indicated that NAO JJA, AMO JJA and SCAND MAM had significant relationships with TTP, but their input of predictive power was neglible. PLS models were able to explain up to 29% of variability in PH. SCAND JJA and MEI MAM were shown to be significant predictors, but adding them into models did not influence modeling performance. We concluded the impacts of climate oscillation anomalies were not detectable or significant in mountain pastures using LSP metrics at fine spatial resolution. Rather, at a 30 m resolution, the indirect effects of seasonal climatic oscillations are overridden by terrain influences (mostly elevation) and snow cover timing. Whether climate oscillation mode indices can provide some new and useful information about growing season conditions remains a provocative question, particularly in light of the multiple environmental challenges facing the agropastoralism livelihood in montane Central Asia.

TI  - Factors associated with lead (Pb) exposure on dogs around a Pb mining area, Kabwe, Zambia
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lead (Pb)-poisoning is a serious public health concern and dogs have been useful as a sentinel-animal for Pb exposure of humans. In the present study, the blood Pb concentrations (BLC), isotope ratios (208 Pb/206 Pb and 207 Pb/206 Pb), and biochemistry of 120 domestically owned dogs living around a Pb mining area, in Kabwe, Zambia were analyzed to determine factors associated with Pb exposure. The overall mean value of Pb in dog blood in the present study was 271.6 mu g/L. The BLC in the dogs from sites near the mine were significantly higher than those in the dogs from a site 4 km from the mine (352.9 +/- 205.1 mu g/L versus 28.0 +/- 13.9 mu g/L). BLC significantly decreased with both increasing age of the dogs and distance from the mine. The Pb isotope ratios in the dog that resided near the mine showed values similar to those reported at the galena mine in Kabwe, which is considered to be the source of Pb exposure. In contrast to the high metal exposure that was determined in these dogs, the mean values of most analyzed parameters in the blood biochemical analysis were surprisingly within or close to the standard reference values. Moreover, none of the dogs showed overt signs of Pb-poisoning or other clinical symptoms. The results of analysis of Pb exposure of the dogs obtained in the present study, which are similar to the previously reported results in human in this location, suggest that dogs could be useful as a sentinel animal for Pb exposure of humans in Kabwe.

TI  - Employing a Multi-Input Deep Convolutional Neural Network to Derive Soil Clay Content from a Synergy of Multi-Temporal Optical and Radar Imagery Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation (EO) has an immense potential as being an enabling tool for mapping spatial characteristics of the topsoil layer. Recently, deep learning based algorithms and cloud computing infrastructure have become available with a great potential to revolutionize the processing of EO data. This paper aims to present a novel EO-based soil monitoring approach leveraging open-access Copernicus Sentinel data and Google Earth Engine platform. Building on key results from existing data mining approaches to extract bare soil reflectance values the current study delivers valuable insights on the synergistic use of open access optical and radar images. The proposed framework is driven by the need to eliminate the influence of ambient factors and evaluate the efficiency of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to effectively combine the complimentary information contained in the pool of both optical and radar spectral information and those form auxiliary geographical coordinates mainly for soil. We developed and calibrated our multi-input CNN model based on soil samples (calibration = 80% and validation 20%) of the LUCAS database and then applied this approach to predict soil clay content. A promising prediction performance (R-2 = 0.60, ratio of performance to the interquartile range (RPIQ) = 2.02, n = 6136) was achieved by the inclusion of both types (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and laboratory visible near infrared-short wave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) multispectral) of observations using the CNN model, demonstrating an improvement of more than 5.5% in RMSE using the multi-year median optical composite and current state-of-the-art non linear machine learning methods such as random forest (RF; R-2 = 0.55, RPIQ = 1.91, n = 6136) and artificial neural network (ANN; R-2 = 0.44, RPIQ = 1.71, n = 6136). Moreover, we examined post-hoc techniques to interpret the CNN model and thus acquire an understanding of the relationships between spectral information and the soil target identified by the model. Looking to the future, the proposed approach can be adopted on the forthcoming hyperspectral orbital sensors to expand the current capabilities of the EO component by estimating more soil attributes with higher predictive performance.

TI  - Small Scale Landslide Detection Using Sentinel-1 Interferometric SAR Coherence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Infrastructure is operational under normal circumstances and is designed to cope with common natural disruptions such as rainfall and snow. Natural hazards can lead to severe problems at the areas where such phenomena occur, but also at neighboring regions as they can make parts of a road network virtually impassable. Landslides are one of the most devastating natural hazards worldwide, triggered by various factors that can be monitored via ground-based and/or satellite-based techniques. Cyprus is in an area of high susceptibility to such phenomena. Currently, extensive field campaigns including geotechnical drilling investigations and geophysical excavations are conducted to monitor land movements, and, at the same time, determine the geological suitability of areas. Active satellite remote sensors, namely Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), have been widely used for detecting and monitoring landslides and other ground deformation phenomena using Earth Observation based techniques. This paper aims to demonstrate how the use of Copernicus open-access and freely distributed datasets along with the exploitation of the open-source processing software SNAP (Sentinel's Application Platform), provided by the European Space Agency, can be used for landslide detection, as in the case study near Pissouri, where a landslide was triggered by heavy rainfall on 15 February 2019, which caused a major disturbance to everyday commuters since the motorway connecting the cities of Limassol and Paphos remained closed for more than a month. The Coherent Change Detection (CCD) methodology was applied successfully by detecting the phenomenon under study accurately, using two indicators (the coherence difference and the normalized coherence difference). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was carried out to measure their performance with the coherence difference having an overall accuracy of 93% and the normalized coherence difference having an overall accuracy of 94.8% for detecting the landslide and non-landslide areas. The probability of landslide detection was 63.2% in the case of the coherence difference and increased to 73.7% for the normalized coherence difference, whereas the probability of false alarm for both indicators was approximately 1%.

TI  - Characterization of Background Temperature Dynamics of a Multitemporal Satellite Scene through Data Assimilation for Wildfire Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of an active fire in an image scene relies on an accurate estimation of the background temperature of the scene, which must be compared to the observed temperature, to decide on the presence of fire. The expected background temperature of a pixel is commonly derived based on spatial-contextual information that can overestimate the background temperature of a fire pixel and therefore results in the omission of a fire event. This paper proposes a method that assimilates brightness temperatures acquired from the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) sensor MSG-SEVIRI into a Diurnal Temperature Cycle (DTC) model. The expected brightness temperatures are observational forecasts derived using the ensemble forecasting approach. The threshold on the difference between the observed and expected temperatures is derived under a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) framework. The detection results are assessed against a reference dataset comprised of MODIS MOD14/MYD14 and EUMETSAT FIR products, and the performance is presented in terms of user's and producer's accuracies, and Precision-Recall and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) graphs. The method has a high detection rate when the data assimilation is implemented with an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and a Sampling Importance Resampling (SIR) particle filter, while the weak-constraint Four-Dimensional Variational Assimilation (4D-Var) has comparatively lower detection and false alarm rates according to the reference dataset. Consideration of the diurnal variation in the background temperature enables the proposed method to detect even low-power fires.

TI  - Flood Proxy Mapping with Normalized Difference Sigma-Naught Index and Shannon's Entropy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall-induced floods often cause significant loss of life as well as damage to infrastructure and crops. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Earth Observation Satellites (EOS) can be used to determine the extent of flooding over large geographical areas. Unlike optical sensors, SAR instruments are suitable for cloudy weather conditions, making them suitable for flood detection and mapping during extreme weather events. In this study, we explore the application of the Normalized Difference Sigma-Naught Index (NDSI) and Shannon's entropy of NDSI (SNDSI) of Sentinel-1 data for open water flooding detection, based on automatic thresholding and Bayesian probability. The proposed methodology was tested using the floods in Sofala province, Mozambique, caused by cyclone Idai on March 14-19 of 2019. Results show that thresholding of the NDSI Vertical Transmit-Horizontal Receive (VH) can produce results with Overall Accuracy above 90%, and Kappa higher than 0.6. Considerable performance improvements were obtained by our thresholding method over the entropy of NDSI, yielding results with Kappa of 0.70-0.77. Additionally, it was found that Weibull distribution can properly describe the properties of flooded pixels within the histogram of SNDSI, which allows us to generate a flood probability raster using a Bayesian approach. The final per-pixel flooding probability is useful to indicate certainty in the classification results. The SNDSI Bayesian model produced an AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) of 0.93-0.97, with cross-polarized data yielding the most accurate results.

TI  - GISand remote sensing techniques for the estimation of dew volume in the Republic of Serbia
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the help of satellite data and numerical geographical information system (GIS) methods, the total capacity of dew volume on the entire territory of the Republic of Serbia was estimated. Multicriteria GIS analysis and satellite detections with the support of methods such as kriging and semi-kriging gave satisfactory results in the present research. After the download of satellite data, they were compared with meteorological data for precipitation, evaporation and air temperature. A very precise grid in 1 x 1 degrees of longitude and latitude was created. The average estimated dew potential for the territory of Serbia is 20-40 mm.year(-1)for the south of the country, 15 mm.year(-1)for the north, 30-50 mm.year(-1)for the central region and 20-30 mm.year(-1)for the east. In most drought regions, it is < 10 mm.year(-1).m(-2). Counties with the largest dew capacity (between 15,200 and 20,000 L) include Borski, Nisavski and Jablanicki in the eastern part of the country, as well as Zlatiborski, Raski and Pec in the western and southern parts, respectively. On the other hand, counties with the lowest dew capacity (2,000-3,000 L) encompass northern parts of Serbia (Sremski, Severno-Banatski, Srednje-Banatski, Juzno-Banatski, Severno-Backi and Zapadno-Backi). The possibility for dew use is particularly strong during the spring. The estimated total capacity of the dew potential for Serbia is 1.5 x 10(7)L. By comparing the obtained data for Serbia, it is concluded that the amount of this type of water resource is not large, but enough for use in agricultural and other economic sectors.

TI  - Isolating Anthropogenic Wetland Loss by Concurrently Tracking Inundation and Land Cover Disturbance across the Mid-Atlantic Region, US
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global trends in wetland degradation and loss have created an urgency to monitor wetland extent, as well as track the distribution and causes of wetland loss. Satellite imagery can be used to monitor wetlands over time, but few efforts have attempted to distinguish anthropogenic wetland loss from climate-driven variability in wetland extent. We present an approach to concurrently track land cover disturbance and inundation extent across the Mid-Atlantic region, United States, using the Landsat archive in Google Earth Engine. Disturbance was identified as a change in greenness, using a harmonic linear regression approach, or as a change in growing season brightness. Inundation extent was mapped using a modified version of the U.S. Geological Survey's Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) algorithm. Annual (2015-2018) disturbance averaged 0.32% (1095 km(2) year(-1)) of the study area per year and was most common in forested areas. While inundation extent showed substantial interannual variability, the co-occurrence of disturbance and declines in inundation extent represented a minority of both change types, totaling 109 km(2) over the four-year period, and 186 km(2), using the National Wetland Inventory dataset in place of the Landsat-derived inundation extent. When the annual products were evaluated with permitted wetland and stream fill points, 95% of the fill points were detected, with most found by the disturbance product (89%) and fewer found by the inundation decline product (25%). The results suggest that mapping inundation alone is unlikely to be adequate to find and track anthropogenic wetland loss. Alternatively, remotely tracking both disturbance and inundation can potentially focus efforts to protect, manage, and restore wetlands.

TI  - Low Orbiting Satellite and Small UAS-Based High-Resolution Imagery Data to Quantify Crop Lodging: A Case Study in Irrigated Spearmint
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional methods for crop lodging assessments need accurate ground observations and tend to be laborious. Lodging assessment methods and accuracy can thus be improved using remote sensing data from small unmanned aerial systems (UASs) and low orbiting satellites (LOSs). With such aim, imagery to assess spearmint crop lodging was acquired using a small UAS at two ground sample distances (GSDs) of 0.01 and 0.03 m. Crop surface model (CSM) and six image color features were extracted from small UAS-based data. These features were then classified into not lodged (NL), partially lodged (PL), and lodged (L) groups. Mean and majority feature classes were obtained for 50 regions of interest (ROI) of size 1 m(2) each. Features were compared with visual crop lodging ratings using Pearson correlation (r) and Cohen's kappa (CK) coefficients. CSM showed higher assessment accuracy with r approximate to 0.85 and CK > 0.60. Mean percentage red (%R) was observed to have the strongest correlation with visual ratings (r = 0.75 and CK = 0.40-0.59) followed by mean percentage blue (%B), both at 0.01- m GSD. The percentage of lodging calculated from %R and %B maps was also contrasted with similar estimates from LOS-based imagery at 3.00-m GSD with no statistical differences found at 5% level.

TI  - Long-Term Displacement Monitoring of Slow Earthflows by Inclinometers and GPS, and Wide Area Surveillance by COSMO-SkyMed Data
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - With reference to two slow earthflows in structurally complex clayey formations of the Italian southern Apennines, this paper shows the results of a long-term displacement monitoring using integrated systems of inclinometers and GPS, and their comparison with PSInSAR data. A fixed-in-place and traversal inclinometer system, first installed in 2004, recorded both the shear displacements along the slip bands, and the internal deformations of the landslide masses. A GPS network of permanent stations and benchmarks, installed in 2006-2007 in 23 strategic points of the slope, allowed for the temporal continuity of displacement monitoring. The two long series of data allowed to evaluate the factor scaling of the PSInSAR COSMO-SkyMed data, although the component of the displacement vector along the line of sight (LOS) was small. PSInSAR data allowed for the monitoring extension to houses and rigid structures that acted as reflectors. The joint data analysis allowed for the comprehension of the main features of the landslides' kinematics.

TI  - Effect of Missing Vines on Total Leaf Area Determined by NDVI Calculated from Sentinel Satellite Data: Progressive Vine Removal Experiments
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application Sentinel-2 images were sensitive to change in the vegetation contained in the pixel. The reduction in the NDVI values was proportional to the reduction in the vegetation, following a linear relationship. The quantitative relationship obtained in this study is valuable since a vineyard, once established, generally loses grapevines each year due to diseases, abiotic stress, etc., so it is important to consider the effect of the missing vines in order to have a correct estimation of the vineyard vigour.Abstract Remote Sensing (RS) allows the estimation of some important vineyard parameters. There are several platforms for obtaining RS information. In this context, Sentinel satellites are a valuable tool for RS since they provide free and regular images of the earth's surface. However, several problems regarding the low-resolution of the imagery arise when using this technology, such as handling mixed pixels that include vegetation, soil and shadows. Under this condition, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) value in a particular pixel is an indicator of the amount of vegetation (canopy area) rather than the NDVI from the canopy (as a vigour expression), but its reliability varies depending on several factors, such as the presence of mixed pixels or the effect of missing vines (a vineyard, once established, generally loses grapevines each year due to diseases, abiotic stress, etc.). In this study, a vine removal simulation (greenhouse experiment) and an actual vine removal (field experiment) were carried out. In the field experiment, the position of the Sentinel-2 pixels was marked using high-precision GPS. Controlled removal of vines from a block of cv. Cabernet Sauvignon was done in four steps. The removal of the vines was done during the summer of 2019, matching with the start of the maximum vegetative growth. The Total Leaf Area (TLA) of each pixel was calculated using destructive field measurements. The operations were planned to have two satellite images available between each removal step. As a result, a strong linear relationship (R-2 = 0.986 and R-2 = 0.72) was obtained between the TLA and NDVI reductions, which quantitatively indicates the effect of the missing vines on the NDVI values.

TI  - Identifying Post-Fire Recovery Trajectories and Driving Factors Using Landsat Time Series in Fire-Prone Mediterranean Pine Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires constitute the most important natural disturbance of Mediterranean forests, driving vegetation dynamics. Although Mediterranean species have developed ecological post-fire recovery strategies, the impacts of climate change and changes in fire regimes may endanger their resilience capacity. This study aims at assessing post-fire recovery dynamics at different stages in two large fires that occurred in Mediterranean pine forests (Spain) using temporal segmentation of the Landsat time series (1994-2018). Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr) was used to derive trajectory metrics from Tasseled Cap Wetness (TCW), sensitive to canopy moisture and structure, and Tasseled Cap Angle (TCA), related to vegetation cover gradients. Different groups of post-fire trajectories were identified through K-means clustering of the Recovery Ratios (RR) from fitted trajectories: continuous recovery, continuous recovery with slope changes, continuous recovery stabilized and non-continuous recovery. The influence of pre-fire conditions, fire severity, topographic variables and post-fire climate on recovery rates for each recovery category at successional stages was analyzed through Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). The modeling results indicated that pine forest recovery rates were highly sensitive to post-fire climate in the mid and long-term and to fire severity in the short-term, but less influenced by topographic conditions (adjusted R-squared ranged from 0.58 to 0.88 and from 0.54 to 0.93 for TCA and TCW, respectively). Recovery estimation was assessed through orthophotos, showing a high accuracy (Dice Coefficient ranged from 0.81 to 0.97 and from 0.74 to 0.96 for TCA and TCW, respectively). This study provides new insights into the post-fire recovery dynamics at successional stages and driving factors. The proposed method could be an approach to model the recovery for the Mediterranean areas and help managers in determining which areas may not be able to recover naturally.

TI  - A New Modeling Approach for Spatial Prediction of Flash Flood with Biogeography Optimized CHAID Tree Ensemble and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods induced by torrential rainfalls are considered one of the most dangerous natural hazards, due to their sudden occurrence and high magnitudes, which may cause huge damage to people and properties. This study proposed a novel modeling approach for spatial prediction of flash floods based on the tree intelligence-based CHAID (Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector)random subspace, optimized by biogeography-based optimization (the CHAID-RS-BBO model), using remote sensing and geospatial data. In this proposed approach, a forest of tree intelligence was constructed through the random subspace ensemble, and, then, the swarm intelligence was employed to train and optimize the model. The Luc Yen district, located in the northwest mountainous area of Vietnam, was selected as a case study. For this circumstance, a flood inventory map with 1866 polygons for the district was prepared based on Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and field surveys with handheld GPS. Then, a geospatial database with ten influencing variables (land use/land cover, soil type, lithology, river density, rainfall, topographic wetness index, elevation, slope, curvature, and aspect) was prepared. Using the inventory map and the ten explanatory variables, the CHAID-RS-BBO model was trained and verified. Various statistical metrics were used to assess the prediction capability of the proposed model. The results show that the proposed CHAID-RS-BBO model yielded the highest predictive performance, with an overall accuracy of 90% in predicting flash floods, and outperformed benchmarks (i.e., the CHAID, the J48-DT, the logistic regression, and the multilayer perception neural network (MLP-NN) models). We conclude that the proposed method can accurately estimate the spatial prediction of flash floods in tropical storm areas.

TI  - Linguistic rhetoric of Soviet discourse: official vs personal register (J. Stalin - A. Dovzhenko)
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the conception of the Sochi Linguistic & Rhetorical School the paper discusses the diglossia of the Soviet discourse employed in the former USSR, distinguishes official and personal registers as well as shows their difference drawing on Joseph Stalin's speech of 31 January 1944 to the Politburo of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks concerning Alexander Dovzhenko's screenplay "Ukraine in Flames" and in the writer's diaries. The comparison reveals a few specific linguistic rhetorical features of cognitive communicative type ontologically characteristic of the Soviet linguistic personality's communicative cognitive activity in a totalitarian state. The cognitive features of Stalin's individual discourse representing the official register and his system of argumentation rest on the significative component of linguistic units, arguments from literature to illustrate the postulates and dogmas of Marxist-Leninist doctrine forming the foundation of the Soviet discourse. It is also found that the official register represented by Stalin's speech is characterized by the following features: 1) repetition; 2) sarcastic remarks; 3) dramatic mutually exclusive contrast of mental spaces ("our own, true in the last resort" and destructed, represented by the opponent's discourse); 4) rigidly adversarial characteristic of the alternative linguistic rhetorical worldview; 5) appeal to the Soviet collective linguistic personality's opinion; 6) ideological translation from one subdiscourse into the other, from personal register into the official one; 7) biased retelling of the discourse regarded as anti-Soviet; 8) appeal to the facts lacking in the discourse under criticism; 9) "ideological editing" taking on the form of peremptory lecturing with consequences threatening the liberty of the person under criticism. The personal register of the Soviet Ukrainian writer Dovzhenko is characterized by a broad interpretation of reality devoid of the "Marxist-Leninist blinds" and a more objective interpretation of the world due to a bigger ratio of denotative references ("evidential arguments" like "I say" and "I heard" etc) and communicative cognitive activity relative to two axiological hierarchies: national and Christian, i.e. the dominance of human values over class morality. It is proved that Dovzhenko's screenplay was criticized within Stalin's official register for its deviation from the cognitive schemas and the model of the Soviet discourse, for the focus on Ukraine and its citizens rather than on class struggle.

TI  - U-Net-Id, an Instance Segmentation Model for Building Extraction from Satellite Images-Case Study in the Joanopolis City, Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, there exists a growing demand for individual building mapping in regions of rapid urban growth in less-developed countries. Most existing methods can segment buildings but cannot discriminate adjacent buildings. Here, we present a new convolutional neural network architecture (CNN) called U-net-id that performs building instance segmentation. The proposed network is trained with WorldView-3 satellite RGB images (0.3 m) and three different labeled masks. The first is the building mask; the second is the border mask, which is the border of the building segment with 4 pixels added outside and 3 pixels inside; and the third is the inner segment mask, which is the segment of the building diminished by 2 pixels. The architecture consists of three parallel paths, one for each mask, all starting with a U-net model. To accurately capture the overlap between the masks, all activation layers of the U-nets are copied and concatenated on each path and sent to two additional convolutional layers before the output activation layers. The method was tested with a dataset of 7563 manually delineated individual buildings of the city of Joanopolis-SP, Brazil. On this dataset, the semantic segmentation showed an overall accuracy of 97.67% and an F1-Score of 0.937 and the building individual instance segmentation showed good performance with a mean intersection over union (IoU) of 0.582 (median IoU = 0.694).

TI  - Capturing ephemeral forest dynamics with hybrid time-series and composite mapping in the Republic of Panama
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring and progressing toward international goals of curbing deforestation and improving livelihoods of people who depend on forests requires nuanced understanding of forests and the processes surrounding deforestation and degradation. Despite rapid improvements in Earth Observation technology, monitoring of tropical forests remains hindered by persistent cloud cover, heterogeneous landscapes, long wet seasons, and small and ephemeral clearings masked by rapid growth. A hybrid method is presented that combines elements of both time-series and compositing approaches to best overcome these obstacles to map forest cover and change in the Republic of Panama based on Landsat imagery. The resulting Panama Vegetation-Cover Time-Series (PVCTS) maps depict forest cover in Panama from 1990 to 2016 at 30 m resolution. Acknowledging the fuzzy boundary between forest and non-forest classes, these maps employ a hierarchical classification scheme that reflects the natural process of regeneration and can accommodate different definitions of forest and deforestation. Classification accuracy is 97-98 % between forest/non-forest categories and 76-81 % for deforestation events. The maps show a slight greening of Panama from 1990 to 2016 caused by expansion of young secondary growth. The annual rate of deforestation in mature forest has remained around -0.6 %/yr, although young forests have matured at a similar rate such that there is no net loss of forest. While estimates of total forest cover are similar to official national estimates depending on forest definition, there is little agreement in location of deforestation events.

TI  - The Study of Ocean Wave and Wave Power Observations by Synthetic Aperture Radar in Nearshore Waters
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on 2 RADARSAT-2 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) SLC (Single Look Complex) data and the cross-spectrum method, the distributions of significant wave heights and mean wave periods of ocean wave were inverted, and the distributions of the wave power density, which can represent the wave power, were calculated. Some comparisons between the results of the SAR and those of the ECMWF (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) dataset were carried out, and the observation ability for the distribution characteristics of wave and wave power by the SAR was studied in detail. The results show that compared with buoys, which are single-point observations, and wave models, which are simulated observations, the SAR is an ideal tool for extensive wave observations in nearshore waters. The advantage of SAR observations is that some fine structure and microcosmic changes in wave and wave power can be found, which helps us understand the internal structure and transformation patterns of wave better. Therefore, the SAR showed extremely extensive application prospects in the field of wave observations. The contributions in this paper will provide some references for researchers aiming for ocean wave detection by remote sensing and promote the application level of SAR in the detection of wave and wave power.

TI  - Quantifying the Effect of Xiluodu Reservoir on the Temperature of the Surrounding Mountains
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - To quantitatively determine the effect of Xiluodu Reservoir on the temperature of the surrounding mountains, the temperature differences between various locations and the reservoir were calculated based on Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) data. Elevation, slope, aspect, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and visual field were selected as the impact factors, and the most significant grid size used to explore the effect of reservoir on the surrounding mountains was determined by spatial analysis and partial correlation analysis. The effect of the Xiluodu Reservoir on the surrounding mountains' temperature was then quantitatively studied while accounting for the effect of water surface width on temperature. The results are summarized as follows. The most significant grid size for determining the influence of Xiluodu Reservoir on the surrounding mountains' temperature is 90 m. The effect range threshold of the entire reservoir on the temperature of the surrounding mountains is approximately 600 m, and the partial correlation coefficient in each buffer area decreases gradually with increasing distance from the reservoir. The effect threshold of the reservoir on the temperature of the surrounding mountains is approximately 1,500 m in the head area with a water surface width approximately 1,000 m, but it is negligible in the tributary area where the width is approximately 60 m.

TI  - Investigation of Transmission Characteristic of O<SUP>+</SUP> 83. 4 nm Dayglow in the Ionosphere
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme Ultraviolet (10 similar to 100 nm) dayglow emission is produced primarily by photoionization excitation and photoelectron impact ionization. Observing extreme ultraviolet dayglow by using space-based remote sensing, we can obtain the information of electron density, ion density and spatial distribution of ionospheric F layer in the daytime. The EUV dayglow remote sensing technology started earlier in foreign countries, especially in Europe, America, Japan and other countries, and have come to maturity now. However, there are very few studies on EUV dayglow remote sensing in China, and the detection of ionosphere is mainly at night. For example, the ionospheric photometer loaded on the D-Star of the FengYun-3 meteorological satellite launched by China in 2017 can obtain the nighttime ionospheric peak electron density. Remote sensing in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission, especially the detection of the radiation characteristics of O+ ion 83. 4 nm in the ionosphere, is an important means to obtain daytime ionospheric radiation characteristics, and is also the research hotspot of ionospheric optical remote sensing in the world. Firstly, we have studied the main radiative transfer theory of EUV dayglow in this paper, and introduces the excitation process, impact ionization process and multiple resonant scattering process. On this basis, we focus on the generation mechanism and radiation transmission characteristics of 83. 4 nm dayglow. O+ 83. 4 nm dayglow is generated by photoionization of the O atoms in the low thermosphere by solar EUV and is the brightest emission in EUV. The altitude distribution of the 83. 4 nm dayglow can provide some information about the density profile of the O+ ions, and by charge neutrality, the electron density, which provide an effective method for ionospheric detection in the daytime. Secondly, we have analyzed the band characteristics of 83. 4 nm dayglow. Based on the Mass Spectrometer Incoherent Scatter (MSIS-00) model, we calculate the initial volume emission rates, the volume emission rates under resonant scattering and limb column emission intensity of 83. 4 nm dayglow emission by using the AURIC vl. 2 model, and then we analyze the correlation with altitude, latitude, solar activity index, geomagnetic activity index and so on. Based on the extreme ultraviolet radiation algorithm, and the particularity of the radiation transmission at O+ ion 83. 4 nm, considering the multiple scattering effects of the radiation, the radiation calculation method of oxygen ion 83. 4 nm dayglow is proposed. Assuming that the ionosphere is electrical neutrality, the O+ density of the ionosphere in the daytime can be inverted by obtaining the EUV dayglow intensity of oxygen ion 83. 4 nm, and then we can obtain the electron density distribution of the ionosphere F layer in the daytime, providing an important basis for studying the radiation transmission characteristics of the daytime ionosphere.

TI  - A Method of Using WRF-Simulated Surface Temperature to Estimate Daily Evapotranspiration
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface temperature is one of the key parameters for estimating regional evapotranspiration (ET) based on the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model using remote sensing data. However, continuous daily remote sensing surface temperature data are often not available due to the weather and environmental conditions. This paper proposed a scheme to obtain reliable ET that estimating ET using WRF-simulated surface skin temperature (TSK) and then modifying the deviation using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This study aims to explore whether the model data can be a viable option when the continuous-time-series remote sensing surface temperature is missing for estimating ET. Comparison results show that the correlation between WRF TSK and the measured temperature of the 2-cm soil (T-s) is better than MODIS land surface temperature (LST) in the study area, while the correlation between MODIS LST and the measured surface radiation temperature (IRT) is better than WRF TSK. The MODIS LST is significantly higher than T-s, and the WRF TSK is closer to T-s than MODIS LST. However, the ET calculated using WRF TSK was not good, exhibiting relatively high ET in the whole area and a poor correlation with the measurements, whereby R-2, RMSE, and the percent bias (PBIAS) were equal to 0.1256, 5.2783 mm, and -202.17%, respectively. According to the principle of land surface process simulation in WRF, this paper proposes using NDVI to modify ET calculated using TSK. The comparison between the modified ET and the measurements exhibited a relatively good correlation, with R-2 = 0.7532, RMSE = 1.0993 mm, and PBIAS = -17.9%. Therefore, the model surface temperature data can be used to estimate continuous-time-series regional ET when NDVI is used to modify the deviation, which indicates the surface temperature data simulated by the WRF Model can become the optional data for estimating ET and compensate for the shortcoming of poor time continuity of remote sensing data, further expanding the application prospects of meteorological model data in the remote sensing field.

TI  - Satellite-Based Observations Reveal Effects of Weather Variation on Rice Phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining detailed data on the spatio-temporal variation in crop phenology is critical to increasing our understanding of agro-ecosystem function, such as their response to weather variation and climate change. It is challenging to collect such data over large areas through field observations. The use of satellite remote sensing data has made phenology data collection easier, although the quality and the utility of such data to understand agro-ecosystem function have not been widely studied. Here, we evaluated satellite data-based estimates of rice phenological stages in California, USA by comparing them with survey data and with predictions by a temperature-driven phenology model. We then used the satellite data-based estimates to quantify the crop phenological response to changes in weather. We used time-series of MODIS satellite data and PhenoRice, a rule-based rice phenology detection algorithm, to determine annual planting, heading and harvest dates of paddy rice in California between 2002 and 2017. At the state level, our satellite-based estimates of rice phenology were very similar to the official survey data, particularly for planting and harvest dates (RMSE = 3.8-4.0 days). Satellite based observations were also similar to predictions by the DD10 temperature-driven phenology model. We analyzed how the timing of these phenological stages varied with concurrent temperature and precipitation over this 16-year time period. We found that planting was earlier in warm springs (-1.4 days degrees C-1 for mean temperature between mid-April and mid-May) and later in wet years (5.3 days 100 mm(-1) for total precipitation from March to April). Higher mean temperature during the pre-heading period of the growing season advanced heading by 2.9 days degrees C-1 and shortened duration from planting to heading by 1.9 days degrees C-1. The entire growing season was reduced by 3.2 days degrees C-1 because of the increased temperature during the rice season. Our findings confirm that satellite data can be an effective way to estimate variations in rice phenology and can provide critical information that can be used to improve understanding of agricultural responses to weather variation.

TI  - Investigation of the ground displacement in Saint Petersburg, Russia, using multiple-track differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global sea level rise and local land subsidence might exacerbate the risk of flooding in coastal plains. Among other cities, this is also the case for the high-latitude city of St. Petersburg, which has long been threatened by flood events. To protect the urban area from storm surges, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1978 approved the construction of the 25 km long Flood Prevention Facility Complex (FPFC), which was completed in 2011. The risk of flooding in the city area of St. Petersburg is amplified by the fact that large sections of the coastal area have been reclaimed from the sea. In this study, we investigate the temporal evolution of the ground displacement in St. Petersburg. To this end, we perform an extended analysis based on the application of a simplified version of the differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique, known as the minimum acceleration (MinA) approach. The MinA algorithm is a multi-satellite/multi-track interferometric combination technique that allows working with multiple sets of SAR images. The method allowed generation of time series of two-dimensional (2-D) (i.e. East-West and Up-Down) deformation of the terrain by processing two sequences of Sentinel-1A/B (S-1A/B) SAR images acquired from 2016 to 2018, along the ascending and descending flight passes. The Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) algorithm was independently applied to the two sets of SAR data to generate the relevant Line-Of-Sight (LOS) -projected ground deformation time series. Subsequently, the LOS-projected deformation products were geocoded and jointly combined. The results indicate that the deformation in the city is predominantly vertical (i.e. it is subsiding) with a maximum subsidence rate of about 20 mm/year corresponding to the newly sea-reclaimed lands. Finally, the error budget of the retrieved 2-D deformation time series has also been addressed.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Wetland Landcover Changes of Poyang Lake Derived from Landsat and HJ-1A/B Data in the Dry Season from 1973-2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As China's largest freshwater lake and an important wintering ground for white cranes in Asia, the Poyang Lake wetland has unique ecological value. However, wetland cover types have changed dynamically and have attracted the attention of society and researchers over the past few decades. To obtain detailed knowledge and understanding of the long-term landcover dynamics of Poyang Lake and the associated driving forces, Landsat and HJ-1A/B images (31 images) were used to acquire classification and frequency maps of Poyang Lake in the dry season from 1973-2019 based on the random forest (RF) algorithm. In addition, the driving forces were discussed according to the Geodetector model. The results showed that the coverage of water and mudflat showed opposite trends from 1987-2019. Water and vegetation exhibited a significant decreasing trend from 1981-2003 and from 1996-2004 (p < 0.01), respectively. A phenomenon of vegetation expanding from west to east was found, and the expansion areas were mainly concentrated in the central zone of Poyang Lake, while vegetation in the northern mountainous area of Songmen (region 1) and eastern Songmen Mountain (region 2), showed a significantly expanded trend (R-2 > 0.6, p < 0.01) during the five-decade period. The year-long dominant distribution of water occurred mainly in the two deltas formed by the Raohe and Tongjin rivers and the Fuhe and Xinjiang rivers, with deep water. In the 1973-2003 and 2003-2019 periods, a total of 313.522 km(2) of water turned into swamp and mudflat and 478.453 km(2) of swamp and mudflat transitioned into vegetation, respectively. Elevation and temperature appeared to be the main factors affecting the regional wetland evolution in the dry season and should be considered in the management of Poyang Lake. The findings of this work provide detailed information for spatial-temporal landcover changes of Poyang Lake, which could help policymakers to formulate scientific and appropriate policies and achieve restoration of the Poyang Lake wetland.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution of urban carbon emission performance in China and prediction of future trends
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change resulting from CO2 emissions has become an important global environmental issue in recent years. Improving carbon emission performance is one way to reduce carbon emissions. Although carbon emission performance has been discussed at the national and industrial levels, city-level studies are lacking due to the limited availability of statistics on energy consumption. In this study, based on city-level remote sensing data on carbon emissions in China from 1992-2013, we used the slacks-based measure of super-efficiency to evaluate urban carbon emission performance. The traditional Markov probability transfer matrix and spatial Markov probability transfer matrix were constructed to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of urban carbon emission performance in China for the first time and predict long-term trends in carbon emission performance. The results show that urban carbon emission performance in China steadily increased during the study period with some fluctuations. However, the overall level of carbon emission performance remains low, indicating great potential for improvements in energy conservation and emission reduction. The spatial pattern of urban carbon emission performance in China can be described as "high in the south and low in the north," and significant differences in carbon emission performance were found between cities. The spatial Markov probabilistic transfer matrix results indicate that the transfer of carbon emission performance in Chinese cities is stable, resulting in a "club convergence" phenomenon. Furthermore, neighborhood backgrounds play an important role in the transfer between carbon emission performance types. Based on the prediction of long-term trends in carbon emission performance, carbon emission performance is expected to improve gradually over time. Therefore, China should continue to strengthen research and development aimed at improving urban carbon emission performance and achieving the national energy conservation and emission reduction goals. Meanwhile, neighboring cities with different neighborhood backgrounds should pursue cooperative economic strategies that balance economic growth, energy conservation, and emission reductions to realize low-carbon construction and sustainable development.

TI  - Evaluation of ecological risk of heavy metals in watershed soils in the Daxia River Basin
T2  - AIP ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed ecological risk is affected by the environment, climate, and human activity. In this study, the Daxia River Basin in northwestern China was regarded as the research area. The remote heavy metal ecological risk assessment model of the basin was constructed using remote sensing data, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and environmental factors. The results show that different areas of the basin have different ecological risk levels depending on the geographical location and the level of human activity. A multivariate linear relationship exists between the NDVI and heavy metal content, precipitation, and temperature, and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.866 was derived at a significance level of P < 0.01. There was a nonlinear relationship between the average heavy metal content and the Health Risk Index. The model correlation coefficient equals 0.893 at P < 0.01. The results of the study further demonstrate that risk assessment of the basin can be carried out using remote sensing information and environmental meteorological factors. It also reveals that establishing vegetation helps inhibit the migration of heavy metals in the soil.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of MSG Downward Shortwave Radiation Product Under Clear-Sky Condition
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Downward shortwave radiation (DSR) plays a very important role in land surface radiation budget and land-surface processes modeling. Although there are several radiation products developed based on satellite observations, the coarse spatial resolution greatly limits their applications in regional or local scales. To get high-resolution and accuracy-reliable DSR data, a practical downscaling method for clear-sky condition was proposed by using the scale-invariant relationship of the radiative transfer process to decompose the global radiation into direct and diffuse components at horizontal level and conducting topographic correction finally. Based on this method, the time series of Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) DSR product covering part of Navarre province in the northern Spain was disaggregated into 30-m level with the use of the ALOS World 3D-30m digital elevation model (DEM) data. The downscaled results not only presented high spatial heterogeneity with respect to the changes in surface topography but also showed reasonable values at different times over different days in one year. The in situ validation indicated that the hourly downscaled DSR had quite high correlation with the surface measurements at each day with the coefficient of determination above 0.97 and the root-mean-squared error lower than 35 W/m(2). Overall, the evaluation allows concluding on the proposed method that can be a good way to get reliable and high-resolution DSR data from coarse-resolution DSR product under clear-sky condition.

TI  - Mapping coastal wetlands of China using time series Landsat images in 2018 and Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands, composed of coastal vegetation and non-vegetated tidal flats, play critical roles in biodiversity conservation, food production, and the global economy. Coastal wetlands in China are changing quickly due to land reclamation, aquaculture, industrialization, and urbanization. However, accurate and updated maps of coastal wetlands (including vegetation and tidal flats) in China are unavailable, and the detailed spatial distribution of coastal wetlands is unknown. Here, we developed a new pixel- and phenology-based algorithm to identify and map coastal wetlands in China for 2018 using time series Landsat imagery (2798 ETM + /OLI images) and the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The resultant map had a very high overall accuracy (98%). There were 7474.6 km(2) of coastal wetlands in China in 2018, which included 5379.8 km(2) of tidal flats, 1856.4 km(2) of deciduous wetlands, and 238.3 km(2) of evergreen wetlands. Jiangsu Province had the largest area of coastal wetlands in China, followed by Shandong, Fujian, and Zhejiang Provinces. Our study demonstrates the high potential of time series Landsat images, pixel- and phenology-based algorithm, and GEE for mapping coastal wetlands at large scales. The resultant coastal wetland maps at 30-m spatial resolution serve as the most current dataset for sustainable management, ecological assessments, and conservation of coastal wetlands in China.

TI  - Modeling urban growth by coupling localized spatio-temporal association analysis and binary logistic regression
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and forecasting the dynamics of urban growth can be helpful for making sustainable land-use policies. Computing models can simulate urban growth but many require extensive data input, which cannot be always met. Here we proposed coupling localized spatio-temporal association (LSTA) analysis and binary logistic regression (BLR) to model urban growth from historical land cover configurations. An indicator called neighborhood aggregation index (NAI) was defined first to measure configuration enrichment for any land cover type under spatial-and-temporal contexts. Multiple NAIs for different land cover types were taken into the proposed LSTA-BLR model to project future urban growth. A case study was selected in Wuhan, China where land covers were classified for each year during 2014-2017 based on the Landsat Imagery from Google Earth Engine. Urban growth from the year 2016 to 2017 was extracted from the classified land cover maps as the dependent variable which was modeled by the LSTA-BLR using predictors of the NAIs from the previous years. The LSTA-BLR models were tested under different neighborhood sizes (3 x 3, 5 x 5, 7 x 7, 9 x 9, and 11 x 11) and time windows (2016, 2015-2016, and 2014-2016). Results indicated that the best accuracy of the modeled urban growth reached 72.9% under the setting of 5 x 5 neighborhood size and time window 2014-2016. Urbanization was most likely to occur close to previously urbanized areas and unlikely near the neighborhood of enriched forest and water bodies. The neighborhood size affected the modeled result and the time window defining the NAIs had the most significant impact on model performance. We conclude that prior land cover configurations should be integrated for mapping future urban growth and the proposed LSTA-BLR model can serve as a useful tool to understand the near-future urbanization process based on the historical land cover configurations.

TI  - Basal Channel Extraction and Variation Analysis of Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden Ice Shelf in Greenland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ice shelf controls the ice flow and affects the rates of sea level rise. Its stability is affected by the basal channel to some extent. However, despite its importance, high spatiotemporal variation in the length of the basal channels and influencing factors remain poorly characterized. Here, we present evidence from satellite and airborne remote-sensing for the basal channel beneath the floating Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden (79 North Glacier) ice shelf in Northeast Greenland. We observe the surface depression of the ice shelf using IceBridge, which is an ongoing NASA mission to monitor changes in polar ice. We find that the basal channel corresponds with the depression. Temporal and spatial changes of the basal channels from 2000 to 2018 are obtained annually. The results show that the main influencing factor affecting the basal channel is the sea surface temperature (SST), and the major area of the channel length change is found in the midstream area of the ice shelf.

AB  - The dynamics of land surface temperature (LST) and its correlation with vegetation are crucial to understanding the effects of global climate change. This study intended to retrieve the LST of China, based on the NOAA-AVHRR images, by using a split-window algorithm. The spatiotemporal variation of LST, Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the correlation between the two was investigated in China from 1982-2016. Moreover, eight scenarios were established to explore the driving forces in vegetation variation. Results indicated that the LST increased by 0.06 degrees C/year in nearly 81.1% of the study areas. The NDVI with an increasing rate of 0.1%/year and occupied 58.6% of the study areas. By contrast, 41.4% of the study areas with a decreasing rate of 0.7 x 10(-3)/year, was mainly observed in northern China. The correlation coefficients between NDVI and LST were higher than that between NDVI and precipitation, and the increase in LST could stimulate vegetation growth. Most regions of China have experienced significant warming over the past decades, specifically, desertification happens in northern China, because it is getting drier. The synergy of LST and precipitation is the primary cause of vegetation dynamics. Therefore, long-term monitoring of LST and NDVI is necessary to better understand the adaptation of the terrestrial ecosystem to global climate change.

TI  - Integration of Microwave and Optical/Infrared Derived Datasets from Multi-Satellite Products for Drought Monitoring
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is among the most common natural disasters in North China. In order to monitor the drought of the typically arid areas in North China, this study proposes an innovative multi-source remote sensing drought index called the improved Temperature-Vegetation-Soil Moisture Dryness Index (iTVMDI), which is based on passive microwave remote sensing data from the FengYun (FY)3B-Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) and optical and infrared data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and takes the Shandong Province of China as the research area. The iTVMDI integrated the advantages of microwave and optical remote sensing data to improve the original Temperature-Vegetation-Soil Moisture Dryness Index (TVMDI) model, and was constructed based on the Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), land surface temperature (LST), and downscaled soil moisture (SM) as the three-dimensional axes. The global land data assimilation system (GLDAS) SM, meteorological data and surface water were used to evaluate and verify the monitoring results. The results showed that iTVMDI had a higher negative correlation with GLDAS SM (R = -0.73) than TVMDI (R = -0.55). Additionally, the iTVMDI was well correlated with both precipitation and surface water, with mean correlation coefficients (R) of 0.65 and 0.81, respectively. Overall, the accuracy of drought estimation can be significantly improved by using multi-source satellite data to measure the required surface variables, and the iTVMDI is an effective method for monitoring the spatial and temporal variations of drought.

TI  - Ecological worldview, agricultural or natural resource-based activities, and geography affect perceived importance of ecosystem services
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding public perceptions of the importance of ecosystem services (ES) is crucial for the development and communication of sustainable management and policies. Yet public perspectives on ES and their sociocultural and geographic patterns are not well understood. This study asks: Which ES are perceived as more or less important by the general public?; Which ES are considered most similar when the public are asked to evaluate the importance of specific water, agricultural and natural resources ES?; And, what individual and geographic factors are associated with perceived importance of different ES? We conducted a survey of residents in an urban and agricultural watershed in the U.S. Upper Midwest (n = 1136). This study asked respondents about a wider range of ES than is typical, and examines how ecological worldviews influence the perceived importance of ES. Respondents rated regional provision of drinking and surface water quality, clean lakes and rivers for wildlife, and a reliable supply of drinking and surface water most important. Those with a stronger ecological worldview tended to rate natural areas and processes as more important and agricultural products as less important than respondents with a more anthropocentric worldview. Perceived importance of various ES was also predicted by other individual-level factors relating to livelihood, outdoor recreation, and proximity to lakes, forests and agriculture. For example, respondents with livelihoods dependent on agriculture rated agricultural products and rural character highly. These findings bolster the case for more context-specific assessments of public importance ratings for environmental benefits to inform planning and management.

TI  - Differences in the Effects of Storms on Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) in Boreal Lakes during an Early Summer Storm and an Autumn Storm
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In boreal lakes, increased precipitation events have been linked to increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), however the effects of seasonal differences on DOC and how this may impact storm response remain unclear. We evaluated DOC concentration and a set of DOC quality metrics during an early summer storm and an autumn storm on a suite of six lakes in Acadia National Park in Maine, USA. to better understand differences in seasonal storm responses. Our results revealed differences in the response of DOC quality metrics to an early summer versus an autumn storm, with changes in DOC quality metrics varying by storm and lake features. During the early summer storm, we observed greater changes in various DOC quality metrics in deep lakes with longer residence times, whereas during the autumn storm, lakes with large watershed area to lake area ratios experienced the greatest changes. Land cover was highly correlated with changing DOC quality metrics in the early summer storm but did not play a significant role in the autumn storm response. Our research provides evidence of seasonal differences in the effects of storms on boreal lakes, which are ultimately mediated by a combination of lake and watershed characteristics as well as seasonal differences in climate such as solar radiation and antecedent weather conditions.

TI  - Validation of POLDER GRASP aerosol optical retrieval over China using SONET observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring fine mode aerosol pollutants is one of priorities in national environmental programs. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and fine mode AOD are key parameters for estimation of particulate matter. POLDER/GRASP retrieval provides probably the most detailed aerosol products globally for 2005 - 2013. Current studies are focused on understanding the value of new satellite products for potential monitoring of air quality over China. As part of this objective, the quantitative evaluation of the products over China, a statistical comparison of total AOD, fine mode AOD and Fine Mode Fraction (FMF) with Sun-Sky Radiometer Observation Network (SONET) products is conducted. Two of available POLDER aerosol products: GRASP "models" and "high-precision" were evaluated at 8 SONET sites over China in this study. The results show the best agreement of the total AOD at 490 nm from "models" approach with AOD (500 nm) from SONET with correlation coefficient of similar to 0.96, slope of similar to 0.9, RMSE of 0.14 and bias (intercept) of 0.04, with about 76% of retrievals inside of Gfrac ranges. The validation results of the fine mode AOD at 490 nm with AOD the fine mode SONET-SDA product (500 nm) are quite comparable for both "high-precision" and "models" approaches, with slightly better results for "high-precision" data showing correlation coefficient of similar to 0.95, slope of similar to 0.78, RMSE of 0.14 and bias (intercept) of 0.07, with about 68% of retrievals inside of Gfrac ranges. The analysis is demonstrated that POLDER/GRASP results are one of most suitable aerosol products for characterization of FMF (Fine Mode Fraction) of aerosol. For example, compared with MODIS, the FMF from POLDER/GRASP is significantly closer to SONET-SDA FMF, with Gfrac increasing from 16.75% (MODIS) to 62.35% (POLDER/GRASP). Moreover, there is a clear similarity of spatial distribution of the fine mode AOD from GRASP with ground-level PM2.5 observations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Hyperspectral-Physiological Phenomics System: Measuring Diurnal Transpiration Rates and Diurnal Reflectance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel hyperspectral-physiological system that monitors plants dynamic response to abiotic alterations was developed. The system is a sensor-to-plant platform which can determine the optimal time of day during which physiological traits can be successfully identified via spectral means. The directly measured traits include momentary and daily transpiration rates throughout the daytime and daily and periodical plant weight loss and gain. The system monitored and evaluated pepper plants response to varying levels of potassium fertilization. Significant momentary transpiration rates differences were found between the treatments during 07:00-10:00 and 14:00-17:00. The simultaneous frequently measured high-resolution spectral data provided the means to correlate the two measured data sets. Significant correlation coefficients between the spectra and momentary transpiration rates resulted with a selection of three bands (rho 523, rho 697 and rho 818nm) that were used to capture transpiration rate differences using a normalized difference formula during the morning, noon and the afternoon. These differences also indicated that the best results are not always obtained when spectral (remote or proximal) measurements are typically preformed around noon (when solar illumination is the highest). Valuable information can be obtained when the spectral measurements are timed according to the plants' dynamic physiological status throughout the day, which may vary among plant species and should be considered when planning remote sensing data acquisition.

TI  - Coastal Wetland Mapping Using Ensemble Learning Algorithms: A Comparative Study of Bagging, Boosting and Stacking Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are a critical component of the coastal landscape that are increasingly threatened by sea level rise and other human disturbance. Periodically mapping wetland distribution is crucial to coastal ecosystem management. Ensemble algorithms (EL), such as random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM) algorithms, are now commonly applied in the field of remote sensing. However, the performance and potential of other EL methods, such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and bagged trees, are rarely compared and tested for coastal wetland mapping. In this study, we applied the three most widely used EL techniques (i.e., bagging, boosting and stacking) to map wetland distribution in a highly modified coastal catchment, the Manning River Estuary, Australia. Our results demonstrated the advantages of using ensemble classifiers to accurately map wetland types in a coastal landscape. Enhanced bagging decision trees, i.e., classifiers with additional methods to increasing ensemble diversity such as RF and weighted subspace random forest, had comparably high predictive power. For the stacking method evaluated in this study, our results are inconclusive, and further comprehensive quantitative study is encouraged. Our findings also suggested that the ensemble methods were less effective at discriminating minority classes in comparison with more common classes. Finally, the variable importance results indicated that hydro-geomorphic factors, such as tidal depth and distance to water edge, were among the most influential variables across the top classifiers. However, vegetation indices derived from longer time series of remote sensing data that arrest the full features of land phenology are likely to improve wetland type separation in coastal areas.

TI  - Magnetic Resonance Sentinel Lymph Node Imaging and Magnetometer-Guided Intraoperative Detection in Penile Cancer, using Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles: First Results
T2  - UROLOGIA INTERNATIONALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In penile cancer, lymph node (LN) metastasis is the main known prognostic factor that affects survival. Inguinal sentinel LN (SLN) dissection (sLND) using radioactive marking is recommended by the European Association of Urology guidelines to evaluate the nodal status in clinically node-negative penile cancer (cN0; >= pT1, G2). Dependence on radioisotopes limits the application of this procedure to small parts of the developed world, and imposes restrictions on hospital logistics. To overcome these issues, SLN visualization using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetometer-guided detection after intraprostatic injection of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) has been successfully applied in prostate cancer. Here, we present the first results of magnetic sLND in penile cancer. After peritumoral SPION injection, MR SLN imaging and magnetometer-guided sLND were performed in one cN0 penile cancer patient. Another patient underwent magnetometer-guided sLND only. In the first case, 5 SLNs could be visualized on MRI and intraoperatively detected by magnetometer-guided sLND. In the second patient, 3 SLNs could be detected by magnetic sLND. Neither patient exhibited adverse events attributable to SPION-injection. In conclusion, SPION-guided SLN identification using MRI and a handheld magnetometer is feasible and could provide a radiation-free technique for SLN identification in penile cancer. For further clarification, a multicenter study should be carried out.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Geologists employ high-spatial-resolution (HR) remote sensing (RS) data for many diverse applications as they effectively reflect detailed geological information, enabling high-quality and efficient geological surveys. Applications of HR RS data to geological and related fields have grown recently. HR optical remote sensing data are widely used in geological hazard assessment, seismic monitoring, mineral exploitation, glacier monitoring, and mineral information extraction due to high accuracy and clear object features. By reviewing these applications, we can better understand the results of previous studies and more effectively use the latest data and methods to efficiently extract key geological information. Compared with optical satellite images, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images are stereoscopic and exhibit clear relief, strong performance, and good detection of terrain, landforms, and other information. SAR images have been applied to seismic mechanism research, volcanic monitoring, topographic deformation, and fault analysis. Furthermore, a multi-standard maturity analysis of the geological applications of HR images reveals that optical remote sensing data are superior to radar data for mining, geological disaster, lithologic, and volcanic applications, but inferior for earthquake, glacial, and fault applications. Therefore, it is necessary for geological remote sensing research to be truly multi-disciplinary or inter-disciplinary, ensuring more detailed and efficient surveys through cross-linking with other disciplines. Moreover, the recent application of deep learning technology to remote sensing data extraction has improved the capabilities of automatic processing and data analysis with HR images.

TI  - Indicator system construction and health assessment of wetland ecosystem-Taking Hongze Lake Wetland, China as an example
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland is one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, a unique habitat for creatures. However, nearly half of the world's wetlands have deteriorated and disappeared in the past 100 years due to human disturbance, and the wetlands are still in a situation of continuous degradation. Current wetland evaluation cannot reveal spatial heterogeneity and its changes within the wetland. Therefore, based on remote sensing technology and landscape index, this study constructed a wetland health indicator system consisting of 12 indicators and used analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to calculate their weights. Using remote sensing data, experimental data and auxiliary data, this indicator system was applied to the Hongze Lake wetland in Jiangsu Province, China and the spatial pattern of health status was mapped. The health index of the edge of Hongze Lake is relatively lower, and the interior is healthier. The whole health index is 5.63. This study indicated that the wetland health assessment methodology proposed can effectively evaluate the spatial pattern of wetland ecosystem health and provide technical support for the protection and restoration of wetlands.

TI  - A spatiotemporal deep fusion model for merging satellite and gauge precipitation in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), numerous models have been developed for merging satellite and gauge precipitation. However, most established merging methods consider the spatial or temporal correlation between satellite data and rain gauge data separately, and the produced merged precipitation is still limited by low spatial resolution and regional inaccuracy. In this study, a deep fusion model is proposed to merge the TRMM 3B42 V7 satellite data, rain gauge data and thermal infrared images by exploiting their spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously. Specifically, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is combined with a long-short-term memory network (LSTM), where the spatial characteristics of satellite, rain gauge and thermal infrared data are extracted by CNN, while their time dependence is captured by LSTM. Experiment results on 796 rain gauges in China show that the proposed CNN-LSTM model outperforms the comparative models (CNN, LSTM, Multi-Layer Perception). It can improve the accuracy of the original TRMM data in China (reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) by 17.0% and 14.7%, respectively and increasing the Correlation Coefficient to 0.72), even for different precipitation intensities and gauge sparse regions. Finally, a dataset of merged daily precipitation from 2001 to 2005 with a higher resolution of 0.05 degrees and higher accuracy over China is produced. This study provides a useful tool and a valuable dataset for QPE in China, which would benefit water research and water resource management.

TI  - Integration of TanDEM-X and SRTM DEMs and Spectral Imagery to Improve the Large-Scale Detection of Opencast Mining Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) is a key variable of the Earth's system and has become an important indicator to evaluate the impact of human activities on the Earth's ecosystems. With the increasing demand of mine resources, widespread opencast mining has led to significant changes in LULC and caused substantial damage to the environment. An efficient approach of detecting mining activities at large scales is of critical importance in mitigating their potential impacts on downstream settlements and in assessing LULC characteristics. In this study, we present a novel approach for enabling large-scale automatic detection of opencast mining areas by integrating multitemporal digital elevation models (DEMs, including the SRTM DEM and the recently released TanDEM-X DEM) and multispectral imagery in object-based image analysis and random forest (RF) algorithms. A sequence of data preparation, image segmentation, threshold analysis, calculation of metrics, and influence factor regulation was developed and tested on the Landsat 8 sample dataset in Inner Mongolia in China, which is a mineral-rich area. Aside from spectral metrics, such as brightness and reflectance value, introduced topographical features enhanced the modeling and classification significantly, and the overall performance is greatly influenced by feature selection (the out-of-bag error rate in the RF algorithm is 7.54% for the integrated DEM method in comparison with 12.70% for the only-optical images method). The integrated use of spectral imagery and multitemporal DEMs reveals that the identified mining area is about 1100 km(2) in the study area and period, and the topographic changes of opencast mining in terms of elevation difference is between -258 and 162 m. The results show that the method can map the locations and extents of mining areas automatically from spectral and DEM data and can potentially be applied to larger areas.

TI  - Mapping Annual Land Disturbance and Reclamation in a Surface Coal Mining Region Using Google Earth Engine and the LandTrendr Algorithm: A Case Study of the Shengli Coalfield in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The development and utilization of mining resources are basic requirements for social and economic development. Both open-pit mining and underground mining have impacts on land, ecology, and the environment. Of these, open-pit mining is considered to have the greatest impact due to the drastic changes wrought on the original landform and the disturbance to vegetation. As awareness of environmental protection has grown, land reclamation has been included in the mining process. In this study, we used the Shengli Coalfield in the eastern steppe region of Inner Mongolia to demonstrate a mining and reclamation monitoring process. We combined the Google Earth Engine platform with time series Landsat images and the LandTrendr algorithm to identify and monitor mining disturbances to grassland and land reclamation in open-pit mining areas of the coalfield between 2003 and 2019. Pixel-based trajectories were used to reconstruct the temporal evolution of vegetation, and sequential Landsat archive data were used to achieve accurate measures of disturbances to vegetation. The results show that: (1) the proposed method can be used to determine the years in which vegetation disturbance and recovery occurred with accuracies of 86.53% and 78.57%, respectively; (2) mining in the Shengli mining area resulted in the conversion of 89.98 km(2) of land from grassland, water, etc., to barren earth, and only 23.54 km(2) was reclaimed, for a reclamation rate of 26.16%; and (3) the method proposed in this paper can achieve fast, efficient identification of surface mining land disturbances and reclamation, and has the potential to be applied to other similar areas.

TI  - Responses of dissolved oxygen to Deep Depression BOB 04 based on satellite and Bio-Argo observations in the Bay of Bengal
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work explores the responses of subsurface dissolved oxygen (DO) to -Wind Pump" impacts of Deep Depression (DD) BOB 04 (2014) with a pre-existing cyclonic eddy based on satellite and Bio-Argo observations in the central Bay of Bengal. Results show the combined influence of the pre-existing cyclonic eddy and DD BOB 04 shoaled the oxycline from 48 m to the shallowest depth 32 m two days after the DD BOB 04. With the pre-existing cyclonic eddy, BOB 04 induced DO decrease in the subsurface for a long time of 18 days. The strong saline stratification suppressed the chlorophyll enhancement along the DD track after its passage. However, this weak DD caused the significant subsurface DO decrease owing to the upwelling. This hovered DD with a pre-existing cyclonic eddy played an important role in governing the boundary of oxygen minimum zone.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - To solve the problems related to the assessment of groundwater potential in small-scale areas or small arid bedrock island areas in the field of groundwater potential assessment via remote sensing technology based on fuzzy assessment methodology, we used maps, DEM data, GF-1 satellite data, and so on, employing Wailingding Island in the Pearl River estuary as the study area. Then, we used a lithology index, relief index, slope index, vegetation fraction index, land temperature index, water density index, and soil humidity index as extraction indices. Next, we assessed the groundwater potential of this island. We obtained the results of the level charts of groundwater potential assessment in this area based on the RS fuzzy assessment method. The results were verified according to the water flow rate of the wells. Finally, we determined the distribution of groundwater in the area. This study is significant for guiding the exploitation and utilization of groundwater in small islands.

TI  - Tree Species (Genera) Identification with GF-1 Time-Series in A Forested Landscape, Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are the most important component of terrestrial ecosystem; the accurate mapping of tree species is helpful for the management of forestry resources. Moderate- and high-resolution multispectral images have been commonly utilized to identify regional tree species in forest ecosystem, but the accuracy of recognition is still unsatisfactory. To enhance the forest mapping accuracy, this study integrated the land surface phenological metrics and text features of forest canopy on tree species identification based on Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide field of view (WFV) and time-series images (36 10-day NDVI data), conducted at a forested landscape in Harqin Banner, Northeast China in 2017. The dominant tree species include Pinus tabulaeformis, Larix gmelinii, Populus davidiana, Betula platyphylla, and Quercus mongolica in the study region. The result of forest mapping derived from a 10-day dataset was also compared with the outcome based upon a commonly utilized 30-day dataset in tree species identification. The results indicate that tree species identification accuracy is significantly (p < 0.05) improved with higher temporal resolution (10-day, 79.4%) of images than commonly used monthly data (30-day, 76.14%), and the accuracy can be further increased to 85.13% with a combination of the information derived from principal component analysis (PCA) transformation, phenological metrics (standing for the information of growing season) and texture features. The integration of higher dimensional NDVI data, vegetation growth dynamics and feature of canopy simultaneously will be beneficial to map tree species at the landscape scale.

TI  - Exploring Dynamic Change of the Tidal Flat Aquaculture Area in the Shandong Peninsula (China) using Multitemporal Landsat Imagery (1990-2015)
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the global distribution of tidal flat aquaculture has undergone great changes under climate change and economic development. In this study, the Shandong Peninsula in northeastern China was selected as the study area. Tidal flat aquaculture was extracted from multitemporal remote sensing data (TM and ETM+) between 1990 and 2015. The dynamic change of tidal flat aquaculture area and the reasons for spatial distribution variations were then analyzed. The results showed that: tidal flat aquaculture area in the Shandong Peninsula increased steadily by 1477.85 km(2) (from 638.50 km(2) to 2116.35 km(2)) between 1990 and 2015 at a rate of 59.70 km(2).yr(-1). The tidal flat aquaculture area in the Yellow River Delta accounted for 27.06% of the tidal flat aquaculture area in the Shandong Peninsula in 1990, increasing to 72.27% in 2015. Due to the influence of sea reclamation, tourism development, and other anthropogenic activities, the aquaculture area in Jiaozhou Bay gradually decreased from 14.45% in 1990 to 2.42% in 2015 shifting the geometric center of gravity for aquaculture on the peninsula from the southeast to the northwest. The spatial distribution was mainly influenced by coastal geology, landforms, and geomorphology. The Yellow River Delta was a key area for tidal flat aquaculture development in the Shandong Peninsula. Effective planning and management are critical to promoting sustainable development of tidal flat aquaculture.

TI  - Geolocation Accuracy Assessment of Himawari-8/AHI Imagery for Application to Terrestrial Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advancements in new generation geostationary satellites have facilitated the application of their datasets to terrestrial monitoring. In this application, geolocation accuracy is an essential issue because land surfaces are generally heterogeneous. In the case of the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8, geometric correction of the Himawari Standard Data provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA data) was conducted using thermal infrared band with 2 km spatial resolution. Based on JMA data, the Center for Environmental Remote Sensing (CEReS) at Chiba University applied a further geometric correction using a visible band with 500 m spatial resolution and released a dataset (CEReS data). JMA data target more general users mainly for meteorological observations, whereas CEReS data aim at terrestrial monitoring for more precise geolocation accuracy. The objectives of this study are to clarify the temporal and spatial variations of geolocation errors in these two datasets and assess their stability for unexpected large misalignment. In this study, the temporal tendencies of the relative geolocation difference between the two datasets were analyzed, and temporal fluctuations of band 3 reflectances of JMA data and CEReS data at certain fixed sites were investigated. A change in the geolocation trend and occasional shifts greater than 2 pixels were found in JMA data. With improved image navigation performance, the geolocation difference was decreased in CEReS data, suggesting the high temporal stability of CEReS data. Overall, JMA data showed an accuracy of less than 2 pixels with the spatial resolution of band 3. When large geolocation differences were observed, anomalies were also detected in the reflectance of JMA data. Nevertheless, CEReS data successfully corrected the anomalous errors and achieved higher geolocation accuracy in general. As CEReS data are processed during the daytime due to the availability of visible bands, we suggest the use of CEReS data for effective terrestrial monitoring during the daytime.

TI  - Improved Landsat-Based Water and Snow Indices for Extracting Lake and Snow Cover/Glacier in the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying water and snow cover/glaciers (SCG) accurately is of great importance for monitoring different water resources in the Tibetan Plateau. However, discriminating between water and SCG remains a difficult task because of their similar spectral characteristic according to the physical principles of remote sensing. To efficiently distinguish different kinds of water resources automatically, here we proposed two new indices including: (i) the normalized difference water index with no SCG information (NDWIns) to extract lake water and suppress SCG: and (ii) the normalized difference snow index with no water information (NDSInw) to extract SCG and suppress lake water. Both new water and snow indices were tested in the Tibetan Plateau using Landsat series, showing that the overall accuracies of NDWIns and NDSInw were in the range of 94.6-97.0% and 94.9-97.0% in mapping the lake water from SCG and mapping the SCG from lake water, respectively. Further comparisons suggest that these new two indices improved upon the previous normalized difference snow index/modified normalized difference water index (NDSI/MNDWI) in mapping the water body and SCG. While the present study only focuses on the validation over certain areas in Tibetan Plateau, the newly proposed NDWIns and NDSInw have the potential for better monitoring the lake water and snow/glacier areas over other cold regions around the globe.

TI  - Spatially and temporally complete Landsat reflectance time series modelling: The fill-and-fit approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Statistical time series models are increasingly being used to fit medium resolution time series provided by satellite sensors, such as Landsat, for terrestrial monitoring. Cloud and shadows, combined with low satellite repeat cycles, reduce surface observation availability. In addition, only a single year of data can be used where there is high inter-annual variation, for example, over many croplands. These factors reduce the ability to fit time series models and reduce model fitting accuracy. In solution, we propose a novel fill-and-fit (FF) approach for application to medium resolution satellite time series. In the 'fill' step, gaps are filled using a recently published algorithm developed to fill large-area gaps in satellite time series using no other satellite data. In the 'fit' step, a linear harmonic model is fitted to the gap-filled time series. The FF approach, and the conventional harmonic model fitting without gap filling, termed the F approach, are demonstrated using seven months of Landsat-7 and -8 surface reflectance Analysis Ready Data (ARD) over agricultural regions in North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, and Kansas. Synthetic model-predicted reflectance for days through the growing season are examined, and assessed quantitatively by comparison with an independent Landsat surface reflectance data set. The six Landsat reflective band root-mean-square difference (RMSD) between the predicted and the independent reflectance, considering millions of pixel observations for each ARD tile, show that the FF approach is more accurate than the F approach. The mean FF RMSD values varied from 0.025 to 0.026 for the four tiles, whereas the mean F RMSD values varied from 0.026 to 0.047. These mean FF RMSD values are< 0.03 which is comparable to the uncertainty specification for the Landsat 8 OLI TOA reflectance, but greater than the atmospheric correction uncertainty in any Landsat 8 OLI band. The greatest RMSD values were found over the Minnesota tile and occurred due to a long period of missing data early in the growing season, and the smallest RMSD values were found for the Kansas tile because of the high availability of clear surface observations. The F approach could not be applied where there were insufficient clear surface observations to fit the model, and where the model was applied, the fitting was often sensitive to issues including gaps in the Landsat time series and the presence of undetected cloud- and shadow-contaminated observations. The FF approach could be applied to every ARD tile pixel location and the predicted reflectance was spatially-coherent and natural looking. Examples are shown that illustrate the potential of using FF predicted synthetic reflectance time series for land surface monitoring.

TI  - Very Short-Term Surface Solar Irradiance Forecasting Based on FengYun-4 Geostationary Satellite
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm to forecast very short-term (30-180 min) surface solar irradiance using visible and near infrared channels (AGRI) onboard the FengYun-4A (FY-4A) geostationary satellite was constructed and evaluated in this study. The forecasting products include global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI). The forecast results were validated using data from Chengde Meteorological Observatory for four typical months (October 2018, and January, April, and July 2019), representing the four seasons. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was employed to calculate the cloud motion vector (CMV) field from the satellite images. The forecast results were compared with the smart persistence (SP) model. A seasonal study showed that July and April forecasting is more difficult than during October and January. For GHI forecasting, the algorithm outperformed the SP model for all forecasting horizons and all seasons, with the best result being produced in October; the skill score was greater than 20%. For DNI, the algorithm outperformed the SP model in July and October, with skill scores of about 12% and 11%, respectively. Annual performances were evaluated; the results show that the normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) value of GHI for 30-180 min horizon ranged from 26.78 to 36.84%, the skill score reached a maximum of 20.44% at the 30-min horizon, and the skill scores were all above 0 for all time horizons. For DNI, the maximum skill score was 6.62% at the 180-min horizon. Overall, compared with the SP model, the proposed algorithm is more accurate and reliable for GHI forecasting and slightly better for DNI forecasting.

TI  - Fractional evergreen forest cover mapping by MODIS time-series FEVC-CV methods at sub-pixel scales
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evergreen forest plays a particular role in biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and soil and water conservation, and the spatial and temporal evolutions of evergreen forest complexly interact with climate change. However, it is difficult for the existing remote sensed data to meet both demands of large scale and high accuracy. To solve this problem, we developed a time-series FEVC-CV method by combining the fractional evergreen forest cover model (FEVC) with the coefficient of variation (CV) at sub-pixel scales. This method using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product to meet the needs of large-scale mapping. Considering the severe mixed-pixel problem and spatial heterogeneity of the study area, the improved dimidiate pixel model was used to extract the fractional evergreen forest cover at sub-pixel scales by introducing a new variable the infra-annual NDVI minimum value (NDVIann-min) and dividing grid units. Meanwhile, the CV of the time-series NDVI highlighted the time series fluctuation stability of evergreen forest compared with other vegetation types, such as deciduous forest and continuous crop. Therefore, the infra-annual time-series CV (CVai) and the CV of the continuous crop key phenology (CVkp) period were used to eliminate the interferences from other vegetation types, which were extremely admixed with low-coverage evergreen forest. We then verified the accuracy of the algorithm using 2-m resolution Gaofen-1 images. The results revealed that the overall accuracy of our algorithm exceeded 90%, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of cover fraction of around 10%. In addition, the mean relative error (MRE) indicated that the extraction accuracy of evergreen forest in non-urban areas was superior to the accuracy in urban areas. The results show that the algorithm achieved fairly high accuracy in detecting evergreen forest, including evergreen trees in urban areas, at a large scale.

TI  - Comparison of different machine learning and regression methods for estimation and mapping of forest stand attributes using ALOS/PALSAR data in complex Hyrcanian forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest structural attributes are required information for sustainable forest management. The use of different remote sensing sources has been investigated intensively as a new potential and an alternative for the forest stand characteristics estimation during the last few years. This research purpose was to examine the phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) data ability in order to estimate stand volume, basal area, and tree density in the Hyrcanian forests of Iran with high composition and structure variations. The required preprocessing and processing steps were performed on the ALOS/PALSAR raw data, and the corresponding values of circular plots were extracted on all SAR data. The modeling of forest structure attributes was performed using fieldcollected attributes by the k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and multiple linear regression (MLR) algorithms. The modeling validity was performed by unemployed plots and by the absolute and relative root mean square error (RMSE) and bias measures. The results of this study have shown that although the results of ANN, SVM, and kNN algorithm were not very different but compared to MLR algorithm, they had better performance. In addition, based on the results of this study, the ANN algorithm showed slightly better performance in forest attribute prediction than the other used algorithms. The results were 34.56%, 27.65%, and 31.16% in relative RMSE for stem volume, basal area, and tree density prediction. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Impacts of cloud scattering properties on FY-3D HIRAS simulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloudy sky spectral radiance at the top of the atmosphere has always been an important while difficult variable to simulate for fast radiative transfer models. In this paper, we focus on examining the impacts of cloud scattering properties on the spectral radiance signature of the High-spectral Resolution Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS) onboard the Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite by using the Advanced Radiative transfer Modeling System (ARMS) and the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM). Cloud scattering properties used in the radiative transfer models are critical for modeling the spectral radiance under cloudy sky, which involves choices of appropriate cloud particle models and particle size distributions, etc. Multiple FY-3D HIRAS observations over Southern China and Southeast Asia with ice or liquid water cloud cover on 6 May 2018 are examined, respectively. Vertical atmospheric profiles are derived from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 reanalysis product. Cloud property retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer are used. Cloud scattering property parameterization schemes based on spherical and nonspherical cloud particle shapes are implemented for liquid water and ice clouds in ARMS and CRTM, respectively. Results show that both ARMS and CRTM can well simulate the radiance at the HIRAS spectral ranges under liquid water cloud condition as compared with the HIRAS observation with mean absolute error (MAE) of brightness temperature of less than 1 K. However, for ice cloud conditions, ARMS model using assumed spherical ice properties exhibits large biases between simulation and observation. CRTM with nonspherical ice properties using 16-stream approximation shows MAE less than 1 K and MAE of about 1 K using 2-stream approximation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimation of All-Weather 1 km MODIS Land Surface Temperature for Humid Summer Days
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is used as a critical indicator for various environmental issues because it links land surface fluxes with the surface atmosphere. Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometers (MODIS) 1 km LSTs have been widely utilized but have the serious limitation of not being provided under cloudy weather conditions. In this study, we propose two schemes to estimate all-weather 1 km Aqua MODIS daytime (1:30 p.m.) and nighttime (1:30 a.m.) LSTs in South Korea for humid summer days. Scheme 1 (S1) is a two-step approach that first estimates 10 km LSTs and then conducts the spatial downscaling of LSTs from 10 km to 1 km. Scheme 2 (S2), a one-step algorithm, directly estimates the 1 km all-weather LSTs. Eight advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR2) brightness temperatures, three MODIS-based annual cycle parameters, and six auxiliary variables were used for the LST estimation based on random forest machine learning. To confirm the effectiveness of each scheme, we have performed different validation experiments using clear-sky MODIS LSTs. Moreover, we have validated all-weather LSTs using bias-corrected LSTs from 10 in situ stations. In clear-sky daytime, the performance of S2 was better than S1. However, in cloudy sky daytime, S1 simulated low LSTs better than S2, with an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.6 degrees C compared to an average RMSE of 3.8 degrees C over 10 stations. At nighttime, S1 and S2 demonstrated no significant difference in performance both under clear and cloudy sky conditions. When the two schemes were combined, the proposed all-weather LSTs resulted in an average R-2 of 0.82 and 0.74 and with RMSE of 2.5 degrees C and 1.4 degrees C for daytime and nighttime, respectively, compared to the in situ data. This paper demonstrates the ability of the two different schemes to produce all-weather dynamic LSTs. The strategy proposed in this study can improve the applicability of LSTs in a variety of research and practical fields, particularly for areas that are very frequently covered with clouds.

TI  - Regional Forest Mapping over Mountainous Areas in Northeast China Using Newly Identified Critical Temporal Features of Sentinel-1 Backscattering
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 provides an extraordinary opportunity to explore the temporal behavior of backscattering of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) due to its unique capability of successive observations every 12 days. This study reported new findings on the critical temporal features of Sentinel-1 backscattering over mountainous forested areas in northeast China and their application in regional forest mapping. Two interesting phenomena were discovered through the analysis of 450 scenes of images acquired by Sentinel-1A or Sentinel-1B over an area of 318,898.62 km(2). The first phenomenon was that the dates of the largest drops of backscattering coefficients over forest and non-forest plots were different during the transition from autumn to winter. The largest drop of non-forest plots occurred around the date of the minimum temperature decreasing below 0 degrees C, while that of forest plots occurred around the date of the maximum temperature decreasing below 0 degrees C. The second phenomenon was that at the dates where these two drops occurred, the magnitude of the drop was negatively correlated with the forest canopy coverage for the first date and positively correlated for the second date. Based on these two phenomena, two methods for the forest mapping, referred to as the direct method and the indirect method, were proposed using only three dates of Sentinel-1 images, i.e., Date1: before the minimum temperature decreased below 0 degrees C, Date2: after the minimum temperature decreased below 0 degrees C but before the maximum temperature decreased below 0 degrees C, and Date3: after the maximum temperature decreased below 0 degrees C. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the forest map produced by the direct method was 93.60%, while that by the indirect method was 93.80%. Their accuracies were comparable with those of forest maps derived from publicly released land cover maps, which was approximately 94.42% for the best one. This study proposed a new way to do large-scale forest mapping in annually frozen regions using as few Sentinel-1 SAR images as possible.

TI  - The Generation of Soil Spectral Dynamic Feedback Using Landsat 8 Data for Digital Soil Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil spectral dynamic feedback captured from high temporal resolution remote sensing data, such as MODIS, during the soil drying process after a rainfall could assist with digital soil mapping. However, this method is ineffective in utilizing the images with a relatively high spatial resolution. There are an insufficient number of images in the soil drying process since those high spatial resolution images tend to have a low temporal resolution. This study is aimed at generating soil spectral dynamic feedback by integrating the feedback captured from the images with a high spatial resolution during the process of multiple drying after different rainfall events. The Landsat 8 data with a temporal resolution of 16 day was exemplified. Each single spectral feedback obtained from Landsat 8 was first adjusted to eliminate the impact of different rainfall magnitudes. Then, the soil spectral dynamic feedback was reorganized and generated based on the adjusted feedback. Finally, the soil spectral dynamic feedback generated based on Landsat 8 was used for mapping topsoil texture and compared with the mapping results based on the MODIS data and the fusion data of MODIS and Landsat 8. As revealed by the results, not only could the generated soil spectral dynamic feedback based on Landsat 8 data improve the details of the spatial distribution of soil texture, but it also enhances the accuracy of mapping. The mapping accuracy based on Landsat 8 data is higher than that based on the MODIS data and fusion data. The improvements of accuracy are more obvious in the areas with more complex surface conditions. This study widens the scope of application for soil spectral dynamic feedback and provides support for large-scale and high-precision digital soil mapping.

TI  - Retrieval of Secchi Disk Depth in Turbid Lakes from GOCI Based on a New Semi-Analytical Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate remote estimation of the Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) in turbid waters is essential in the monitoring the ecological environment of lakes. Using the field measured Z(SD) and the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(lambda)) data, a new semi-analytical algorithm (denoted as Z(SDZ)) for retrieving Z(SD) was developed from Rrs(lambda), and it was applied to Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) images in extremely turbid waters. Our results are as follows: (1) the Z(SDZ) performs well in estimating Z(SD) in turbid water bodies (0.15 m < Z(SD) < 2.5 m). By validating with the field measured data that were collected in four turbid inland lakes, the determination coefficient (R-2) is determined to be 0.89, with a mean absolute square percentage error (MAPE) of 22.39%, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.24 m. (2) The Z(SDZ) improved the retrieval accuracy of Z(SD) in turbid waters and outperformed the existing semi-analytical schemes. (3) The developed algorithm and GOCI data are in order to map the hourly variation of Z(SD) in turbid inland waters, the GOCI-derived results reveal a significant spatiotemporal variation in our study region, which are significantly driven by wind forcing. This study can provide a new approach for estimating water transparency in turbid waters, offering important support for the management of inland waters.

TI  - Conventional and digital soil mapping in Iran: Past, present, and future
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Demand for accurate soil information is increasing for various applications. This paper investigates the history of soil survey in Iran, particularly more recent developments in the use of digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches rather than conventional soil mapping (CSM) methods. A 2000-2019 literature search of articles on DSM of areas of Iran in international journals found 40 studies. These showed an increase in frequency over time, and most were completed in the arid and semi-arid regions of central Iran. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forests (RF), and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MnLR) were the most commonly applied models for predicting soil classes and properties and ANN performed best in most comparative studies. Given the scale of inquiry of most studies (local or regional), quantitative environmental variables such as terrain attributes and remote sensing data were frequently used whereas qualitative variables such as geomorphology, geology, land use, and legacy soil maps were rarely used. The literature review of CSM showed that this method is incapable of defining the spatial distribution of soils and also provides a lower accuracy than DSM method. This review has identified research gaps that need filling. In Iran, coherent national scale DSM with consistent methodology is needed to update legacy soil maps, and to apply DSM in forestlands, hillslopes, deserts, and mountainous regions which have largely been ignored in recent DSM studies. This review should also be useful for producing more local and regional digital soil maps more rapidly as it helps show which covariates and mathematical methods have been best suited to this scale of DSM in Iran.

TI  - Accuracy assessment of the global forest watch tree cover 2000 in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Inaccurate information on forest resources could hamper forest conservation, reforestation and sustainable management. Remote-sensing products have emerged as key tools in forest cover monitoring. The Global Forest Watch (GFW) dataset as an interactive remote sensing product, is now applied by more than 2 million users including researchers, conservationists and local communities for analyzing forest cover changes. The quality of this product varies spatially, and local validations are recommended before using the data for inventory and management tasks. Our study evaluated the accuracy and suitability of the GFW dataset for analyzing China's forest cover. We conducted a validation based on a streamlined visual interpretation procedure using high resolution optical imagery on Google Earth to map the uncertainties and inaccuracies of GFW Tree Cover 2000 in China. We then estimated China's forest area after considering the data uncertainty, made a comparison with the data reported by the National Forest Inventory of China (CNFI) to understand where and how the land-based inventory differs from the presence/absence-based remote sensing data. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the GFW Tree Cover 2000 data reached 94.5 %. The user's and producer's accuracy of forest classification was 89.26 % and 82.13 %. The sample-based area estimation using GFW showed a larger forest area than the figure reported by CNFI in mainland China, while data discrepancy varied at provincial levels. The study provides a detailed performance assessment of GFW in terms of accuracy of defining forest, and we advise the consideration of data uncertainty in forest cover estimates for future forest management.

TI  - Forecasting Time Series Albedo Using NARnet Based on EEMD Decomposition
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo analysis and prediction are of great significance for global energy budget research and global change forecasting. Research has been performed on time series albedo analysis but seldom attempt was performed on land surface albedo prediction. This article develops an effective method for land surface albedo prediction from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series albedo data (MCD43A3). It consists of time series data decomposing and time series data forecasting. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method decomposes the MODIS historical time series albedo data into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residual series, then the nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARnet) method is used to forecast each IMF component and residue. The predictions of all IMFs and residue are summed to obtain a final forecast for the albedo series. The proposed method was performed on monthly and daily albedo prediction both in snow-free and snowy areas. The results showed that the forecast albedo consists of the MODIS albedo data well, with R-2 greater than 0.89 and RMSE less than 0.052 for snow-free areas. For snowy areas, the forecasting also performed well during snow cover periods, with R-2 greater than 0.76 and RMSE less than 0.076. For irregular change periods of snow falling and melting, it is hard to get very high prediction accuracy due to the irregular land surface change. For this problem, more land surface information should be introduced, or adjusting the model over time is necessary.

TI  - Landsat 8 Remote Sensing Image Based on Deep Residual Fully Convolutional Network
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to achieve the goal of quantitative application, high-precision cloud detection has become one of the key steps in remote sensing data preprocessing. However, traditional cloud detection methods have the disadvantages of complex features, multiple algorithm steps, poor robustness, inability to combine high-level features with low-level features, and ordinary detection performance. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a high-precision cloud detection method based on deep residual fully convolutional network, which can achieve the target pixel level segmentation of cloud layer in remote sensing images. First, the encoder extracts the deep features of the image through continuous down-sampling of the residual module. Then, the bilinear interpolation is used for sampling, and the decoding is completed by combining the image features after multilevel coding. Finally, the decoded feature map is fused with the input image and convolution is performed again to achieve end-to-end cloud detection. Experimental results show that, in terms of the Landsat 8 cloud detection data set, the pixel accuracy of the proposed method reaches 93.33%, which is 2.29% higher than that of the original U-Net, and 7.78% higher than that of the traditional Otsu method. This method can provide useful reference for research on intelligent detection of cloud targets.

TI  - A remote sensing-based scheme to improve regional crop model calibration at sub-model component level
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Parameter calibration is an importantly preliminary step before using a crop model to simulate crop growth and final yield. Compared with the traditionally accepted calibration method parameterizing the whole model simultaneously (called as "Global Scheme"), the Sub-Model Component (SMC) Scheme emphasizes on parameterizing different functional modules in a crop model sequentially. However, the SMC Scheme receives less attention, especially at regional scales. Therefore, this study led a performance evaluation of the two calibration schemes through using them to incorporate remote sensing data into a crop model (MCWLA-Rice) independently in Northeast China. We found the SMC Scheme reduced root mean square error (RMSE) on average by 4 days for heading date and 2 days for harvest date. Using the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) to assess the similarity between time series of modelled LAI and remotely-sensed LAI, the SMC Scheme decreased LAI estimation error by 0.04. Finally, the SMC Scheme greatly decreased relative RMSE (RRMSE) for yield by 11%. In addition, temperature and topography could affect the performance of SMC Scheme. Our findings demonstrated that the SMC Scheme calibrated the crop model more effectively and reliably, suggesting its potentially wide application in other regions and crops.

M3  - Article
AB  - Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is an increasingly important environmental pollutant, which has been detected almost everywhere in the environment. Despite the widespread presence of PFOS, much less notice is taken of its toxicology effects on marine bivalves. Thus, the transcriptome response to PFOS treatment (nominal concentration of 20 mg/L) in hepatopancreas of a sentinel organism, Ruditapes philippinarum was examined. Compared with the control group, 32,149 unigenes were up-regulated and 26,958 unigenes down-regulated. Notably, significant gene expression changes were found in carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism and protein biosynthesis, indicating the metabolic disruptions caused by PFOS in R. philippinarum. Additionally, numerous other differentially expressed genes were involved in immune system, antioxidant defense system and detoxification metabolism. In summary, transcriptome profiling of R. philippinarum after exposure to PFOS provided molecular support for our current understanding of the detrimental toxicity of PFOS on marine bivalves.

TI  - Variable Urbanization Warming Effects across Metropolitans of China and Relevant Driving Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is mainly characterized by the expansion of impervious surface (IS) and hence modifies hydrothermal properties of the urbanized areas. This process results in rising land surface temperature (LST) of the urbanized regions, i.e., urban heat island (UHI). Previous studies mainly focused on relations between LST and IS over individual city. However, because of the spatial heterogeneity of UHI from individual cities to urban agglomerations and the influence of relevant differences in climate background across urban agglomerations, the spatial-temporal scale independence of the IS-LST relationship still needs further investigation. In this case, based on Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor (Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS) remote sensing image and multi-source remote sensing data, we extracted IS using VrNIR-BI (Visible red and NIR-based built-up Index) and calculated IS density across three major urban agglomerations across eastern China, i.e., the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) to investigate the IS-LST relations on different spatial and temporal scales and clarify the driving factors of LST. We find varying warming effects of IS on LST in diurnal and seasonal sense at different time scales. Specifically, the IS has stronger impacts on increase of LST during daytime than during nighttime and stronger impacts on increase of LST during summer than during winter. On different spatial scales, more significant enhancing effects of IS on LST can be observed across individual city than urban agglomerations. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between IS and LST at the individual urbanized region can be as high as 0.94, indicating that IS can well reflect LST changes within individual urbanized region. However, relationships between IS and LST indicate nonlinear effects of IS on LST. Because of differences in spatial scales, latitudes, and local climates, we depicted piecewise linear relations between IS and LST across BTH when the IS density was above 10% to 17%. Meanwhile, linear relations still stand between IS density and LST across YRD and PRD. Besides, the differences in the IS-LST relations across urban agglomeration indicate more significant enhancing effects of IS on LST across PRD than YRD and BTH. These findings help to enhance human understanding of the warming effects of urbanization or UHI at different spatial and temporal scales and is of scientific and practical merits for scientific urban planning.

TI  - Regional Ocean Current Field Construction based on an Empirical Bayesian Kriging Algorithm using Multiple Underwater Gliders
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The ocean current is an important component of the complex marine environment. Ocean current forecasting data mainly come from computational simulation, which merges satellite remote sensing data and in situ data measured from marine vehicles. Having a deep understanding of ocean currents is essential for ocean observation and path guidance of ships or other marine vehicles. In this paper, the regional depth-averaged flow is deduced according to the motion characteristics of underwater glider. Through virtual mooring observations of three underwater gliders in the northern South China Sea, sea trial data from June 25th to July 11th 2019 are obtained. After denoising and filtering, the depth-averaged flow data are used to construct the depth-averaged flow field with the spatial interpolation method. Then, the inverse distance weight (IDW) method, radial basis interpolation (RBI) method and empirical Bayesian kriging (EBK) method are adopted to construct the depth-averaged flow field. Thus, the results from the three constructed methods are compared with the real flow field data, demonstrating that the EBK method shows a better balance in interpolation accuracy and performance than the other methods. More specifically, for the EBK method, the mean error value is 0.00441, and the root-mean-square of error is 0.14977, which are lower than those of the other two methods. Furthermore, the evaluation results thoroughly verify the validity of the EBK method and prove that an underwater glider is a useful tool for observing ocean currents.

TI  - Evaluation of Himawari-8/AHI, MERRA-2, and CAMS Aerosol Products over China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable aerosol optical depth (AOD) data with high spatial and temporal resolutions are needed for research on air pollution in China. AOD products from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the geostationary Himawari-8 satellite and reanalysis datasets make it possible to capture diurnal variations of aerosol loadings. However, due to the different retrieval methods, their applicability may vary with different space and time. Thus, in this study, taking the measured AOD at the Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) stations as the gold standard, the performance of the latest AHI hourly AOD product (i.e., L3 AOD) was evaluated and then compared with that of two reanalysis AOD datasets offered by Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), respectively, covering from July 2015 to December 2017 over China. For all the matchups, AHI AOD shows the highest robustness with a high correlation (R) of 0.82, low root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.23, and moderate mean absolute relative error (MARE) of 0.56. Although MERRA-2 and CAMS products both have lower R values (0.74, 0.72) and higher RMSE (0.28, 0.26), the former is slightly better than the latter. Accuracy of AOD products could be mainly affected by the pollution level and less affected by particle size distribution. Comparisons among these AOD products imply that AHI AOD is more reliable in regions with high pollution levels, such as central and eastern China, while in the northern and western part, MERRA-2 AOD seems more satisfying. The performance of all the three AOD products presents a significant diurnal variety, as indicated by the highest accuracy in the morning for AHI and at noon for reanalysis data. Moreover, due to various pollution distribution patterns and meteorological conditions, there are distinct seasonal characteristics in the performance of AOD products for different regions.

TI  - Application of an advanced spatiotemporal model for PM<sub>2.5</sub> prediction in Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Either long- or short-term of fine particle (PM2.5) exposure is associated with adverse health effects especially for children. Primary school students spend much time in schools whereas PM2.5 prediction for such fine-scale places remains a demanding task, let alone a combined prediction with high temporal resolution. The study aimed to estimate PM2.5 levels of different time scales for primary schools in Jiangsu Province, China. Hourly PM2.5 measurements within the academic year (Sept. 2016-June 2017) were collected from 72 routine monitoring sites. Together with PM2.5 emission inventory and dozens of geographic variables, an advanced spatiotemporal land use regression (LUR) model was employed to estimate PM2.5 concentrations of biweekly, seasonal and academic year levels in Jiangsu Province at 2457 primary school locations. 10-fold cross-validation verified high prediction ability with squared correlations R-CV(2) of 0.72 for temporal and 0.71 for spatial changes. PM2.5 levels in primary schools in Nanjing and Nantong were >10% higher than that of the corresponding cities while pollution levels in primary schools in Xuzhou were >20% lower. For 10 out of the 13 cities in Jiangsu, PM2.5 levels for primary schools surpassed 70 mu g/m(3) in winter. Schools in Lianyungang, Zhenjiang and Huai'an suffered the most. This study demonstrated the fine-scale prediction ability of the novel spatiotemporal LUR model, as well as the potential and necessity to apply it in epidemiological studies. It also verified the emergency of pollution control for primary schools from cities such as Lianyungang and Zhenjiang. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Mapping Rice Paddy Based on Machine Learning with Sentinel-2 Multi-Temporal Data: Model Comparison and Transferability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is an important agricultural crop in the Southwest Hilly Area, China, but there has been a lack of efficient and accurate monitoring methods in the region. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have obtained considerable achievements in the remote sensing community. However, it has not been widely used in mapping a rice paddy, and most studies lack the comparison of classification effectiveness and efficiency between CNNs and other classic machine learning models and their transferability. This study aims to develop various machine learning classification models with remote sensing data for comparing the local accuracy of classifiers and evaluating the transferability of pretrained classifiers. Therefore, two types of experiments were designed: local classification experiments and model transferability experiments. These experiments were conducted using cloud-free Sentinel-2 multi-temporal data in Banan District and Zhongxian County, typical hilly areas of Southwestern China. A pure pixel extraction algorithm was designed based on land-use vector data and a Google Earth Online image. Four convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms (one-dimensional (Conv-1D), two-dimensional (Conv-2D) and three-dimensional (Conv-3D_1 and Conv-3D_2) convolutional neural networks) were developed and compared with four widely used classifiers (random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP)). Recall, precision, overall accuracy (OA) and F1 score were applied to evaluate classification accuracy. The results showed that Conv-2D performed best in local classification experiments with OA of 93.14% and F1 score of 0.8552 in Banan District, OA of 92.53% and F1 score of 0.8399 in Zhongxian County. CNN-based models except Conv-1D provided more desirable performance than non-CNN classifiers. Besides, among the non-CNN classifiers, XGBoost received the best result with OA of 89.73% and F1 score of 0.7742 in Banan District, SVM received the best result with OA of 88.57% and F1 score of 0.7538 in Zhongxian County. In model transferability experiments, almost all CNN classifiers had low transferability. RF and XGBoost models have achieved acceptable F1 scores for transfer (RF = 0.6673 and 0.6469, XGBoost = 0.7171 and 0.6709, respectively).

TI  - Modeling co-seismic thermal infrared brightness anomalies in petroliferous basins surrounding the North and East of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Co-seismic gas leakage usually occurs on the edge of seismic faults in petroliferous basins, and it may have an impact on the local environment, such as the greenhouse effect, which can cause thermal infrared brightness anomalies. Using wavelet transform and power spectrum estimation methods, we processed brightness temperature data from the Chinese geostationary meteorological satellite FY-C/E. We report similarities between the co-seismic thermal infrared brightness (CTIB) anomalies before, during and after earthquakes that occurred at the edges of the Sichuan, Tarim, Qaidam, and Junggar basins surrounding the North and East of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in western China. Additionally, in each petroliferous basin, the area of a single CTIB anomaly accounted for 50% to 100% of the basin area, and the spatial distribution similarities in the CTIB anomalies existed before, during and after these earthquakes. To better interpret the similarities, we developed a basin warming effect model based on geological structures and topography. The model suggests that in a petroliferous basin with a subsurface gas reservoir, gas leakage could strengthen with the increasing stress before, during, and even after an earthquake. The accumulation of these gases, such as the greenhouse gases CH4 and CO2, results in the CTIB anomalies. In addition, we conclude that the CTIB anomalies are strengthened by the high mountains (altitude similar to 5000 m) around the basins and the basins' independent climatic conditions. This work provides a new perspective from which to understand the CTIB anomalies in petroliferous basins surrounding the North and East of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

TI  - Estimation of Multi-Species Leaf Area Index Based on Chinese GF-1 Satellite Data Using Look-Up Table and Gaussian Process Regression Methods
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important biophysical parameter, which can be effectively applied in the estimation of vegetation growth status. At present, amounts of studies just focused on the LAI estimation of a single plant type, while plant types are usually mixed rather than single distribution. In this study, the suitability of GF-1 data for multi-species LAI estimation was evaluated by using Gaussian process regression (GPR), and a look-up table (LUT) combined with a PROSAIL radiative transfer model. Then, the performance of the LUT and GPR for multi-species LAI estimation was analyzed in term of 15 different band combinations and 10 published vegetation indices (VIs). Lastly, the effect of the different band combinations and published VIs on the accuracy of LAI estimation was discussed. The results indicated that GF-1 data exhibited a good potential for multi-species LAI retrieval. Then, GPR exhibited better performance than that of LUT for multi-species LAI estimation. What is more, modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) was selected based on the GPR algorithm for multi-species LAI estimation with a lower root mean squared error (RMSE = 0.6448 m(2)/m(2)) compared to other band combinations and VIs. Then, this study can provide guidance for multi-species LAI estimation.

TI  - Simulation of urban expansion based on cellular automata and maximum entropy model
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion is a hot topic in land use/land cover change (LUCC) researches. In this paper, maximum entropy model and cellular automata (CA) model are coupled into a new CA model (Maxent-CA) for urban expansion. This model can help to obtain transition rules from single-period dataset. Moreover, it can be constructed and calibrated easily with several steps. Firstly, Maxent-CA model was built by using remote sensing data of China in 2000 (basic data) and spatial variables (such as population density and Euclidean distance to cities). Secondly, the proposed model was calibrated by analyzing training samples, neighborhood structure and spatial scale. Finally, this model was verified by comparing logistic regression CA model and their simulation results. Experiments showed that suitable sampling ratio (sampling ratio equals the proportion of urban land in the whole region) and von Neumann neighborhood structure will help to yield better results. Spatial structure of simulation results becomes simple as spatial resolution decreases. Besides, simulation accuracy is significantly affected by spatial resolution. Compared to simulation results of logistic regression CA model, Maxent-CA model can avoid clusters phenomenon and obtain better results matching actual situation. It is found that the proposed model performs well in simulating urban expansion of China. It will be helpful for simulating even larger study area in the background of global environment changes.

TI  - Interannual and monthly variations of catch per unit effort and the relation with sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration in fishing grounds (fishing area 48) of Antarctic krill
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the catch of fishing season (January-June) and ocean remote sensing data of Antarctic krill fishing area from 2010 to 2015, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variations in the catch per unit fishing effort (CPUE) of Antarctic krill by using statistical method and yield center of gravity method. Results showed that the mean annual CPUE of Antarctic krill increased gradually from 2010 to 2015, with a peak in 2014 (18.6 t . h(-1)). The mean monthly CPUE of Antarctic krill was lower in January (9.2 t . h(-1)) , while highest in May (20.9 t . h(-1)). Nearly 60% of the catch times were in the summer period (January-March) near the South Shetland Islands. The Antarctic krill fishing grounds were concentrated in the sea area between 60 degrees S-64 degrees S and 46 degrees W-62 degrees W. The center of gravity in fishing ground shifted from the sea area near the South Shetland Islands to the northeast during January to June every year. Most of the fishing ground barycenter was mainly concentrated in the sea area near the South Shetland Islands. The optimum sea surface temperature (SST) of the fishing ground ranged from -1.8 to 1.9, -1.8 to 0.8 and 1.1 to 1.4 degrees C in fisheries sub-zones 48.1, 48.2 and 48.3, respectively. The optimum SST range of the high CPUE fishing areas from January to March was -0.8 to 1.2 degrees C , which decreased from -1.8 to -0.4 degrees C in April-June period. The optimum ranges of chlorophyll a concentration in the sub-zones 48.1, 48.2 and 48.3 were 0.09-1.21, 0.14-0.52 and 0.32-0.39 mg . m(-3), respectively. The chlorophyll a concentration in the areas with high CPUE (>20 t . h(-1)) values was 0.13-0-83 mg . m(-3). Overall, the annual CPUE of Antarctic krill showed an increasing trend during 2010-2015. The main fishing area was located near the South Shetland Islands. The optimum SST range of the central fishing ground was -1.8 to 1.2 degrees C , and the range of chlorophyll a concentration was 0.13-0.83 mg . m(-3).

TI  - Remote sensing-based identification of forest types and the scale effect in subtropical evergreen forests
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing (ORS) is the primary tool to obtain information on regional-scale vegetation cover. Few efforts have been made to identify forest types within subtropical evergreen forests using ORS. Scale effects have been reported in literature, yet the optimal spatial resolution to identify evergreen forest types is still unclear in practical application. In this study, we used four types of ORS imagery [Pleiades (2 m), RapidEye (5 m), and Landsat-8 (15 m and 30 m)] to investigate whether the classification of three typical evergreen forest types [Chinese fir forest (CFF), Masson pine forest (MPF), and evergreen broad leaved forest (EBF)] in subtropical landscapes would be influenced by scale effects. Moreover, we tested the optimal spatial resolution for forest classification. The Random Forest Model was combined with predictive features derived from spectral reflectance, image texture, and vegetation coverage to map land-cover types at four spatial resolutions. The results showed that the overall accuracy (OA) of four land cover maps had a U-curve tendency with increasing spatial resolution. The 2 m Pleiades image generated the highest classification accuracy (Kappa =0.70, OA =0.77) among four types of images. The accuracy of three evergreen forest types also had a similar U-curve tendency. The ranges of the rate of identification (RI) were RICEF =68%-87%, RIMPF =55%-84%, and RIEBF = 29%-74%. The CFF and MPF generated lower classification errors in terms of omission error (OECFF = 0.26 -0.46; OEMPF = 0.31 - 0. 50) and commission error (CECFF = 0. 32 - 0. 53; CEMPF = 0.31-0.46) compared with the EBF (CEEBF = 0. 39 - 0. 66; OEEBF = 0. 47 - 0. 71). Our results showed that the identification of forest types in subtropical regions is clearly subject to scale effects. Despite this, Landsat-8 imagery at 30 m resolution can produce the highest mapping precision due to its broader spectrum sensors. We proposed that the practical mapping of forest types in subtropical areas should consider the inherent trade-off between spectral features and spatial resolution of remote sensors rather than blindly pursuing high spatial resolution.

TI  - On-orbit Radiometric Calibration for Thermal Infrared Band of FY3D/MERSI-II Satellite Remote Sensor Based on Qinghai Lake Radiation Calibration Test-site
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In August 2018, an on-orbit absolute radiometric calibration test for the thermal infrared channel of FY3D/MERSI-II satellite remote sensor was carried out at the Qinghai lake radiation correction test-site. The spectral radiance data of Qinghai Lake was obtained by means of fixed-point measurement. The sounding data were input to radioactive transfer model to compute the at-sensor radiance and brightness temperature of the satellite, and the calibration coefficients for thermal infrared channel 24 (10.26 similar to 11.26 mu m) and channel 25 (11.50 similar to 12.50 mu m) of FY3D/MERSI-II were calculated. AQUA/MODIS and NPP/VIIRS satellite remote sensors which have high calibration accuracy were used to evaluate the accuracy of the on-orbit radiometric calibration method. The average deviation of the channel brightness temperature is less than 0.5 K in the range of 10.261 similar to 1.26 mu m and less than 1.0 K in the range of 11.50 similar to 12.50 mu m, indicating that the on-orbit radiometric calibration method has better calibration accuracy, and the calibration results are reasonable and reliable. Comparing the on-orbit calibration results using the Qinghai Lake with the on-board calibration results, in the range of 10.26 similar to 11.26 mu m and 11.50 similar to 12.50 mu m, the average deviation of the channel brightness temperature is less than 0.5 K and 1.25 K, respectively. It shows that FY3D/MERSI-II runs stably on orbit. This test verified the FY3D/MERSI-II on-board calibration results, and provided a guarantee for the quantitative application of FY3D/MERSI-II remote sensing data.

TI  - A Simple Method for Converting 1-km Resolution Daily Clear-Sky LST into Real LST
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-surface temperature (LST) plays a key role in the physical processes of surface energy and water balance from local through global scales. The widely used one kilometre resolution daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product has missing values due to the influence of clouds. Therefore, a large number of clear-sky LST reconstruction methods have been developed to obtain spatially continuous LST datasets. However, the clear-sky LST is a theoretical value that is often an overestimate of the real value. In fact, the real LST (also known as cloudy-sky LST) is more necessary and more widely used. The existing cloudy-sky LST algorithms are usually somewhat complicated, and the accuracy needs to be improved. It is necessary to convert the clear-sky LST obtained by the currently better-developed methods into cloudy-sky LST. We took the clear-sky LST, cloud-cover duration, downward shortwave radiation, albedo and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as five independent variables and the real LST at the ground stations as the dependent variable to perform multiple linear regression. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the cloudy-sky LST retrieved by this method ranged from 3.5-3.9 K. We further analyzed different cases of the method, and the results suggested that this method has good flexibility. When we chose fewer independent variables, different clear-sky algorithms, or different regression tools, we also achieved good results. In addition, the method calculation process was relatively simple and can be applied to other research areas. This study preliminarily explored the influencing factors of the real LST and can provide a possible option for researchers who want to obtain cloudy-sky LST through clear-sky LST, that is, a convenient conversion method. This article lays the foundation for subsequent research in various fields that require real LST.

TI  - MAPPING FREQUENCY OF OIL SPILLS IN THE CASPIAN SEA USING SENTINEL-2 OPTICAL IMAGES
T2  - NEWS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN-SERIES PHYSICO-MATHEMATICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this work is to evaluate the capabilities of optical images in the problem of detecting oil spills, testing them in the task of mapping zones with a high frequency of oil spills during one year. Using SAR imagery, sometimes it is difficult to separate anthropogenic oil spills and false targets, usually called "look-alikes". Using optical images for oil spill detection, we rely on the spectral characteristics of objects, and although the reflectivity varies depending on the thickness and composition of the slick, in most cases, oil spills can be distinguished from "look-alikes". The region near Absheron peninsula was selected as a study area. Optical images of the Sentinel-2 (A, B) satellites were used to detect oil spills and calculate the zones of their most frequent occurrence. Object based approach was chosen for segmentation and classification images. The map of hot spots with high frequencies of oil spills during 2019 year was presented in this article. Conclusions about the advisability of using optical images along with radar data for monitoring oil spills were made.

TI  - Mapping Fragmented Impervious Surface Areas Overlooked by Global Land-Cover Products in the Liping County, Guizhou Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Imperviousness is an important indicator for monitoring urbanization and environmental changes, and is evaluated widely in urban areas, but not in rural areas. An accurate impervious surface area (ISA) map in rural areas is essential to achieve environmental conservation and sustainable rural development. Global land-cover products such as MODIS MCD12Q1, ESA CCI-LC, and Global Urban Land are common resources for environmental practitioners to collect land-cover information including ISAs. However, global products tend to focus on large ISA agglomerations and may not identify fragmented ISA extents in less populated regions. Land-use planners and practitioners have to map ISAs if it is difficult to obtain such spatially explicit information from local governments. A common and consistent approach for rural ISA mapping is yet to be established. A case study of the Liping County, a typical rural region in southwest China, was undertaken with the objectives of assessing the global land-cover products in the context of rural ISA mapping and proposing a simple and feasible approach for the mapping. This approach was developed using Landsat 8 imagery and by applying a random forests classifier. An appropriate number of training samples were distributed to towns or villages across all townships in the study area for classification. The results demonstrate that the global land-cover products identified major ISA agglomerations, specifically at the county seat; however, other fragmented ISAs over the study area were overlooked. In contrast, the map created using the developed approach inferred ISAs across all townships with an overall accuracy of 91%. A large amount of training samples together with geographic information of towns or villages is the key suggestion to identify and map ISAs in rural areas.

TI  - Evaluation of Cloud Microphysical Properties Derived From MODIS and Himawari-8 Using In Situ Aircraft Measurements Over the Southern Ocean
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud microphysical properties from aircraft measurements during the Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol Transport Experimental Study are used to evaluate the cloud products from the geostationary satellite Himawari-8 (H-8) and the polar-orbiting satellite the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Compared to the in situ aircraft observations when aircraft flew horizontally near cloud tops, the cloud droplet effective radius (r(e)) and number concentration (N-d) from H-8 (MODIS) are 33% (26%-31%) and 2% (9-13%) larger. Both the H-8 and MODIS retrievals behave similarly for liquid-only and mixed-phase low-level clouds, indicating the weak sensitivity of the satellite cloud retrieval performance to cloud phase. The r(e) and N-d of the cloud profiles from aircraft measurements were also used to compare with the satellite product. It shows that H-8 r(e) and N-d agree better with aircraft measurements when considering only the in situ data acquired in the upper portions (highest 20%) of the clouds. Roughly, the r(e) overestimation by H-8 decreases from 18% to 3% when considering the upper portions of clouds compared to all cloud layer averages, except for one case with drizzles appeared. In addition, the performance of MODIS r(e) and N-d is highly dependent on the wavelengths the retrieval method uses. The droplet r(e) retrievals using wavelength of 1.6 mu m have much larger biases than that using the other two channels. The potential effects of the cloud vertical variation and the photon penetration depth, the cloud heterogeneity, the cloud droplet size spectra, and the drizzle on satellite retrievals have also been discussed.

TI  - Recent Evolution of Coastal Tidal Flats and the Impacts of Intensified Human Activities in the Modern Radial Sand Ridges, East China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal tidal flats of the modern Radial Sand Ridges (RSRs) are typical silt-muddy tidal flats in Central Jiangsu Province. These tidal flats play a critical role in coastline protection and biodiversity conservation, and against storm surges, but have recently been displaying drastic changes in geomorphic dynamics because of human activities. However, a comprehensive understanding of spatiotemporal changes in tidal flats in RSRs remains lacking. Hence, we employed a novel remote sensing method by obtaining the instantaneous high/low tide line positions from over 112 scenes of Landsat satellite images of the study area from 1975 to 2017, which were used to track the recent evolution of the coastal tidal flats in the modern RSRs over the past four decades. We found that the shoreline of the tidal flats showed an advanced seaward trend, and the waterline of the tidal flat presented a gradual process during different periods. The total tidal flat area in the study area showed an obviously decreasing trend overall, and approximately 992 km(2) of the tidal flat was lost. We also found that the coastal tidal flats in the modern RSRs were generally undergoing erosion in the low tidal flats, especially in the Northern Swing and Southern Swing areas, while the high tidal flats showed a slowed accretionary change. Land reclamation was the main factor affecting the reduction in the tidal flat area, as the reclamation area has increased by 1300 km(2), with an average of 35.14 km(2)/year. In addition, the erosion of the tidal flats was associated with a reduced sediment supply. Our findings will provide useful information for local managers and researchers to support future environmental management because increasing demand for land and rising sea levels are expected in the future.

TI  - Novel Semi-Supervised Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on a Superpixel Graph and Discrete Potential Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification plays an important role in the automatic interpretation of the remotely sensed data. However, it is a non-trivial task to classify HSI accurately and rapidly due to its characteristics of having a large amount of data and massive noise points. To address this problem, in this work, a novel, semi-supervised, superpixel-level classification method for an HSI was proposed based on a graph and discrete potential (SSC-GDP). The key idea of the proposed scheme is the construction of the weighted connectivity graph and the division of the weighted graph. Based on the superpixel segmentation, a weighted connectivity graph is constructed usingthe weighted connection between a superpixel and its spatial neighbors. The generated graph is then divided into different communities/sub-graphs by using a discrete potential and the improved semi-supervised Wu-Huberman (ISWH) algorithm. Each community in the weighted connectivity graph represents a class in the HSI. The local connection strategy, together with the linear complexity of the ISWH algorithm, ensures the fast implementation of the suggested SSC-GDP method. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed spectral-spatial method, two public benchmarks, Indian Pines and Salinas, were utilized to test the performance of our proposal. The comparative test results confirmed that the proposed method was superior to several other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Ecological and environmental consequences of ecological projects in the Beijing-Tianjin sand source region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of influences of the Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project on soil wind erosion and ecosystem services is imperative for mastering the benefits and drawbacks of the program, as well as for distinguishing more reasonable estimations to evaluate regional sustainable development. Within the Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Region, we quantified the spatiotemporal patterns of land use/cover changes (LUCCs), soil wind erosion modulus (SWEM), and essential ecosystem services throughout 2000-2015 by utilizing field investigations, remotely sensed data, meteorological data, and modeling. The influences of ecological projects on wind erosion and ecosystem services has been subsequently assessed by using those modifications brought on via the LUCCs (e.g., conversion from cropland to grassland/woodland) during the ecological construction. The results indicated that the SWEM showed a decline and ecosystem services which included carbon storage, water retention, and air quality regulation exhibited growth driven by using both local climate exchanges and human activities such as ecological projects. Excluding the effects of climate factors, the LUCCs stemming from ecological projects caused a total SWEM decrease of 3.77 million tons during 2000-2015, of which approximately 70% was prompted by the way of the transition from desert to sparse grassland. And from this transition, ecosystem services including both water retention and aboveground net primary productivity manifest a general increase. The sub-regions of desert grassland in Bayannur, Ordos Sandy Land, and Otindag Sandy Land were hot spots for wind erosion declines and ecosystem service enhancements induced by the ecological projects. We recommend that endeavors be coordinated toward the scientific management of the degraded lands and distribution of the local populace, as well as the implementation of diverse measures in the expected hotter and drier future.

TI  - Evaluation of Different Algorithms for Estimating the Growing Stock Volume of<i>Pinus massoniana</i>Plantations Using Spectral and Spatial Information from a SPOT6 Image
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise growing stock volume (GSV) estimation is essential for monitoring forest carbon dynamics, determining forest productivity, assessing ecosystem forest services, and evaluating forest quality. We evaluated four machine learning methods: classification and regression trees (CART), support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forests (RF), for their reliability in the estimation of the GSV ofPinus massonianaplantations in China's northern subtropical regions, using remote sensing data. For all four methods, models were generated using data derived from a SPOT6 image, namely the spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), texture parameters, or both. In addition, the effects of varying the size of the moving window on estimation precision were investigated. RF almost always yielded the greatest precision independently of the choice of input. ANN had the best performance when SVIs were used alone to estimate GSV. When using texture indices alone with window sizes of 3 x 5 x 5 or 9 x 9, RF achieved the best results. For CART, SVM, and RF,R(2)decreased as the moving window size increased: the highestR(2)values were achieved with 3 x 3 or 5 x 5 windows. When using textural parameters together with SVIs as the model input, RF achieved the highest precision, followed by SVM and CART. Models using both SVI and textural parameters as inputs had better estimating precision than those using spectral data alone but did not appreciably outperform those using textural parameters alone.

TI  - Evaluation of Satellite-Derived Soil Moisture in Qinghai Province Based on Triple Collocation
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating the reliability of satellite-based and reanalysis soil moisture products is very important in soil moisture research. The traditional methods of evaluating soil moisture products rely on the verification of satellite inversion data and ground observation; however, the ground measurement data is often difficult to obtain. The triple collocation (TC) method can be used to evaluate the accuracy of a product without obtaining the ground measurement data. This study focused on the whole of Qinghai Province, China (31 degrees -40 degrees N, 89 degrees -103 degrees E), and used the TC method to obtain the error variance for satellite-based soil moisture data, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the same data, and the correlation between the same data and the ground-truth soil moisture, using passive satellite products: Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Fengyun-3B Microwave Radiation Imager (FY3B), Fengyun-3C Microwave Radiation Imager (FY3C), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2); an active satellite product Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), and reanalysis data Goddard Earth Observing System Model version 5 (GEOS-5) land modeling system. The TC results for the passive satellite data were then compared with the satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to explore the influence of vegetation coverage on the results. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) for the SMAP, SMOS, FY3B, FY3C, and AMSR2 satellite data, the spatial distributions of the TC-derived error variance, the SNR of the satellite-derived soil moisture, and the correlation coefficient between the satellite-derived and ground-truth soil moisture, were all relatively similar, which indirectly verified the reliability of the TC method; and (2) SMOS data have poor applicability for the estimation of soil moisture in Qinghai Province due to their insufficient detection capability in the Qaidam area, high error variance (median 0.0053), high SNR (median 0.43), and low correlation coefficient with ground-truth soil moisture (median 0.57).

TI  - Spatial-temporal analysis of landscape ecological risk in different seasons during the past 30 years in Lake Shengjin wetland, lower reaches of the Yangtze River
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the Landsat series of remote sensing data of Shengjin Lake wetland in 1989, 1996, 2003, 2010 and 2017, the ecological risk assessment model was built, the ecological risk index of different seasons was calculated, and the spatial distribution of ecological risk and its variation characteristics were analyzed. Meanwhile, the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the ecological risk correlation between seasons, seasons and years. The results showed that: (1) there were significant differences in ecological risk index in different seasons. The ecological risk from high to low was summer, winter, autumn and spring. The summer and winter risk index was 37.03% higher than that in spring and autumn. (2) In 1989-2017, the ecological risk index of Shengjin Lake wetland increased significantly. The important landscape types such as mudflats and grasslands in the lake area were highly susceptible to human activities and climate change, and gradually changed from medium-risk and high-risk areas to high risk, high risk area. And the artifical surface and grassland area and the area of higher risk and high area show characteristics of certain synergistic change.In general, the Shengjin Lake Reserve is dominated by lower landscape ecological risks and medium landscape ecological risks. Partyly higher landscape ecological risks and high landscape ecological risks are mainly located in the upper and lower lake areas. (3) The high correlation of ecological risks is often occurred between autumn and winter; the annual ecological risk is highly correlated with winter ecological risk. Therefore, the spatial-temporal evolution trend of the ecological risk in different seasons during the last 30 years reflects the pressure response of the landscape pattern change to the landscape ecosystem disturbance, and the autumn and winter lakes wetlands need to be highly valued.

TI  - A Comparison of Fire Weather Indices with MODIS Fire Days for the Natural Regions of Alaska
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research Highlights: Flammability of wildland fuels is a key factor influencing risk-based decisions related to preparedness, response, and safety in Alaska. However, without effective measures of current and expected flammability, the expected likelihood of active and problematic wildfires in the future is difficult to assess and prepare for. This study evaluates the effectiveness of diverse indices to capture high-risk fires. Indicators of drought and atmospheric drivers are assessed along with the operational Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS). Background and Objectives: In this study, 13 different indicators of atmospheric conditions, fuel moisture, and flammability are compared to determine how effective each is at identifying thresholds and trends for significant wildfire activity. Materials and Methods: Flammability indices are compared with remote sensing characterizations that identify where and when fire activity has occurred. Results: Among these flammability indicators, conventional tools calibrated to wildfire thresholds (Duff Moisture Code (DMC) and Buildup Index (BUI)), as well as measures of atmospheric forcing (Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD)), performed best at representing the conditions favoring initiation and size of significant wildfire events. Conventional assessments of seasonal severity and overall landscape flammability using DMC and BUI can be continued with confidence. Fire models that incorporate BUI in overall fire potential and fire behavior assessments are likely to produce effective results throughout boreal landscapes in Alaska. One novel result is the effectiveness of VPD throughout the state, making it a potential alternative to FFMC among the short-lag/1-day indices. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the societal value of research that joins new academic research results with operational needs. Developing the framework to do this more effectively will bring science to action with a shorter lag time, which is critical as we face growing challenges from a changing climate.

TI  - Hyperspectral image super-resolution combining with deep learning and spectral unmixing
T2  - SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, hyperspectral image super-resolution has attracted the attention of many researchers and has become a hot topic in the field of computer vision. However, it is difficult to obtain high-resolution images due to imaging hardware devices. At present, many existing hyperspectral image super-resolution methods have not achieved good results. In this paper, we propose a hyperspectral image super-resolution method combining with deep residual convolutional neural network (DRCNN) and spectral unmixing. Firstly, the spatial resolution of the image is enhanced by learning a priori knowledge of natural images. The DRCNN reconstructs high spatial resolution hyperspectral images by concatenating multiple residual blocks, each containing two convolutional layers. Secondly, the spectral features of low-resolution and high-resolution hyperspectral images are linked by spectral unmixing. This approach aims to obtain the endmember matrix and the abundance matrix. The final reconstruction result is obtained by multiplying the endmember matrix and the abundance matrix. In addition, in order to improve the visual effect of the reconstructed image, the total variation regularity is used to impose constraints on the abundance matrix to enhance the relationship between the pixels. The experimental results of remote sensing data based on ground facts show that the proposed method has good performance and preserves spatial information and spectral information without the need for auxiliary images.

TI  - Microarray Analysis of Group B Streptococci Causing Invasive Neonatal Early- and Late-onset Infection
T2  - PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Group B Streptococcus is the leading cause of meningitis and sepsis in newborns. Until now, there is no data of fast and simple typing of group B Streptococcus virulence factors using a genetic microarray and comparing these data to clinical manifestations.Methods:A prospective active surveillance study was conducted via 2 independent and nationwide reporting systems, the German Pediatric Surveillance Unit (ESPED) and the Laboratory Sentinel Group at Robert Koch-Institute. Surveillance was performed between 2001 and 2003 and between 2008 and 2010. Typing of virulence factors, serotypes, pilus islands and alpha-like proteins was done by means of a newly developed microarray method.Results:We evaluated 475 isolates of invasive neonatal infections. Predominant virulence factors were serotype III (63%), pilus island 2b and pilus island 1 (50%) and alp rib (64%) (alp - alpha-like protein, rib -resistance to proteases, immunity, group B). There was no significant change over time or geographically within Germany. Serotype III, pilus island 2b + 1 and alp rib showed significant associations with late-onset disease and meningitis, whereas alp 5 had a significant association with early-onset disease. Based on serotypes, pilus islands and alpha-like proteins, it was possible to cluster 86% of all isolates into 5 genetic groups.Conclusions:The molecular epidemiology of a large collection of invasive neonatal infections showed similar distributions, as shown in smaller cohorts before. The microarray used proved to be a fast and reliable technique. Using this new tool, we were able to cluster the isolates according to their virulence factors. The clusters showed a better association with clinical data than single virulence factors.

TI  - Territorial transformations in the peri-urban horticultural area of Mar del Plata (Argentina) and its incidence on water erosion processes
T2  - REVISTA DE GEOGRAFIA NORTE GRANDE
M3  - Article
AB  - The peri-urban spaces of Latin American cities exhibit deep territorial transformations and emerging problems from occupation without planning. The horticultural production, that characterizes numerous peri-urban areas, tends to expand and intensify without considering the potential and limitations of the resources that support it. The present paper characterizes the horticultural transformations of the peri-urban of Mar del Plata (Argentina) city, and analyze its incidence on erosion processes. Based on previous studies, a Landsat image (2017) was classified and the Universal Soil Loss Equation was applied in three landscape units previously defined. The open field horticultural surface increased 80% between 1989 and 2017, as well as current and potential erosion that reach 68,612 tn/year and 221,219 tn/year in 2017, respectively. It is proposed to advance in the diagnosis of the problem to define territorial management strategies in accordance with the principles of sustainability.

TI  - The Three-Segment Control and Measurement of Reliable Monitoring of the Deformation of the Rock Mass Surface and Engineering Structures on the Miedzyodrze Islands in Szczecin, NW Poland
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The research area is located in north-western Poland. It is the city of Szczecin with a particular emphasis on the Miedzyodrze islands. The area of the EcoGenerator Waste Disposal Plant is part of the research area. The analysis of the geological structure of the subsurface layer of Earth's crust within Szczecin, was carried out with particular emphasis on the EcoGenerator Waste Disposal Plant. The analysis of height changes of the benchmarks, was based on archival materials measured in two campaigns. A detailed recognition of the geological structure in connection with the analysis of changes in the height of the benchmarks was important. This enabled stable benchmarks to be located in several areas of Szczecin. They formed the basis for reliable monitoring of surface deformations of organic and existing sediments within the EkoGenerator Plant. The application of an appropriate three segment control and measurement system. In the area around the EcoGenerator Plant, vertical movements of the area were observed using the InSAR Small Baseline Subset Method. An InSAR analysis is only used here for very broad identification of the moving area. The radar data came from Sentinel 1 A and 1 B satellites. A total of 129 images from 15.11.2014 to 28.07.2019 were used.The results of the analyses conducted, form the basis for discussion and act as a summary of the considerations in this paper.

TI  - A model for the assessment of bluetongue virus serotype 1 persistence in Spain
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an arbovirus of ruminants that has been circulating in Europe continuously for more than two decades and has become endemic in some countries such as Spain. Spain is ideal for BTV epidemiological studies since BTV outbreaks from different sources and serotypes have occurred continuously there since 2000; BTV-1 has been reported there from 2007 to 2017. Here we develop a model for BTV-1 endemic scenario to estimate the risk of an area becoming endemic, as well as to identify the most influential factors for BTV-1 persistence. We created abundance maps at 1-km(2) spatial resolution for the main vectors in Spain, Culicoides imicola and Obsoletus and Pulicaris complexes, by combining environmental satellite data with occurrence models and a random forest machine learning algorithm. The endemic model included vector abundance and host-related variables (farm density). The three most relevant variables in the endemic model were the abundance of C. imicola and Obsoletus complex and density of goat farms (AUC 0.86); this model suggests that BTV-1 is more likely to become endemic in central and southwestern regions of Spain. It only requires host- and vector-related variables to identify areas at greater risk of becoming endemic for bluetongue. Our results highlight the importance of suitable Culicoides spp. prediction maps for bluetongue epidemiological studies and decision-making about control and eradication measures.

TI  - The centrality of evolution in biology teaching: towards a pluralistic perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The central importance of evolution to all biological sciences is recognised by many authors. Despite this scientific consensus, the theory of evolution is commonly presented as one discrete topic among many in the biology curriculum. Possible reasons for this scenario include discomfort with the content, ideological opposition and teachers' difficulties in concepts identified as essential for the understanding of evolution. In evolution education, there is a well-established literature on these aspects, but little has been discussed about the historical and philosophical issues concerning the challenges to the centrality of evolution in biology teaching. In this article, I argue that evolution at both basic and higher education levels is strongly based on the original evolutionary synthesis, with a focus on population genetics, and this is one of the reasons for the failure in establishing the centrality of evolution in biology teaching. Given the diversity and complexity of contemporary evolution theory, a more pluralistic perspective to evolutionary teaching is required. I propose that a causally pluralistic evolutionary worldview, which expands the range of causal factors contributing to evolutionary change, is essential when it comes to establishing the centrality of evolution in biology teaching.

TI  - Automated location correction and spot height generation for named summits in the coterminous United States
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Spot elevations published on historical U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps were established as needed to enhance information imparted by the quadrangle's contours. In addition to other features, labels were routinely placed on mountain summits. While some elevations were established through field survey triangulation, many were computed during photogrammetric stereo-compilation. Today, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers have replaced expensive triangulation methods. However, since GNSS measurements require visiting the feature location, a national dataset containing high-accuracy spot elevations has not yet been created. Consequently, modern U.S. Topo maps are devoid of mountain peak or other spot elevations. Still, topographic map users continue to demand the display of spot heights. Therefore, a pilot study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of automatically generating elevation values at named U.S. summits using available elevation data. The devised method uses an uphill stepping technique to find the most likely highest point in subsequently higher-resolution elevation models. Resulting elevation values are compared to other published sources. Results from 196 summits indicate that values derived from lidar are generally higher, whereas those populated from the one-third arc-second USGS Seamless 3DEP elevation dataset are generally lower. A thorough understanding of these relationships require the evaluation of more points.

TI  - Jacobian matrix for near-infrared remote sensing based on vector radiative transfer model
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the polarization effects of the Earth's surface reflection and atmospheric particles' scattering, high-precision retrieval of atmospheric parameters from near-infrared satellite data requires accurate vector atmospheric radiative transfer simulations. This paper presents a near-infrared vector radiative transfer model based on the doubling and adding method. This new model utilizes approximate calculations of the atmospheric transmittance, reflection, and solar scattering radiance for a finitely thin atmospheric layer. To verify its accuracy, the results for four typical scenarios (single molecular layer with Rayleigh scattering, single aerosol layer scattering, multi-layer Rayleigh scattering, and true atmospheric with multi-layer molecular absorption, Rayleigh and aerosol scattering) were compared with benchmarks from a well-known model. The comparison revealed an excellent agreement between the results and the reference data, with accuracy within a few thousandths. Besides, to fulfill the retrieval algorithm, a numerical differentiation-based Jacobian calculation method is developed for the atmospheric and surface parameters. This is coupled with the adding and doubling process for the radiative transfer calculation. The Jacobian matrix produced by the new algorithm is evaluated by comparison with that from the perturbation method. The relative Jacobian matrix deviations between the two methods are within a few thousandths for carbon dioxide and less than 1.0x10(-3)% for aerosol optical depth. The two methods are consistent for surface albedo, with a deviation below 2.03x10(-4)%. All validation results suggest that the accuracy of the proposed radiative transfer model is suitable for inversion applications. This model exhibits the potential for simulating near-infrared measurements of greenhouse gas monitoring instruments.

TI  - Mapping rainstorm erosion associated with an individual storm from InSAR coherence loss validated by field evidence for the Atacama Desert
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme high-magnitude and low-frequency storm events in arid zones provide the necessary runoff to entrain sediments from source areas and therefore dictate the linkages between hillslopes and channels. Nevertheless, the erosive impact of large storms remains difficult to predict. Most of the uncertainty lies in the lack of topographic change maps associated with single hydro-meteorological events. Consequently, event-based erosion models are poorly constrained and their extrapolation over long time periods remains uncertain. In this study, a 15-month Sentinel-1A coherence time series, optical and field data are used to map the spatial patterns of erosion after the 5-day storm occurred on March 2015, in the Atacama Desert. The coherence change detection (CCD) analysis suggests that temporal loss of coherence is related to variations in soil moisture, while permanent loss of coherence is related to modification of soil texture by erosion and sedimentation. Importantly, permanent loss of coherence is more apparent on gentle rather than steeper slopes, likely reflecting differences in regolith cover and thickness. These findings can contradict the landscape models predicting higher erosion on steeper hillslopes. The CCD technique represents a promising tool for analysing and modelling sediment connectivity in arid areas, giving a clear picture of the relation between sediment sources and sink pathways.

TI  - Genetic variability of human adenovirus type 7 circulating in mainland China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human adenovirus (HAdV-7) is a highly contagious pathogen that causes severe respiratory illnesses. However, the epidemic patterns and genetic variability of HAdV-7 circulating in mainland China have not been well elucidated. In this study, we used Chinese HAdV sentinel surveillance data obtained from 2012-2015 to investigate the clinical features of 122 HAdV-7-positive cases and performed amplification and sequence determination of three capsid genes (penton base, hexon, and fiber) from 69 isolated viruses covering from seven provinces of China. Additionally, we compared with data from representative sequences of 21 strains covering seven more provinces in China and 32 international HAdV-7 strains obtained from GenBank database to determine the phylogenetic, sequence variations, and molecular evolution of HAdV-7. The results indicated that HAdV-7 infection occurred throughout the year, and a high proportion of severe cases (27 cases, 22.1%) exhibited infantile pneumonia. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis showed that all HAdV-7 strains could be divided into two major evolutionary branches, including subtype 1 and subtype 2, and subtype 3 was also formed according to analysis of the penton base gene. Subtypes 1 and 2 co-circulated in China before 2008, and HAdV-7 strains currently circulating in China belonged to subtype 2, which was also the predominant strain circulating worldwide in recent years. Further sequence variation analysis indicated that three genes of HAdV-7 were relatively stable across time and geographic space, particularly for viruses within subtypes, which shared almost the same variation sites. Owing to continuous outbreaks caused by HAdV-7, resulting in increased illness severity and fatality rates in China, the establishment of a national HAdV surveillance system is urgently needed for the development of effective preventive and infection-control interventions for adenovirus respiratory infections in China.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing Contributions to Wildland Fire Science and Management
T2  - CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper reviews the most recent literature related to the use of remote sensing (RS) data in wildland fire management. Recent Findings Studies dealing with pre-fire assessment, active fire detection, and fire effect monitoring are reviewed in this paper. The analysis follows the different fire management categories: fire prevention, detection, and post-fire assessment. Extracting the main trends from each of these temporal sections, recent RS literature shows growing support of the combined use of different sensors, particularly optical and radar data and lidar and optical passive images. Dedicated fire sensors have been developed in the last years, but still, most fire products are derived from sensors that were designed for other purposes. Therefore, the needs of fire managers are not always met, both in terms of spatial and temporal scales, favouring global over local scales because of the spatial resolution of existing sensors. Lidar use on fuel types and post-fire regeneration is more local, and mostly not operational, but future satellite lidar systems may help to obtain operational products. Regional and global scales are also combined in the last years, emphasizing the needs of using upscaling and merging methods to reduce uncertainties of global products. Validation is indicated as a critical phase of any new RS-based product. It should be based on the independent reference information acquired from statistically derived samples. The main challenges of using RS for fire management rely on the need to improve the integration of sensors and methods to meet user requirements, uncertainty characterization of products, and greater efforts on statistical validation approaches.

TI  - Surface deformation relating to the 2018 Lake Muir earthquake sequence, southwest Western Australia: new insight into stable continental region earthquakes
T2  - SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - A shallow M-w 5.3 earthquake near Lake Muir in the stable continental region (SCR) crust of southwest Western Australia on the 16 September 2018 was followed on the 8 November by a proximal M-w 5.2 event. Focal mechanisms produced for the events suggest reverse and strike-slip rupture, respectively. Field mapping, guided by Sentinel-1 InSAR data, reveals that the first event produced an approximately 3 km long and up to 0.4-0.6 m high west-facing surface rupture, consistent with reverse slip on a moderately east-dipping fault. The InSAR data also show that the surface scarp relates to a subsurface rupture similar to 5 km long, bound at its northern and southern extremities by bedrock structures. The November event produced a surface deformation envelope that is spatially coincident with that of the September event but did not result in discrete surface rupture. Almost 900 aftershocks were recorded by a temporary seismometer deployment. Hypocentre locations correlate poorly with the rupture plane of their respective mainshocks but correlate well with regions of increased Coulomb stress. The spatial and temporal relationships between the M-w > 5.0 events and their aftershocks reveals dependencies with implications for how other less well-documented SCR earthquake sequences could be interpreted. Furthermore, the September M-w 5.3 Lake Muir earthquake was the ninth event documented to have produced surface rupture in Australia in historical times. These nine ruptures are located exclusively in the Precambrian non-extended SCR rocks of central and western Australia, and none could have been identified and mapped using topographic signature prior to the historical event. Consistent, though fragmentary, evidence exists from analogous regions worldwide. Our analysis of the Lake Muir earthquake sequence therefore provides constraint on models describing mechanisms for strain accumulation and localized release as earthquakes in non-extended SRC crust.

TI  - The San Eduardo Landslide (Eastern Cordillera of Colombia): Reactivation of a deep-seated gravitational slope deformation
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent San Eduardo Landslide (SEL), reactivated on the nighttime of September 20, 2018, is hypothesized as the lowest part of a large-scale deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) covering an area not less than 45 km(2). Based upon remote sensing analysis through aerial photography, accompanied by fieldwork, this work attempts to identify the morphostructural features developed after reactivation of the SEL, as well as relict features upslope indicating active sagging of the adjacent mountain slopes. A preliminary segmentation of the SEL into three zones (SEL-1 to SEL-3) is proposed in order to describe the spatial distribution of extensional (e.g., uphill-facing scarps, trenches), compressional (toe bulging), and shear zones within the slid mass. To complement the geomorphological approach, displacement vectors and motion rates were derived by comparing a 5-month time series of free-cloud Sentinel 2 imagery acquired from September 2018 to February 2019. This approach helps to identify a peak motion rate of > 4 m/day in zones SEL-2 (between September 18 and 28, 2018) and SEL-3 (between September 8, 2018, and October 8, 2018). By February 2019, the motion rate decreased to less than 30 cm/day. The potential mechanisms explaining the triggering/reactivation of the large slope deformation observed are the cumulative displacement on a shale-dominated slope, and the high topographic stresses expected for this high-relief area in the Colombian Eastern Cordillera. Finally, this work explores the geomorphological evidence of a second DSGSD (sackung type) in the area, which in turn suggests that gravitational deformation is probably a more common deformation mechanism in the range than previously considered.

TI  - Ground subsidence and heave over permafrost: hourly time series reveal interannual, seasonal and shorter-term movement caused by freezing, thawing and water movement
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Heave and subsidence of the ground surface can offer insight into processes of heat and mass transfer in freezing and thawing soils. Additionally, subsidence is an important metric for monitoring and understanding the transformation of permafrost landscapes under climate change. Corresponding ground observations, however, are sparse and episodic. A simple tilt-arm apparatus with logging inclinometer has been developed to measure heave and subsidence of the ground surface with hourly resolution and millimeter accuracy. This contribution reports data from the first two winters and the first full summer, measured at three sites with contrasting organic and frost-susceptible soils in warm permafrost. The patterns of surface movement differ significantly between sites and from a prediction based on the Stefan equation and observed ground temperature. The data are rich in features of heave and subsidence that are several days to several weeks long and that may help elucidate processes in the ground. For example, late-winter heave followed by thawing and subsidence, as reported in earlier literature and hypothesized to be caused by infiltration and refreezing of water into permeable frozen ground, has been detected. An early-winter peak in heave, followed by brief subsidence, is discernible in a previous publication but so far has not been interpreted. An effect of precipitation on changes in surface elevation can be inferred with confidence. These results high-light the potential of ground-based observation of subsidence and heave as an enabler of progress in process understanding, modeling and interpretation of remotely sensed data.

TI  - Genesis or Evolution of Gender Differences? Worldview-Based Dilemmas in The Processing of Scientific Information.
T2  - Journal of cognition
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Some issues that have been settled by the scientific community, such as evolution, the effectiveness of vaccinations, and the role of CO2 emissions in climate change, continue to be rejected by segments of the public. This rejection is typically driven by people's worldviews, and to date most research has found that conservatives are uniformly more likely to reject scientific findings than liberals across a number of domains. We report a large (N > 1,000) preregistered study that addresses two questions: First, can we find science denial on the left? Endorsement of pseudoscientific complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) has been anecdotally cited as being more consonant with liberals than conservatives. Against this claim, we found more support for CAM among conservatives than liberals. Second, we asked how liberals and conservatives resolve dilemmas in which an issue triggers two opposing facets of their worldviews. We probed attitudes on gender equality and the evolution of sex differences-two constructs that may create conflicts for liberals (who endorse evolution but also equality) and conservatives (who endorse gender differences but are sceptical of evolution). We find that many conservatives reject both gender equality and evolution of sex differences, and instead embrace "naturally occurring" gender differences. Many liberals, by contrast, reject evolved gender differences, as well as naturally occurring gender differences, while nonetheless strongly endorsing evolution.

TI  - An improved NDVI-based method to predict actual evapotranspiration of irrigated grasses and crops
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent investigations have shown the potential of a water balance method based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa) of Mediterranean grasslands and croplands. The method uses the Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) derived from NDVI to separately estimate vegetation transpiration and bare soil evaporation, which are limited by short-term meteorological water stress scalars. The current paper proposes a modification of these scalars to address the occurrence of water supply additional to rainfall, i.e. irrigated condition. The modified method utilises the temporal evolution of FVC since the beginning of the water stress period to infer the occurrence of irrigation and consequently modify the water scalars. The new method is tested in two study areas in Tuscany (Central Italy), where meadows and annual crops are grown in both rainfed and irrigated conditions. The high spatial fragmentation of these areas is addressed by the use of imagery taken by the recently launched Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), which allows the identification of all main seasonal NDVI evolutions. The tests firstly demonstrate the null or marginal impact of the modification in rainfed condition. Secondly, the effect of the modified water stress scalars is evaluated for irrigated grasses and crops. The latter case includes two experiments in which the original and modified ETa estimates are assessed against relevant ground observations obtained by the processing of meteorological and soil water content datasets. The experimental results indicate that the new method is capable of correctly identifying the occurrence of irrigation and consequently improves the ETa estimation accuracy for irrigated grasses and crops. In particular, the modified method accounts for about 90 % of the seasonal ETa variance observed in the irrigated meadow and tomato field.

TI  - Evidence of infection with <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> and <i>Neospora caninum</i> in South Australia: using wild rabbits as a sentinel species
T2  - AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to utilise wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) as a sentinel species to study levels of environmental contamination with N. caninum and T. gondii in South Australia, and to examine associations with rainfall, climate and land use.Design Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an apicomplexan parasite, causes the clinical disease toxoplasmosis, which can affect sheep as well as humans and many other animals. Neosporosis, the clinical disease caused by closely related Neospora caninum (N. caninum), causes abortions in cattle, with large economic impacts to cattle industries.Methods Aliquots of wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) serum were obtained from twelve sites across South Australia over a period of eighteen years, with a total of 2114 samples. An in-house Modified Agglutination Test (MAT) was developed, and samples were screened for the specific antibodies against both T.gondii and N. caninum. Results: Overall, 9.9% of samples screened for T. gondii tested positive and 6.1% of samples screened for N. caninum tested positive. There was no difference observed in seroprevalence of T.gondii specific antibodies between samples collected throughout summer, autumn, winter or spring. By contrast, a significantly higher (p=0.030) seroprevalence of N. caninum specific antibodies was observed in spring than any other season. T. gondii and N. caninum antibodies were discovered at sites across a broad area of South Australia, indicating these environments maybe infected with both parasites.Conclusion Results provide evidence that suggests N. caninum oocysts may have different survival characteristics, such as varying tolerances to low relative humidity, than T. gondii oocysts.

TI  - Development and Optimization of a High-Content Analysis Platform to Identify Suppressors of Lamin B1 Overexpression as a Therapeutic Strategy for Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy
T2  - SLAS DISCOVERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a fatal, progressive adult-onset disease characterized by widespread central nervous system (CNS) demyelination and significant morbidity. The late age of onset together with the relatively slow disease progression provides a large therapeutic window for the disorder. However, no treatment exists for ADLD, representing an urgent and unmet clinical need. We have previously shown that ADLD is caused by duplications of the lamin B1 gene causing increased expression of the lamin B1 protein, a major constituent of the nuclear lamina, and demonstrated that transgenic mice with oligodendrocyte-specific overexpression of lamin B1 exhibit temporal and histopathological features reminiscent of the human disease. As increased levels of lamin B1 are the causative event triggering ADLD, approaches aimed at reducing lamin B1 levels and associated functional consequences represent a promising strategy for discovery of small-molecule ADLD therapeutics. To this end, we have created an inducible cell culture model of lamin B1 overexpression and developed high-content analysis in connection with multivariate analysis to define, analyze, and quantify lamin B1 expression and its associated abnormal nuclear phenotype in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The assay has been optimized to meet high-throughput screening (HTS) criteria in multiday variability studies. To control for batch-to-batch variation in the primary MEFs, we have implemented a screening strategy that employs sentinel cells to avoid costly losses during HTS. We posit the assay will identify bona fide suppressors of lamin B1 pathophysiology as candidates for development into potential therapies for ADLD.

TI  - Performance of SAFER evapotranspiration using missing meteorological data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving (SAFER) can be used to estimate surface evapotranspiration. In the process of SAFER parameterization, the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) calculated by the Penman-Monteith (PM) method was included. However, methodologies for estimating ETo that use fewer meteorological variables should be sought, mainly to increase the applicability of the method in regions where there are no complete weather stations. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the ETo calculated with estimated data on the calculation of surface evapotranspiration using SAFER (ETSAFER) in the Brazilian semiarid region. The study was carried out in areas of centre pivots cultivated with sugarcane located in the public irrigated perimeter of Jaiba, MG, Brazil. ETo and its impact on ETSAFER were analysed using meteorological data from a station belonging to the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) as well as data from 19 images of the Landsat 8 satellite from 2013, 2014 and 2016. The ETSAFER responses were analysed from the calculations of ETo estimated by the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) and PM methods with missing data including single absences of solar radiation (R-s), wind speed (U-2), relative humidity (RH) and combined absences of U-2 and RH, U-2, RH and R-s, R-s and U-2, and R-s and RH. The temporal and spatial variability of ETSAFER for sugarcane crops was assessed. R-s was the parameter that most affected ETo and, consequently, ETSAFER. ETSAFER was underestimated when calculated using the ETo estimated by PM with missing R-s data and overestimated when the ETo was calculated by HS. In the absence of single or combined data of U-2 and RH, it is recommended to estimate ETo by PM with missing data for the calculation of ETSAFER. It is not advised to use the ETo obtained by the HS method for calculating ETSAFER in semiarid regions.

TI  - Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality Applications Based on Satellite-Borne and ISS-Borne Remote Sensing Data for School Lessons
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Facing global challenges, a qualified education in remote sensing technologies needs to start in school to sensitise teachers and thus young people for ecological issues and develop their technological skills. Remote sensing is part of the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) curricular topics, all of which are either a requirement for or benefit from remote sensing. However, implementing its data and methods into regular curricula poses technological and educational challenges, given the lack of appropriate school IT infrastructure and remote sensing education for aspiring STEM teachers. Immersive media can overcome these structural issues, using the teachers' and pupils' smartphones to display and interact, e.g. with video data, astronaut photographs, or complex hyperspectral data. The data needs to be pre-processed for Augmented and Virtual Reality applications (AR and VR, resp.) to fit topic, available devices and software. Game development software allows for easy integration in apps for AR and VR, but does not contain functions for remote sensing methods. These are either implemented directly in scripts, worked around using less computing-intensive methods or replaced by methods unique to augmented and virtual reality. Following these premises, five AR apps are presented in this report, teaching about tropical cyclones, anthropogenic desertification, energy consumption, gravitation, and algal blooms, all of which use remote sensing data from different sensors aboard the ISS. One VR app teaching about Mount Fuji was developed using a DEM derived from astronaut photographs. All have different levels of interactivity and are embedded in worksheets that fill a double period.

TI  - Association between maternal exposure to particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Lima, Peru
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The literature shows associations between maternal exposures to PM2.5 and adverse pregnancy outcomes. There are few data from Latin America. We have examined PM2.5 and pregnancy outcomes in Lima. The study included 123,034 births from 2012 to 2016, at three public hospitals. We used estimated daily PM2.5 from a newly created model developed using ground measurements, satellite data, and a chemical transport model. Exposure was assigned based on district of residence (n = 39). Linear and logistic regression analyzes were used to estimate the associations between air pollution exposure and pregnancy outcomes. Increased exposure to PM2.5 during the entire pregnancy and in the first trimester was inversely associated with birth weight. We found a decrease of 8.13 g (-14.0; -1.84) overall and 18.6 g (-24.4, -12.8) in the first trimester, for an interquartile range (IQR) increase (9.2 mu g/m(3)) in PM2.5. PM2.5 exposure was positively associated with low birth weight at term (TLBW) during entire pregnancy (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.03-1.20), and at the first (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.03-1.20), second (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.01-1.17), and third trimester (OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.02-1.18) per IQR (9.2 mu g/m(3)) increase. Higher exposure to PM2.5 was also associated with increased risk of small for gestational age (SGA). There were no statistically significant associations between PM2.5 exposure and preterm births (PTB). Exposure to higher concentrations of PM2.5 in Lima may decrease birth weight and increase the frequency of TLBW and SGA. Our study was inconsistent with the literature in finding no associations with preterm birth.

TI  - Stand density extraction and analysis of plantations based on QuickBird and Worldview-2 images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stand density is one of the important forest structure parameters. QuickBird and Worldview-2 high spatial resolution remote sensing images were compared. The Jiangle state-owned forest farm in Fujian Province was the experimental area. A spectral local maximum filtering method was used to extract the number of individual trees in a mountain forest. Nonlinear quadratic polynomial regression models were established for the number of local maximum points and the actual stand density. The near-infrared II waveband of Worldview-2 imagery was used to extract the pure Chinese fir stands with an accuracy of 72.5%, R-2 = 0.502, and RMSE = 35.77 and the Masson pine stands with an accuracy of 78.35%, R-2 = 0.754, RMSE = 41.46, while the accuracy of all unclassified stands was only 0.2907. The results showed that the classification of tree species can improve the accuracy of modeling. The quadratic polynomial model using Worldview-2 image data achieved better results. Stand density in the Jiangle state-owned forest farm was extracted using the NIR II band after fusion of Worldview-2. A stand density planning map was constructed using the best models applied to the different forest types. The method of combining high-spatial resolution imagery and sampling plots to estimate stand density was proven to be feasible. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Migratory behaviour and survival of Great Egrets after range expansion in Central Europe
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Great Egret Ardea alba is one of few Western Palearctic species that underwent a rapid range expansion in the recent decades. Originally breeding in central and eastern Europe, the species has spread in northern (up to the Baltic coast) and western (up to the western France) directions and established viable breeding populations throughout almost entire continent. We monitored one of the first Great Egrets colonies established in Poland to infer migratory patterns and survival rates directly after range expansion. For this purpose, we collected resightings from over 200 Great Egret chicks marked between 2002-2017 in central Poland. Direction of migration was non-random, as birds moved almost exclusively into the western direction. Wintering grounds were located mainly in the western Europe (Germany to France) within 800-950 km from the breeding colony. First-year birds migrated farther than adults. We found some, although relatively weak, support for age-dependent survival of Great Egrets and under the best-fitted capture-recapture model, the estimated annual survival rate of adults was nearly twice higher than for first-year birds (phi(ad) = 0.85 +/- 0.05 vs. phi(fy) = 0.48 +/- 0.15). Annual survival rate under the constant model (no age-related variation) was estimated at phi = 0.81 +/- 0.05. Our results suggest that Great Egrets rapidly adapted to novel ecological and environmental conditions during range expansion. We suggest that high survival rate of birds from central Poland and their western direction of migration may facilitate further colonization processes in western Europe.

TI  - Assessment of the quality of TROPOMI high-spatial-resolution NO<sub>2</sub> data products in the Greater Toronto Area
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite (launched on 13 October 2017) is a nadir-viewing spectrometer measuring reflected sunlight in the ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared spectral ranges. The measured spectra are used to retrieve total columns of trace gases, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2). For ground validation of these satellite measurements, Pandora spectrometers, which retrieve high-quality NO2 total columns via direct-sun measurements, are widely used. In this study, Pandora NO2 measurements made at three sites located in or north of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) are used to evaluate the TROPOMI NO2 data products, including a standard Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) tropospheric and stratospheric NO2 data product and a TROPOMI research data product developed by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) using a high-resolution regional air quality forecast model (in the air mass factor calculation). It is found that these current TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 data products (standard and ECCC) met the TROPOMI design bias requirement (< 10 %). Using the statistical uncertainty estimation method, the estimated TROPOMI upper-limit precision falls below the design requirement at a rural site but above in the other two urban and suburban sites. The Pandora instruments are found to have sufficient precision (< 0.02 DU) to perform TROPOMI validation work. In addition to the traditional satellite validation method (i.e., pairing ground-based measurements with satellite measurements closest in time and space), we analyzed TROPOMI pixels located upwind and downwind from the Pandora site. This makes it possible to improve the statistics and better interpret the high-spatial-resolution measurements made by TROPOMI. By using this wind-based validation technique, the number of coincident measurements can be increased by about a factor of 5. With this larger number of coincident measurements, this work shows that both TROPOMI and Pandora instruments can reveal detailed spatial patterns (i.e., horizontal distributions) of local and transported NO2 emissions, which can be used to evaluate regional air quality changes. The TROPOMI ECCC NO2 research data product shows improved agreement with Pandora measurements compared to the TROPOMI standard tropospheric NO2 data product (e.g., lower multiplicative bias at the suburban and urban sites by about 10 %), demonstrating benefits from the high-resolution regional air quality forecast model.

TI  - Multi-Caged IrO<i><sub>x</sub></i> for Facile Preparation of "Six-in-One" Nanoagent for Subcutaneous and Lymphatic Tumors Inhibition against Recurrence and Metastasis
T2  - ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Single nanocarriers with intrinsic characteristics of diagnosis, effective therapy against solid malignancies with fatal metastasis, and tumor microenvironment regulation are promising in construction of a simple and effective multimode nanotheranostic system. Herein, multi-caged IrOx nanocarriers are fabricated by direct thermal hydrolysis strategy, which exhibit good sono-photodynamic response, outstanding gemstone spectral computed tomography, and photoacoustic (PA) imaging capabilities, universal loading, and pinpoint drug release properties. As a proof of concept, a gemstone spectral computed tomography/PA/fluorescence imaging-guided oxygen self-sufficient sono-photo-chemotherapy nanoagent by simple loading of doxorubicin is constructed. The remarkable synergistic therapy and excellent hypoxia releasing capabilities can remove both subcutaneous and sentinel lymph nodes metastasis tumors, and effectively suppress tumor recurrence and lung metastasis, thus greatly prolonging survival time. The study provides an attractive candidate to construct a "six-in-one" (tri-modal therapies and three imaging modalities) tumor theranostic system.

TI  - Prognostic Value of Lymph Node Ratio in Breast Cancer Patients with Adequate Pathologic Evidence After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The prognostic role of axillary lymph node ratio (LNR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer has not been illuminated. This study was designed to investigate the prognostic role of LNR in breast cancer compared with traditional ypN stage.Material/Methods: A total of 306 breast cancer patients diagnosed with positive axillary lymph nodes from January 2007 to December 2014 were eligible for this retrospective analysis. All enrolled patients were treated with a median of 4 cycles of NAC followed by mastectomy and level I, II, and III axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).Results: The median duration of follow-up was 78 months (range, 7-147 months). Univariate analysis indicated that both the LNR category (P<0.001) and ypN stage (P<0.001) were significant associated with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). However, multivariate analysis indicated that the LNR category was independently associated with EFS (P<0.001) and OS (P<0.001), while the ypN stage showed no statistical effect on EFS (P=0.391) or OS (P=0.081). On additional analyses stratified by molecular subtypes, we found that the prognosis of triple negative breast cancer could be better discriminated when the cutoff value of LNR was set at 0.15.Conclusions: LNR showed a superior predictive value in evaluating prognosis of breast cancer patients after NAC. In addition, the LNR cutoff point 0.15 can accurately discriminate survival outcomes for different triple negative breast cancer subtypes.

TI  - Optimizing precision irrigation of a vineyard to improve water use efficiency and profitability by using a decision-oriented vine water consumption model
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - While the agronomic and economic benefits of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies have long been established in red wine grape varieties, spatial variability in water requirements across a vineyard limits their practical application. This study aims to evaluate the performance of an integrated methodology-based on a vine water consumption model and remote sensing data-to optimize the precision irrigation (PI) of a 100-ha commercial vineyard during two consecutive growing seasons. In addition, a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was conducted of the tested strategy. Using an NDVI generated map, a vineyard with 52 irrigation sectors and the varieties Tempranillo, Cabernet and Syrah was classified in three categories (Low, Medium and High). The proposed methodology allowed viticulturists to adopt a precise RDI strategy, and, despite differences in water requirement between irrigation sectors, pre-defined stem water potential thresholds were not exceeded. In both years, the difference between maximum and minimum water applied in the different irrigation sectors varied by as much as 25.6%. Annual transpiration simulations showed ranges of 240.1-340.8 mm for 2016 and 298.6-366.9 mm for 2017. According to the CBA, total savings of 7090.00 euro (2016) and 9960.00 euro (2017) were obtained in the 100-ha vineyard with the PI strategy compared to not PI. After factoring in PI technology and labor costs of 5090 euro, the net benefit was 20.0 euro ha(-1) in 2016 and 48.7 euro ha(-1) in 2017. The water consumption model adopted here to optimize PI is shown to enhance vineyard profitability, water use efficiency and yield.

TI  - High Arctic Vegetation Change Mediated by Hydrological Conditions
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing air temperatures are driving widespread changes to Arctic vegetation. In the high Arctic, these changes are patchy and the causes of heterogeneity are not well understood. In this study, we explore the determinants of high Arctic vegetation change over the last three decades on Banks Island, Northwest Territories. We used Landsat imagery (1984-2014) to map long-term trends in vegetation productivity and regional spatial data to investigate the relationships between trends in productivity and terrain position. Field sampling investigated vegetation community composition in different habitat types. Our analysis shows that vegetation productivity changes are substantial on Banks Island, where productivity has increased across about 80% of the study area. Rising productivity levels can be attributed to increasing biomass of the plant communities in both upland and lowland habitats. Our analysis also shows that the magnitude of greening is mediated by terrain characteristics related to soil moisture. Shifts in tundra vegetation will impact wildlife habitat quality, surface energy balance, permafrost dynamics, and the carbon cycle; additional research is needed to explore the effects of more productive vegetation communities on these processes in the high Arctic.

TI  - Aboveground biomass estimation of an agro-pastoral ecology in semi-arid Bundelkhand region of India from Landsat data: a comparison of support vector machine and traditional regression models
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compared the traditional regression models and support vector machine (SVM) for estimation of aboveground biomass (ABG) of an agro-pastoral ecology using vegetation indices derived from Landsat 8 satellite data as explanatory variables . The area falls in the Shivpuri Tehsil of Madhya Pradesh, India, which is predominantly a semi-arid tract of the Bundelkhand region. The Enhanced Vegetation Index-1 (EVI-1) was identified as the most suitable input variable for the regression models, although the collective effect of a number of the vegetation indices was evident. The EVI-1 was also the most suitable input variable to SVM, due to its capacity to distinctly differentiate diverse vegetation classes. The performance of SVM was better over regression models for estimation of the AGB. Based on the SVM-derived and the ground observations, the AGB of the area was precisely mapped for croplands, grassland and rangelands over the entire region.

TI  - Health needs of indigenous Mayan older adults in Mexico and health services available
T2  - HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current data indicate that inequitable health service access is one of the major problems faced by indigenous people in Mexico and around the world. The aim of this study was to analyse the perceived health needs of indigenous older adults in a Mayan region of Mexico and the health services provided to address these needs. It used a qualitative design which explored health needs, perceptions of well-being, experiences with public health services and obstacles in accessing services through semi-structured interviews with 20 older adults, nine traditional healers and seven public healthcare providers from Mayan municipalities in southeastern Mexico during 2013-2014. We identified that cultural differences related to the language, values, beliefs and worldview of indigenous populations are ignored or incorporated only minimally by health services. The provision of services does not correspond to the health needs of indigenous Mayan older adults, and wide gaps still undermine their human rights and health status; despite the establishment of favourable regulations, healthcare services are organised for the non-indigenous population. The conditions of social vulnerability affecting indigenous older adults require that healthcare institutions incorporate an intercultural approach in order to improve the quality of care according to the necessities of the population.

TI  - Vegetation-groundwater dynamics at a former uranium mill site following invasion of a biocontrol agent: A time series analysis of Landsat normalized difference vegetation index data
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Because groundwater recharge in dry regions is generally low, arid and semiarid environments have been considered well-suited for long-term isolation of hazardous materials (e.g., radioactive waste). In these dry regions, water lost (transpired) by plants and evaporated from the soil surface, collectively termed evapotranspiration (ET), is usually the primary discharge component in the water balance. Therefore, vegetation can potentially affect groundwater flow and contaminant transport at waste disposal sites. We studied vegetation health and ET dynamics at a Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) disposal site in Shiprock, New Mexico, where a floodplain alluvial aquifer was contaminated by mill effluent. Vegetation on the floodplain was predominantly deep-rooted, non-native tamarisk shrubs (Tamarix sp.). After the introduction of the tamarisk beetle (Diorhabda sp.) as a biocontrol agent, the health of the invasive tamarisk on the Shiprock floodplain declined. We used Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to measure greenness and a remote sensing algorithm to estimate landscape-scale ET along the floodplain of the UMTRCA site in Shiprock prior to (2000-2009) and after (2010-2018) beetle establishment. Using groundwater level data collected from 2011 to 2014, we also assessed the role of ET in explaining seasonal variations in depth to water of the floodplain. Growing season scaled NDVI decreased 30% (p <.001), while ET decreased 26% from the pre- to post-beetle period and seasonal ET estimates were significantly correlated with groundwater levels from 2011 to 2014 (r(2) =.71; p =.009). Tamarisk greenness (a proxy for health) was significantly affected by Diorhabda but has partially recovered since 2012. Despite this, increased ET demand in the summer/fall period might reduce contaminant transport to the San Juan River during this period.

TI  - Monitoring Narrow Mangrove Stands in Baja California Sur, Mexico Using Linear Spectral Unmixing
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Small stands of mangrove trees are difficult to detect and monitor using satellite remote sensing because the width of the narrow strips of vegetation are typically much smaller than the spatial resolution of the imagery. Every mangrove pixel also contains water and bare soil reflectance. Linear spectral unmixing, which estimates the fractional presence of specific land cover types per pixel, was performed on Landsat 8 imagery to detect mangroves on the eastern shoreline of the Bay of La Paz on the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico. Low-altitude aerial imagery collected from a DJI Mavic Pro drone was used as ground-reference data in the accuracy assessment. Continuous fractional presence of mangroves was detected with 80% accuracy and 85% of mangrove area was found. Future work will use linear spectral unmixing to systematically monitor mangrove extent and health in the region relative to expected growth in tourism development.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Invited perspectives: How machine learning will change flood risk and impact assessment
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing amounts of data, together with more computing power and better machine learning algorithms to analyse the data, are causing changes in almost every aspect of our lives. This trend is expected to continue as more data keep becoming available, computing power keeps improving and machine learning algorithms keep improving as well. Flood risk and impact assessments are also being influenced by this trend, particularly in areas such as the development of mitigation measures, emergency response preparation and flood recovery planning. Machine learning methods have the potential to improve accuracy as well as reduce calculating time and model development cost. It is expected that in the future more applications will become feasible and many process models and traditional observation methods will be replaced by machine learning. Examples of this include the use of machine learning on remote sensing data to estimate exposure and on social media data to improve flood response. Some improvements may require new data collection efforts, such as for the modelling of flood damages or defence failures. In other components, machine learning may not always be suitable or should be applied complementary to process models, for example in hydrodynamic applications. Overall, machine learning is likely to drastically improve future flood risk and impact assessments, but issues such as applicability, bias and ethics must be considered carefully to avoid misuse. This paper presents some of the current developments on the application of machine learning in this field and highlights some key needs and challenges.

TI  - Low-frequency sea level variability and impact of recent sea ice decline on the sea level trend in the Arctic Ocean from a high-resolution simulation
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic Ocean is undergoing significant changes, with rapid sea ice decline, unprecedented freshwater accumulation, and pronounced regional sea level rise. In this paper, we analyzed the sea level variation in the Arctic Ocean based on a global simulation with 4.5-km resolution in the Arctic Ocean using the multi-resolution Finite Element Sea Ice-Ocean Model (FESOM). The simulation reasonably reproduces both the main spatial features of the sea surface height (SSH) and its temporal evolution in the Arctic Ocean in comparison with tide gauge and satellite data. Using the model results, we investigated the low-frequency variability of the Arctic SSH. Both the first two dominant modes of the annual-mean SSH evolution in the Arctic Ocean present decadal variability and can be mainly attributed to the variability of the halosteric height, thus the freshwater content. The first mode can be explained by the Arctic Oscillation (AO). The AO-related atmospheric circulation drives the accumulation and release of freshwater in the Arctic deep basin and the consequent ocean mass change over the continental shelf, leading to the antiphase changes in SSH between the shelf seas and the deep basin. The second mode shows an antiphase oscillation between the two Arctic deep basins, the Amerasian and Eurasian Basins, which is driven by the Arctic dipole anomaly (DA). The DA-related wind anomaly causes a spatial redistribution of freshwater between the two basins, leading to the antiphase SSH changes. By using a dedicated sensitivity simulation in which the recent sea ice decline is eliminated, we find that the sea ice decline contributed considerably to the observed sea level rise in the Amerasian Basin in the recent decades. Although the sea ice decline did not change the mean SSH averaged over the Arctic Ocean, it significantly changed the spatial pattern of the SSH trend. Our finding indicates that both the wind regime and ongoing sea ice decline should be considered to better understand and predict the changes in regional sea level in the Arctic Ocean.

TI  - Engineered niches support the development of human dendritic cells in humanized mice
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Classical dendritic cells (cDCs) are rare sentinel cells specialized in the regulation of adaptive immunity. Modeling cDC development is crucial to study cDCs and harness their therapeutic potential. Here we address whether cDCs could differentiate in response to trophic cues delivered by mesenchymal components of the hematopoietic niche. We find that mesenchymal stromal cells engineered to express membrane-bound FLT3L and stem cell factor (SCF) together with CXCL12 induce the specification of human cDCs from CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Engraftment of engineered mesenchymal stromal cells (eMSCs) together with CD34(+) HSPCs creates an in vivo synthetic niche in the dermis of immunodeficient mice driving the differentiation of cDCs and CD123(+)AXL(+)CD327(+) pre/AS-DCs. cDC2s generated in vivo display higher levels of resemblance with human blood cDCs unattained by in vitro-generated subsets. Altogether, eMSCs provide a unique platform recapitulating the full spectrum of cDC subsets enabling their functional characterization in vivo. Classical human dendritic cells (cDCs) are rare sentinel cells specialized in regulating adaptive immunity. Here, the authors show that expression of membrane bound FLT3L, along with stem cell factor (SCF) and CXCL12 in stromal cells induces specification of pre/AS-DCs, type 1 and type2 cDC from haematopoietic stem cells.

TI  - Survey of entity encounter experiences occasioned by inhaled <i>N,N</i>-dimethyltryptamine: Phenomenology, interpretation, and enduring effects
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Experiences of having an encounter with seemingly autonomous entities are sometimes reported after inhaling N,N-dimethyltryptamine.Aim:The study characterized the subjective phenomena, interpretation, and persisting changes that people attribute to N,N-dimethyltryptamine-occasioned entity encounter experiences.Methods:Two thousand, five hundred and sixty-one individuals (mean age 32 years; 77% male) completed an online survey about their single most memorable entity encounter after taking N,N-dimethyltryptamine.Results:Respondents reported the primary senses involved in the encounter were visual and extrasensory (e.g. telepathic). The most common descriptive labels for the entity were being, guide, spirit, alien, and helper. Although 41% of respondents reported fear during the encounter, the most prominent emotions both in the respondent and attributed to the entity were love, kindness, and joy. Most respondents endorsed that the entity had the attributes of being conscious, intelligent, and benevolent, existed in some real but different dimension of reality, and continued to exist after the encounter. Respondents endorsed receiving a message (69%) or a prediction about the future (19%) from the experience. More than half of those who identified as atheist before the experience no longer identified as atheist afterwards. The experiences were rated as among the most meaningful, spiritual, and psychologically insightful lifetime experiences, with persisting positive changes in life satisfaction, purpose, and meaning attributed to the experiences.Conclusion:N,N-dimethyltryptamine-occasioned entity encounter experiences have many similarities to non-drug entity encounter experiences such as those described in religious, alien abduction, and near-death contexts. Aspects of the experience and its interpretation produced profound and enduring ontological changes in worldview.

TI  - Selective Predation by Owls on Infected Bank Voles (<i>Myodes glareolus</i>) as a Possible Sentinel of Tularemia Outbreaks
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tularemia is a widely spread zoonotic disease in the northern hemisphere, caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. In humans, tularemia is an acute febrile illness with incidence peaks in late summer to early autumn of outbreak years, but there is no early warning system in place that can reduce the impact of disease by providing timely risk information. In this study, we revisit previously unpublished data on F. tularensis in water, sediment, soil, and small mammals from 1984 in northern Sweden. In addition, we used human case data from the national surveillance system for tularemia in the same year. In the environmental and small mammal material, bank vole (Myodes glareolus) samples from urine and bladder were the only samples that tested positive for F. tularensis. The prevalence of F. tularensis among trapped bank voles was 13.5%, although all six bank voles that were retrieved from owl nest boxes in early May tested positive. Forty-two human tularemia cases were reported from August to December in 1984. Based on these results, we encourage investigating the potential role of tularemia-infected bank voles retrieved from owl nest boxes in spring as an early warning for outbreaks of tularemia among humans in summer and autumn of the same year.

TI  - Shoreline infrastructure degradation and increasing littoral naturalization accommodates juvenile fish and crab assemblages in heavily urbanized Upper New York Harbor
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many estuarine shorelines are influenced by urbanization. Extensive shoreline modification in Upper New York Harbor (UNYH) included port development, landfilling marshes, and armoring. Recent sedimentation in constructed shipping terminal embayments, abandonment of shoreline structure maintenance, subsequent recruitment of upland and intertidal vegetation, and restoration projects have naturalized some shorelines in this urban setting. We determined the species composition and relative abundance of fishes and crabs in shallow shoreline habitats in constructed embayments of UNYH with seine sampling to determine the potential for restoring similar isolated shallow water sites as functional habitats. Twenty-seven identified species of fishes and crabs, including seasonally transient and resident marsh species, were represented in samples dominated by Menidia menidia, but marsh resident and coastal ocean species were also periodically abundant. Differences in assemblage structure among the sampled embayments as measured by principal components analysis were weak despite some differences in the slope and colonization of vegetation along shorelines. The mere presence of shallow shorelines was sufficient to recruit numerous species. Assemblage differences relative to a nearby relatively unaltered estuary revealed a lack of southern, warm affiliated species reflecting a natural clinal gradient. Marsh resident species dominated in UNYH, but not as strongly as at the reference estuary. Together with a previously published evaluation of life cycle connectivity for several sentinel species, this study shows that even small, isolated projects seeking to restore shallow shorelines add value to the estuarine landscape and are worth pursuing.

TI  - Rheology of a Debris Slide From the Joint Analysis of UAVSAR and LiDAR Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide rheology governs the deformation and flow behavior of sliding masses. As rheology strongly varies as a function of the composition and environment of landslides, a wide range of viscosities have been suggested based on very limited experimental or observational constraints. Here, we introduce a novel method to quantify the landslide rheology from remote sensing data. We focus on an ideal natural laboratory, the Slumgullion landslide, Colorado, which has moved at tens of millimeters per day for centuries. A joint analysis of Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)-derived surface displacements and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Digital Elevation Model (DEM)-derived landslide thickness at its frontal toe allows us to invert for the intrinsic viscosity (10(9)-10(11.5) Pa center dot s under different degrees of plasticity) based on the Bingham plastic model. Detailed displacement measurements also elucidate local variations in magnitude and orientation. Our method presents the capability of remote sensing data to understand the rheology of quasi-static debris slides in general.

TI  - Mapping mangrove forest using Landsat 8 to support estimation of land-based emissions in Kenya
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kenyan coast is constantly under persistent cloud cover which hinders mapping using optical images. Up-to-date land-cover information in such areas is sometimes missing from national mapping initiatives. This study uses a computed composite image based on a mean of cloud and shadow free Function of Mask masked multi-temporal Landsat 8 images acquired during long-dry season in a pilot area. We test the effectiveness of the composite to map mangrove forest using random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) machine learning algorithms integrated with context from Markov random fields (MRF(s)). MRFs was chosen because it is computationally efficient hence can be scaled out nationally. The MRF frameworks are compared to pixel-based classification using threefold independent validation samples. SVM-MRFs and RF-MRFs methods have the highest overall accuracy compared to pixel-based classification. However, visual assessment of predicted land-cover using aerial photograghs established that SVM-MRFs framework corresponded well to land-cover in the study area. This framework also managed to map classes with limited ground reference data better than RF-MRFs. Generally, context in both techniques played a discriminative role especially in heterogeneous regions. Therefore, scaling out this approaches would go a long way in generating mangrove forest map inventory in persistent cloud cover regions which is useful for land-based emission estimation.

TI  - Ecosystem characteristics and environmental regulations based geospatial planning for sustainable aquaculture development
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of unplanned shrimp aquaculture has caused many environmental issues and multiuser conflicts worldwide due to the lack of ecosystem characteristics-based comprehensive methodology for identifying suitable areas for aquaculture development. This study was conducted to identify proper zones for P. Vannamei farming using the analytical hierarchy process-based spatial analysis. Seventeen thematic layers were grouped into four fundamental requisite for P. vannamei aquaculture, namely, land class, water (pH, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total ammonia nitrogen, nitrate, and phosphate), soil (pH, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, and texture), and resource availability (distance to road, source water, hatchery, and processing facility). The pairwise comparison matrix and the weighted linear combination approach were used. The suitability scores were classified on a scale from 1 (unsuitable) to 4 (most suitable). The spatial restriction rules excluded the regulated areas, including agriculture, mangroves, forest, settlements, water bodies, regions near the high tide line. The entire study area is favorable for P. vannamei culture in terms of water, soil, and infrastructure; however, land availability is restricted to 35,032 ha. Of the available area, 24,420 ha was found most suitable, and 10,603 ha was suitable for P. vannamei culture. The major water bodies, namely, the Buckingham Canal, Kandaleru River, and Penneru River, can support 34, 23, and 25% of the shrimp culture area. The final area outputs were compared with ground truth survey data and found to be consistent. The geospatial application of this methodology provides an integrated site evaluation for P. vannamei shrimp culture taking into environmental conditions and regulations.

TI  - Tracking Pyrometeors With Meteorological Radar Using Unsupervised Machine Learning
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pyrometeors are the large (>2 mm) debris lofted above wildfires that are composed of the by-products of combustion of the fuels. One speciation of pyrometeor is firebrands, which are burning debris that lead to ignitions ahead of the surface fire and can be the dominant mechanism of fire spread and structure loss. Pyrometeors are observed by meteorological radar. To date, there have been no investigations into identification of pyrometeor speciation with radar. Here we present an unsupervised machine learning method (Gaussian mixture model) to classify pyrometeor modes using X-band radar data. The coherent features of the mode of pyrometeor identified most likely to transport firebrands were tracked in time and space. The radar classification and tracking method shows that wildfires do produce signatures in radar returns that could be used for spot fire risk prediction. In wildfires, different types of debris (known as pyrometeors) are lofted in the smoke plumes and transported downwind. Some types of pyrometeors may, when in the air, still be burning and capable of starting new wildfires. Here we investigate the potential for meteorological radar to classify different types of pyrometeors and to track them to determine their potential for starting new fires downwind of the main fire front.

TI  - Corporate governance mechanisms and corporate investments: evidence from India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the influence of corporate governance variables relating to the board of directors, audit and ownership on the agency problems that inflict a firm's investments in capital and research and development (R&D) expenditures. This study posits that the R&D investments are inflicted by the agency problem of "quiet life" whereas "empire-building" agency problem affects capital expenditure decisions. Design/methodology/ approach This study analyses the investment behaviour of non-financial and non-utility firms listed on NIFTY 200 from FY 2009 to FY 2018 using a static and dynamic model. Findings The results from the static model suggest that ownership concentration mitigates the agency problem of the "quiet life" that affects R&D expenditures. However, no corporate governance attribute has a significant impact on R&D investments under the assumption of the dynamic model. In respect of capital expenditures, the analysis of static model yields that audits by large auditor firms and usage of non-audit services ameliorate the agency problem of "empire-building". The results from the dynamic model show that independent boards worsen it. They also continue to provide empirical evidence in favour of large auditors. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature on the corporate governance-investment association by simultaneously examining the impact of multiple corporate governance attributes on the agency problems of "quiet life" and "empire-building" that affect R&D and capital expenditures, respectively, in a static and dynamic context for a sample of Indian firms.
