AB  - Monitoring crop phenology is a great importance to yield estimation and agriculture field management for food security, sustainable development of agriculture and to improve productivity. It's also important to understand how climate and local factors are effect on crop growth. The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellites such as Sentinel-2 gives a unique opportunity to monitor crops systematically by vegetation index time-series. To explore the applicability of Sentinel-2 for crop phenology monitoring, we analyzed the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with crop calendar for the year 2018 from crop fields in Samara airport area, Russia. This work has great potential to provide valuable support for monitoring crop phenology and providing precise management strategy. The dates of active tillering, jointing and maturity detected from NDVI could be useful in supporting crop modeling, extension irrigation, fertilization management, harvest determination and in last enhance food security.

TI  - Watershed Models for Development and Implementation of Total Maximum Daily Loads
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper reviews 14 prevalent watershed models for their capabilities, credibility, and suitability in total maximum daily load (TMDL) development and implementation. Brief descriptions of the models, including sources, capabilities, and applicability are presented. General information such as intended watershed and simulation types, simulated outputs, uncertainty analysis capabilities, graphical user interface, and availability are also presented. Mathematical bases of the hydrologic and water quality simulations, which indicate credibility, expected performance, and accuracy, and dictate model features (e.g.,structure, input data, and parameters) are presented. Routing procedures, the backbones of the models, are compared and ranked. The Gridded Surface and Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA) and MIKE SHE (Systeme Hydrologique Europeen) models rank high on overland and Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) on channel/pipe flow routing as the most accurate for representation of the physical processes and also the most numerically complex. The Generalized Watershed Loading Function (GWLF) and Spreadsheet Tool for the Estimation of Pollutant Load (STEPL) rank at the bottom on both the aspects. The rest of the models are in between, although the Dynamic Watershed Simulation Model (DWSM) is computationally efficient among kinematic wave models. Notable strengths and limitations of the models for TMDL development and implementation are presented. All these provide valuable information on the models, not readily available in a concise form elsewhere, to compare and help determine relative credibility and make informed selections for TMDLs and similar studies. Future research should focus on further comparisons of the models based on other key aspects such as simulation capabilities of processes, uncertainty analysis, required resources, and performances on watersheds followed by developing better models or improving existing ones by strengthening the weaknesses found. Robust physically based algorithms, uncertainty analysis capabilities, and use of remotely sensed and high-resolution data are recommended to be part of the model improvements.

AB  - For the first time Smarandache introduced neutrosophic sets which can be used as a mathematical tool for dealing with indeterminate and inconsistent information. the notion of BMBJ-neutrosophic set and subalge-bra, as a generalization of a neutrosophic set, is introduced, and it's application to BCI/BCK-algebras is investigated. The concept of BMBJ-neutrosophic subalgebras in BCI/BCK-algebras is introduced, and related properties are investigated. New BMBJ-neutrosophic subalgebra is established by using an BMBJ-neutrosophic subalgebra of a BCI/BCK-algebra. Alos, homomorphic (inverse) image of BMBJ-neutrosophic subalgebra and translation of BMBJ-neutrosophic subalgebra is investigated. At the end, we provided conditions for an BMBJ-neutrosophic set to be an BMBJ-neutrosophic subalgebra.

TI  - Multispectral data by the new generation of high-resolution satellite sensors for mapping phytoplankton blooms in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Ionian Sea, southern Italy)
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The HR (High-Resolution) EO (Earth Observation) satellite systems Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2 were tested for mapping the frequent phytoplankton blooms and Chl a distributions in the sea basin of the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Ionian Sea, southern Italy), using the sea truth calibration data acquired in 2013. The data were atmospherically corrected for accounting of the aerosol load on optically complexes waters (case II). Various blue-green and additional spectral indices ratios, were then satisfyingly tested for mapping the distribution of Chl a and differently sized phytoplankton populations through PLS (Partial Least Square regression) models, regressive statistical models and bio-optical algorithms. The PLS models demonstrated higher robustness for assessing the distribution of all the phytoplankton and Chl a except for those related to sub-surface micro-phytoplankton. The distributions obtained via a bio-optical approach (OC3 algorithm and full physically based inversion) showed a general agreement with the previous ones produced by statistical methods. The reflectance signals, captured by OLI and Sentinel 2 sensors in the visible and shorter wavelengths once atmospherically corrected, were found to be useful to map the coastal variability at detailed scale of Chl a and different phytoplankton populations, in the optically complexes waters of the Mar Piccolo.

TI  - Supporting Insurance Strategies in Agriculture by Remote Sensing: A Possible Approach at Regional Level

CP  - 19th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA)

AB  - Climate variability is one of the greatest risks for farmers. The ongoing increase of natural calamities suggests that insurance strategies have to be more dynamic than previously. In this work a remote sensing based service prototype is presented aimed at supporting insurance companies with the aim of defining an operative tool to objectively calibrate insurance annual fares, tending to cost reduction able to attract more potential customers. Methodology was applied to the whole Piemonte region (NW Italy) that is greatly devoted to agriculture. MODIS MOD13Q1-v6 image time series were used for this purpose. MODIS data were used to figure out the ongoing climate change trends at regional scale, looking at the NDVI time series ranging from 2000 to 2018; the average phenological behaviour of the main agriculture classes in the area (CORINE Land Cover classes Level 3, CLC2012) was considered looking at the yearly average NDVI value trend in the analysed period. This analysis was intended to describe the yearly tuning of the average insurance risk factor and fares in respect of the reference year (2000). A patch level investigation comparing the NDVI average value of a single CLC2012 patch with its reference class was differently used to map local differences of crops performance, aimed at locally tuning insurance risk and fares around the average one as resulting from the previous step. Proposed methodology proved to be able to describe the average temporal evolution of crop classes performances and to locally tune, at single field and crop type level, the agronomic performances of insured areas.

TI  - Gastronomic Vocabulary as a Feature of Nigerian English
T2  - VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV-SERIYA LINGVISTIKA-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The World Englishes Paradigm studies various aspects of the English language characterized by specific peculiarities and changing as a result of contacts with indigenous languages and cultures. The history of English in Nigeria embraces 500 years of an interaction between highly different cultural systems and civilizations. Language contacts between English and the indigenous languages of Nigeria have led to its linguistic, cultural and intrastructural diversity. The aim of this article is to analyse the gastronomic vocabulary of Nigerian English influenced by the Nigerian worldview and culture. The research is focused on borrowings from African languages (mainly Yoruba and Igbo) that play a vital role in forming the culturally important lexicon of Nigerian English. The sources of the research material are dictionaries, as well as books by Nigerian writers composed in English. The analysis carried out in the course of the research allowed us to discover secondary nominations that denote Nigerian flora and cuisine, to reveal their metaphorical usage and to study corresponding figurative comparisons, idioms, proverbs and sayings. The investigation of gastronomic symbols in Nigerian speech shows universal processes of employing common gastronomic lexical units from real-life discourse as a basis for symbolization. The results of the study show that the gastronomic vocabulary and the images it creates constitute one of the most impressive Nigerian cultural codes. The knowledge of this vocabulary is instrumental in understanding those codes.

CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications X held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - In this work a project for the implementation of remote sensing research activities for the acquisition of new knowledge and encouraging the participation of the PhD students of Remote Sensing Systems /RSS/ Department at SRTI-BAS in these activities is presented. The goal of the project is collecting data through spectral measurements for land cover monitoring in a selected test region in Bulgaria and create an open access spectral database. The first task of the work to collecting spectral measurements data is related to the methodology of acquiring in-situ spectral data of land covers in test site. Methodology follows the next steps of 1) collecting samples and additional information; 2) laboratory and field spectrometric measurements; 3) spectral data verification. For the implementation of the steps the test region is selected meeting the following requirements: i) Offers a wide variety of objects from the adopted nomenclature; ii) Has spectral data from Earth Observation device systems; iii) Has the possibility to perform regular measurements with available spectrometric systems. According to the described conditions the test region around the town of Novi Iskar is chosen. In CORINE Land Cover database for this area the presence of 12 classes of land covers has been verified which has to be characterized in detail on the basis of the received data. Each one will be recorded in the created database which is the next project task. This will allow the data received in the experiments to be considered reliable and representative. For monitoring purposes the data could be interpolated for larger areas with similar land covers to trace the dynamics of objects using spectral data.

M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - As a major sentinel of adaptive immunity, T cells seek and destroy diseased cells using antigen recognition to achieve molecular specificity. Strategies to block checkpoint inhibition of T cell activity and thus reawaken the patient's antitumor immune responses are rapidly becoming standard of care for treatment of diverse cancers. Adoptive transfer of patient T cells genetically engineered with tumor-targeting capabilities is redefining the field of personalized medicines. The diverse opportunities for exploiting T cell biology in the clinic have prompted new efforts to expand the scope of targets amenable to immuno-oncology. Given the complex spatiotemporal regulation of T cell function and fate, new technologies capable of global molecular profiling in vivo are needed to guide selection of appropriate T cell targets and subsets. In this chapter, we describe the use of activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) to illuminate different aspects of T cell metabolism and signaling as fertile starting points for investigation. We highlight the merits of ABPP methods to enable target, inhibitor, and biochemical pathway discovery of T cells in the burgeoning field of immuno-oncology.

AB  - Aerosol optical depth can be retrieved from measurements performed by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite instrument. The MODIS satellite system includes two polar satellites, Terra and Aqua. Each of them flies over the Pierre Auger Observatory once a day, providing two measurements of aerosols per day and covering the whole area of the Observatory. MODIS aerosol data products have been generated by three dedicated algorithms over bright and dark land and over ocean surface. We choose the Deep Blue algorithm data to investigate the distribution of aerosols over the Observatory, as this algorithm is the most appropriate one for semi-arid land of the Pierre Auger Observatory. This data algorithm allows us to obtain aerosol optical depth values for the investigated region, and to build cloud-free aerosol maps with a horizontal resolution 0.1 degrees x0.1 degrees. Since a sufficient number of measurements was obtained only for Loma Amarilla and Coihueco fluorescence detector (FD) sites of the Pierre Auger Observatory, a more detailed analysis of aerosol distributions is provided for these sites. Aerosols over these FD sites are generally distributed in a similar way each year, but some anomalies are also observed. These anomalies in aerosol distributions appear mainly due to some transient events, such as volcanic ash clouds, fires etc. We conclude that the Deep Blue MODIS algorithm provides more realistic aerosol optical depth values than other available algorithms.

AB  - The transition of satellite InSAR technology to a ground based system provides a proven risk reduction technology if combined with a critical slope monitoring (CSM) program. Together the technology with the active engagement of a defined program can detect the onset of slope displacement, acceleration, and provide a method to determine slope collapse. Recently, using the radar software, Guardian, and its ability to document surface velocity in intervals of 24-hours or less has allowed for the development of site-specific levels of rockfall risk.The ground-based InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) systems and their near real-time capabilities allow for proactive and early warning monitoring. The technical requirements include the ability to operate 24/7 in all weather conditions, acquire data in near real-time, and visually present data in an interpretable format that requires no end user processing. Since slope failure without acceleration is unlikely, the rapid visual presentation of processed data becomes a crucial component for a CSM technology.The definition of the CSM program not only requires short intervals for data acquisition, processing, and visual presentation but also requires a monitoring professional that can interpret and communicate changes in slope movement. A specific CSM technology requirement demands, acquiring data at a continuous interval of 2-minutes or less, 24 hours per day for the duration of the monitoring project. Also, the CSM technology must be able to transmit alarm messages at the moment thresholds are met, visually present data with various time series plots, including displacement, and velocity maps while acquired radar data is continuously updated and with no end-user processing. A site-specific document called a trigger action response plan (TARP) needs to be prepared at the start of any CSM project. Currently, only the IBIS-FM and ArcSAR radars developed by IDS (Ingegneria Dei Sistemi) GeoRadar can meet the technical requirements of the defined CSM technology.During a CSM program, the short interval between each data acquisition provides two specific advantages. First, the short acquisition interval decreases interpolation, which automatically increases data confidence. Second, the short intervals also decrease the effects of atmospheric changes that are a part of all data acquisitions. Although the IBIS-FM and ArcSAR radar systems can operate in nearly all-weather conditions, sudden changes in local atmospheric conditions can still exhibit data effects. Both radar systems include active proprietary algorithms that account for ongoing atmospheric changes during acquisitions. In comparison, some remote sensing data acquired from, LIDAR, and total station technologies can be critically affected by sudden changes in local atmospheric conditions.Combining the near real-time capabilities of an interferometric synthetic aperture radar system with a dedicated professional will decrease risk to people and property by allowing slope movement trends to be identified and observed in near real-time, 24-hours per/day. The paper will discuss the highlights of several successful CSM programs. We describe deployment versatility, the ability to identify the onset of displacement accurately, and the critical identification of the onset of acceleration.

AB  - Early season crop identification is important for food security and economic stability. The USDA NASS uses optical data to provide acreage estimates, each June, to the NASS Agricultural Statistics Board. However, early season crop identification is difficult using optical data alone, because imagery is frequently cloudy during the spring. The purpose of this study is to determine whether using SAR and SAR texture can improve early season winter wheat identification compared to optical data alone. Study areas in the Missouri "Bootheel" (2017 growing season) and Northwest Texas (2018 growing season), United States (U.S.) are selected. The SAR data used in this study are Sentinel-1. Optical data include: Landsat 8, Disaster Monitoring Constellation, and Sentinel-2. Study results show that optical data with SAR achieved the highest winter wheat accuracies, 7.7% higher than optical data alone, in Missouri. Optical with SAR and SAR texture resulted in improved accuracies over optical alone, but only marginally, in Texas. These results indicate that optical and SAR, used together, can potentially improve early season crop identification.

TI  - Religious Socialism in Post-Secular Europe
T2  - POLITICS RELIGION & IDEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent scholarship on Religion and International Relations critically questions the secularist assumptions on which the discipline was founded. Yet many combinations of the religious and the political remain unexplored, particularly those that exist on the left of the ideological spectrum, such as religious socialism. Focusing on the International League of Religious Socialists (ILRS), the main religious socialist organization in Europe since the 1920s, I argue that European networks of religious socialists act as interlocutors between social democratic parties, minority religious communities, and the state, while defending political secularism from both secular and religious forms of extremism. This is a marked change from the Cold War era, during which religious socialists took up concerns of the global south, such as dependency theory and disarmament. In the conclusion, I discuss how religious faith, political secularism, and social democratic principles fit together in the contemporary religious socialist worldview, and consider the wider significance of religious socialism in a post-secular age.

AB  - A water wave glint correction algorithm, light attenuation depths and water depths estimated from satellite imagery in the Indian River Lagoon and Banana River estuarine waters provide a means to evaluate light penetration or water clarity. The shallow water estuarine study area is along Florida's east coast area known as"space coast" Florida. In-situ data, including water depths obtained from bathymetric charts, in-situ hyperspectral attenuation signatures and satellite-based reflectance factors are obtained from atmospherically corrected visible and near infra-red channels of World View-3 satellite imagery. The high spatial, radiometric and 11bit digital resolution satellite imagery is used to study water visibility that is an important ecosystem quality indicator. In shallow coastal waters as well as deeper water areas and nearby coastal waterways, the effects of water surface gravity wave facets and sun glint influence the estimates of water quality related variables estimated at the pixel level. The results have significant implications related to the estimation of the depth of penetration of light using satellite-based methods in coastal waters. Application of atmospherically corrected satellite imagery followed by glint removal is shown using translating and dilating derivative wavelet algorithms to estimate the attenuation depth of light in water. The research has been conducted in order that results may be transferable to other estuaries that suffer from reduction in light penetration due to factors such as turbidity or harmful algal blooms.

TI  - Aerosol uncertainty assessment: an integrated approach of remote AQUA MODIS and AERONET data
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) is one of the widely used sensors to address environmental and climate change subjects with a daily global coverage. MODIS Collection 6 aerosol products at 10-km resolution are used in this study to monitor aerosol variability and assess its uncertainty using ground-based measurements. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) is retrieved by different algorithms based on the pixel surface, determining between land and ocean. Using data collected from Sidi Salem Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) station, we computed the accuracy for aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved from MODIS aboard the AQUA satellite using two validation methods. The results show a good agreement between MODIS and AERONET data for the study period using both the algorithms. We obtained high values of the correlation coefficient. These findings indicate that MODIS data perform well over Ben Salem AERONET station and are recommended for air quality monitoring over Tunisia. The conducted validation throughout the AERONET leads to a degree of confidence that allows a deep investigation of the AOD spatial variability over Tunisia. Then, MODIS data shows high performance with good certainty to identify the principal dust sources and typical transport paths occurring on the study region.

TI  - Axillary staging in daily practice in the diagnosis of breast cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - When a breast cancer is diagnosed, the quality of the evaluation before treatment is essential to guide the therapeutic decision. The staging axillary is necessary because it estimates the regional extension of the disease, which makes it a paramount prognosis factor. Some different pre-operative medical imaging can reveal metastasis axillary nodes. However, the axillary ultrasound remains the reference imaging and it also leads the biopsies too. Since the ACOSOG-Z0011 trial, we are facing a therapeutic de-escalation in the axillary surgery. According to recent results, we can note that the position of the axillary imaging is more and more important. The purpose of the ultrasound is to avoid a two-stage dissection after a positive sentinel lymph node when the ACOSOG-Z0011 criteria are not met.

CL  - Hammamet, TUNISIA
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is considered a promising technique for studying some phytoplanktonic algae because of such advantages as large-scale, real- time and long-term monitoring. The application of statistical models in the field of remote sensing is a crucial tool. The main objective of this study was to quantify the spatial distribution, and develop an empirical model, to detect phytoplankton algal density (diatoms and dinoflagellate). We used ratios of transformed reflectance values (REF) from Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) data to establish statistical relationships to dinoflagellate and diatoms densities cells, in the coastal area of Algiers Bay in Algeria. Another additional advantage of our study is that in situ measurements, it coincides with the passage of the satellite at the same time. The result shows that the proliferation prediction model could predict diatoms algae with an accuracy of 77%. The results of this research provided the possibility for the development of an appropriate methodology for remote monitoring of this phytoplankton types in coastal water.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next- Generation Satellites XXIII
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - The geo-referencing information of the satellite imagery is obtained by the use of either attitudes and velocity/position provided by the satellite instrumentation, nevertheless the positioning using this approach depend directly on the quality of the ephemeris data. The image-to-image registration aims to find a geometric transformation relating two or more images in order to locate them in the same geographic reference. As the first Algerian high-resolution satellite ALSAT-2A, has a nominal positional accuracy of around 300m, this last approach can be used to estimate and improve the raw image positional quality where these images are registered to orthoimages that are more accurate. Therefore, the resulting image have an enhanced geolocation quality than the one calculated using the estimation of the line of sight model. The purpose of this work is to provide a framework to automatically estimate the positional quality of Alsat2A image for cataloguing purpose, also to improve the geolocation accuracy of the level 1-A (geometrically raw) images by using other imagery that is already geo-localized with better accuracy. Landsat 8 orthoimagery coverage represents a data source that is worldwide available and its accuracy is sufficient for our work. Therefore, it is used as reference images to estimate and enhance the quality of raw ALSAT-2A images. This work is based on the use of open-source software such python, OpenCv and PostgreSQL and the open-data e.g. geo-referenced quick looks of landsat8 provided by EarthExplorer. Many experimentations has been conducted to decide on which algorithm is better to enhance the contrast and which spectral channel to use, also many methods for the homologue points extraction and description have been evaluated. Then, points of interest extracted from the reference orthoimagery are fed into a geographic database, allowing the use of these points as known ground points to estimate and enhance the quality of Alsat-2A imagery.

AB  - For sustainable irrigation water management as well as ecosystem health monitoring, it is important to provide an estimate of evapotranspiration components, i.e. transpiration and soil evaporation. To do so, Thermal InfraRed data can be used with dual-source surface energy balance models, because they solve separate energy budgets for the soil and the vegetation. But those models rely on specific assumptions on raw levels of plant water stress to get both components (evaporation and transpiration) out of a single source of information, namely the surface temperature. Additional information from remote sensing data is thus required. This works evaluates the ability of the SPARSE dual-source energy balance model to compute not only total evapotranspiration, but also water stress and transpiration/evaporation components, using either the sole surface temperature as a remote sensing driver, or a combination of surface temperature and soil moisture level derived from microwave data.

AB  - Based on interviews with several OKV activists, Chapter 2 analyzes the social and political factors that shaped their worldview. The OKV has largely been organized and maintained by men from the Hitler Youth generation who, after the horrors of Nazism and WWII, converted to communism and experienced the GDR as a provider of recognition, self-respect and social mobility. While the leading activists come from various backgrounds, and in the GDR embarked upon different professional trajectories, all explain their own biographies with the help of a common set of political arguments. These self-descriptions reveal commonalities with the genre of "socialist autobiographies" that were systematically trained in Central/Eastern Europe's socialist states before 1989.

AB  - Identifying the irrigated areas is essential for waters managers who are in charge of distributing this resource over a large scale. The monitoring of water soil content and irrigation is a powerful tool for water resource management. The potential of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data for estimating the soil moisture and irrigation is studied over covered surfaces. An inversion algorithm of the Water Cloud Model (WCM) was developed after calibrating and validating the model over the Kairouan plain, a semi-arid region in Tunisia. The aim is to restitute soil moisture over the whole region. The developed algorithm used a synergy between S1, radar data in VV polarization, and NDVI derived from S2 optical data at high spatial resolution. The results showed good accuracy between retrieved and measured soil moisture with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) lower than 6 vol.%. Then, the resulting soil moisture maps were used for irrigation mapping. The process used a combination of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree classifications to distinguish between irrigated and non-irrigated agricultural fields. Results from the annual irrigation map show that the overall accuracy on the classification is about 77%.

It examines the worldviews of the six study participants based on their responses to the questionnaires and the verbatim transcript of their interviews and recorded journeys. These provide an intimate look at the Dasein and personal identities of the participants, and how their personal histories, beliefs, and spiritual orientations are integrated and reflected in their Neo-shamanic practice and journey experiences. The chapter proceeds to examine the beneficial effects of Neo-shamanic practice reported by the participants, specifically elevated well-being, enhanced identity and Dasein, expanded consciousness, and integration of the mystic and the mundane realms of being.

T2  - NEO-SHAMANISM AND MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This chapter describes the pitfalls that can occur to those practicing Neo-shamanism and embracing its accompanying anomalous worldview. Neo-shamanic practice and its resultant awareness of the sacred aspects of the mundane world as well as the existence of a world beyond material consensual reality that is imperceptible with the physical senses tend to place practitioners in a state of chronic cultural dissonance. It is tempting for Neo-shamanic practitioners to turn to spiritual means of dealing with mundane and psychological issues and traumas rather than seeking more culturally sanctioned sources of assistance such as psychotherapy. This spiritual bypassing can result in a failure to adequately resolve the problems at hand. It can also lead to identity dysfunctions, including grandiosity, intensified fantasy proneness (which can present in conditions such as sleep paralysis), and intensified schizotypy. While elements of fantasy proneness and schizotypy can enhance creativity, they have the potential to develop into full-fledged psychological disorders and/or sociological dysfunction if not balanced by connection to the material world through relationships, professional assistance, or a well-grounded identity and integrated Dasein.

M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In this chapter, the author presents a review of the GIS use during the research carried out during the past three decades dealing with land degradation. The objective is to assess the viability of applying GIS with different modes of remotely sensed data acquisition for quantifying land degradation in Tunisia. Various GIS based modelling approaches for soil erosion hazard assessment such as empirical and physical distributed are discussed. Five case studies are selected from several projects. They apply different methods for land degradation investigation at different scales using GIS and remotely sensed data. The research dealt mainly with: 1) The prediction of soil erosion at the regional level related to conservation techniques; 2) The quantification of soil erosion at the gully level based on GIS, digital photogrammetry and fieldwork; 3) The monitoring of gully erosion using GIS combined to images acquired by a non-metric digital camera on board a kite.

M3  - Article
AB  - The current study exposes the results of aeromagnetic data interpretation and a combined analysis of 1-A sentinel radar image that cover the study area of Beni Mellal Atlas in order to describe the structural geometry and to understand its tectonic evolution. The map of the reduced to pole of residual magnetic field highlights various magnetic anomalies with high amplitudes that correspond to Jurassic-Cretaceous basaltic formations outcropping synclinal basins of Beni Mellal Atlas. The interpretation of magnetic data using tilt derivative (TDR), horizontal gradient technique coupled to upward continuation and Euler Deconvolution allows us to distinguish the fractures network that is affecting the study area. In order to complete this analysis, the Sentinel-A radar image is processed and filtered using SNAP ESA Sentinel-1 toolbox software to extract lineaments. The final structural map reveals four faults groups oriented respectively NE-SW, ENE-WSW to E-W, N-S and NW-SE Their depths estimated by the application of Euler deconvolution exceed 1500 m. Thoses faults have played a major role in structural evolution of Beni Mellal Atlas.

TI  - Contribution of remote sensing to mapping In-Abeggui gold deposit (Central Hoggar, South Algeria)
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The area concerned with the application of remote sensing is the In-Abeggui gold deposit in the Eastern part of Laouni terrane (Central Hoggar, South Algeria). This deposit includes a system of gold-bearing quartz veins marked by intense hydrothermal alteration. The gold veins are hosted in a big gabbro-diorite massif, cut by microgranite and aplite dike veins, all situated in a Neoproterozoic volcanogenic basin. The aim of this paper is to use LANDSAT 7ETM+ satellite images for mapping and characterizing gold-bearing veins, faults, and host rocks in the studied area and especially comparing the results with our traditional field work. All of the techniques used, such as colored compositions (CC), spectral band ratio, principal component analysis (PCA), and directional filtering, allowed a better lithological discrimination of the different formations. Moreover, they highlighted a hierarchical distribution of faults and emphasized their preferential directions. As regards lithology, the visualization with colored composition (RGB) of the three principal components (PC1, PC2, PC3) enabled us to clearly distinguish gabbros, diorites, volcanogenic rocks, and detrital rocks. Besides, we could distinguish between various faults, white aplitic dikes, and various gold-bearing quartz veins.

TI  - Suicide Risk Screening in Pediatric Hospitals: Clinical Pathways to Address a Global Health Crisis
T2  - PSYCHOSOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Youth suicide is on the rise worldwide. Most suicide decedents received healthcare services in the year before killing themselves. Standardized workflows for suicide risk screening in pediatric hospitals using validated tools can help with timely and appropriate intervention, while attending to The Joint Commission Sentinel Event Alert 56. Objective: Here we describe the first attempt to generate clinical pathways for patients presenting to pediatric emergency departments (EDs) and inpatient medical settings. Methods: The workgroup reviewed available evidence and generated a series of steps to be taken to feasibly screen-medical patients presenting to hospitals. When evidence was limited, expert consensus was used. A standardized, iterative approach was utilized to create clinical pathways. Stakeholders reviewed initial drafts. Feedback was incorporated into the final pathway. Results: Clinical pathways were created for suicide risk screening in pediatric EDs and inpatient medical/surgical units. The pathway outlines a 3-tiered screening process utilizing the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions for initial screening, followed by a brief suicide safety assessment to determine if a full suicide risk assessment is warranted. This essential step helps conserve resources and decide upon appropriate interventions for each patient who screens positive. Detailed implementation guidelines along with scripts for provider training are included. Conclusion: Youth suicide is a significant public health problem. Clinical pathways can empower hospital systems by providing a guide for feasible and effective suicide risk-screening implementation by using validated tools to identify patients at risk and apply appropriate interventions for those who screen positive. Outcomes assessment is essential to inform future iterations.

AB  - Building on laboratory- and survey-based research probing the psychology of ideology and the experience of worldview conflict, we examined the association between worldview conflict and emotional reactions, psychological well-being, humanity esteem, and political ideology in everyday life using experience sampling. In three combined samples (total N = 328), experiencing disagreement compared to agreement was associated with experiencing more other-condemning emotions, less well-being, and less humanity esteem. There were no clear associations between experiencing disagreement and experiencing self-conscious emotions, positive emotions, and mental stress. None of the relationships were moderated by political ideology. These results both replicate and challenge findings from laboratory- and survey-based research, and we discuss possible reasons for the discrepancies. Experience sampling methods can help researchers get a glimpse into everyday worldview conflict.

TI  - Essential Biodiversity Change Indicators for Evaluating the Effects of Anthropocene in Ecosystems at a Global Scale
T2  - FROM ASSESSING TO CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY: CONCEPTUAL AND PRACTICAL CHALLENGES
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Understanding and predicting the impact of global change drivers on bio-diversity, the basis of the delivery of goods and services to humans, is a critical task in the Anthropocene Era. This has led to the development of international monitoring networks and frameworks to evaluate changes in biodiversity, the Essential Biodiversity Variables, though still somewhat ineffective. Biodiversity drivers have changed their relative importance in time and space, e.g. due to policies to combat air pollution, the increasing nitrogen pollution or climate change. Hence, to monitor their impact on biodiversity in space and time, we need appropriate Biodiversity Change Indicators and Surrogates, measured through distinct metrics. In this chapter, we propose a conceptual model to select the most cost-effective metrics of biodiversity-change based on both the type and intensity of the drivers that limit or impact biodiversity, and the nature of the Essential Biodiversity Variables which may be affected in each case. We propose ecophysiology-based metrics for low intensity limiting/impacting drivers, affecting organisms' individual performance; trait-based metrics for medium intensity drivers, affecting the ecological performance of sensitive species before tolerant ones, changing species abundance and community functional traits; taxonomic-based metrics for high driver intensities which may culminate in species loss. We further discuss the utility of remote sensing data to measure some of these indicators or surrogates, allowing to upscale and/or generalize spatial and temporal information.

AB  - This essay contributes to a conceptual discussion on the need for bridge-building between the natural and social sciences, among different social science disciplines, and the research programmes in political science focusing on peace, security, development and environment ('sustainable development'), by introducing the two new linkage concepts of 'political geo-ecology' and 'peace ecology'. It focuses on the policy goal of a 'sustainable peace' understood as 'peace with nature' in the newly proposed epoch of earth history, the Anthropocene.The key argument of this chapter is that this goal may be achieved by a process of 'sustainability transition' that addresses the economic causes of greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, in which where concerned individuals, families, local communities, states and nations as well as international governmental organisations and non-governmental bodies and social movements may contribute to the transition.This text suggests that the goal of a 'sustainable peace' may be addressed from a peace ecology perspective that integrates both peace and security studies and ecology or ecological approaches aiming at the realisation of the goal of a 'sustainable development'. It is argued that this requires a shift from disciplinary and multidisciplinary research methods towards inter-and transdisciplinary approaches by moving towards a 'transformative science' aiming at a 'sustainable peace' where the needed policy changes and the actors and processes of this change towards sustainability should become a part of the research design and action research process.This essay touches on the manifold fundamental conceptual, methodological, theoretical and action-oriented research needs of a 'peace ecology approach' that aims at contributing to the realisation of a 'sustainable peace' as 'peace with nature' in the 'Anthropocene', where the societal outcomes of the physical effects of global environmental and climate change can be countered and mitigated by policies of adaptation, mitigation and an increase of resilience by the affected people.From the perspective of a Hobbesian policy approach of 'business-as-usual,' but also from traditional scientific worldviews, this goal may appear at present to be utopian and for sceptics, it is not achievable. It requires a fundamental change in the dominant 'worldview' of many scientists and of the neoliberal mindset of most policymakers, practitioners, but also of ordinary citizens towards an alternative sustainability approach.For the natural and social sciences it requires a new 'scientific revolution towards sustainability'-similar to what Kuhn (1962) called the 'Copernican Revolution' or Schellnhuber (1999) outlined as a 'Second Copernican Revolution'-with a new scientific paradigm of a 'peace ecology' that still needs to be developed in the future.This holistic approach of linking different scientific discourses with discussions in the political realm deliberately distances itself from the mainstream of political science contributions with often narrowly focused theoretical discussions that solely appeal to a scientific audience and are hardly noted in societal and political discussions.

AB  - While the application of very high-resolution imagery is widely acknowledged, the use of sensors of spatial resolutions of five meters and above is constrained in urban settings because of limitations due to the mixed pixel information. This study investigates the potential of Sentinel-2 products for the detection of roof materials in the city of Kigali as input for planning decisions and monitoring of urban expansion. A linear spectral unmixing is applied to spectral information of both artificial and natural surfaces collected in the field. Results indicate that both spatial and radiometric resolution are sufficient to detect even small fractions of roof materials, although a proper calibration and endmember optimization is required. Challenges remain regarding surfaces of similar spectral signatures, such as clay roofs and argillaceous soil, and surfaces which are strongly under-represented within pixels. The spatial distribution of clay roofs as an indicator for upper-class houses matches the reference data collected in the fields, but for a reliable prediction of all materials more attention must be placed on metal roofs of different colors.

T2  - ISTORIYA-ELEKTRONNYI NAUCHNO-OBRAZOVATELNYI ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to reconstruct one of the facets of Derbyshire gentry's worldview. The author analyzes, what 15th century's gentry thought about the boundaries of permissible and unacceptable in land litigations. The main source is extremely interesting and little-known text, a book in which Robert Pilkington describes the decades-long land dispute between him and the Aynesworth family. The analysis showed that in defending their rights, gentry often went beyond the law. They could to summon several hundred "men in hernes", seized or damaged disputed property, drove tenants from the land, and even tried to kill their opponents. And yet, as soon as the conflict went beyond what was allowed, the gentry community found a tendency to self-regulation. The "friends" of the opponents intervened to give their allies the necessary support, neither side gained a decisive advantage, and the conflict returned to the legal channel. The boundaries of the permissible were outlined clearly. It was normal methods were: demonstration of military power, psychological pressure and cattle rustling. The seizure of the disputed land was a possible scenario. Finally, anything that harmed the health, liberty, property of the opponent or any other person involved in the litigation was considered unworthy and unacceptable.

AB  - Through his customary metaliterary formulation Cervantes concludes in the Persiles a worldview of writing as a speculative expression of the act of creation and reception of the story in fiction, associated with rhetorical, epistemological and literary motifs in the Byzantine genre. The Persiles universe allows us to discover the last attempt of Cervantes to unleash the meanders of writing as a reflexive expansion of the writer's condition, the composition of the story, its intrinsic reception and the awareness of the relations between reality and invention. The prologue of Persiles is an eloquent statement of writing as a circumflex act of existence itself.

AB  - The results of a study of NDII applicability for monitoring of a heterogeneous rural and urban area during a growing season (April-November) were shown. We evaluated the spatial and quantitative distributions, and temporal trends of NDII derived from Landsat 8 imagery, NDII=(NIR-SWIR)/(NIR+SWIR) or NDII=(Band5-Band6)/(Band5+Band6), over a typical medium-sized European city with its surroundings. The temporal changes of NDII were also correlated with sunshine duration, temperature, and precipitation. Vegetation was the component of land cover that was changing to the highest degree during the growing season. The most dynamic temporal alterations of NDII were recorded within the arable land. In forest areas and grassland NDII was relatively stable through the summer. The NDII values were stable also in the built-up area in view of practically constant state of human-made covers in the studied period. NDII can support the monitoring of land cover/land use in the urban and rural areas, provided that the images of fully developed plant cover are used. It was stated that NDII correlated with weather conditions. The relationships between NDII and precipitation, temperature, and sunshine duration could facilitate risk assessment and planning of agronomic practices with regard to the weather.

TI  - Ambiguity Tolerance Toward Nonbinary Sexuality Concepts: Evidence from British Newspapers
T2  - JOURNAL OF BISEXUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Humans tend to construct their worldview via binaries, that is, two distinct, nonoverlapping elements, such as the juxtapositions of human-animal, human-machine, or male-female. Our research focuses on the binary categories of "heterosexuality-homosexuality" and explores how stable or malleable they are. For this, the authors analyze newspaper coverage of sexuality concepts in the United Kingdom from 1995 to 2010 and quantify if and how tolerance toward ambiguous concepts including "bisexuality" vary across time as well as with gender, political opinion, and expertise. Our findings indicate a distinct "millennial effect" of intolerance toward sexual ambiguity, suggesting that resistance against ambiguity rears up during periods of instability. Conversely, we found higher levels of ambiguity tolerance in left-wing newspapers, broadsheet publications, female journalists, and expert writers, as opposed to right-wing newspapers, tabloid publications, male journalists, and novice writers. Our results can help to better understand to what degree concepts related to human sexuality are relatively hard-wired or rather fluid social categories.

AB  - Earth observation using spaceborne sensors with short revisiting time has forgone the limits of conventional assessment methods. In this paper, we investigate the use of SAR Tomography (TomoSAR) to monitor infrastructures, using Morandi Bridge in Genoa, Italy, as a case study. Morandi Bridge suffered a partial collapse due to a structural failure on August 14, 2018. The main issues to be considered for using TomoSAR as a means of an early warning system in structural health monitoring are discussed, highlighting the differences respect to monitoring applications dealing with subsidence and deformation of extended areas.A set of 70 Sentinel-1A images of the bridge over a period of three years prior to the bridge collapse are analyzed using 5D TomoSAR based on Sup-GLRT scatterers detection technique. Preliminary results indicate that possible temporal and thermal deformations of the static structure can be estimated using the method considered.

T2  - Brazilian Journal of Veterinary Research and Animal Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian spotted fever is a serious and lethal illness for humans and is caused by the Rickettsia rickettsii bacteria. In the state of Sao Paulo/SP (Brazil), the etiological agent of this disease is transmitted by the Amblyomma sculptum tick. It was already shown that horses infected with this bacteria produce a strong immune response and could be important sentinels for the detection of the disease in a proper region. The present investigation performed a serological survey in horses from five farms of Vale do Paraiba, Sao Paulo state, Brazil, searching for antibodies against, Rickettsia rickettsii, Rickettsia parkeri, Rickettsia amblyommatis, Rickettsia rhipicephali, and Rickettsia bellii. In each farm, ticks were also collected that were taxonomically identified and examined by real-time PCR for Rickettsia spp DNA. Blood samples were collected from 206 horses, and 334 ticks were picked up from these animals from January to December 2017. Eighty ticks were A. sculptum and 254 Dermacentor nitens. Of the blood samples, 7.3% seroconverted to Rickettsia spp. Of these, 0.97% had a positive serological response to R. bellii. None of the 80 A. sculptum ticks were positive through real-time PCR for Rickettsia spp. Although there was no detection of ticks infected by Rickettsia spp in five farms of Paraiba Valley, the horses presented serological positive reactions against this agent. Thus, further large studies should be conducted in the area targeting hosts and vectors to generate data for control measures of the transmission of Brazilian spotted fever.

TI  - BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH: THE BORDERLINE URALS IN THANATOLOGICAL CULTURE
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The space of the Urals is analysed through the prism of thanatological studies. The paper emphasises the significance of the phenomenon of death / dying in the understanding of local identity. The authors provide a concept of the Urals as a multi-level frontier, including not only geographical, ethnocultural, and socio-economic dimensions, but also a metaphysical frontier between the world of the living and the world of the dead, the real and the surreal. A specific tradition developed in the region due to the historical peculiarities of adaptation that generations of immigrants had to go through to become accustomed to severe climatic, social, and economic conditions: the gloomy, the anxious, and even the terrible becomes commonplace in the minds of Ural inhabitants; death is regarded as something ordinary and not extraordinary, as a familiar portal for transition into non- being, not as an unfamiliar or frightening state. At the same time, a constant stay at the edge of life and death, on the border of the known and the unknown, forges a unique Ural character that helps overcome real difficulties and hardships, resist the challenges of nature and fate, and, ultimately, defeat unfavourable circumstances again and again in the quest to find light in life. Practical issues receive special attention in the paper as it considers the possibilities of developing so-called dark tourism in the Central Urals as a way of presenting a special local cultural code that includes such important elements as willingness to overcome difficulties, the sense of a frontier, and conscious coexistence with death, which is initially present nearby. Allegorically, such a cultural code may be compared to the worldview of fort guards or people living by the ocean at the far reaches of the Earth. Unusual discourses and the commodification of death are common for the Urals and reflect the potential of dark (and in general - cultural) tourism in the region. It is already a unique product, even though demand for it is still spontaneous and haphazard.

TI  - [Dose coverage of axillary target volumes using different field arrangements following breast conserving surgery for invasive breast cancer].
T2  - Magyar onkologia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the dose coverage of sentinel lymph node (SLN) site, level I, II and III axillary target volumes using different field arrangements (standard or high tangent fields: STgF, HTgF and STgF + axillary-supraclavicular field: ASF) in N0 invasive breast cancer patients treated with breast conserving surgery. In 30 patients the SLN site was marked with titanium clip. They were treated with 3D-conformal radiotherapy. Retrospectively, for the purpose of this study, the SLN site and axillary target volumes were contoured, and three plans were generated for each patient using the original CT data. The prescribed dose was 50 Gy (2 Gy/fraction). The mean dose with STgF or HTgF was 33.1 and 49.1 Gy (p=0.0001) in the SLN site, 25.7 and 45.1 Gy (p<0.0001) in level I, 7.2 and 28.9 Gy (p<0.0001) in level II and 3.5 and 12.7 Gy (p=0.0003) in level III. The mean dose with STgF+ASF in level II or III was 45 and 46 Gy. The dose coverage is inadequate to all axillary levels with STgM. The target volumes should be delineated to give accurate dose estimation.

TI  - Characteristics of the gravity field of predictive oil-gas areas in the DDD region according to satellite model EGM08 and gravity measurements at the beginning of the XX century
T2  - GEOFIZICHESKIY ZHURNAL-GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Gravimetric information is the basis for mineral exploration. The foundations of resource research in Ukraine were started by a large-scale gravimetric survey performed by the Poltava Gravimetric Observatory (PGO) in 1926-1934. Modern geological exploration uses information from Earth remote sensing, obtained with the help of special equipment installed on space vehicles. Satellite data on the distribution of gravitational anomalies (Delta g) are displayed in the model of the gravitational field of the Earth EGM08, created for the practical use on the data of the special missions CHAMP and GRACE. The features of the structure of the gravitational field for perspective oil and gas areas located in the Dnieper-Donetsk depression (DDD) are considered, based on the model EGM08 and gravity measurements performed in the first half of the XX century. This allows: 1) to test the geological information of the model EGM08; 2) to assess the nature of the age-old changes in gravity in areas that have a specific and similar geological structure by comparing these data sets. For most sites it is typical: 1) the complex structure of the field of gravity, the presence of local "potential wells" with fluctuations in gravity anomalies of 10 divided by 30 mGl, characteristic of fault zones; 2) mainly negative values of anomalies by area (Delta g <= 0), which is typical for the rocks with reduced density and increased porosity. These results confirm the correct nature of the model EGM08. The secular changes of the gravity delta Delta g for the corresponding points were estimated as the anomaly difference according to the EGM08 model data and the classical measurements previously reduced to the WGS84 system. For most points, there are: 1) a multidirectional change in delta Delta g; 2) for about 20 % of points the values vertical bar delta Delta g vertical bar >= 5 mGl, which does not exclude the influence of local technogenic or geophysical factors. A statistically significant increase in the age-old change in gravity on + 3.3 mGl was found for the northwestern section of site No. 2 (Lokhvitsa segment of DDD), where the density of ground-based measurement points is high.

TI  - Estimation of forest development stage and crown closure using different classification methods and satellite images: A case study from Turkey
T2  - Journal of Forest Science (Prague)
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to estimate stand development stages (SDS) and stand crown closures (SCC) of forest using different classification methods (maximum likelihood, support vector machine: linear, polynomial, radial and sigmoid kernel functions and artificial neural network) based on satellite imagery of different resolution (Landsat 7 ETM+ and IKONOS). The results showed that SDS and SCC were estimated with Landsat 7 ETM+ image using the artificial neural network with a 0.83 and 0.78 kappa statistic value, and 92.57 and 89.77% overall accuracy assessments, respectively. On the other hand, SDS and SCC were predicted with IKONOS image using support vector machine (polynomial) method with a 0.94 and 0.88 kappa statistic value, and 95.95 and 91.17% overall accuracy assessments, respectively. Our results demonstrated that IKONOS satellite image and support vector machine (polynomial) method produced a better estimation of SDS and SCC as compared to Landsat 7 ETM+ and other supervised classification methods used in this study.

TI  - Validation of HOAPS Rain Retrievals against OceanRAIN In-Situ Measurements over the Atlantic Ocean
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite-derived HOAPS (Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite Data) precipitation estimates have been validated against in-situ precipitation measurements from optical disdrometers, available from OceanRAIN (Ocean Rainfall And Ice-phase precipitation measurement Network) over the open-ocean by applying a statistical analysis for binary estimates. In addition to using directly collocated pairs of data, collocated data were merged within a certain temporal and spatial threshold into single events, according to the observation times. Although binary statistics do not show perfect agreement, simulations of areal estimates from the observations themselves indicate a reasonable performance of HOAPS to detect rain. However, there are deficits at low and mid-latitudes. Weaknesses also occur when analyzing the mean precipitation rates; HOAPS underperforms in the area of the intertropical convergence zone, where OceanRAIN observations show the highest mean precipitation rates. Histograms indicate that this is due to an underestimation of the frequency of moderate to high precipitation rates by HOAPS, which cannot be explained by areal averaging.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next- Generation Satellites XXIII
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - The first diffraction gratings on curved substrates were manufactured by employing ruling engines by H. A. Rowland. Due to the ruling principle, these gratings are characterized by equidistant parallel lines if the line pattern is projected along the optical axis onto a tangential plane in the vertex of the grating substrate. The Offner spectrometer is based on such a classical grating on a convex spherical substrate. This spectrometer type shows very good field correction properties. Therefore, it is among the most promising spectrometer types to meet the demands of hyper-spectral imaging. A further improvement of the optical performance is based on the modification of the surface figure of the substrate to an aspherical shape while keeping the mentioned constant grating line distribution. There are many reasons to employ interference lithography/holography - and in particular the direct blazing approach - even for the generation of the specific Offner grating line distribution on the convex substrate. A main benefit of this method is the attainable nearly perfect angular orientation of the blaze facets for the whole grating aperture. Here the achievable well defined blaze structure leads to best diffraction efficiencies close to the theoretical optimum - independent from the local curvature of the substrate. To manage the more complex recording setups of direct blazed Offner gratings, reliable methods for testing the wave front quality are a necessary pre-condition. A corresponding test method based on holographic principles will be introduced in the following text. The aspherical Offner grating was designed for the application in the UV-1 spectrometer within the Sentinel 5 mission, which is part of the European Earth Observation Program "Copernicus". The spectrometer is a passive grating imaging spectrometer with a swath width of 2.670km and a spatial resolution of 50x50km(2).

TI  - Magnetic Connectivity in the Corona as a Source of Structure in the Solar Wind
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Five decades of satellite data confirm that the solar wind contains many boundaries separating flow with distinct magnetic and plasma properties. Some speculate the boundaries in the solar wind found at Earth originate at the solar surface and are carried along with the expanding solar wind as fossil structures to 1 AU. This begs the question, is it the physics and magnetic structure above the photosphere that creates well-defined boundaries between different magnetic flux regions at 1 AU in the solar wind? Magnetic boundaries in the corona exist all the time as topological features of null points in the field. These topological magnetic boundaries seem to be likely locations for plasma boundaries. It can be expected that these boundaries are typical locations where field line-integrated quantities, such as field-aligned current, experience large and abrupt changes. We perform three-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar corona driven by photospheric foot point motions. We find that large and abrupt changes occur for field line-integrated quantities across a magnetic topological boundary and the cause for these changes is the discontinuous mapping for magnetic field lines and thus for Alfven waves across these boundaries. It is also demonstrated via in situ properties that thin layers of field-aligned and perpendicular currents are frequently located at or close to topological boundaries.Plain Language Summary The solar wind travels from the Sun to the orbit of Earth (where we can measure it) in a day or more, and it brings with it the signature of processes which happen on the solar surface. The structure that we observe in the solar wind at Earth's orbit resembles a group of waving inflatable tube-man arms flailing about each other. These structures are "magnetic flux tubes", and their boundaries separate regions in the solar wind where the magnetic field, plasma density, and flow can be drastically different. In order to discern the origin of these structures, we perform simulations of the plasma and magnetic field on the solar surface, where the material that forms the solar wind begins its journey out to the orbit of Earth. We find that very specific features in the magnetic field are responsible for creating boundary-like structures and that the plasma either side of these boundaries can evolve independently. This paper shows boundary structure in the solar magnetic field and plasma; however, the connection of these structures to the solar wind structure is not yet clear. Future work will address this question.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURES ON THE NATURE OF RIVERBED DISPLACEMENTS FOR THE RIVERS OF THE DNISTER BASIN UPPER PART
T2  - GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of work is to investigate the influence of the Precarpathian bend and the Volynian-Podolian upland for the nature of displacement of the Dnister River tributaries and to determine stability of river channels. The object of this research is the Dnister River and its left and right tributaries. Considering the main factors influencing the nature of the horizontal riverbed displacements caused by both natural and anthropogenic factors, special attention is focused on the geological structures in the area on which Dnister River and its tributaries flow. Methods. Applying the software package ArcGIS authors had implemented the monitoring for a 100 year period using various topographical, geological, ground maps, and space images. For monitoring of displacements of the riverbeds of right and left bank tributaries of the Dnister there were used: topographic maps at scales 1:100000 and 1:75000 (Austrian period - 1886, 1910, Polish period -1930, the Soviet period - 1985, 1989); space images Landsat 7 (2000), Landsat 8 (2014) and Sentinel 2 (2016, 2017); and soil map scale 1:200000. It allows declaration about the different nature of the displacements. Results. The Dnister River flows on the border of two structures - the Precarpathian bend and the Volynian-Podolian upland. The right bank tributaries (Bystrytsia, Limnytsia, Stryi, and others) that begin in the Carpathians, cross the outer and inner boundaries of the Precarpathian bend, and are characterized by riverbed stability in the mountainous part, with multithreading and considerable meandering (especially for the Stryi River) within the Precarpathian bend. Lithological deposits have a significant influence at the mouth of the Stryi River. For these tributaries, according to the results of the study, large horizontal displacements are observed, they extend for: Limnytsia river - 500 m, Bystrytsia river - 580 m, Stryi River - 1200 m. The left bank tributaries, which are located on the Volynian-Podolian upland, include Zolota Lypa, Seret, Zbruch, Smotrych, and Strypa rivers. They are highly sinuos but much more stable in horizontal displacements. The maximum displacements for these rivers are 300-380 m. Scientific novelty. Investigation includes the influence of geological structures on the displacements of the left and right bank tributaries of the Dnister River and an analysis of the basic mathematical expressions that are used to evaluate the stability of the riverbeds. The practical significance. The results of monitoring riverbed deformation processes have to be considered while solving tasks related to riverbed processes, namely for: development and building of hydraulic engineering facilities, design of power transmission network when crossing rivers, development of gas transmission pipelines, determination of flood hazard zones and consequences of destruction after flash floods or seasonal floods, establishment of boundaries of land conservation areas, management of recreation activities, monitoring of the condition of frontier lands, and establishment of the border along the midstream of rivers.

TI  - MODELLING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE SCIENTIFIC CONCEPT "ALTRUISM" AND THE EVERYDAY IDEA OF ALTRUISM IN FRENCH LINGUISTIC CULTURE
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a diachronic linguistic model which allows the authors to reveal the dependence of the interiorization of the philosophical concept "altruism" on the French everyday worldview into which it integrates. The article describes the model application to the French-language material which included: 1) for the reconstruction of the concept - fragments of the scientific discourse proper and descriptions of scientific concepts in secondary texts, encyclopedic (reference) articles; 2) for the reconstruction of ideas - instructive tales and proverbs, literary critical reviews, precedent texts, inclusions of the words "altruism", "altruist" found in the corpus of the French language, and reactions to the stimulus "altruist" by native speakers of French. The model covers the period from the 18th century (the time when the term altruism" appeared) to the present time. The following tasks were completed in the course of modeling: for particular chronological periods - to justify the choice of language material and research methods adequate to the material; to show its development in diachrony based on the semantic attributes found in the scientific concept; to correlate the semantic content of the concept with the synchronous content of everyday representation; to characterize the features of the interiorization process. Since the end of the 17th-18th centuries (the time when the scientific concept "altruism" appeared) until the 21th century, the development of the studied fragment was recorded in the scientific and everyday worldviews, and similarities and differences in their semantic content were noted in separate synchronous sections. The scientific concepts were reconstructed, and the sets of attributes were identified. It has been found that French folklore definitely reflects the good as a manifestation of altruism, and contains its personifications. The altruist in the work of G. Flaubert "A Simple Soul" is more like a biblical character than a real person. Modern French naive consciousness reflects a close intertwining of the scientific notion of altruism and the common notion of it. The current content of everyday ideas in the psycholinguistic experiment is expressed by a significant number of synonyms and antonyms to the words that mark the semantic attributes of altruism; and extended non controversial judgments are situated on the periphery.

TI  - The iceberg drift study near Severnaya Zemlya in the spring of 2018 by remote sensing data
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - The movement of icebergs in the Laptev Sea off the coast of the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago in spring of 2018 was analyzed using satellite observations in visible spectral band. As is shown in the article the data of radiometers installed on the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites allow monitoring of iceberg drifting in spring period in the above Arctic region. Thus, in March-April 2018, the total amount of icebergs detected near the archipelago was 4917. 4161 icebergs were in the landfast ice, 722 ones were drifting with the ice fields, and the other 32 were aground in ice fields. The average length of the icebergs was equal to 88 m; the largest of the recognized icebergs was located in the landfast ice near the ice shelf of the Matusevich fjord and it was 1240 m in length. The maximum speed of drift of the icebergs, as determined by the satellite data, was equal to 29.5 km/day. This was estimated for the situation when the speed of the near-water (surface) wind reached 20 m/s and larger. The purpose of the work was to study drifting of icebergs in order to define more exactly dynamics of the iceberg movement in this poorly known area of the Arctic. It is found that in a case of the consolidated ice cover the drift speed of ice fields with the icebergs involved depends on the driving wind force and direction. According to mean speeds of movement all icebergs were separated into three groups: the icebergs of the coastal zone with velocities smaller 1 km/day; the icebergs of the transition zone at speeds of 1.3 to 1.6 km/day; and the icebergs of the transit zone with speeds larger 2 km/day. The characteristics of the iceberg drifts obtained on the basis of daily satellite monitoring can be used in regional iceberg drift models to ensure safe economic activity on the Arctic shelf. Also, they can find application in engineering calculations in the design of infrastructure facilities on the shelf of the Arctic seas.

TI  - Sentinel Emotional Events: The Nature, Triggers, and Effects of Shame Experiences in Medical Residents
T2  - ACADEMIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This study explores an under-investigated topic, how medical residents experience shame within clinical learning environments, by asking residents to reflect on (1) the nature of their shame experiences; (2) the events that triggered, and factors that contributed to, those shame experiences; and (3) the perceived effects of those shame experiences. Method In this hermeneutic phenomenology study, the authors recruited 12 (self-nominated) residents from an internal medicine residency at a large teaching hospital in the United States. Data collection from each participant in 2016-2017 included (1) a written reflection about an experience during medical training in which the participant felt "flawed, deficient, or unworthy," and (2) a semi-structured interview that explored the participant's shame experience(s) in depth. The data were analyzed according to hermeneutic traditions, producing rich descriptions about participants' shame experiences. Results Participants' shame experiences ranged from debilitating emotional and physical reactions to more insidious, fleeting reactions. Participants reported shame triggers relating to patient care, learning processes, and personal goals; numerous factors contributed to their shame experiences. The effects of shame reactions included social isolation, disengagement from learning, impaired wellness, unprofessional behavior, and impaired empathy. Positive effects of shame reactions included enhanced learning, increased willingness to reach out for help, and improved relationships. Conclusions Shame reactions can be sentinel emotional events with significant physical and/or psychological effects in medical learners. This study has implications for learners, educators, and patients, and it may pave the way toward open, honest conversations about the role shame plays in medical education.

T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA I KONFLIKTOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is a continuation of "The Destiny of Russian philosophy and modernity. Transformations of values and transformation of models. Part I:' Both parts are united by an attempt to consider the phenomenon of Russian philosophy as a dispositive connecting such components as "the Russian idea," the specific relation to metaphysics, and a choice situation between knowledge and belief. If the first part mainly considered the pre-revolutionary period, the second part considers the Soviet and Post-Soviet periods. Russian philosophy of the Soviet period, voluntarily or not, reproduced the dispositive of the messianism and isolationism of the Russian idea. After the opposition of dialectics characteristic of the Soviet period, and metaphysics during the Post-Soviet period, Russian philosophy moves the discussion of the nature of metaphysical knowledge to the sphere of journalism. As for the third element of the dispositive - understanding the choice between belief and knowledge - its originality is that in Russian philosophy, the choice of contrasts is impossible. In general, an examination of the basic elements of the dispositive in Russian philosophy confirms the existence of these elements in all three stages of the history of native philosophical thought. Such important historical and philosophical questions, such as the question of the nature of modal communications between these elements and the question of the nature of relations of power that caused the emergence of this dispositive and supported its existence in changing historical and cultural circumstances, are left out of the field of discussion. Nevertheless, it is possible to confirm the hypothesis of the existence of Russian philosophy as uniform historical whole.

TI  - MONITORING THE RESPONSE OF MEDITERRANEAN BEACHES TO STORMS AND ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIONS USING LANDSAT IMAGERY
T2  - GEOFOCUS-REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE LA INFORMACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale and continuous monitoring of morphological changes on beaches is of great interest for coastal management. Shoreline positions were extracted with the system SHOREX on multiple dates on three beaches of the Gulf of Valencia from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 images from the period 1984-2014. These data made it possible to analyze the evolution of the beaches over three decades, as well as their short-term changes. In this way, the capacity of the shorelines to represent the response of the beaches to coastal storms and anthropogenic actions was evaluated. The shorelines obtained from SHOREX show great potential for monitoring and surveillance of the state of the beaches, while the analysis of their changes provides key information on the nature of the beaches.

AB  - This paper presents a navigation system architecture for localization of multiple UAVs in indoor environments. The system is composed of: 1) an Acoustic Localization System ( ALOS); 2) an inertial measurement unit ( IMU); and 3) an Extended Kalman Filter as sensor fusing technique. ALOS is designed to compute the position of the vehicles, using ultrasonic sensors to measure the distances between emitter modules fixed on the environment and receiver modules, mounted on quadrotors. The position calculated by ALOS is integrated with data from accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, using a Kalman Filter. The filter outputs an estimation for position and orientation of the vehicle, at a higher frequency than the ALOS operation. We present a physical experiment and a simulation to evaluate the architecture. The first experiment showed that ALOS is capable of achieving a centimeter level accuracy at 1 Hz rate. In simulation, two quadrotors performed position control using the complete proposed system for localization.

TI  - optical constants of iron and nickel metal and an assessment of their relative influences on silicate mixture spectra from the FUV to the NIR
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report new measurements of the optical constants of iron and nickel metal in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum (similar to 0.16-3.59 mu m), building upon the measurements of Cahill et al. (2012). These values were determined from metal films vapor-deposited onto fused-silica prisms. Our measurement of optical constants employed ellipsometry performed within the prism, sensing the side of the metal film unexposed to the ambient atmosphere. The data we report have important implications for modeling planetary reflectance and emittance spectra, especially in relation to space-weathering effects observed in remotely sensed data for the surfaces of the Moon, Mercury, and asteroids.

TI  - City block-based assessment of land cover components' impacts on the urban thermal environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has posed many problems for the urban thermal environment, which has spurred many scientists to focus their studies on the effects of landscape compositions and configurations on land surface temperature (LST) to offer some support to policy-making decisions to mitigate the phenomenon of the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Many prior studies have developed the relationship between land cover types and LST using pixel-by-pixel or grid-by-pixel regression analysis; from the viewpoint of practical usage in urban planning, this study estimates the impact of land cover compositions on LST by taking a city block-based regression analysis approach. Based on Landsat 8 TIRS images over a continuous span of 4 years, the proposed approach is compared to the conventional grid-based method and discussed in terms of its feasibility. We evaluate the relative contributions of different land cover components to the estimated relationship. First, the phenomenon of UHI is found to be an event affecting area rather than a pixel or point location. Second, as more images are employed, a more meaningful relationship between the land cover components and LST can be achieved based on statistical analysis. Third, the estimated effect of land cover composition on LST with different relative weights can be more helpful to allow local governments or other metropolitan areas with similar urban size to make policy decisions in urban management and mitigate the influence of the UHI effect on the human population.

TI  - Updates to the Noah Land Surface Model in WRF-CMAQ to Improve Simulated Meteorology, Air Quality, and Deposition
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional, state, and local environmental regulatory agencies often use Eulerian models to investigate the potential impacts on pollutant deposition and air quality from changes in land use, anthropogenic and natural emissions, and climate. The Noah land surface model (LSM) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is widely used with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for such investigations, but there are many inconsistencies that need to be changed so that they are consistent with dry deposition and emission processes. In this work, the Noah LSM in WRFv3.8.1 is improved in its linkage to CMAQv5.2 by adding important parameters to the WRF/Noah output, updating the WRF soil and vegetation reference tables that influence CMAQ wet and dry photochemical deposition processes, and decreasing WRF/Noah's top soil layer depth to be consistent with CMAQ processes (e.g., windblown dust and bidirectional ammonia exchange). The modified WRF/Noah-CMAQ system (both off-line and coupled) impacts meteorological predictions of 2-m temperature (T2; increases and decreases), 2-m mixing ratio (Q2; decreases), and 10-m wind speed (WSPD10; decreases) in the United States. These changes are mostly driven by leaf area index values and aerodynamic roughness lengths updated in the vegetation tables based on satellite data, with additional impacts from soil tables updated based on recent soil data. Improvements in the consistency in the treatment of land surface processes between CMAQ and WRF resulted in improvements in both estimated meteorological (e.g., T2, WSPD10, and latent heat fluxes) and chemical (e.g., ozone, sulfur dioxide, and windblown dust) model estimates.Plain Language Summary In this study we update a robust and well-established coupled meteorology-chemistry model, via the use of advanced treatments of land-atmosphere characteristics and processes, as well as improved linkages for a commonly used land surface model in weather, climate, and air quality applications. The updated model shows improved predictions of important weather and air quality parameters, such as temperature, wind speed, and ozone when compared to observations in the United States. Overall, the updated modeling system more firmly establishes the physical connections between the land and atmosphere to expand the model to a wider array of weather, climate, and air quality applications.

TI  - Use of sensors and spatial variability to fertilization management in processing tomato
T2  - XV INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PROCESSING TOMATO
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th International Symposium on Processing Tomato
CL  - Athens, GREECE
AB  - One of the main problems in fertilization management in commercial plots is the lack of technical knowledge in the adjustment of the crop fertilization requirements in relation to its production, phenological moment, and the spatial variability. In this sense, the objective must be to establish methodologies and sensors that can help to establish a more adjusted crop fertilization need in each area and during all crop cycles with the aim of more efficient crop production. However, technicians do not have sufficient knowledge of these techniques and these measures are strongly influenced by spatial variability. To reduce these problems, transfer of knowledge is a crucial factor. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of spatial variability to determine nitrogen status in processing tomato crop with different sensors (massive and punctual) to help the technician to design a more efficient fertilization management, locate the measure points and select the adequate sensor. For this study, in the FERTINNOWA project, a trial was conducted in 2017 in a commercial plot belonging to the CONESA group, with 'H-1311' tomato cultivar of medium cycle (125-135 days). The spatial variability was studied with a NDVI image from Sentinel 2 satellite obtained in the previous year and the measure of the ECa sensor. These data permitted to select different control points in relation with the crop grown and soil texture, to evaluate the crop nutritional status during the all processing tomato crop cycles. Different fertilization status sensors were evaluated with lab plant analysis in the different control points to determine variability and representability of the measure to determine nutritional plant status. The data showed that the variability between control points were high with different sensors and in different crop moments.

TI  - Use of satellite images to differentiate productivity zones in commercial processing tomato farms
T2  - XV INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PROCESSING TOMATO
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th International Symposium on Processing Tomato
CL  - Athens, GREECE
AB  - New trends in crop production and new technologies are enabling better management of large fields with great soil heterogeneity. In this sense, the improvement in the temporal and spatial resolution of the new satellites produces images of the crop throughout its crop cycle. With vegetative indexes such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), an evolution of the development of the tomato plant cover of industry can be obtained with images every 5 to 7 days. This free tool available to any user with minimal knowledge of GIS will allow the farmer to identify the different productive areas of the farm in advance of planning the harvest. The objective of this study was to evaluate the capacity of satellite images to detect different productive zones in a commercial farm of processing tomato during two years of cultivation. For this study, a trial was conducted in 2016 and 2017 in commercial plots belonging to the ROMA Company, with 'H-1311' tomato cultivar of medium maturity (125-135 days). The irrigation system in the farm was subsurface drip. The spatial variability was studied with different NVDI images from Sentinel 2 satellite obtained in both years. These points were used as control point to measure the development of the crop during the entire crop cycle and to establish different productivity zones. The result in the yield data in the different control points selected showed different yields between the different zones of the farm. The harvest data were correlated with NVDI images from the Sentinel satellite 2 (R-2=0.81) in 2017 to produce a map of yield of all the farm surface in both years of cultivation. In 2016 this relation was worse. The satellite images allowed the identification of zones of development and production of crops, which can be a good tool to study high and low productivity points on the farm.

AB  - This paper evaluates the 10-m wind intensities and significant wave heights from the NCEP Ensemble Forecast System using altimeter data. A total of 20 perturbed members plus a control member (deterministic run) compose the ensemble. The assessment is focused on the comparison between the control run and the ensemble mean, in terms of benefits presented by four error metrics. Four satellite missions are selected for the assessments, obtained from AVISO and NESDIS/NOAA databases. Results show that the scatter components of the errors strongly depends on the latitude, were extra-tropical locations at longer forecast times present large errors. A significant improvement using the ensemble forecast compared to deterministic runs was verified at these locations, where the RMSE of day 10 was reduced from 5 to 3.5 m/s for U10 and from 1.8 to 1.3 meters for Hs.

AB  - This paper tackles the problematic relationship between religion and violence. Religion is ambivalent in relation to peace and violence. Nonetheless, as peace advocates, we need to use the potential resources of religion as a way of advancing peace in a violent world. Interfaith dialogue is a tedious task not only because it needs time and patience in its engagements but also because of the complexities involved in the conversation. Thus, people engaged in interfaith dialogue must be open not only to sharing their experiences and views but also must be prepared to listen to questioning their positions and faiths. Since dialogue implicates a whole worldview, not limited to religion, we need to learn from each other in the process of engagement. In this dialogue, we need to shift from a focus on our commonality to the affirmation of our differences.

AB  - There are four widely-used kernel driven models in the thermal infrared domain, including LSF-Li, RL, Ross-Li and Vinnikov. They have great potentials to achieve the angular effect correction for land surface temperature products. RL and Ross-Li are direct extensions of kernel models in the visible and near infrared region and other two models were directly designed for the thermal infrared region. Their fitting abilities should be evaluated comprehensively at first. Some evaluation works have been reported based on simulated datasets or measured dataset with limited view angles. In this paper, two measured multi-angle datasets with over 104 directions were selected to do evaluation. Both of them were extracted from the airborne measurement using spatial-temporal average method. We found that LSF-Li is always the best one, followed by Ross-Li, RL and Vinnikov.

TI  - Shallow water bathymetry from WorldView-2 stereo imagery using two-media photogrammetry
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two-media photogrammetry appears to be a useful technology for mapping shallow water depth. The objective of this paper is to explore the feasibility of shallow water bathymetry using satellite two-media photogrammetry. This paper presents a two-media photogrammetry technique for WorldView-2 stereo multispectral imagery. In this method, near-infrared band is used for sun glint elimination. A combination of Scale Invariant Feature Transform and Semi-Global Matching algorithm is adopted for dense stereo matching. Rational Function Model is applied for raw Digital Elevation Model generation and the water surface elevation is determined by interpolating water edge elevation. Finally, the approximate refraction correction model is adopted in the water region to correct the vertical coordinate offsets. Our experimental results of Ganquan Island and Zhaoshu Island show that a reasonable depth estimate with relative error less than 17% and 14% can be obtained for the water depth range between 5 and 20 m, and the root-mean-square error are 2.09 m and 1.76 m, respectively. However, less accurate estimate is found for the very shallow water depth range between 0 and 5 m. The overall accuracy of satellite two-media photogrammetry is at the same level with the traditional multispectral-based model for bottom depth retrieval.

In this paper, based on scattering vector in hybrid mode and X-Bragg scattering model, a new method is presented for evaluating ship detection performance. By using this method, three polarization features, including circular polarization ratio, relative phase, and roundness, were analyzed selectively. Experiments performed using hybrid mode emulated from C-band RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric SAR data validate the feasibility of the method in analyzing the ship detection performance.

AB  - The Tibet plateau (TP), as the third pole, plays an important role for indicating the global climate change. This study evaluated the potential of SAR data on lake mapping on the southern TP region which is characterized by various complex water conditions. A robust object-oriented lake extraction approach using Sentinel-1 data is proposed. First, an automatic method of selecting regions that obeying bimodal distribution is used to obtain the optimal threshold to identify lakes. Second, Taguchi design experiments are used to obtain the optimal segmentation parameters of multiresolution segmentation and object-oriented classification is applied to extract the lakes. Finally, a postprocessing approach is applied to remove the false alarms due to shadows with auxiliary DEM data and object-based variance of intensity map. Experiments on the Sentinel-1 image demonstrate that the proposed method produces highly reliable lake extents in southern TP, and is potentially applicable to the lake mapping projects on the whole TP.

AB  - Spatialized Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data was essential for studying the relationship between human activities and environmental changes. Rapid and accurate acquisition of this data was always an important issue. The land use/cover data and the DMSP/OLS nighttime light (NTL) data both had been used to simulate GDP spatialization. By analyzing previous researches, the estimated method based on land use/cover data, estimated method based on radiance-calibrated NTL data and estimated method based on land use/cover data and radiance-calibrated NTL data were applied and compared in this study. The result showed the precision of agricultural production method based on land use/cover data and non-agricultural production method based on radiance-calibrated NTL data which did not include saturated pixels were both high. The accuracy of estimated GDP based on land use/cover data and radiance-calibrated NTL data was the best. The estimated method based on land use/cover data and radiance-calibrated NTL data was used to create a 1-km gridded GDP density map in 2010. In order to make the estimated result more accurate, the county-level statistical data was used to correct it. The corrected 1-km gridded GDP density map in 2010 reflected the Chinese economic development situation and spatial distribution characteristics of GDP density in 2010.

AB  - The integration of satellite data and numerical modeling represents an efficient strategy to find immediate answers to the main issues raised at the onset of a new effusive eruption. Satellite thermal remote sensing can provide a variety of products suited to timing, locating, and tracking the radiant character of lava flows, including the opening times of eruptive vents. The time-series analysis of thermal satellite data can also provide estimates of the time-averaged discharge rate and volume. High-spatial resolution multispectral satellite data complement field observations for monitoring the lava emplacement in terms of flow length and area. All these satellite-derived parameters can be passed as input to physics-based numerical models in order to produce more accurate and reliable forecasts of effusive scenarios during ongoing eruptions. Here, we demonstrate the potential of the integrated application of satellite remote sensing techniques and lava flow models during the 2017 eruptive activity of Mt Etna. Remote sensing data from SEVIRI are analyzed by the HOTSAT system to output hotspot location, lava thermal flux, and effusion rate estimation. This output is used to drive, as well as to continuously update, lava flow simulations performed by the physics-based MAGFLOW model. We also show how Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data complement the field observations to track the flow front position in time and add valuable data on lava flow advancement with which to iteratively validate the numerical simulations.

AB  - Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) have gained great importance in remote sensing-based applications, and also in mineral prospectivity mapping. Studies show that MLAs can outperform classical classification techniques. So, MLAs can be useful in the exploration of strategical raw materials like lithium (Li), which is used in consumer electronics and in the green-power industry. The study area of this work is the Fregeneda-Almendra region (between Spain and Portugal), where Li occurs in pegmatites. However, their smaller exposition can be regarded as a problem to the application of remote sensing methods. To overcome this, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were applied to. This study aims at: (i) comparing the performance accuracy in lithological mapping achieved by SVM and by RF; (ii) evaluating the sensitivity of both classifiers to class imbalance and; (iii) compare the results achieved with previously obtained results. For these, the same Level 1-C Sentinel-2 images (October 2017) were used. SVM showed slightly better accuracy, but RF was able to correctly classify a larger number of mapped Li-bearing pegmatites. The performance of the models was not equal for all classes, having all underperformed in some classes. Also, RF was affected by class imbalanced, while SVM prove to be more insensitive. The potential of this kind of approach in Li-exploration was confirmed since both algorithms correctly identified the presence of Li-bearing pegmatites in the three open-pit mines where they outcrop as well in areas where Li-pegmatites were mapped. Also, some of the areas classified as Li-bearing pegmatites are corroborated by the interest areas delimited in previous studies.

AB  - Snow melting is a complex process generally characterized by a moistening, ripening and run-off phase. Identifying the timing of these phases is crucial for river discharge, avalanches and snow contaminants monitoring. An alternative to the sporadic and punctual snow water equivalent (SWE) and liquid water content (LWC) measurements is represented by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). We analyze the correlation between the multi-temporal C-band SAR backscattering and the snow melting timing. The backscattering was compared with in situ observations and snow modelling simulations for two test sites in the Alpine region. SAR sensitivity to LWC variation and snow properties enables the identification of the snow melting phases. A strong decrease of the backscattering in correspondence of an increase of LWC, e.g. during the moistening phase, is observed. Furthermore, an increase of backscattering happens in correspondence of SWE decrease, e.g. during the run-off phase. We discuss the possible mechanisms which affect SAR backscattering, related both to LWC and snow structure variations. The presented investigation could have relevant application for monitoring and predicting the snowmelt progress over large regions.

T2  - Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Redox stress is a well-known contributor to aging and diseases in skin. Reductants such as dithiothreitol (DTT) can trigger a stress response by disrupting disulfide bonds. However, the quantitative response of the cellular proteome to reductants has not been explored, particularly in cells such as fibroblasts that produce extracellular matrix proteins. Here, we have used a robust, unbiased, label-free SWATH-MS proteomic approach to quantitate the response of skin fibroblast cells to DTT in the presence or absence of the growth factor PDGF. Of the 4487 proteins identified, only 42 proteins showed a statistically significant change of 2-fold or more with reductive stress. Our proteomics data show that reductive stress results in the loss of a small subset of reductant-sensitive proteins (including the collagens COL1A1/2 and COL3A1, and the myopathy-associated collagens COL6A1/2/3), and the down-regulation of targets downstream of the MAPK pathway. We show that a reducing environment alters signaling through the PDGF-associated MAPK/Akt pathways, inducing chronic dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 at Thr202/Tyr204 and phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 in a growth factor-independent manner. Our data highlights collagens as sentinel molecules for redox stress downstream of MAPK/Akt, and identifies intervention points to modulate the redox environment to target skin diseases and conditions associated with erroneous matrix deposition.

T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The information obtained by means of spectral remote sensing (i.e., the hyperspectral images) are involved in several real-life scenarios and applications. Historical research, monitoring of environmental hazards, forensics and counter-terrorism are some examples of contexts in which the hyperspectral data play an important role.In many contexts, the hyperspectral images could also play sensitive roles (e.g., in military applications, etc.) and are generally exchanged among several entities, in order to carry out different tasks on them. Therefore, it is important to guarantee their protection. A meaningful choice is the protection through data hiding techniques.In fact, by means of reversible data hiding techniques, the imaging data become a sort of information carrier and can be used for delivering other important data that can be used, for instance, to check the integrity of the original imaging data.In this paper, we introduce a one-pass framework that is able to perform the lossless data hiding and the lossless compression of the marked stream, at the same time, by exploiting the capabilities of the predictive paradigm. Substantially, in a single pass, a marked and compressed stego image is obtained, which can be exactly restored by the receiver: by decompressing and reversibly reconstructing the original unaltered image. In addition, our framework also permits to perform only the decompression (without the extraction of the hidden information). In this manner, the resulting stego (marked) hyperspectral image, could be used for several purposes, in which it is not necessary to extract the original data and an acceptable grade of degradation is tolerated. We also implement a proof-of-concept of the proposed framework to assess the effectiveness of our contribution. Finally, we report the achieved experimental results, which outperform other similar approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B,V. All rights reserved.

TI  - High-accuracy detection of malaria vector larval habitats using drone-based multispectral imagery
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest in larval source management (LSM) as an adjunct intervention to control and eliminate malaria transmission has recently increased mainly because long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spray (IRS) are ineffective against exophagic and exophilic mosquitoes. In Amazonian Peru, the identification of the most productive, positive water bodies would increase the impact of targeted mosquito control on aquatic life stages. The present study explores the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) for identifying Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi) breeding sites with high-resolution imagery ( 0.02m/pixel) and their multispectral profile in Amazonian Peru. Our results show that high-resolution multispectral imagery can discriminate a profile of water bodies where Ny. darlingi is most likely to breed (overall accuracy 86.73%- 96.98%) with a moderate differentiation of spectral bands. This work provides proof-of-concept of the use of high-resolution images to detect malaria vector breeding sites in Amazonian Peru and such innovative methodology could be crucial for LSM malaria integrated interventions.Author summary The most efficient malaria vector in the Latin American region is Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi). In Amazonian Peru, where malaria is endemic, Ny. darlingi feeds both indoors and outdoors (endophagy, exophagy), depending on the local environment, and rests outdoors (exophily). LLINs and IRS, the most common tools employed for vector control, target endophagic and endophilic mosquitoes. Thus, they are only partially effective against Ny. darlingi. Control of the aquatic stages of vector mosquitoes, larval source management (LSM), targets the most productive breeding sites nearest to human habitation. In four riverine communities, we used drones with high-resolution imagery as a key initial step to analyze water bodies within the estimated flight range of Ny. darlingi, 1 km. We found distinctive spectral profiles for water bodies that were positive versus negative for Ny. darlingi. The methodology and analysis reported here provide the basis for testing whether LSM can be combined successfully with LLINs and IRS to contribute to the elimination of transmission in malaria hotspots in the Amazon.

M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this work was to analyze the recent rates of progradation and regression of an interior delta in the Los Micos lagoon, located in the Honduras Caribbean. The analysis focused on the anthropogenic and meteorological factors that have contributed to the accelerated deltaic formation and the potential effects on the natural physical system. To do this, polygons have been generated from satellite images of the Landsat mission taken in the years: 1984, 1999, 2010 and 2014. The areas of the polygons have been calculated and their temporal evolution has been analyzed. A delta progradation rate of 38.45 m.a(-1) has been observed, which has caused a loss of lagoon area of similar to 6.77 ha.a(-1), as a result of the change in land use in the watershed and the effects of severe weather events such as Hurricane Mitch.

M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Greater use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer has led surgeons and radiation oncologists to have frequent encounters with women with upfront node-positive disease and a clinical complete response. These cases raise many important questions about what the optimal locoregional management should be to minimize recurrence risk while minimizing treatment-related toxicities. A particular point of debate is whether all patients who are known to have had node-positive disease before neoadjuvant chemotherapy should receive complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) if they have had a complete clinical and radiologic response. In this article, we present arguments and evidence in favor of and against axillary dissection after a complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by a brief data-driven review of implications for adjuvant radiotherapy in this context. We conclude that as trials continue to gather more evidence to guide decisions in the future, we must encourage patients to enroll in clinical trials when eligible, and otherwise support them to make decisions that are informed and congruent with their personal values in areas where there is clinical equipoise.

AB  - Etty Hillesum's diaries and letters, in both their form and content, stand as a repudiation of the Nazis' monologically constituted reductive discourse. Unlike her oppressors, Hillesum embraced the Other with its voices saturating her writings and informing her Weltanschauung. One such voice is that of Russian novelist, Fyodor Dostoevsky. Through an examination of his fable of "The Grand Inquisitor" and The Brothers Karamazov of which it is a part, their likely influences on Hillesum's all-embracing worldview are examined. In contrast to the diabolical markers of the Nazis' discourse, it is the seminal proposition of this paper that Hillesum's dialogically constituted writings, which foreground a concern for the Other, reflect the discourse of the deity.

TI  - Relevance and Scale Dependence of Hydrological Changes in Glacierized Catchments: Insights from Historical Data Series in the Eastern Italian Alps
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers have an important hydrological buffering effect, but their current rapid reduction raises concerns about future water availability and management. This work presents a hydrological sensitivity analysis to different climatic and glacier cover conditions, carried out over four catchments with area between 8 and 1050 km(2), and with glacierization between 2% and 70%, in the Italian Alps. The analysis is based on past observations, and exploits a unique dataset of glacier change and hydro-meteorological data. The working approach is aimed at avoiding uncertainties typical of future runoff projections in glacierized catchments. The results highlight a transition from glacial to nival hydrological regime, with the highest impacts in August runoff over smaller catchments. The buffering effect of current glaciers has largely decreased if compared to the Little Ice Age, up to 75% for larger catchments, but it is still important during warm and dry summers like 2003. We confirm a non-linear relationship between glacier contribution in late summer and catchment area/percent glacierization. The peak in runoff attributable to glacier melt, expected in the next 2-3 decades on highly glacierized alpine catchments, has already passed in the study area.

TI  - Factors influencing the adoption of the sentinel lymph node technique for endometrial cancer staging: an international survey of gynecologic oncologists
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To explore the factors influencing adoption of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) technique for endometrial cancer staging among gynecologic oncologists.Methods A self-administered, web-based survey was sent via email (April 20 through May 21, 2017) to all members of European Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, International Gynecologic Cancer Society, and Society of Gynecologic Oncologists. Surgical and pathologic practices related to SLN and reasons for not adopting this technique were investigated.Results Overall, 489 attending physicians or consultants in gynecologic oncology from 69 countries responded: 201 (41.1%), 118 (24.1%), and 117 (23.9%) from Europe, the USA, and other countries, respectively (10.8% did not report a country). SLN was adopted by 246 (50.3%) respondents, with 93.1% injecting the cervix and 62.6 % using indocyanine green dye. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network SLN algorithm was followed by 160 (65.0%) respondents (USA 74.4%, Europe 55.4%, other countries 71.4%). However, 66.7% completed a backup lymphadenectomy in high-risk patients. When SLN biopsy revealed isolated tumor cells, 13.8% of respondents recommended adjuvant therapy. This percentage increased to 52% if micrometastases were detected. Among the 243 not adopting SLN, 50.2% cited lack of evidence and 45.3% stated that inadequate instrumentation fueled their decisions.Conclusions SLN with a cervical injection is gaining widespread acceptance for staging of endometrial cancer among gynecologic oncologists worldwide. Standardization of the surgical approach with the National Comprehensive Care Network algorithm is applied by most users. Management of isolated tumor cells and the role of backup lymphadenectomy for high-risk' cases remain areas of investigation.

TI  - Proliferative Typhlocolitis With Multinucleated Giant Cells: A Nonspecific Enteropathy in Immunodeficient Sentinel Mice
T2  - VETERINARY PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Beginning in 2015, athymic nude sentinel mice from conventional, medium-, and high-security facilities presented to the Comparative Pathology Laboratory (CPL) with weight loss, diarrhea, and/or rectal prolapse. Regardless of whether clinical signs were present or absent, the gross observation of ceco-colonic thickening corresponded histologically to pleocellular typhlocolitis with mucosal hyperplasia and lamina proprial multinucleated cells. A subset of affected sentinels exhibited granulomatous serositis and hepatosplenic necrosis with multinucleated cells. Initial suspicion of mouse hepatitis virus infection was excluded by polymerase chain reaction, electron microscopy, and serology. Multinucleated giant cells were confirmed as macrophages by positive immunoreactivity to Mac-3 and Iba-1 and negative immunoreactivity to pancytokeratin. From conventional and medium-security facilities, Helicobacter species were identified in 40 of 143 (27.9%) mice, with H. hepaticus accounting for 72.5% of identified Helicobacter species. Other agents included opportunistic bacterial infection (41/145, 28.3%), murine norovirus (16/106, 15.1%), and pinworms (2/146, 1.4%). From high-security facilities, only Enterobacter cloacae was identified (2/13, 15.4%), and no evidence of Helicobacter sp., murine norovirus, or pinworms was present. No potentially infectious disease agent(s) was identified in 71 of 146 (48.6%) affected nude sentinels from conventional and medium-security facilities and 11 of 13 (84.6%) affected nude sentinels from high-security facilities. No statistically significant differences in histologic lesion scores were identified between Helicobacter-positive and Helicobacter-negative mice. Thus, proliferative typhlocolitis with multinucleated giant cells was considered a nonspecific histologic pattern associated with a variety of primary and opportunistic pathogens in athymic nude mice.

AB  - This paper focuses on Sami indigenous people food system as an example to consider for alternative solutions which do not put stress on the planet ecosystems. Their food system is linked with Sami traditional ecological knowledge and livelihood practices and all together they inform the Sami's worldview. All these different fields of life are related and tied to a specific natural environment. We can notice connections with some aspects of environmental ethics theories and other traditional ethical theories especially with the Aristotelian virtue ethics.

TI  - Evaluating the capability of the Sentinel 2 data for soil organic carbon prediction in croplands
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The short revisit time of the Sentinel-2 (S2) constellation entails a large availability of remote sensing data, but S2 data have been rarely used to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) content. Thus, this study aims at comparing the capability of multispectral S2 and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data for SOC prediction, and at the same time, we investigated the importance of spectral and spatial resolution through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the variable importance in the prediction (VIP) models and the spatial variability of the SOC maps at field and regional scales. We tested the capability of the S2 data to predict SOC in croplands with quite different soil types and parent materials in Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, using multivariate statistics and local ground calibration with soil samples. We split the calibration dataset into sub-regions according to soil maps and built a multivariate regression model within each sub-region. The prediction accuracy obtained by S2 data is generally slightly lower than that retrieved by airborne hyperspectral data. The ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) is higher than 2 in Luxembourg (2.6) and German (2.2) site, while it is 1.1 in the Belgian area. After the spectral resampling of the airborne data according to S2 band, the prediction accuracy did not change for four out of five of the sub-regions. The variable importance values obtained by S2 data showed the same trend as the airborne VIP values, while the importance of SWIR bands decreased using airborne data resampled according the S2 bands. These differences of VIP values can be explained by the loss of spectral resolution as compared to APEX data and the strong difference in terms of SNR between the SWIR region and other spectral regions. The investigation on the spatial variability of the SOC maps derived by S2 data has shown that the spatial resolution of S2 is adequate to describe SOC variability both within field and at regional scale.

CP  - Joint Urban Remote Sensing Event (JURSE)
CL  - Vannes, FRANCE
AB  - This paper explores different aspects of semantic segmentation of remote sensing data using deep neural networks. Learning with deep neural networks was revolutionized by the creation of ImageNet. Remote sensing benefited of these new techniques, however Earth Observation (EO) datasets remain small in comparison. In this work, we investigate how we can progress towards the ImageNet of remote sensing. In particular, two questions are addressed in this paper. First, how robust are existing supervised learning strategies with respect to data volume? Second, which properties are expected from a large-scale EO dataset? The main contributions of this work are: (i) a strong robustness analysis of existing supervised learning strategies with respect to remote sensing data, (ii) the introduction of a new, large-scale dataset named MiniFrance.

AB  - We present an unsupervised and automatic system for volcano deformation monitoring via the Copernicus Sentinel-1 data. The system relies on the Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) approach, permitting us to generate updated displacement time series at every new Sentinel-1 acquisition over a selected area of interest in a fast and accurate way. The service is currently operative to monitor the main active Italian volcanoes in the framework of cooperation with the Italian Department of Civil Protection. The system is potentially extendable to every area on the Earth, thus making it suitable for surface displacement monitoring of a large variety of phenomena. Finally, the obtained results are made available to the scientific community through the EPOS Research Infrastructure.

AB  - The classification of land-cover classes in remote sensing images can suit a variety of interdisciplinary applications such as the interpretation of natural and man-made processes on the Earth surface. The Convolutional Support Vector Machine (CSVM) network was recently proposed as binary classifier for the detection of objects in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images. The training phase of the CSVM is based on convolutional layers that learn the kernel weights via a set of linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This paper proposes the Multi-scale Convolutional Support Vector Machine (MCSVM) network, that is an ensemble of CSVM classifiers which process patches of different spatial sizes and can deal with multi-class classification problems. The experiments are carried out on the EuroSAT Sentinel-2 dataset and the results are compared to the one obtained with recent transfer learning approaches based on pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

AB  - The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is defined as an increase of the air and surface temperature inside a city compared to surrounding rural areas. This increment can be of several degrees, thus exposing populations to serious health risks, especially in hot developing countries, where the majority of the world's megacities are located. The UHI effect has been widely studied in the past with local methods employing field sensors. The use of satellites moved the analysis from local to city scale, but long-term investigations have been so far limited by storage and computational capacities. In this work, both ESA and NASA heritage data are used to study temporal evolution of the UHI of the city of Chennai, India over a 14-year period. The Google Earth Engine is exploited to process the available large dataset in a reasonable time. Results show that the UHI of Chennai has grown of 450% over time and that its main drivers are average temperature and city expansion.

T2  - ETUDES ROMANES DE BRNO
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel Ualalapi (1987), by the Mozambican writer Ungulani Ba Ka Khosa (1957), chooses the subversion of the official discourse on the historical character of Ngungunhane, the last emperor of Gaza, as its main objective. In this historical narrative, the author is developing the theme of the relationship between tradition and modernity, emphasizing the place of orality in African reality. The novel presents several elements that are derived from the Mozambican tradition and form part of the animistic mythological worldview, typical for the African culture. These elements, having an extraordinary, unusual character and originating in a non -rational order, can be considered fantastic. The article intends to reflect on the character and the place of the fantastic elements in the novel Ualalapi and in the modern Mozambican narrative.

AB  - Rapid and uncontrolled urbanization is one of the most important land cover change phenomenon, which has important environmental impacts on ecosystem and climate. Due to the urbanization, green areas and natural permeable surfaces transform into non-permeable impervious surfaces, yielding an increase in urban land surface temperatures (LST). This causes an environmental phenomenon called urban heat islands (UHI), where urban temperatures are higher than the surrounding rural areas. Satellite remote sensing technology is an effective tool to monitor and quantify the effects of urbanization process with synoptic viewing capability and high temporal resolution. This study focuses on determining the land surface temperature and land use/land cover (LULC) changes in Istanbul for the last three decades and identifying the relation between these parameters using multi-temporal optical and thermal remote sensing data. The study is conducted using Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIR images, which were acquired on June 1984 and June 2017 respectively. In order to assess the land cover change between 1984 and 2017, a vegetation impervious surface -soil (V-I-S) model was applied to the fraction images obtained from linear spectral unmixing process. End-member spectra used in linear spectral umixing were extracted from ASTER spectral library and resampled to band passes of Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI data. In addition to V-I-S model outputs, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) images were produced. A maximum-likelihood classification was also performed to multi spectral bands in order to derive the LULC maps. Water bodies were extracted from imagery using automated water extraction index (AWEI). Thermal infrared bands of Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 are used for the derivation of land surface temperatures. The results of the study indicates that, the amount of impervious surfaces substantially increased along with land surface temperatures over three decades.

AB  - In the current study, the identification of open pit mining areas has been conducted using multispectral satellite images of medium (Landsat 8) and high (Sentinel 2B) spatial resolution of the province of Zamora Chinchipe in southern Ecuador. Such research involved several digital processes such as atmospheric correction, image fusion through the Brovey algorithm, noise elimination among others. We worked simultaneously with spatial and spectral patterns through the application of algorithms in order to increase spatial resolution, and spectral indices that enhance variables of interest. In addition, the Pixel Purity Index (PPI) methodology has been applied in order to obtain the classes involved in the study area based on the pure pixels and the results were compared between the two methodologies. The zones considered open-pit mining have been obtained in both cases.

AB  - This study aims to explain theodicy in Daesoon Jinrihoe using established theodicies. Theodicy in Daesoon Jinrihoe can be described as follows: within the worldview of Daesoon Jinrihoe, the problems of evil and suffering are better addressed by analyzing the problem of mutual contention. Accordingly, theodicy in Daesoon Jinrihoe is a matter which should be discussed only in regards to the time period known as the Former World and the transition period after the Reordering Works that leads up to the Later World. The Later World does not operate under patterns of mutual contention. Consequently, there will be no suffering. Therefore, issues of theodicy are irrelevant in the Later World. Theodicy should be dealt differently as it pertains to the Former World and the previously mentioned transition period.Daesoon Thought posits that there is an underlying principle presides over the cosmos, and the divine beings act in accordance with it and perform specific duties in their own subdivisions. The cosmic principle is able to contain cycles of both Sanggeuk (‘mutual destruction’ in general usage, but ‘mutual contention’ in Daesoon Thought related to the Former World) and sangsaeng (‘mutual generation’ in general usage and ‘mutual beneficence’ in Daesoon Thought related to the Later World). Suffering came into being due to mutual contention. However, mutual contention was not set into motion maliciously, but was arranged instead to facilitate the realization of greater values such as growth and development. In other words, mutual contention are not products of a moral value the nature of which is bad or wrong. Yet, since the world has operated under mutual contention from time immemorial, a nearly incalculably vast multitude of grievances have accumulated. In addition, the divine beings who had operated under mutual contention often made mistakes and spread confusion. This extreme situation resulted in tremendous disasters breaking out all over the world. Perhaps this particular theodicy could be named “Dualistic Sanggeuk Theology (Dualistic Theodicy of Mutual Contention).” After the divine beings reported to the Supreme God that the world had fallen into a serious crisis, the Supreme God penetratingly examined the circumstances of the world and then descended to Earth as a human being named Jeungsan. As Jeungsan practiced the Reordering Works of Heaven and Earth, the Great Opening was preordained by Him. As a result, the transition period started, and from that point onward, theodicy should be described differently. It is presumed that all creatures will be judged at the time of the Great Opening. This will result in the annihilation of all wicked beings including both divine beings and humans. There will also be the establishment of an earthly paradise as well as grievance resolution for all beings prior the Great Opening. This can also be called “The Eschatological Theodicy of the Resolution of Grievances.” Theodicy in Daesoon Jinrihoe adopts the two theodicies mentioned above. In addition to that, various theodicies from other traditions such as Irenaean (“soul-making”) Theodicy, Free Will Theodicy, Recompense Theodicy, Afterlife Theodicy, Karma Samsara Theodicy, theodicy of participation, and Communion Theodicy can all potentially be applied on a case by case basis.

TI  - BETWEEN CONSERVATISM AND UTOPIA, OR, LEO STRAUSS'S QUEST FOR A NONPOLITICAL FOUNDATION OF THE POLITICAL
T2  - ETICA & POLITICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Leo Strauss has been read as the author of a paradoxically nonpolitical political philosophy. This reading finds extensive support in Strauss's work, notably in the clain that political life leads beyond itself to contemplation and in the limits this imposes on politics. Yet the space of the nonpolitical in Strauss remains elusive. The "nonpolitical" understood as the natural, Strauss suggests, is the "foundation of the political". But the meaning of "nature" in Strauss is an enigma: it may refer either to the "natural understanding" of commonsense, or to nature "as intended by natural science," or to "unchangeable and knowable necessity." As a student of Husserl, Strauss sought both to retrieve and radically critique both the "natural understanding" and the "naturalistic" worldview of natural science. He also cast doubt on the very existence of an unchangeable nature. The true sense of the nonpolitical in Strauss, I shall argue, nmst rather be sought in his embrace of the trans-finite goals of philosophy understood as rigorous science. Nature may be the nonpolitical foundation of the political, but we can only ever approximate nature asymptotically. The nonpolitical remains as elusive in Strauss as the ordinary. To approximate both we need to delve deeper into his understanding of Husserl.

TI  - Archpriest Avvakum's Paradise Lost: The Treatise <i>Sniskanie i Sobranie o Bozhestve i o Tvari</i> as Interpretation of Biblical History
T2  - SLOVENE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SLAVIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper focuses on interpretation of Biblical history in a lesser-known treatise written by Archpriest Avvakum entitled Sniskanie i sobranie o Bozhestve i o tvari. The main issues addressed in the paper are the sources and aims of the treatise, methods and functions of citing, structure and style of the text, the perception of God, the imagery of the world and paradise, the notion of mankind and fall of man, the progress and sense of history, the flow of time, the role of the author and the reader in the text. Central to this polemical treatise is the thesis of the immensity of God, which manifests itself both in spatial and in temporal aspects. The simplicity of Avvakum's notion of the physical world is considered in the context of the author's holistic worldview. An emphasis is put on the perception of the creation of Adam as a key moment that predetermined the eschatological plan of history. The paper traces the spatial and temporal imagery of Avvakum and its manifestation inside the text, specifically in the alteration of the past, present, future and infinite planes of reality, which reveals Avvakum's attitude to the process and meaning of history. Sniskanie i sobranie is a text whose structure is a reverse reflection of the major work of Avvakum, i.e. his Life, where the events of the present are referred to the the sacred history, while in Sniskanie Biblical events are compared to the present. The versatility of Sniskanie i sobranie is demonstrated through its multiple functions, since the text is built as a polemical treatise, narrative and a dialogue. In conclusion, the interpretation of the events of the Book of Genesis by Avvakum is compared to John Milton's poem Paradise Lost. The works reflected both similar and entirely different problems in connection with the fall of man and the loss of paradise.

TI  - An Improvement of the Performance of SAR Offset Tracking Approach to Measure Optimal Surface Displacements
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - For the measurement of abrupt and large surface movements caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruption and melting glacier, Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offset tracking method would be a feasible solution because it can provide unambiguous ground displacements in both the ground range and azimuth directions when the interferometric phase is not coherent. However, the measurement performance of the method largely depends on the kernel size, which denotes the size of search window to estimate the azimuth and range offsets between reference and target SAR images. Thus, there is a trade-off between sensitivity and measurement density depending on the search kernel size. In this study, an enhanced SAR offset tracking method based on multi-kernel processing has been developed to find an optimized measurement from the trade-off between resolution and measurement accuracy. It can obtain optimal surface displacement measurements by calculating multiple offset measurements and determining a final measurement from the statistical properties of the multiple measurements. The measurement performance of the proposed method was evaluated by using European Remote Sensing 2 (ERS-2) satellite SAR data sets of the Hector Mine earthquake event in 1999 and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) data sets of the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake event. Our results showed that an optimized measurement from the trade-off between the observation accuracy and resolution can be effectively determined by our proposed processing strategy. The results are improved results for measurement density and accuracy over previously published results. It further confirmed that our new method is allowed for the optimal measuring the large-scale fast surface displacements that cannot be sufficiently observed with the phase-based SAR method.

AB  - Urbanization dynamics of small cities and towns are understudied, especially for countries in Africa. In this study, we use dense Landsat time series data to extract urban expansion dynamics of small cities and towns in Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and then conduct spatio-temporal analysis to characterize the obtained urban expansion. Our results show that the proposed methodology effectively extracted urban expansion of small cities with acceptable accuracy. Small cities experience patterns and rates of urban expansion that are markedly different from larger cities.

AB  - Crop classification and mapping are important to socioeconomic, food safety, and policy-making. Accurate and timely spatial distribution of crop types based on remote sensing is important for both scientific and practical purposes. However, the existing studies mostly focused on main crops, such as winter wheat, paddy rice and some others. For the garlic crop, there is few relevant research available. So in this paper, in order to explore the feasibility of garlic extraction, a preliminary experiment of garlic mapping based on random forest (GMRF) is carried out with multi-temporal 10-m resolution Sentinel-2 images, by taking Jinxiang County, Shandong Province, China as the experimental area. The experimental results suggest that the proposed GMRF method can achieve a good performance, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 98.56% and a kappa coefficient of 0.967.

AB  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has boosted the performance of Very High Resolution (VHR) remote sensing data classification. Moreover, the continuous development of CNN techniques for image scenes description has entered a new challenge. The deep neural network models require a huge number of training samples, which is the main limitation of processing remote sensing data. To overcome this issue, a new method, based on the Capsule neural network for VHR image scenes recognition is proposed in this work. Experiments on the public Aerial Image Dataset (AID) benchmark, containing different areal categories with submeter spatial resolution are conducted. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as compared with the classical CNN model.

AB  - Since 2015, the Sentinel 2 satellite provides a medium to high spatial resolution (10m-30m) images. For studying the land cover of Gabes area, located in the South- East of Tunisia, we exploited the 10 m bands of this satellite. We have tested the supervised classification with the SVM classifier. The classification is preceded by a segmentation step. The spectral data, the vegetation index and the texture metrics (GLCM) are used for training. The best Overall Accuracy OA (92, 12%) is obtained when all the used features are combined.

TI  - Morphological Changes of the Lower Ping and Chao Phraya Rivers, North and Central Thailand: Flood and Coastal Equilibrium Analyses
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chao Phraya River flows in the largest river basin of Thailand and represents one of the important agricultural and industrial areas in Southeast Asia. The Ping River is one major upstream branch flowing down slope southwardly, joining the Chao Phraya River in the low-lying central plain and ending its course at the Gulf of Thailand. Surprisingly, the overflow occurs frequently and rapidly at the Lower Ping River where channel slope is high, and in particular area, sand-choked is extensively observed, even in normal rainfall condition. In contrary, at the downstream part, the erosion of river bank and shoreline around the mouth of Chao Phraya River has been spatially increasing in place where there should be a massive sediment supply to form a delta. Here we use Landsat imageries taken in 1987, 1997, 2007 and 2017 to analyze geo-morphological changes of rivers. Results show that both rivers have undergone the rapid decreasing of water storage capacity and increasing of sand bar areas in river embayment. The total emerged sand bar area in the Lower Ping River increases from 1987 to 2017 up to 28.8 km(2). The excessive trapped bed sediments deposition along the upper reaches is responsible for the shallower of river embankment leading to rapid overflow during flooding. At the Chao Phraya River mouth, a total of 18.8 km(2) of the coastal area has been eroded from 1987 to 2017.This is caused by the reducing of sediment supply leading to non-equilibrium in the deltaic zone of the upper Gulf of Thailand. There are several possibility implications from this study involving construction of weir, in-channel sand mining, reservoir sedimentation and coastal erosion management.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - In this manuscript, a feature level ensemble based technique has been proposed using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for an unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) in landcover classification. Here, ANNs in form of an auto-encoder (AE) and a restricted Boltzman machine (RBM) have been used to learn the sample distribution of both source and target domains together during training. The trained ANNs are then used to find new features suitable for adaptive learning across the two domains having different sample distributions. Finally, the new features obtained from AE and RBM are fused to obtain the final train and test set. Experimentation has been carried out using patterns collected from Landsat-8 multi-spectral satellite images captured over various regions of India. The prediction accuracies of target classes obtained for the proposed scheme show encouraging results when compared with that of other state-of-the-art DA techniques.

AB  - Ground thermal anomalies associated with geothermal surface manifestations such as hot springs, fumaroles, altered surfaces, and steaming grounds serve as crucial indicator for geothermal explorations. In order to highlight the ground thermal anomalies, this study was raised to use the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data to estimate surface temperature under condition of dense vegetation. This study was focused to exploit the ASTER Thermal Infrared Radiometer (TIR) under lab and field scale conditions. The ASTER TIR bands were used to extract the Land Surface Temperature (Ts) from radiances by excluding surface emissivity (epsilon(s)). The epsilon is a surface parameter dependent to the surface materials. In this paper, we demonstrated the performance of the Normalized Emissivity Method (NEM) to calculate the Ts by estimating the epsilon under condition of dense vegetation. The Patuha and Wayang Windu Geothermal field in West Java (Indonesia) were selected as study site due to existence of surface manifestations under canopy vegetation and open area. According to the method, we identified that the ground thermal anomalies are located at surface manifestations. Due to the different spatial scales of satellite and surface measurements and the lack of homogeneous areas, which are representative for low resolution pixels and ground measurements, ground-validation is necessary. The consistency between ASTER data and location of geothermal manifestations indicated that thermal remote sensing data integrated with a spatial-based model, provides an effective means for identifying geothermal potential.

TI  - Not wallowing in misery - retractions of negative misinformation are effective in depressive rumination
T2  - COGNITION & EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - People often continue to rely on misinformation in their reasoning after they have acknowledged a retraction; this phenomenon is known as the continued-influence effect. Retractions can be particularly ineffective when the retracted misinformation is consistent with a pre-existing worldview. We investigated this effect in the context of depressive rumination. Given the prevalence of depressotypic worldviews in depressive rumination, we hypothesised that depressive rumination may affect the processing of retractions of valenced misinformation; specifically, we predicted that the retraction of negative misinformation might be less effective in depressive ruminators. In two experiments, we found evidence against this hypothesis: in depressive ruminators, retractions of negative misinformation were at least as effective as they were in control participants, and more effective than retractions of positive misinformation. Findings are interpreted in terms of an attentional bias that may enhance the salience of negative misinformation and may thus facilitate its updating in depressive rumination.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Was Associated With Favorable Survival Outcomes For Patients With Clinically Node-Negative Asian Melanoma
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard management for clinically node-negative cutaneous melanoma patients. This study aimed to evaluate the role of SLNB in Taiwanese melanoma patients and in particular, patients with acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM).Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes of the patients who underwent primary surgery followed by either SLNB or nodal observation at the Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from January 2000 to December 2011.Results: Among the total of 209 patients, 127 underwent SLNB and 51 underwent nodal observation only after primary surgery. There were no significant differences in clinicopathological features between the two groups except that patients who underwent SLNB were older and had a higher rate of ALM than those under nodal observation. The median follow-up time was 43.5 months until July 2013. The patients who underwent SLNB had significantly better diseasefree survival (DFS) (57.1 vs 18.7 months, p < 0.01) and melanoma-specific survival (MSS) (112.4 vs 45.2 months, p < 0.01) than those under observation. Improvement in DFS (HR: 0.51, p < 0.01) and MSS (HR: 0.60, p = 0.03) was observed even after adjusting for age and disease pathology by multivariate analysis. This benefit of clinical outcomes persisted in patients with ALM, Breslow thickness <= 2 mm, or no ulceration, but not in patients with non-ALM, Breslow thickness >2 mm, or ulceration.Conclusion: SLNB was associated with favorable outcomes in patients with clinically node-negative cutaneous melanoma, particularly in Taiwanese patients with ALM, Breslow thickness <= 2 mm, and nonulcerated melanoma.

CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - In complex urban environments, the information of high-resolution Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is of great importance for effective air pollution control, air navigation, public health assessment, and meteorological forecasting. High resolution AOD may be produced by merging and/or fusing existing AOD products or reproduced by merging and/or fusing the reflectance data at the top of atmosphere (TOA) and ground levels through the deep blue method. However, the former can only lead to the production of AOD with 500 m similar to 1 km spatial resolution at best. To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to fuse the reflectance values of Landsat and MODIS imageries at the TOA level to be in concert with the fused land surface reflectance values for advanced synthesis. Such a collective endeavor can lead to the production of AOD with daily 30m spatial resolution via the deep blue method. This paper thus presents such a synthetic effort that synergizes the spatial and temporal advantages of two satellite sensors (MODIS Terra and Landsat 8) to reach the goal with the aid of machine learning and high-performance computing. Based on the deep blue method, the practical implementation of the synthetic image processing was assessed by a case study of the downtown Atlanta area in the United States. 10-fold cross validation was applied stepwise to control the uncertainty via machine learning. The predictions of AOD at the ground level were calibrated using the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD data and finally validated by the AERONET) AOD data too.

AB  - Data fusion algorithms help extract information from "asynchronous" time series satellite data whereas data merging data help extract information from "synchronous" time series satellite data into a series of synthetic images by using the temporal, spatial, or even spectral properties. Such data fusion algorithms including Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) and spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) have greatly improved the coverage, enhancing data application potential with higher spatiotemporal resolution via multi-sensor earth observations. The goal of this study is to assess the utility of BME and modified BME algorithm with the aid of a data merging algorithm called Modified Quantile-Quantile Adjustment (MQQA), in comparison with STARFM for the retrieval of Aerosol Optical Depth in an urban environment. MQQA heavily counts on big data to support the systematic bias correction from "synchronous" time series satellite data. Such assessment of algorithmic efficiency needs to be carried out for both top of atmosphere reflectance and ground reflectance levels in support of the deep blue method for the retrieval of atmospheric optical depth at the ground level.

AB  - The DCC core is one of the coldest and most consistent targets. When viewed from space, the measurements over DCC have minimal impact from water vapor and aerosols. DCC technique can also be used for assessing the calibration and product stability for infrared thermal emissive bands (TEB). In this work, the stabilities from the years 2003 to 2019 are analyzed for both Terra and Aqua LWIR bands. Terra band 30 shows the largest change rate of 0.196 K/yr, and the total change since 2003 is approximately 3 K. Terra bands 27 and 29 and Aqua band 29 also show 0.03-0.05 K/yr changes, and the other bands exhibit stable trending. The Terra-Aqua difference for each LWIR band is analyzed. Band 30 shows the largest difference and largest change between Terra and Aqua. In general, for both Terra and Aqua, the LWIR bands show good and stable detector uniformity. However, the mirror side differences are affected by their anomalies such as the Terra safe mode in February 2016 and the Aqua formatter reset in January 2018. The impact of the Terra safe mode on the mirror side difference are generally larger for PV LWIR bands 27-30. After the safe mode, the mirror side difference jumped and then decreased. Before the formatter reset, the mirror side difference of Aqua PV LWIR bands is relatively larger than after the event. Aqua mirror side differences are stable and are smaller after the formatter reset. The formatter reset impact on the band averaged measurement is insignificant.

CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - GOES-16 is the first of the GOES-R series of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) and was launched on November 19, 2016. The spacecraft was initially in a test position of 89.5 degrees West and reached its operational position (75.2 degrees West) on December 11, 2017. The Himawari-8 spacecraft was launched on October 7, 2014 and is located at 140.7 degrees East. The similar design and similar calibration algorithm between the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on-board GOES-16 and the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on board Himawari-8 makes the importance of inter-comparison. Due to their locations, double difference is an appropriate method for their comparison and Aqua MODIS is one of good references. However, ABI (AHI) midwave-infrared (MWIR) band 7 does not have good matching with Aqua MODIS. In this work, the ABI-AHI comparison and ABI assessment for MWIR band 7 is performed using Aqua bands 20, 22, and 23. The ocean sites under ABI (AHI) at nadir are used for inter-comparison with Aqua MODIS. To enhance the comparison accuracy, a few procedures and corrections have been applied. For MWIR band 7, the ABI-AHI difference is about -0.39K over ocean scene, with the ABI measurement precision being slightly better than that of AHI. This double difference method is also being used for the assessment of ABI consistency before and after re-location on November 30, 2017. Two ocean scenes are selected for the ABI re-location assessments, with measurement precision at nadir providing better measurements than non-zero view angles. The ABI MWIR measurement over the ocean scene at the same view angle before and after re-location shows that the precisions are comparable. The MWIR band brightness temperature (BT) measurement over ocean scene shows a 0.04K difference, while the measurement precision before and after re-location is consistent.

AB  - Surface albedo is a key parameter controlling the earth energy budget, which can be estimated by integrating the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). The semi-empirical kernel-driven BRDF models has been widely used in BRDF/Albedo products, MODIS products for instance (Schaaf et al., 2002). However, these albedo products are suspect under large SZA (Liu et al., 2009). With the hotspot improved kernel-driven models, it is necessary to assess the property of these models. In this study, two POLDER datasets are utilized to access these models by root-mean-square error (RMSE) and relative RMSE (RMSE_r). Then, cross-comparison between albedos estimated by improved models under several SZAs is analyzed by POLDER and the concurrence MODIS pixels. This study is aimed at choosing suitable models for albedo estimation under different angular situations to retrieve more accurate albedo.

AB  - The installation of the  Disaster Management Center (DMC)and new budget classification on disaster and safety related budget in 2015 allowed the central government to manage disaster and safety related budget in a comprehensive manner. Based on the information coming from the separate budget classification, this study attempts to analyze the trends of disaster and safety related budget along with disaster type, activities, response stage, and departments during the time period of FY 2015-2019. The analysis demonstrates that the total size of disaster and safety budget does not appear to grow sizably over the period, although the public safety issue is big concern to most Koreans. When the disaster and safety related budget was classified along with disaster types, social and safety accident (41.5%) made up the largest portion in FY 2019, followed by natural disaster (31.4%), disaster and safety in general (26.9%). When classified along with activities, disaster prevention (46.2%), disaster safety system operation (28.4%), financial reserve (19.5%), education, training, advertisement (0.8%) was followed. When classified along with response stage, preparation made up almost the half (49.7%), followed by prevention (36.7%), recovery (6.1%). The analysis also shows that the Department of Land and Housing (25.2%), Public Administration and Safety (15.5%), Agriculture and Fishery (13.3%) are the big 3 in the allocation of the disaster safety management budget.

AB  - Mapping carbon stocks in the tropics is essential for climate change mitigation. Passive microwave remote sensing allows estimating carbon from deep canopy layers through the Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) parameter. Although their spatial resolution is coarser than that of optical vegetation indices or airborne Lidar data, microwaves present a higher penetration capacity at low frequencies (L-band) and avoid cloud masking. This work compares the relationships of airborne carbon maps in Central and South America with both (i) SMAP L-band VOD at 9 km gridding and (ii) MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Models to estimate carbon stocks are built from these two satellite-derived variables. Results show that L-band VOD has a greater capacity to model carbon variability than EVI. The resulting VOD-derived carbon estimates are further presented at a detailed (9 km) spatial scale.

AB  - The ecosystem science requirements for the NASA ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) will need to be validated after its launch in 2021[1]. Out of all disciplines that are encompassed by the NISAR mission, ecosystems are the one in most need of prelaunch proxy data, consisting of repeated L-band observations over an extended period of time. The solid earth, cryosphere, and hazards research communities have been able to use historical and contemporary spaceborne data available from ERS1/2, Radarsat, TerraSAR, Sentinel -1, and others for developing and evaluating products similar to what NISAR would be able to provide. This has been possible, in part, because of the focus of these disciplines on sparsely vegetated surfaces and the fairly straight -forward correspondence of surface scattering properties at both L- and C -band (wavelength of 24 cm and 5 cm respectively). Time series data from L-band sensors of value for ecosystem science disciplines, in contrast, have been sporadic and irregular. Ecosystems targets are almost always vegetated, with the scattering components and volume scattering nature of the target giving different scattering responses at the different wavelength regimes. For this reason, the use of C -band observations as a proxy for NISAR' s L-band, as is often done for other disciplines, is not possible for the development and testing of NISAR algorithms.In 2018, a plan was developed for a field/airborne/spaceborne campaign to acquire data in 2019 for NISAR pre -launch ecosystem algorithm development and for evaluation of NISAR ecosystem Cal/Val protocols. This plan includes the acquisition of not just L-band SAR data from the NASA/JPL UAVSAR airborne SAR, but also the acquisition of spaceborne data, airborne data, and field measurements to fully exercise the NISAR protocols for validation of its ecosystem science measurement requirements. Included in the plan is the processing of the field, airborne, and spaceborne data into validation products and the generation of NISAR-like level 3 science products.

In the present work, the problem of detesting agricultural and non-agricultural land cover is addressed The methodology is based on classification with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning using AlexNet. The study area is located at the Ionian Islands, which include several land cover classes according to Copernicus CORINE Land Cover 2018 (CLC 2018). Furthermore, the dataset consists of natural color images acquired by Sentinel-2A multispectral instrument. Experimentation proves that extra addition of training data from foreign grounds, unfamiliar to the Greek data, serves much as a confusing agent regarding network performance.

AB  - Traditionally, the land cover mapping process needs a ground data to be collected with high precision in both class labeling and spatial locations. To collect enough, high precise ground data require resources. As a result, we proposed an approach for building an image classification based on the class activation map (CAM) where the goal is not to identify the relationship between each pixel and a class label, but to identify whether each sub-images contain the class of interest or not. The output of the class activation map is the filter responds where pixels with high respond are likely to belong to the class of interest. We examined the performance on a LANDSAT 8 and found. The result of CAM showed that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in identifying whether a sub-image contains the class of interest or not. However, the precision in localizing the class is relatively moderate.

AB  - Subclasses classification is one of the major challenges in remote sensing (RS) scene classification. The area under observation, in order to classify agriculture and urban subclasses, requires efficient classification algorithms. Among such algorithms, deep learning algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is one such promising candidate to obtain the classified map. In this work, performance of a CNN network has been demonstrated on the data obtained from National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) field site Domain 17 by considering different modality data and its subsequent fusion using the proposed model of CNN as applied on (i) the Hyperspectral, (ii) the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and then (iii) fused data respectively. Both the Hyperspectral and the LiDAR data have been fused at pixel level. Using the proposed methodology, a classified map is obtained with an overall accuracy of 96 percent for fused data.

TI  - A Self-Calibrated Non-Parametric Time Series Analysis Approach for Assessing Insect Defoliation of Broad-Leaved Deciduous <i>Nothofagus pumilio</i> Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Folivorous insects cause some of the most ecologically and economically important disturbances in forests worldwide. For this reason, several approaches have been developed to exploit the temporal richness of available satellite time series data to detect and quantify insect forest defoliation. Current approaches rely on parametric functions to describe the natural annual phenological cycle of the forest, from which anomalies are calculated and used to assess defoliation. Quantification of the natural variability of the annual phenological baseline is limited in parametric approaches, which is critical to evaluating whether an observed anomaly is "true" defoliation or only part of the natural forest variability. We present here a fully self-calibrated, non-parametric approach to reconstruct the annual phenological baseline along with its confidence intervals using the historical frequency of a vegetation index (VI) density, accounting for the natural forest phenological variability. This baseline is used to calculate per pixel (1) a VI anomaly per date and (2) an anomaly probability flag indicating its probability of being a "true" anomaly. Our method can be self-calibrated when applied to deciduous forests, where the winter VI values are used as the leafless reference to calculate the VI loss (%). We tested our approach with dense time series from the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to detect and map a massive outbreak of the native Ormiscodes amphimone caterpillars which occurred in 2015-2016 in Chilean Patagonia. By applying the anomaly probability band, we filtered out all pixels with a probability <0.9 of being "true" defoliation. Our method enabled a robust spatiotemporal assessment of the O. amphimone outbreak, showing severe defoliation (60-80% and >80%) over an area of 15,387 ha of Nothofagus pumilio forests in only 40 days (322 ha/day in average) with a total of 17,850 ha by the end of the summer. Our approach is useful for the further study of the apparent increasing frequency of insect outbreaks due to warming trends in Patagonian forests; its generality means it can be applied in deciduous broad-leaved forests elsewhere.

AB  - Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) provide valuable information for the automatic mapping of our territories. In this article we focus on the analysis of urban land covers from SITS, trying to evaluate the density of artificialized areas. We hypothesize that such areas do not evolve significantly through time (over the interval of a year) compared to other non-artificialized areas (e.g., agricultural crops, vegetation). The proposed approach is based on a spatio-temporal characteristic measuring the temporal stability of a zone, extracted using the Run Length Encoding method. Preliminary results obtained on a series of 41 SENTINEL-2 images highlight the ability of our approach to discriminate different urban land-cover classes (e.g., artificial areas, high density vs. low density housing areas).

T2  - RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of small reservoirs with low suspended sediment concentration (CSS) is still a challenge for remote sensing. In this work we estimate CSS from the optical properties of water and orbital imagery. Campaigns were carried out at selected dates according to the calendar of sensor passages, rainfall seasonality and hydrograph of the reservoir for the collection of surface water samples and field spectroradiometry. The calibration between CSS and spectral behavior generated CSS estimation models from MODIS and Landsat 8 data, allowing investigation of their temporal and spatial behavior. The MODIS model generated a time series of CSS from 2000 to 2017, presenting R-2 = 0.8105 and RMSE% = 39.91%. The Landsat 8 model allowed the spatial analysis of CSS, with R-2 = 0.8352 and RMSE% = 15.12%. The combination of the proposed models allowed the temporal and spatial analysis of the CSS and its relationships with the rainfall regime and the quota variation of the Descoberto reservoir (DF). The results showed that the use of orbital data complements the CSS information obtained by the traditional methods of collecting and analyzing water quality in low CSS reservoirs.

T2  - SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with Pc5 magnetospheric pulsations featuring positive azimuthal wave numbers registered with the mid-latitude coherent decameter radar located near Ekaterinburg (EKB). The azimuthal wave numbers are determined using adjacent high time resolution beams directed toward the magnetic pole. Approximately 13 % of all steady waves registered with the radar propagate eastward. We have examined ten cases of wave observations with both small and high positive wave numbers, which occurred between April 2014 and March 2015. We performed a wavelet analysis of the data sets, estimated wavelength in radial direction for four cases, and determined meridional phase propagation direction. In three cases, the results are consistent with field line resonance behavior. However, in the majority of the studied events wave frequencies are considerably lower than those of field line resonance, which were derived from satellite data on magnetic field and particle density. These waves may be classed with the drift-compressional mode.

TI  - The Image of the Ideal Person or Plato on the Nature, Place and the Tragic Fate of Philosophers in the <i>Republic</i>
T2  - AGATHOS-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Plato describes the philosopher in the Republic as an ideal person, but taken in his dialectical contradiction. Therefore, the article is based on a textual analysis of Plato's works in the historical and philosophical vein, considers the question of the ideal and "false philosophers", their nature, functions in public life, position in the State structure. Complicated contradictory relationship of the ideal philosophers with the State power is shown in the article. On the one hand, they should pursue their higher predestination, and perceive the Good spending the contemplative life. On the other hand, as the citizens of the State, they should for the sake of people bring the supreme knowledge to public life. But the materialization of ideas is always connected with big problems. The false philosophers are only apparently philosophers. They are ready to actively participate in the political life of the country because of their psychology and goals. Unfortunately being greedy and ambitious they become not a source of creation, but a source of destruction of the spiritual and moral foundations of the State and man. In the modern world the role and responsibility of true philosophers is incredibly increasing due to the emergence of a global civilization facing the face of a third world war. In this context, let's recall that the main function of philosophy - that Plato told about - is the development of the worldview which values may affect the adoption of practical solutions to improve the world and make it safer.

TI  - Adaptive Wavelet Filter With Edge Compensation for Remote Sensing Image Denoising
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) is one of the main payloads of the second-generation geostationary orbit meteorological satellite, FengYun-4A. Typically, the existence of variable stripe noise in the water vapor band remote sensing images of the AGRI greatly affects many applications, such as cloud detection, especially as one full disk image is separated into ten sub-images for transforming as soon as possible, so the denoising algorithm, which can reduce variable stripe noise and is adaptive to process using sub-images, must be built. In this paper, we propose an adaptive wavelet filter for image denoising. This approach introduces a new parameter termed weight sum variance of digital number probability (WSVODP), which is used to indicate the appropriate wavelet filter coefficients. WSVODP is only sensitive to the difference of observation targets of different sensors. Thus, our approach can learn appropriate wavelet filter coefficients fast and exactly. We built a real-world remote sensing image dataset from AGRI on FengYun-4A, and the experimental results on this dataset show that the proposed approach could effectively reduce the variable stripe noise from different observation targets. At the same time, an edge compensation method, which is fitted to the scanning model of the AGRI, is suggested to avoid ringing artifacts. Many applications, such as cloud detection with denoised images, show very good results. The proposed approach reduces the stripe noise adaptation, so the result is very steady even if the stripe noise varies with different targets, and edge compensation ensures that there are no obvious ringing artifacts in the full disk image joined by the ten sub-images.

TI  - Histopathologic Evaluation of Neck Dissections
T2  - NECK DISSECTION
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The purpose of histopathologic evaluation of neck dissections is to identify metastatic disease to locoregional lymph nodes. The standard protocol for processing neck dissections is effective for the evaluation of macrometastases and works well for clinically positive necks, but clinically negative necks (cN0) present a clinicopathologic dilemma. While many clinically negative necks harbor occult macroscopic and microscopic disease, intensive histopathologic evaluation of neck dissections to identify microscopic disease is neither economically nor technically feasible. Sentinel node biopsy is a sensitive strategy for identifying cN0 patients who require neck dissection and also provides a potential target for more intensive histologic evaluation. Despite relatively low sensitivities, intraoperative evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes is beneficial because it has high specificity and can facilitate neck dissection in roughly half of patients who require one. Although micrometastases and even isolated tumor cells are clinically important, there is no consensus standard protocol for intensive evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes in the head and neck literature. We propose a protocol for the evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes of the head and neck based on the current evidence. Thyroid cancer is discussed separately as it does not require comparable aggressive surgical management of microscopic nodal disease. The pathologic evaluation and workup of nodalmetastases of unknown primary is also discussed.

AB  - Acute diarrhea is an important public health issue. Here, we focused on the differences of enteropathogens in acute diarrhea between urban and rural areas in southeast China. Laboratory-and sentinel-based surveillance of acute diarrhea (>= 3 loose or liquid stools/24 hours) was conducted at 16 hospitals. Fecal specimens were tested for bacterial (Aeromonas sp., Campylobacter sp., diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, Plesiomonas shigelloides, non-typhoidal Salmonella, Shigella sp., Vibrio sp., and Yersinia sp.) and viral (adenovirus, astrovirus, Norovirus, Rotavirus, and Sapovirus) pathogens. Descriptive statistics were used. Between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, 4,548 outpatients with acute diarrhea were enrolled (urban, n = 3,220; rural, n = 1,328). Pathogens were identified in 2,074 (45.6%) patients. Norovirus (25.7%), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (10.2%), enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) (8.8%), group A Rotavirus (7.0%), and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) (5.6%) were the most common pathogens. Enteropathogens were less common in urban than in rural areas (42.0% versus 54.4%, P < 0.001). In urban areas, EAEC and ETEC were more common in high-income than in middle-income regions. Interventions targeting the most common enteropathogens can substantially reduce the burden of acute diarrhea in southeast China.

TI  - A Semisupervised Deep Learning Framework For Tropical Cyclone Intensity Estimation

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)
CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Tropical cyclone intensity estimation is important to catastrophic weather forecast. In this paper, it is treated as a classification task, with the, intensity categories as class labels. Normally, traditional supervised methods require a large amount of prior knowledge for training. However, in reality, only a small amount of labeled samples can be available. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel semisupervised deep learning framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for FY-4 multispectral images (MSI). The new model only needs a small set of samples labeled a priori to accurately classify the images and estimate cyclone intensity. Moreover, the model involves an iterative training set update process with a hybrid similarity measurement especially designed for the task. The experiments show that the classification performance of the network:is improved during the iterations. Evaluation on the estimated intensity categories indicate that the proposed method is significantly better than several existing methods, including the state-of-the-art cyclone intensity estimation model based on CNN, while small training sets are used.

TI  - Sparkpr: An Efficient Parallel Inversion of Forest Canopy Closure
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy closure is an important parameter to study forest ecosystem and understand the status of forest resources. With the development of remote sensing big data, the amount of remote sensing data has increased sharply, which makes the existing serial processing of remote sensing data face severe challenges.In order to satisfy the requirements of efficient remote sensing data processing, Spark open source framework is applied to the parallel processing of remote sensing images, and a parallel forest canopy density inversion algorithm based on Spark is proposed. We call this algorithm Sparkpr. Based on the GF-1 remote sensing images and 80 actual measured sample points obtained by Maoershan Laoshan Experimental Forest Farm of Northeast Forestry University in 2016. In this paper, a multi-element linear regression algorithm is used to carry out parallel inversion of the forest canopy density in the Laoshan Experimental Forest Farm of the Maoershan. The comparison experiment between single machine mode and spark standalone and spark on yarn mode is carried out. The experimental results show that the serial and parallel inversion results of forest depression density based on the model are consistent, and the parallel inversion results are accurate and credible. With the increase of computing nodes, the efficiency of parallel inversion is also improving.

AB  - In recent years, using satellite remote sensing data to detect nightlight of fishing vessels has become an important way for understanding the dynamics of fisheries resources and providing information for international fisheries management. In our study, we used the daily Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) day/night band (DNB) low-light remote sensing image in 2016 to detect nighttime lights in the Yellow Sea. Multiple threshold identification methods were developed to process DNB image in individual spot groups and mass-shaped spot groups, which could accurately identify lighting points in the two backgrounds. The results shown that 121,673 lighting points were identified for fishing vessels, the number of nightlights in each month could reflect seasonal changes very well. The spatial distribution hotspot map was generated with all nightlight points in 2016, which can provide a reference for understanding fishing activities in Yellow Sea.

M3  - Article
AB  - Wildlife resources are an important part of China's natural resources. China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and is in the leading position in wildlife resources in the world. Despite our vast territory, there are still many shortcomings in wildlife resources management, and there is still a big gap compared with European and American countries. Wildlife resources are an important part of China's natural resources. Due to the rapid development of China's economy and the sustained growth of population, wildlife populations and habitats continue to be destroyed, leading to the extinction of some species. Conservation of these endangered rare wildlife is one of the main contents of biodiversity conservation in China As the scope of human social activities continues to expand, the quality of wildlife habitats and the safety of ecosystems are seriously threatened, and the number of rare and endangered species is greatly reduced or even extinct. In this paper, remote sensing technology is used to monitor the experimental area remotely and obtain the real-time environmental changes in the experimental area. Moreover, based on the domestic GF-1 remote sensing satellite images from 2010 to 2018, the habitat elements (ecosystem structure, water resources, human activities and roads) were extracted. To provide data for adaptive habitat change of wildlife. OIF method is used to obtain the best data factors of remote sensing data. Finally, the suitability of wildlife habitat in the experimental area is evaluated by combining remote sensing data with evaluation model, and its dynamic changes are analyzed. The experimental analysis shows that the adaptive habitat area in this area has been decreasing, and the ecological environment has become increasingly unbalanced. This study provides guidance for the conservation of biodiversity in nature reserves and the maintenance of ecosystem balance.

AB  - The inter-calibration of the brightness temperature between FY-3B/MWRI and Aqua/AMSR-E is studied by 8858 files of MWRI L1 and 9327 files of AMSR-E L2A from November 18, 2010 to September 30, 2011 with the spatial coverage on north of 60 degrees N. According to the polar projection, time-space matching and linear fitting, the intercalibration parameters of the MWRI and AMSR-E are achieved. From the scatters of each channel and the statistic analysis, it shows that there are some deviation between the two sensors but it has obvious consistency on overall trend and the correlation coefficients of the TB in H and V polarization among all channel are more than 0.9. Using the linear regression analysis, the slopes and intercepts of the fitting equations for 10.7 similar to 89.0GHz H/V ascending and descending TB data on every month of the data sets were achieved. After inter-calibration the statistic parameters between the two sensors are obviously optimized.

AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE), the ratio of gross primary production (GPP) over evapotranspiration (ET), is a critical index for understanding and predicting terrestrial ecosystem carbon-water interactions and their responses to climate change. However, the spatiotemporal variation in WUE and its controlling mechanism are poorly understood till now at regional/global scales, due to either limited data availability or uncertainties in current data streams. For overcoming such limitations, a remote sensing (RS)-based two-leaf Jarvis-type canopy conductance (RST-G(c)) model was incorporated into a revised distributed hydrological model ESSI (version 3) to simulate ET. The hydrological model was validated against ET estimates from eddy covariance (EC) data and streamflow observations. A well validated global GPP dataset from Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) was then incorporated to estimate WUE for the period 2000-2016 over Northeast China. Variations of the simulated ET, GPP and WUE were quantified and their responses to potential drivers (e.g., precipitation, temperature, net radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and lead area index) were analyzed at different timescales (monthly and inter-annual) across various ecosystems.

AB  - This study tested and compared the suitability of SPOT-5 image and LiDAR data both separately and combined for the classification of the urban area using Rotation Forest (ROF) classifier. Experimental results revealed that the integration of the SPOT-5 image and LiDAR data classification scheme gave better classification accuracies, when compared to the classification schedules using one of the two solely. Furthermore, RoF classifier produced better classification results than that of other two classifiers (i.e., SVMs (Support Vector Machines) and RF (Random Forests)). Finally, it should be noted that RoF classifier provided an effective way of combining SPOT-5 image and LiDAR data for classification, which is robust to the important parameter M (i.e. the number of features in each subset).

AB  - As the influence of global warming, it is important to assess the freezing and thawing conditions of the ground surface to fully understand the impacts of frozen ground on the surface and subsurface hydrology, the surface energy and moisture balance, ecosystem conservation, and engineering constructions on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (QTP). However, assessing the changes of ground surface freezing and thawing conditions on the QTP still remains a challenge owing to the sparseness and discontinuity of remote sensing and ground observations. The ground surface thawing index can be used to predict changes of the thermal regime of permafrost and can be good indicators of climate change in the QTP, which is of great importance for a variety of engineering applications. In this study, we firstly used the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) algorithm to fill in the Land Surface Temperatures (LST) data gaps of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observation data caused by the cloud contamination. Then we used the MODIS LST data to estimate the daily ground surface temperatures (GST) by a multiple linear regression model on the QTP. Finally, we calibrated the model by the ground temperature observations at a selection of meteorological stations. The precisely estimation of the multi-years thawing index within 2003-2012 is calculated to monitor the ground surface freezing and thawing conditions change on QTP.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - Vegetation monitoring is important for the study of the global carbon cycle and ecosystem. Aquarius/SAC-D mission that launched in 2011 is the first satellite with both active and passive L-band microwave instrumentation. The Aquarius instrument consists of three dual polarized L-band (1.413 GHz) radiometers each with its own feedhorn and a fully polarimetric L-band (1.26 GHz) scatterometer that makes use of the radiometer feedhorns. In this study, the impact of soil moisture and vegetation on L-band backscatter and emission is studied using Aquarius scatterometer/radiometer measurements. Considering that the passive microwave data are more sensitive to changes in surface water and active microwave data are more sensitive to vegetation cover and roughness, we attempt to use radar vegetation index (RVI) for monitoring global vegetation. The relationship between RVI and VWC is explored at regional and global and continental scales based on Aquarius observations. The VWC data are derived using satellite estimates from MODIS/NDVI. It is found a good statistical relationship between RVI and VWC, especially for agricultural areas. Although statistical relationship and seasonal variability is captured, the dynamic range of the RVI is insufficient for a meaningful signal-to-noise. Further vegetation optical depth (VOD) is estimated using the t-. model by reconstructing the microwave vegetation indices (MVIs) and Microwave Polarization Difference Index (MPDI) derived from Aquarius radiometer data. The results indicate that the VOD can generally reveal vegetation seasonal changes and can provide unique information for vegetation monitoring. The uniqueness of this approach is that the RVI and VOD are retrieved directly from the backscatter and brightness temperature without any field correction or auxiliary vegetation data. This method can provide a new opportunity for long-term global vegetation monitoring for Aquarius or SMAP mission.

TI  - Reconstruct missing pixels of Landsat land surface temperature product using a CNN with partial convolution
T2  - APPLICATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Applications of Machine Learning
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - U.S. Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) recently included the Land Surface Temperature (LST) product, which contains widespread and irregularly-shaped missing pixels due to cloud contamination or incomplete satellite coverage. Many analyses rely on complete LST images therefore techniques that accurately fill data gaps are needed. Here, the development of a partial-convolution based model with the U-Net like architecture to reconstruct the missing pixels in the ARD LST images is discussed. The original partial convolution layer is modified to consider both the convolution kernel weights and the number of valid pixels in the calculation of the mask correction ratio. In addition, the new partial merge layer is developed to merge feature maps according to their masks. Pixel reconstruction using this model was conducted using Landsat 8 ARD LST images in Colorado between 2014 and 2018. Complete LST patches (64x64) for two identical scenes acquired at different dates (up to 48 days apart) were randomly paired with ARD cloud masks to generate the model inputs. The model was trained for 10 epochs and the validation results show that the average RMSE values for a restored LST image in the unmasked, masked, and whole region are 0.29K, 1.00K, and 0.62K, respectively. In general, the model is capable of capturing the high-level semantics from the inputs and bridging the difference in acquisition dates for gap filling. The transition between the masked and unmasked regions (including the edge area of the image) in restored images is smooth and reflects realistic features (e.g., LST gradients). For large masked areas, the reference provides semantics at both low and high levels.

AB  - Soil erosion is the main cause of the decline in global available land resources, and China is one of the countries suffering from severe soil erosion. In this paper, the RUSLE model and GIS were used to assess the changes in soil erosion in different ecosystems and counties. The results showed that from 2005 to 2017, the highest rate of ecosystem change was in the other ecosystems category, with an increase in mean soil loss to 4.06 t.ha(-1).year(-1). For the counties, the highest soil erosion was recorded in Maoxian County during the study period, because Maoxian County was one of the severely affected counties in the Wenchuan Earthquake. The mean soil loss in Yingjing was relatively small, as the estimates for 2005 and 2017 were 0.08 t.ha(-1).year(-1) and 0.09 t.ha(-1).year(-1), respectively. The areas with severe soil loss are along rivers, mainly distributed along the Minjiang and Tuojiang River basins and their tributaries. The findings of our study will be helpful for identifying high-risk zones, and developing policies to minimize human, environmental and economic losses in any disastrous event.

AB  - The rapid and accurate detection has been one of the major issues in detecting landslide from massive aerospace remote sensing data. In this paper, we propose a fusion detection model based on back-propagation neural networks to achieve accurate and efficient feature detection on landslide. In specific, we construct a fundamental shape model and apply a scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm for feature matching and transformation. By fusing spatial shape features and spectral features, the landslide targets can be further identified and located with high accuracy. We conduct several experimental studies based on aerospace remote sensing data from two real-world scenarios. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline algorithms and achieves up to 95.52% accuracy in landslide detection.

AB  - Agricultural production capacity in Farming pastoral Ecotone of Northern China (FPENC) has been limited to long-standing water shortage and drought. In this context, the center pivot irrigation (CPI) exhibited a widespread adoption in recent years to increase utilization efficiency of agricultural water and crop yield. However, the high rate of groundwater extraction by CPI, reducing the aquifer saturated thickness, has large potential impacts on aboveground vegetation growth. And, we lack the knowledge of the temporal and spatial variations of CPI in FPENC. In this paper, taking Ulanqab as an example, we measured spatio-temporal patterns of CPI from 2008 to 2017 using Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI data and spatial autocorrelation methods. The results indicated that the number of CPI increased first and then decreased, reaching a peak of 1243 in 2015. There was a positive spatial autocorrelation in the spatial distribution of CPI, that is, it had a very obvious spatial clustering characteristics. The degree of spatial agglomeration increased from 0.283 in 2008 to 0.526 in 2017. The results of local spatial autocorrelation showed that the spatial agglomeration pattern of Ulanqab was dominated by High-High agglomeration. These obtained results can provide a strong basis for decision-making in formulating sustainable agricultural development strategies.

TI  - High Spatial Resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> Retrieval Using MODIS and Ground Observation Station Data Based on Ensemble Random Forest
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited by the number of ground observation stations, PM2.5 retrieval from the remote sensing data is an effective complement to conventional ground observations and is a current research hotspot. The general principle behind the remote sensing retrieval of PM2.5 is to first retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and calculate the PM2.5 via the AOD-based statistical relationships. This method is likely to cause error propagation, which leads to instability in the retrieval model. In this paper, we propose a PM2.5 remote sensing retrieval method via an ensemble random forest machine learning method to directly establish the relationship between the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and ground observational PM2.5 to avoid retrieval errors from the atmospheric aerosol optical depths and obtain PM2.5 retrieval results with higher precision and spatial resolution. The proposed method first uses a random forest to train and validate the MODIS images and ground observation station PM2.5 data; then, an optimal multi-model group, according to the determination coefficient R-square (R-2) index, is selected. Finally, the optimal multi-model group is used on the whole MODIS image to obtain the PM2.5 retrieval result for the whole area. In an attempt to use machine learning technology to retrieve PM2.5, the experiments selected a substantial amount of MODIS image data during four seasons in Guangdong Province for validation and compared three performance indicators (R-2, RMSE, and correlation coefficient (CC) to verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - For delta area once groundwater is over-exploited, it may trigger a series of geological disasters, especially ground subsidence, which made the city along coastal regions have an increased risk of sea-level rise. During recent years at Yangtze Delta ground subsidence has got been controlled primarily via re-pumping of seawater into land region, but the subsidence is still continuous. TCPInSAR(Temporarily Coherent Point Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry) technique as an improvement of PSInSAR can generate the settlement time series with high accuracy. We adopted this technique to process ENVISAT ASAR images spanning from 2007 to 2009 and TerraSAR-X images spanning from 2009 to 2010 to obtain the land surface subsidence in Shanghai. And then we compared the settlement of this area with the groundwater level measured by the in-situ wells, and found the two are in good agreement. Finally, we estimated the storage coefficients of the aquifer. This study showed that InSAR technique is very useful to monitor and model groundwater efficiently.

AB  - The NOAA satellites HRPT data in the Northwest Pacific have been acquired by SeaSpace ground station located at Ocean University of China since October 2000. The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) have been retrieved from AVHRR onboard NOAA polar orbiting satellites using the TeraScan Desktop System. The SST data are validated with in situ buoy data from iQuam in the region 10 degrees N-50 degrees N, 105 degrees E-145 degrees E during the period of October 2000 to December 2017. The collocations of AVHRR and in situ buoy SST are generated with the spatial window of 0.01 degrees and the temporal window of 0.5 h. The daytime and nighttime biases and standard deviations of the overall matchups for each satellite are -0.55 +/- 1.00 degrees C and -0.35 +/- 0.94 degrees C (NOAA-12 minus buoy), -0.21 +/- 0.69 degrees C and -0.68 +/- 0.91 degrees C (NOAA-14 minus buoy), -0.17 +/- 0.76 degrees C and -0.40 +/- 0.88 degrees C (NOAA-15 minus buoy), -0.27 +/- 0.62 degrees C and -0.58 +/- 0.77 degrees C (NOAA-16 minus buoy), -0.08 +/- 0.63 degrees C and -0.37 +/- 0.75 degrees C (NOAA-17 minus buoy), -0.29 +/- 0.66 degrees C and 0.52 +/- 0.77 degrees C (NOAA-18 minus buoy), -0.21 +/- 0.68 degrees C and -0.50 +/- 0.78 degrees C (NOAA-19 minus buoy). The yearly statistics of the SST differences are investigated. The results indicate that the accuracy of the SST data is not consistent for each satellite during the different period. It is suggested that the HRPT data need be reprocessed.

The four-dimensional spectral bands of the image, the first principal component and NVDI are used as the spectral features of the image, and four measures of GLCM are used as the texture features of the image. And then the Sargassum is extracted using SVM by constructing spectral-texture eigenvectors. The experiment achieves superior results compared with the conventional NDVI threshold method.

AB  - Bare land can be used as an indicator of urbanization. It can be accurate, fast, and low-cost to acquire the distribution and temporal-spatial variations of bare land with remote sensing technology. Over the last 30 years, the rapid urbanization processes of Beijing may have introduced bare land in urban areas. In this study, we take advantage of high-spatial resolution Landsat archive with long-term record to extract the bare land areas in Beijing. Then the temporal-spatial evolution of bare land area in winter and summer for 16 districts and 4 functional zones of Beijing are analyzed. We find that the bare land area in Beijing was reduced by about 600 km(2) between 1987 and 2016. Changes in bare land are caused by the urban development process. Bare land is mainly distributed in new urban development zone and ecological conservation zone. Finally, we proposed some suggestions for controlling the bare land in winter, which would help to mitigate environmental hazard such as dust emission and soil loss caused by exposed bare land.

AB  - Atmospheric pollutant PM2.5 does serious harm to human health. It is one of important tasks in our country to reduce the pollution and protect people's lives. For this purpose, accurate prediction of the pollution conditions is needed, and a model based on BP Neural Network Algorithm is proposed in this paper. By using the data of PM2.5 and meteorological parameters observed in Fuling, a mountainous suburban region in Chongqing, China from Jan.1, 2016 to Sep.1, 2017, the effects of temperature, humidity and wind speed on PM2.5 were first analyzed by the principal component analysis. Then a prediction model based on the BP neural network algorithm was built by using satellite remote sensing data, and the concentrations of the pollutants were explored by the model. The experimental results show that the standard deviation between the prediction results and average variance of the observed data is only 0.1218. Finally, the relationship between the number of hidden neurons and the absolute error is discussed. The prediction results show that the performance of BP neural network is better than that of regression model.

AB  - Drought is a major hazard that affects many different fields around the world. Among the various adverse effects of drought, its influence on agriculture is most direct and significant. The mapping and monitoring of drought have received serious attention from not only the policymakers, but also the scientific community. Over the recent years, a variety of drought monitoring models derived from remote sensing data were developed based on the change characteristics of vegetation and soil caused by drought. Perpendicular drought index (PDI), which was developed on the basis of spatial characteristics of moisture distribution in near red reflectance space, could generally reflect drought condition and was widely used. Texas State in America is usually affected by drought. This paper evaluated the drought occurred in the west of Texas, America in 2017 using PDI calculated with Sentinel 2 data. The precipitation data was collected from the national centers for environmental information website and international soil moisture network. The precipitation anomaly index was used to determine the accuracy of PDI. The result showed that, PDI had strong correlation with the precipitation anomaly index, with the correlation coefficient of -0.66.

AB  - Drought is one of the most complex natural hazards that can produce devastating impacts on many aspects, especially on agricultural production. Insufficient site observation data for drought monitoring makes remote sensing technique a key issue for global and regional drought assessment with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Some agricultural drought indexes have been developed during the last decade. Perpendicular drought index (PDI) and modified perpendicular drought index (MPDI) have received considerable attention because of their simplicity and efficacy. In this paper, PDI and MPDI were calculated using MODIS data and applied to assess the 2018 spring drought under dense vegetation cover condition in the south of Hebei Province. The validation was carried out using in situ relative soil water content from 0 to 10 cm and the consistency between perpendicular drought indexes, including PDF and MPDI, and in situ soil water content was analyzed. Result shows a good agreement between the drought information extracted by PDI and MPDI and the field measurement of soil water content, with the correlation coefficients of -0.62 and -0.74.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential climate variable that can be used to assess climate change. One kind of method commonly used to estimate SST based on remote-sensing measurements is the split-window (SW) algorithm. However, the derivation of the linear SW algorithm does not appear to reflect reality because some assumptions and approximations were used. Moreover, the quadratic SW equation cannot be interpreted theoretically although it maintains the structure of the linear SW equation. The Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite launch is planned for 2018. Focusing on exploring the mechanism of the SW algorithm using GF-5 data, this study investigated the assumptions and approximations used to derive the linear SW technique. Two revised equations of these assumptions and approximations were developed. Combining the revised equations, a nonlinear SW algorithm was obtained that could be simplified to the quadratic equation. Compared with previous research, this study focuses more on the theoretical interpretation and improves our understanding of the semi-empirical quadratic SW equation. The matchup data set produced by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility was used to validate the quadratic SW algorithm. A bias of -0.05K and a RMSE of 0.53K were obtained.

AB  - Tea is the most popular drink in China. The spatial distribution information of tea plantation is useful for local government management. Lantian Country, with an area of 99.77km2, located in the midwest of Anxi County, which is famous for Oolong Tea, was chosen as study area, and image from Chinese high resolution satellite Gaofen-2 acquired on Jan 22, 2015 was used to study the method of tea plantations extraction. In order to construct best features for classification, optimum index factor (OIF) were firstly calculated on different original spectral bands combinations and the one with max OIF was chosen. Secondly, spectral enhancement was carried on multi-spectral hands.Difference between two vegetation indexes, namely, normalized difference vegetation index and modified normalized difference vegetation index was calculated and named as DNDVI. In DNDVI image, the brightness difference between tea plantation and background was improved and shadowed area in either index image was reduced. Thirdly, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), Gabor filter, local binary patterns (LBP) extraction, and method combined LBP and Gabor was carried on pan image to construct texture features. Among eight common features based GLCM, contrast, dissimilarity, entropy, variance, tea plantation area was darker. In homogeneity and angular second moment, this phenomena is just the opposite. In mean and correlation, there was no obvious difference between target tea plantation and background. So the gray level co-occurrence texture (GLCT) subtract sum of second two features from sum of the first four feature was used as final GLCM feature, and window size for GLCM set to he 15 was preferred. Multi-scale and multidirectional Gabor texture with max frequency set to be 1HZ was derived. For LBP, the operator LBP16, 2 with rotation invariance was tested to be the best. Finally, five schemes combine these spectral and textural features as inputs of classifier were evaluated in term of classification accuracy. Six categories including tea plantation, forest, roads, water, buildup, bare soil, shadows were classified by support vector machine. The result showed that overall accuracy range from 75.55% to 89.11%, Kappa coefficient range from 0.613 to 0.843, for plantation, user accuracy range from 84.95% to 100%, producer accuracy range from 53.29% to 91.53%. Gaofen-2 show its capacity to map the tea plantation area accurately. Schemes utilized spectral and textural features together perform much better than that utilized spectral only. The scheme combination of hand1, band 3, ban4, DNDVI, LBP_Gabor outperformed other Scheme, with the highest overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. The textures feature of high resolution image helps to improve the accuracy, and the way to construct suitable texture feature and merge different texture feature deserved study more. The proposed method to extract tea plantation is applicable at administrative level of country.

TI  - Exploring Bamboo Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboo forests, due to rapid growth and short harvest rotation, play an important role in carbon cycling and local economic development. Accurate estimation of bamboo forest aboveground biomass (AGB) has garnered increasing attention during the past two decades. However, remote sensing-based AGB estimation for bamboo forests is challenging due to poor understanding of the mechanisms between bamboo forest growth characteristics and remote sensing data. The objective of this research is to examine the remote sensing characteristics of on-year and off-year bamboo forests at different dates and their AGB estimation performance. This research used multiple Sentinel-2 data to explore AGB estimation of bamboo forests in Zhejiang Province, China, by taking into account the unique characteristics of on-year and off-year bamboo forest growth features. Combining field survey data and Sentinel-2 spectral responses (spectral bands and vegetation indices) and textural images, random forest was used to identify key variables for AGB estimation. The results show that (1) the on-year and off-year bamboo forests have considerably different spectral signatures, especially in the wavelengths between red edge 2 and near-infrared wavelength (NIR2) (740-865 nm), making it possible to separate on-year and off-year bamboo forests; (2) on-year bamboo forests have similar spectral signatures although AGB increases from as small as 40 Mgha(-1) to as high as 90 Mgha(-1), implying that optical sensor data cannot effectively model on-year bamboo AGB; (3) off-year bamboo AGB has significant relationships with red and shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands in the April image and with red edge 2 in the July image, but the AGB saturation problem yields poor estimation accuracy; (4) stratification considerably improved off-year bamboo AGB estimation but not on-year, non-stratification using the April image is recommended; and (5) Sentinel-2 data cannot solve the bamboo AGB data saturation problem when AGB is greater than 70 Mgha(-1), similar to other optical sensor data such as Landsat. More research should be conducted in the future to integrate multiple sourcesremotely sensed data (e.g., lidar, optical sensor data) and ancillary data (e.g., soil, topography)into AGB modeling to improve the estimation. The use of very high spatial resolution images that can effectively extract tree density information may improve bamboo AGB estimation and yield new insights.

AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing technologies, high-resolution remote sensing data has been widely studied and applied in many fields, such as geography, agriculture, and earthquake detection. However, providing users with efficient remote sensing data distribution services is a huge challenge, which is due to the timeliness and the shorter update cycle of remote sensing data. In this paper, we propose HyPDS, a hybrid File Transfer Protocol-Peer to Peer (FTP-P2P) content distribution system for remote sensing data. A main problem in the design of a HyPDS content distribution system is therefore how to efficiently utilize the bandwidth of downloading peer nodes so as to maximize utilization rate of the downstream bandwidth of the resource requesting nodes of the system. Using the real-world measurements, we identify the key factor that affects the utilization rate of the downstream bandwidth of the resource requesting nodes and thus construct a fine-grained performance model (i.e., P2P-FTP) to address the optimal bandwidth allocation problem. We also have deployed HyPDS on the real-world system platform, which has more than 100 Terabytes (TB) of remote sensing data resources in the key Laboratory of Aerospace Information Applications. Experimental results showed that HyPDS has significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches in maximizing the bandwidth usage, with a maximum increase of 45%.

AB  - Marine science is an observational science and observational data is a prerequisite for understanding the ocean. Satellite remote sensing technology provides a new means for observing the important parameters of Sea Surface Temperature (SST). This work innovatively explores the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), a deep learning model, for the analysis and prediction of the SST in the specific research area of the Yellow Sea cold water mass. The research results show that LSTM can effectively analyze and predict SST. The accuracy of area-averaged SST prediction depends on the length of training observation time sequence. The increase in sequence length enhances prediction accuracy. Given training data of a dozen years, the accuracy of a 30-day length prediction can reach up to 95.87%, which meets the requirements of ocean forecasting. The study also revealed that specifying an observation length, the area-averaged prediction accuracy of a 30-day length prediction for different locations of the cold water mass make no difference.

AB  - This paper illustrates how BIM integration with GIS is approached as part of the workflow in creating Virtual Historic Dublin. A design for a WEB based interactive 3D model of historic buildings and centres in Dublin City (Virtual Historic Dublin City) paralleling smart city initiates is now under construction and led by the National Monuments at the Office of Public Works in Ireland. The aim is to facilitate the conservation and maintenance of historic infrastructure and fabric and the dissemination of knowledge for education and cultural tourism using an extensive Historic Building Information Model. Remote sensing data is now processed with greater ease to create 3D intelligent models in Historic BIM. While the use of remote sensing, HBIM and game engine platforms are the main applications used at present, 3D GIS has potential to form part of the workflow for developing the Virtual Historic City. 2D GIS is now being replaced by 3D spatial data allowing more complex analysis to be carried out, 3D GIS can define and depict buildings, urban rural centres in relation to their geometry topological, semantic and visualisation properties. The addition of semantic attributes allows complex analysis and 3D spatial queries for modelling city and urban elements. This analysis includes fabric and structural elements of buildings, relief, vegetation, transportation, water bodies, city furniture and land use.

AB  - The growing Earth Observation (EO) satellite data requires an open and freely accessible exploitation tool to facilitate the development and sustainability of applications on land use and land cover change, water resources, forest monitoring, and etc. Open Data Cube (ODC) was initiated by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) to provide a solution with new computing technologies. ODC can promote free and open EO satellite data and application algorithms, and lower the technical barriers for users on exploiting the data. This project aims to develop the ODC protocol in Taiwan and apply it on a case study forest monitoring after the attack of typhoon Morako in Taimali river basin, the eastern of Taiwan. Firstly, the strategic implementation, the platform, and the infrastructure of Taiwan Data Cube (TWDC) are initiated. And, the TWDC is applied on forest monitoring between 2000 and 2016 using Landsat-7 images. Finally, the improvement and perspective of TWDC protocol are discussed. In the future, ( 1) the Formosat series images will be prepared as Analysis Ready Data (ARD), (2) the software environment will be improved on data management and user interactive interface, and (3) the protocol of TWDC will be duplicated to developing countries on international cooperation projects under the collaboration with CEOS and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

TI  - Missing Data Reconstruction for Remote Sensing Images With Weighted Low-Rank Tensor Model
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Missing data reconstruction for remote sensing images, such as dead-pixel recovery and cloud removal, is important for remote sensing data applications. Missing information reconstruction is well known as being an ill-posed inverse problem. In this paper, a weighted low-rank tensor regularization model is proposed to handle the problem. The proposed model fully utilizes the correlations in the spatial, spectral, and temporal components of the remote sensing images to adaptively deal with the varied missing data problems, including the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) band 6 dead line problem, the Landsat scan-line corrector failure (SLC-off) problem, and cloud contamination. A double-weighted treatment is developed to balance the contributions from the different dimensions and preserve the different structures and textures in remote sensing images. The experiments undertaken confirmed the good performance of the proposed method, and the reconstruction results of the proposed method, in both visual effect and quantitative evaluation, were superior to those of the other methods.

TI  - Hermeneutical Principles to Buddhist Mission by Karl Ludvig Reichelt
T2  - Korea Presbyterian Journal of Theology
T2  - 장신논단
M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper explores a hermeneutical possibility of whether the gospel of Jesus can be properly represented within the framework assumed by the Buddhist worldview, framework that does not require the religious other to assume a Western worldview. Karl Ludvig Reichelt (1877-1952), a Norwegian Lutheran missionary to China, established a Christian monastery Tao Fong Shan ( 道風山 ) in Hong Kong which was radically based on his Johannine hermeneutic, including architecture, outward and inward design, and daily life. It was modelled after Buddhist monasteries to make sense to Buddhists in appearance, worship ceremony, and terminology. His Johannine Approach gave special emphasis to the “Light” and “Logos” for developing Christ’s fulfillment through hidden disposition of teachings in Chinese religions, which was the key to elicit “all-embracing activity of Jesus Christ,” implicitly related to Jesus’ seven “I AM” sayings (ego eimi). Reichelt seriously considered not only the foundational depth of Buddhism as more than superficial and doctrinaire, but also how greater portions of Buddhist culture can be retained and the gospel of Jesus communicated in light of the Buddhist framework. He had a new attitude of courtesy and respect, accommodating to non-Christian religions, arguing that Christianity as the ultimate truth does not intend to destroy anything good or true of native faiths but instead to strengthen and fulfill them as preparation.

TI  - Hermeneutics of Dialogue and Reconciliation: Understanding Jesus' Gospel, Relevant to Asian Religious Contexts
T2  - Korean Evangelical New Testament Sudies
T2  - 신약연구
M3  - research-article
AB  - Biblical hermeneutics has traditionally dealt with interpreting dialogues between the text, the reader and the circumstances (i.e., world reality), so that it is a relevant window for intrusion into a human culture, showing where God’s mission may already be at work in individuals and groups. In point of fact, we do not know what scripture says until we know how it relates to our world. In this work, I have specifically explored some hermeneutical questions on what shall we do with the existing Asian cultural and religious practices? To what extend can we use the people’s words for God when these are deeply tied to their existing religious beliefs. Christians no longer must neglect rich spiritual and cultural assets of other religions. Hermeneutics of dialogue and reconciliation precipitates us to learn of truths found in other religions which shows our own need to grow and be fertilized in understanding. For an appropriate gospel communication, Christian hermeneutics should deduce adequate strategies of courtesy and respect for the Asian recipients who have long committed to and are deeply embedded in their religious culture. Such approaches acknowledge that God allowed inherent bridges for the gospel to be resident within them. Luke’s gospel is best adapted to God-fearers. At the time of writing, many predominant Jewish traditions were being almost completely eliminated. Most of the Jewish Palestinian tradition was redactionally modified to the changing situation. Developing a hermeneutics of dialogue and reconciliation in the Asian religious context while interpreting the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus as a test case, the writer argues that Asian karmic worldview would more efficiently work for them to recognize the meaning and  weight of the switched afterlife and judgment over the Rich Man in the parable world. For the Asian karmic readers, punishment of the Rich Man is envisaged more obvious, not least because his self-indulgence in pleasure that caused him to be in pain is brought by his ignorance and obsession, according to the Buddhists’ Four Noble Truths. Another aspect that the Asian readers would understand better the Rich Man’s ignorance and failure is their long-traditional knowledge of teachings on the “Not-Two,” teaching that all existence in the universe is always inseparably connected. The Rich Man never recognized Lazarus as a “Not-two” and likewise that he did not see himself to be co-reliant on others. Asian communities had never experienced a unique period of Christendom as the Western churches, so that Christianity in Asia naturally demands to be translated from one cultural context to another. Jesus’ Gospel should be expressed and interpreted in indigenous forms and concepts for a genuine Gospel communication. This process will direct and correct the wider global church.

M3  - Article
AB  - Integration of Remote Sensing (RS) and the Geographical Information System (GIS) approaches in the field of groundwater resources management is a breakthrough. The RS and GIS geospatial approaches can enhance the assessment, monitoring, and conservation of groundwater resources. In this study, RS and GIS geospatial techniques were applied with the aim of identifying groundwater potential zones in Embu County, Kenya, based on selected multi influencing factors. Lineament layer was obtained by processing Landsat 8 ETM+ image using Principal Component Analysis in ENVI (R) 4.7 and automatic extraction from Principal Component Image using the LINE module in Geomatica software. The resultant groundwater potential map showed that approximately 78% of the total area ranged from 'high' to 'very high' zones indicating that almost half of the study area has good groundwater potential. About 20% showed moderate potential while only 2% fell under the low potential zone. The proposed study approach can be used as a new way of modeling geospatial data for identification and mapping of groundwater potential zones. The study findings are useful to first-hand information planners and local authorities for assessment, planning, management and administration of groundwater resources in Embu County.

TI  - Socio-Psychological Factors that Contribute to and Impede the Process of Student Eco-Vocational Consciousness Formation
T2  - EKOLOJI
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the issue under study is caused by the need to form a new socio-psychological paradigm in the field of environmental education. It was clearly shown by the beginning of the new millennium, that the current environmental education is based on analytical knowledge of nature, which is pragmatically narrow and consumer-oriented, and therefore it could not fundamentally change the worldview of a significant part of the population. As a result, there is an objective need for a transition to a qualitatively new stage in its development. The purpose of the article is to determine the socio-psychological factors that contribute to and hinder the formation of eco-vocational consciousness of students. The study methods: The leading method for studying this issue is modeling, which allows considering the socio-psychological factors that contribute to and hinder the purposeful formation of eco-vocational consciousness structural components. The article identifies the main factors contributing to the process of eco-vocational consciousness formation: the need for a value orientation for the co-evolution of man and the biosphere; the ability of the individual of perceiving, experiencing and comprehension the relationship between the current environmental situation and occupational activities; the willingness of specialists to consciously implement environmentally reasonable occupational activities; public interest in the knowledge, transformation and maintenance of the environment in optimal condition and other significant factors. The factors that prevent the formation of eco-vocational consciousness are identified: the absence of a state customer for an ecologically-oriented vocational education; weak linkage of environmental training with vocational training; poor scientific and methodical provision of environmental orientation in vocational training, theoretical and methodical foundations for organizing the integration of environmental and vocational training; the need to coordinate and manage the system of electronic training, the creation of didactic complexes, appropriate methods. The data obtained in the work can be used in education to build effective educational programs for the development of eco-vocational consciousness; in practical psychology, in ecological psychology, as well as for further theoretical development of this issue.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Russian system of National (State) Forest Inventory (NFI) valid from 2007 is methodologically imperfect and serves as a target of criticism and discussion. Insufficient attention paid to remote sensing should be attributed to the system's weaknesses. A possible way of improving the NFI system is the use of automatic classification of forests' characteristics based on materials of Earth remote sensing. One of the advanced automatic methods for forest remote sensing materials classification is k-NN or k-nearest neighbors algorithm, which have been successively used in the NFIs in other countries. It is based on regression between the spectral response characteristics of pixels with known forest characteristics and remaining pixels of the image. Questions of practical application of this method for the purposes of NFI were first raised and studied by Finnish researchers in the 1990s. Over the past two decades, a considerable amount of research in this area has been carried out in different countries. The purpose of our research is to assess the feasibility of using the k-NN method for determining the generalized characteristics of forests on the example of the Lodeynopol'skoe forest district in Leningrad region. The forest district area is 401,866 ha. It consists of 16 forest sub-districts. A regular network was created at a pitch of 1 x 1 km in order to form a set of trial plots for the classification by the means of GIS-technologies within the forest district. Round-shaped plots with a radius of 10 m or forest inventory compartments were used as trial plots located in the network nodes. Forest description for both types of plots was taken from the forest management data. Landsat-8 images were used for the classification (spectral channels . GREEN, RED, NIR, SWIR 2). The Landsat-8 images were automatically classified according to a number of forest inventory characteristics: average growing stock per 1 ha; middle class of bonitet; average relative density; share of coniferous and deciduous plantations area. The results of the k-NN classification were compared with the forest management materials. Systematic errors in the assessment of growing stocks, completeness and bonitet for the territory of Lodeynopol'skoe forest district made up less than 5 %. The obtained results confirm the potential of further study of conceptual and practical issues of the k-NN method application for determining forest characteristics. The development of this direction can contribute to the improvement of the Russian State Forest Inventory methodology.

AB  - In view of various impacts on biosphere and possible cross-regional environmental problems, dust attracts global concerns. We employed multiple spatial resolution satellite images to identify dust sources and the relevantly hydrological land covers. We used true-colour composite images of MODIS to obtain the preliminary information on dust emissions and then distinguished the land covers of dust sources in Landsat images of Xilingol Grassland. The study found that hydrologically associated land covers, such as ephemeral lakes, bajadas, ephemeral river beds, dry lakes and their margins, dominated dust emission areas. Factors responsible for aeolian dusts are from both natural and human aspects. Besides abnormal weather phenomena, factors contributed to dust emissions include ecological and water balance destructions caused by human activities in alkali and coal exploitations and water pumping from rivers or lakes for agriculture and industry. This study will help grassland manager combat land desertification and control dust emission in the future.

AB  - The evolution of the antarctic ice cap is a subject of the utmost importance for the climate science. For this reason exploiting the historic archive of SPOT 5 HRS binocular stereo imagery over the Antarctica has gained interest. However, estimating surface models of Antarctica from optical satellite imagery is a challenging task. Different factors contribute to its difficulty: the reduced contrast of the snow, the abrupt changes in elevation, and the persistent cloud cover that is often indistinguishable from the snowy ground, or is translucent, or projects shadows on the ground; all of them hinder stereo matching. For these reasons the direct application of existing satellite stereo pipelines on these images often yields unsatisfactory results. In this study we explore strategies to address these problems and improve 3D modeling on these regions. We adapt the S2P [1] pipeline and incorporate a new multiscale strategy that allows to deal with incorrect geometry estimation due to clouds or lack of texture. In addition, integrating existing very low resolution DSM (1 km per pixel) of the Antarctica allows to further filter the model to produce a cleaner 3D model.

AB  - Grasslands are globally important for their economic and environmental services, for these reasons their conservation and their mode of exploitation must be monitored. In this work we wanted to study the relationship between temporal interferometric coherence, radar backscattered coefficient and types of agricultural practices associated with grasslands such as grazing, mowing, and the mixed exploitation of these two practices. High coherence values due to backscattering from the ground were linked to ploughed bare fields and low vegetation height and the backscattering coefficient ro increases with the biomass up to a saturation level. Results revealed that grazing actions are easily detectable especially with the coherence values while mowing date cannot be clearly detected whether by coherence or by backscattered coefficient.

TI  - Spatio-temporal fusion of NDVI data for simulating soil water content in heterogeneous Mediterranean areas
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that the soil water content (SWC) of Mediterranean ecosystems can be simulated by combining ground data and remote sensing observations of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The application of this approach in heterogeneous and fragmented areas, however, requires the use of spatio-temporal fusion (STF) methods to properly account for the actual NDVI variability of the examined ecosystems. One of these methods, which was specifically developed to produce annual NDVI data series in Mediterranean regions, is currently applied to MODIS and TM/ETM+ images taken over a highly fragmented green urban area in Florence (Central Italy). The performances of this STF method, called SEVIS, are indirectly evaluated by comparing local SWC measurements to simulations driven by the original (MODIS) and fused (MODIS+TM/ETM+) NDVI datasets. The results obtained confirm the critical dependence of the applied SWC simulation strategy on the efficient accounting for the actual NDVI evolution of the observed ecosystem. In particular, the use of the fused NDVI dataset corrects almost completely for the strong SWC underestimation produced by the original MODIS images during the summer dry period, significantly improving all accuracy statistics (r(2) from 0.564 to 0.855, RMSE from 0.101 to 0.044 cm(3)cm(-3) and MBE from -0.046 to 0.000 cm(3)cm(-3)).

AB  - InSAR accuracy analysis of canopy height model (CHM) in comparison with in situ measurements is conducted. CHM was constructed as a difference between digital model of surface (TanDEM-X DSM) and elevation (ALOS PALSAR DEM). The systematic underestimation of the actual CHM was established: the discrepancy between the results of radar interferometry and field measurements reached 5.5 m at the values of stand fullness equaled to 0.5, 0.9 and 1, and varies in the range from 2m to 4 m at fullness spanned from 0.6 to 0.8. The conclusion is made about necessity of updating results of radar interferometry by means of appropriate corrections obtained for different values of the forest fullness. The results of remote optical-microwave measurements of forest parameters are available on the Internet.

AB  - In this work we present an automatic algorithm for providing probabilistic flood maps, not only on bare soils, but also within urban areas. The probabilistic flood mapping procedure is based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and the Bayesian inference. Both intensity data and Interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence feature are used. The approach improves the information content of a binary SAR-based floodwater map, which does not give any indication on the uncertainty in the pixel state.The proposed methodology is tested for the flood event that heavily affected the city of Houston (Texas) during the 2017 hurricane season. Data provided by the Sentinel-1 mission are used, with a geometric resolution of 20m. The algorithm takes fully advantage of the Sentinel-1 mission's repeat cycle of six days and narrow orbital tube to fully exploit the potentialities of InSAR coherence feature to detect floodwater in complex environments. The application of the proposed method to the Houston case study showed promising results.

TI  - Sentinel-1 InSAR Coherence to Detect Floodwater in Urban Areas: Houston and Hurricane Harvey as A Test Case
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an automatic algorithm for mapping floods. Its main characteristic is that it can detect not only inundated bare soils, but also floodwater in urban areas. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations of the flood that hit the city of Houston (Texas) following the landfall of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 are used to apply and validate the algorithm. The latter consists of a two-step approach that first uses the SAR data to identify buildings and then takes advantage of the Interferometric SAR coherence feature to detect the presence of floodwater in urbanized areas. The preliminary detection of buildings is a pre-requisite for focusing the analysis on the most risk-prone areas. Data provided by the Sentinel-1 mission acquired in both Strip Map and Interferometric Wide Swath modes were used, with a geometric resolution of 5 m and 20 m, respectively. Furthermore, the coherence-based algorithm takes full advantage of the Sentinel-1 mission's six-day repeat cycle, thereby providing an unprecedented possibility to develop an automatic, high-frequency algorithm for detecting floodwater in urban areas. The results for the Houston case study have been qualitatively evaluated through very-high-resolution optical images acquired almost simultaneously with SAR, crowdsourcing points derived by photointerpretation from Digital Globe and Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) inundation model over the area. For the first time the comparison with independent data shows that the proposed approach can map flooded urban areas with high accuracy using SAR data from the Sentinel-1 satellite mission.

TI  - A Multisensor Approach to Satellite Monitoring of Trends in Lake Area, Water Level, and Volume
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes in arid regions play an important role in regional water cycles and are a vital economic resource, but can fluctuate widely in area and volume. This study demonstrates the use of a multisensor satellite remote sensing method for the comprehensive monitoring of lake surface areas, water levels, and volume for the Toshka Lakes in southern Egypt, from lake formation in 1998 to mid-2017. Two spectral water indices were used to construct a daily time-series of surface area from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), validated by higher-resolution Landsat images. Water levels were obtained from analysis of digital elevation models from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), validated with ICESat Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) laser altimetry. Total lake volume peaked at 26.54 x 10(9) m(3) in December 2001, and declined to 0.76 x 10(9) m(3) by August 2017. Evaporation accounted for approximately 86% of the loss, and groundwater recharge accounted for 14%. Without additional inflows, the last remaining lake will likely disappear between 2020 and 2022. The Enhanced Lake Index, a water index equivalent to the Enhanced Vegetation Index, was found to have lower noise levels than the Normalized Difference Lake Index. The results show that multi-platform satellite remote sensing provides an efficient method for monitoring the hydrology of lakes.

M3  - Article
AB  - Conflicting and even hostile, stigmatizing attitudes of psychiatrists to suicidal patients is noted in many studies. Aim: This study aims to check the worldview differences in death and life attitudes in these two groups of people. Materials: the clinical sample comprised of 185 people in acute postsuicide (2-14 days, 64 males, 121 females, age 16-27,M=21.39 +/- 2.42) and 168 psychiatrists (49 males, 119 females, age 27-81,M=46.25 +/- 13.88). Materials: Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory, short version of Experience in Close Relationships - Revised, Hardiness Survey, short versions of Death Attitude Profile Revised and Fear of Personal Death Scale; Death Experience questionnaire. Results: Analysis of differences t-Student showed that psychiatrist and suicidal patients differed in most chosen characteristics (Cohen's d.21 -.77). They didn't differ though in the sum of Death Experiences, but doctors noted more interaction with deaths of unknown people (chi(2)(2,352)=37.57,p<.001), while suicidal patients noted personal death experiences (chi(2)(2,352)=8.837,p=0.012), experiences of suicidal attempts (chi(2)(2,352)=206.195,p<.001), thoughts of death (chi(2)(2,352)=38.73;.p<.001). The definition of the risk group as the dependent variable through the binary logistic regression yielded significant results (Cox-Snell R-2 = .41; Nagelkerke R-2 = .55; Hosmer-Lemeshow test chi(2)=12.40, p=.134): people in acute postsuicide reported more characteristic high values of "fear of consequences for family and friends", "attachment anxiety", "negative past", "hedonistic present" and "control" (Hardiness): low values of "neutral death acceptance", "attachment avoidance", "future". Hierarchical regression analysis showed that for doctors the most meaningful attitude toward death is "neutral acceptance" (R-2=.21, F(8,158)=4.991, p<.001), while for suicide attempters it is "escape acceptance (R-2=.309, F(8,184)=9.816, p<.001). In suicidal .attempters the variable "present hedonistic" contributed to 3 different death constructs: "fear of being forgotten" (b=.53, p=.037), "fear of transpersonal consequences" (b=.478, p=.041), and "neutral acceptance of death" (b=.433, p=.01). Conclusions: Psychiatrists and people in acute postsuicide have distinctive differences in following parameters: attachment style, time orientations, responsibility, death attitudes. These may provoke difficulties in communication and therapeutic rapport.

CP  - IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf)
CL  - Boston, MA
AB  - A new approach to ship detection, discrimination, and motion estimation is proposed and demonstrated using a combined polarimetry and GMTI technique from a spaceborne platform. Using a standard dual-pol SAR, the new method exploits a bright "shadow" in cross-pol imagery of a moving ship and its azimuth-shifted image to discriminate it from other stationary or quasi-stationary objects (e.g., icebergs) on the ocean surface and to estimate its motion parameters, such as radial speed and heading. The motion estimation results are compared to those obtained using the newly implemented Dual-Channel Polarimeric GMTI modes on RADARSAT-2. Unlike the ship wake approach, the proposed technique is applicable to and successfully demonstrated for both C-band and X-band radars (RADARSAT-2 and TerraSAR-X) and it is not dependent on the angle of incidence to achieve a good signal-to-clutter ratio and ship detectability. Physical mechanisms giving rise to ship "shadows" are also discussed.

AB  - By focusing on Jonathan Edwards’ Relational Ontology, this study examines his acceptance of scientific achievements during the Enlightenment age and it’s influence on his theology. As a pastor and theologian, in Reformed worldview which puts an emphasis on the sovereignty of God, Edwards pondered on how to interpret scientific discover and theories.This lead him to develop Relational Ontology opposing the mechanical worldview and deism in his times. Relational Ontology is a kind of metaphysics of Edwards that divine creations exist harmoniously and orderly in this world. He develops and applies the ontology to his theology including the doctrines of trinity, redemption, and heaven. Edwards opposes a dichotomous view of dividing the material and spiritual world, rather believing that divine providence can be proofed through the development of science. Upon misunderstanding of Edwards’ Relational Ontology, there are some scholars who claim his ontology is not consistent with that of Reformed theology. For example, John Cooper argues that Edwards’ Relational Ontology lacks the classical division of creation and creator in theism and views it closer to panentheism. However, the scholars make a mistake to analyze Edwards’ arguments through contemporary theological view.Upon examination, we discover Edwards’ example as a good theologian that sought to understand scientific achievements during the Enlightenment in the sight of Christianity that God is centered.

AB  - The remote sensing technology is effective method for soil moisture observation. However the main problem of the remote sensing data is coarse spatial resolution. [1] In that point, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is promising technology for soil moisture estimation because of its high resolution. The variation of the backscattering coefficient from the SAR data is mainly used in the algorithm for estimation of soil moisture on the surface (0-5cm). Then the research for estimation of soil moisture using SAR images has been conducted. But the study area of the research were mostly on the bare soil or sparsely vegetated area. It is difficult to estimate soil moisture on the forestry area with dense vegetation and rough surface. Then, Korea peninsula has mountainous topography over than 60%. Those mountain in Korea has quite dense vegetation on summer and fall season. Also it has a rough surface which has a steep slope. So for the soil moisture estimation on the Korea peninsula using SAR images, estimation on mountainous area should be procured the accuracy. That is why the objective of this study is establishment of the base for producing high resolution soil moisture data on Korea peninsula.

AB  - This paper examines the debate between Hainsworth and Rawson concerning the violence in the early poetry of Hughes and suggests how the debate alludes to the ecocritical possibility of Hughes’s early poetry. The paper also reads a few of Hughes’s early poems to show how they have some ecological aspects. The debates between Hainsworth and Rawson tend to interpret Hughes’s themes only in the framework of the natural world without perusing their diverse meanings.The debate shows ecological characteristics in several ways. It tells us that Hughes tried to recognize and understand the objects of the natural world as such. This attitude suggests that Hughes perceived nature not as it but as you/our partner. The debate also tells us that Hughes’s poem opened up a possibility to see the animal as an agency, and it thereby suggests that Hughes leads the reader to reconsider the hierarchy between humans and nonhumans inherent in the view of nature. Hughes’s poems such as “The Hawk in the Rain,” “The Jaguar,” and “Hawk Roosting” exemplify that Hughes is moving away from a human-centered worldview to an ecological-centered worldview. For him, hawks and jaguars are actants who construct their worlds and trans-corporeal beings who are interconnected in the instinctual cycle of the natural world. Through his representation of animals, Hughes puts the natural world in the center of poetic discourse. The Hawk in the Rain and Lupercal predict Hughes’ environmental and ecological consciousness seen in his later works.

TI  - Wordsworth's An Evening Walk: The Poetics of Picturesque and Its Beyond

AB  - This paper examines how Wordsworth's An Evening Walk constructs its own picturesque style. The poem is written under the influence of Gilpin's picturesque theory, but it is beyond the limits of the theory. William Gilpin emphasizes the importance of the rough appearance of natural objects and rejects artificial beauty. He prefers to see people adapted or naturalized to the landscape because he believes that the picturesque aesthetics contains the consciousness that the nature itself should be viewed and evaluated. Gilpin further stresses the overall harmony of the natural landscape, revealing a humble belief that nature is composed of various forms and is out of human understanding.Wordsworth's An Evening Walk seeks the harmony of the landscape to harmonize the landscape through the chiaroscuro of light and shade, but the poet's picturesque poetry captures the movements of the mind that conform to the scenery in addition to the portrayal of the landscape. The poet shows that the emotional reaction or the manifestation of imagination comes from the close connection with the natural landscape through the anecdotes of the female beggar, suggesting that human thoughts and emotions are the inevitable events of life and death on the natural stage. In An Evening Walk, nature is stamped as a base for directing the failure of the community and for restoring the community of sympathy. In this respect, An Evening Walk anticipates the poet’s poetry such as The Ruined Cottage, "Tintern Abbey", Home at Grasmere, and "Michael" written during his great period.  Gilpin's picturesque theory and Wordsworth's An Evening Walk leads us to rethink the (re)union of the eye and the material, which makes it possible to find the intrinsic value of a natural object in the image or description created by such (re)union. Given the humility of nature, the awareness of nature's wholeness, and the perception of nature as a basis for our thoughts and emotions, it could be said that Gilpin's picturesque theory and Wordsworth's An Evening Walk anticipates a proto-ecological worldview.

AB  - Engineering plastic (EP) is rising as a new alternative material and used for various fields. Recently, the EP has been used as frictional material for spherical bearings of railway bridges. However, the characteristics of friction of EP is not specified yet, and, thus, this study aims to provide frictional coefficient of the EP materials used in Korea for designing spherical bearings. This study conducts frictional tests following the EN 1337-2 regulation resulting in the initial frictional and final coefficients raging 0.025-0.047 for initial frictional coefficient and 0.048-0.067 with sliding distance of 10,242 m. This study also compares the results of the EP materials with properties of PTFE (Polytetraflouroethylene). The frictional coefficients of the EP are larger than those of the PTFE.However, the resistance fo the EP to frictional abrasion is better than that of the PTFE. This study alos estimates increasing rate of frictional coefficient to sliding distance. The increasing rates of the EPs are relatively larger than that of the PTFE, and the increasing rate of the EP without lubricant is smaller than those of the EP with lubricant.

TI  - A method for reducing scanning error rate of LIDAR using a galvanometer
T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXV
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Scanners are widely used in modern industry and daily life, and they have a wide range of applications. They are used not only for medical measuring and imaging equipment but also for cutting and processing equipment in the industrial field, as well as for information processing, display and data collection in various technologies, such as projectors and 3D image sensors. With the development of technology, the use of scanners has been increasing as automation has progressed. In particular, with the development of unmanned mobile technology, sensors using scanners are being developed. It is a common problem that it is difficult to precisely control a mechanically moving scanner, although the manner of controlling the scanner varies according to the application technology. When a scanner is operated at a high speed, a scan error occurs because of the difference of scan speed between the acceleration region and the constant region. Scan error also leads to serious problems in a LIDAR sensor. In a LIDAR sensor, scan error prevents the user from achieving the objective of detecting the exact position of the object by collecting or transmitting information that is different from what the user desires. In this paper, we present a technique to compensate for the scanning error that occurs in a LIDAR sensor. In most cases where a commercial scanner is used, the user has restricted methods to control the scanner. It is difficult to control the scanner precisely because the scanner needs to be controlled using only one or two pieces of information. Also, conditions that can be changed depending on application technology may be limited. We propose a method to reduce the scan error and to improve the 3D image of the LIDAR sensor through the limited scanner control.

AB  - This paper decided to look at the strategies that TV historical dramas of the 2010s considered when implementing characters in order to gain popularity. To this end, the characters in the representative historical dramas <Chuno>, <The Deep Rooted Tree>, and <The Moonlight Drawn by Clouds> were analyzed.First, it satisfies women's fantasy. Both male and female characters have been given charms that project the wishes or desires of current female viewers. For male characters, he emphasized internal factors such as purity toward female characters, one-sidedness and faith. Female characters have been given the ability or character to realize the image or status of women admired today. She has outstanding knowledge and skills that can compete with men and their own job or success in the field of players or pro league.Second, reducing distance and securing intimacy. TV history dramas requiring a lot of explanation, understanding, and foreknowledge work first before curiosity. This is a disadvantageous requirement to attract early viewer ratings compared to modern dramas. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, the character in the play gave him a job by acting and thinking like a modern person, using lines and props.Third, putting a character into a fictional history in which imagination has been exercised. Creating a virtual history is divided into two ways again: creating a fictional worldview created by imagination, combined with an existential space based on feed.Through this, this paper wanted to examine what the current trend or trend of TV historical dramas is in the history of TV dramas that will continue. This paper also makes a point that it tried to grasp the desire of the people of the time to watch it or what the view of the world was also about.

AB  - The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-20 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) was launched on November 18, 2017 and has been in operation for about one year. It has 14 Reflective Solar Bands (RSBs) covering a spectral range of 412nm to 2.25 um at two spatial resolutions at nadir 750m for Moderate resolution (M) bands and 350m for Imaging (I) bands. The spatial characterization of the VIIRS instrument was performed during the prelaunch calibration with parameters such as Band-to-Band Registration (BBR). Accurate estimation of BBR is a key spatial parameter when the interband calculation is required. Because there is no on-board spatial calibration source like Spectro Radiometric Calibration Assembly (SRCA) with Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), VIIRS instrument does not have on-board capability of measuring on-orbit BBR. As an alternative method, scheduled moon collections can be used to estimate on-orbit BBR characterization within the RSBs. In this paper, NOAA-20 VIIRS on-orbit BBR estimation methodology and initial results are presented.

AB  - This article is a reflection on consummation from the Christian worldview. Most scholars think of Christian worldview in terms of creation, fall into sin and redemption and view that consummation of the Kingdom of God is included in redemption. But in this article, it is argued that consummation should be discussed separately because there is not only continuity but also a clear discontinuity between redemption and consummation. Revelation 21:1-4 are selected as the main text for consummation and the following four themes are discussed with a biblical theological method: first, the meaning of new heaven and new earth is discussed. Then, by explaining the significance of the holy city, new Jerusalem and bride, a deeper investigation is made to explore the contents of the consummation of the Kingdom of God. After that, the Immanuel principle is dealt with as the final completion of God’s covenant with His people. Finally, shalom as the eternal blessing is exposed as the ultimate blessing given to God’s people. In conclusion, an attempt is made to identify what kind of contribution it can make in the Christian worldview.

AB  - Floods are the most common natural hazard worldwide. GARI is a flood risk management and analysis tool that is being developed by the Environmental and Nordic Remote Sensing Group (TENOR) of INRS in Quebec City (Canada). Beyond mapping the flooded areas and water levels, GARI allows for the estimation, analysis and visualization of flood risks for individuals, residential buildings, and population. Information can therefore be used during the different phases of flood risk management. In the operational phase, GARI can use satellite radar images to map in near real-time the flooded areas and water levels. It uses an innovative approach that combines Radarsat-2 and hydraulic data, specifically flood return period data. Information from the GARI enable municipalities and individuals to anticipate the impacts of a flood in a given area, to mitigate these impacts, to prepare, and to better coordinate their actions during a flood.

AB  - Small-sized particulates (PM2.5) are very dangerous if inhaled by humans. The measurement of the particle concentration is carried out by the highly variable AQMS. Several studies have shown a positive relationship between aerosol optical thickness to surface PM2.5. The study aims to predict PM2.5 from Aerosol Optical Thickness using Linear Regression Model in Indonesia. The aerosol optical thickness is obtained from the VIIRS sensor on the SNPP satellite and from the MODIS sensor on the Aqua satellite. Linear regression model for predicting daily PM2.5 using AOT VIIRS SNPP is PM2.5=56.683*AOT-3.807 with r=0.7. Linear regression model for predicting daily PM2.5 using AOT MODIS-Aqua is PM2.5=104.3*AOT+1.0118 with r=0.7.

AB  - Satellites all around the globe generate huge quantities of data periodically on a daily basis. The management of such large quantities of data poses significant problems ranging from data storage, retrieval and manipulation. The current scenario of managing Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) ASTROSAT-CZTI satellite data involves an elementary and unsophisticated approach which causes a lot of delay in data retrieval and further causes noticeable data portability issues. The evaluation and research on the above mentioned complication paved a way for us to introduce a new architectural system to solve this complex optimization problem. We propose the creation of an independent application server and an underlying Django REST API based web service which would facilitate the efficient management and retrieval of this data. This also extends the scope, making the system more dynamic and helps in load balancing. The application server helps the system to regulate the turbulent flow of huge data quantities. The Django web framework provides feature distribution which helps manage unorganised data cost effectively. Thus, it removes the possible causes of deterioration of response in the existing system. The REST API extends the scope of the system by providing umpteen useful features which makes universal interfacing of our system possible. The techniques used in the development of our proposed system including data migration, prefetching of data and minimizing the time trade-off, address all existing challenges and show a significant improvement in the overall performance of the system.

AB  - Monitoring of land use/cover (LULC) change is very important for sustainable development planning study. This research work is to understand natural and environmental situation and its cause such as intensity, distribution and socio and economic effects in Moscow, Russia based on remote sensing and Geographical Information System techniques. A model was developed by following thematic layers: land use/cover, vegetation, soil, geomorphology and geology in ArcGIS 10.2 software using multi-spectral satellite data obtained from Landsat 7 and 8 for the years of 1995, 2005 and 2016 respectively. Increasing scientific and political interest in regional aspects of global environmental changes, there is a strong stimulus to better understand the patterns causes and environmental consequences of LULC expansion in the elevation of Moscow state, one of the areas in the nation with fast economic growth and high population density. A 70 to 300 m inundation land loss scenarios for surface water and sea level rise (SLR) were developed using digital elevation models of study site topography through remote sensing and GIS techniques by ASTER GDEM and Landsat OLI data. The most severely impacted sectors are expected to be the vegetation, wetland and the natural ecosystem. Improved understanding of the extent and response of SLR will help in preparing for adaptation.

TI  - Islamic finance instruments for promoting long-run investment in the light of the well-being criterion (maslaha)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study of this methodological abstraction is erected the nature of the well-being function as evaluative criterion. The well-being function (maslaha) evaluates the interrelationships between long-run investment (real sector), the corresponding financial instruments (financial sector) and the embedded socioeconomic variables and ethical values conveyed by extensive complementarities and participation in a systemic approach of unity of knowledge. Among the financing variables to be selected will be the transformation of debt-instruments into equity instruments. All financial instruments are to be transformed into a holistic participatory pooled portfolio.Design/methodology/approach The paper establishes the point that, the idea of long-run is appropriately that of a juncture of Islamic change during which the objective of well-being (maslaha) is evaluated (estimation leading to simulation) with long-run investment and Islamic financing instruments on the basis of the Islamic methodological worldview. This methodological worldview is premised on the ontological foundation of the episteme of organic unity of knowledge and the resulting world-system. The Qur'an refers to this foundation of knowledge as Tawhid. Tawhid is used in this paper to mean the Primal Ontological Law of Unity of Knowledge.Findings The most critical long-run investment program focused on is poverty alleviation and its equity-based financing instruments that reduce debt progressively to attain sustainable grassroots development with the ability to own, and the social capability to distribute resources and enable the grassroots. The corresponding interaction, integration and evolutionary dynamics of learning that emanate from the interrelationship of poverty alleviation as the focus of long-run investments and their attenuating financing instruments, along with the implications of inter-causal socioeconomic variables and the embedded episteme of unity of knowledge in the well-being function (maslaha). This paper is thus an abstracto-empirical contribution to the literature of Islamic finance, long-run investment and socioeconomic development with global significance.Research limitations/implications The choice of long-run investment for poverty alleviation and the corresponding Islamic financing instruments are summarized by the following Tawhidi epistemic schema (an extractive picture). Upon this epistemic methodological worldview, the entire structure of well-being and sustainability of socioeconomic development lies.Practical implications The paper brings out many of the properties that ought to be the truly moral/ethical and thereby the conformable analytical nature of the model of financing and investment in a combination of short-, medium- and long-term mobilization of resources to attain levels of social well-being as the objective criterion. Empirical work is done to bring the objective criterion to an applied level and to critically examine the work in the same field being carried out by many other ones, including authors and institutions. The empirical work done here can be widely extended to the case of estimating of the maslaha function (well-being).Social implications This paper carries an essentially moral and social perspective in its methodological orientation that is derived from the Islamic epistemological foundations of unity of knowledge (Tawhid) and applied to Islamic finance and investment theory with the well-being objective criterion.Originality/value This is an original paper that combines methodological abstraction with applied financing and investment perspectives. Such an abstracto-empirical approach has not been done in Islamic research writings.

CL  - Dept Energy, Milan, ITALY
AB  - For the last few decades, there have been a lot of studies recognising the significant roles of the urban trees as a high-quality carbon sink. This work is a preliminary study about how remote sensing and photogrammetry could be useful tools to identify urban trees for the purpose of Carbon Storage (CS) computation in urban areas. Our first study area is a typical urban park located in Sassuolo, a municipality in the northern part of Italy in the so-called "Pianura Padana" We measured the tree Height (H) and the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), required for the calibration of the CS, based on the tree allometry during the field data collection along with the constructing a 3D model through the photogrammetric approach A high-resolution WorldView (WV) 3 satellite image of the same area, was classified using an object-oriented approach to count the number of trees varied with different species. This preliminary study will enhance the possibilities of the application of these approaches in case of the larger urban areas to ascertain the accuracy of the tree CS calibration.

AB  - Mapping urban areas using the earth observation satellites is useful for monitoring urban expansions and measuring urban developments. In this research, the different thresholds for detecting the urban areas separately from the remote-sensing index images (normalized-difference built-up index(NDBI) and urban index(UI) images) generated from the Landsat-8 image acquired in Daegu, South Korea were evaluated through the following steps: (1) the NDBI and UI images were separately generated from the given Landsat-8 image; (2) the different thresholds (-0.4, -0.2, and 0) for detecting the urban areas separately from the NDBI and UI images were evaluated; and (3) the accuracy of each detected urban area was assessed. The experiment results showed that the threshold -0.2 had the best performance for detecting the urban areas from the NDBI image, while the threshold -0.4 had the best performance for detecting the urban areas from the UI image. Some misclassification errors, however, occurred in the areas where the bare soil areas were classified into urban areas or where the high-rise apartments were classified into other areas. In the future research, a robust methodology for detecting urban areas, including the various types of urban features, with less misclassification errors will be proposed using the satellite images. In addition, research on analyzing the pattern of urban expansion will be carried out using the urban areas detected from the multi-temporal satellite images.

AB  - Spontaneous combustion of coal is a critical problem encountered by mining and thermal power industries. Usually, coal is stored in open area in the form of stockpiles in the coal mines and thermal power plants. In this paper, we have focused on localization of open-cast coal mines and coal stockpiles using satellite images to automate the entire process of prediction of spontaneous combustion in the coal stockpiles. We have used USGS Landsat-8 Satellite images, collected from various coal mines and thermal plants across the world. The satellite images consist of 11 bands including Red, Blue, Green, Near Infrared (NIR), and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR). Apart from the reflectance measurements obtained from these bands, we also use standard indices including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) as the features to train the models. The ground truth for the training dataset has been created by manually annotating these images for three classes: coal mines, coal stockpiles and water bodies. The Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) based U-Net architecture has been trained to develop two models to classify pixels between (A) Coal Mine and Water and (B) Coal Stockpile and Water. In this paper, we present an exhaustive experimental results to demonstrate the effective localization of coal mine and coal stockpiles using the proposed FCN based approach.

TI  - Preprocessed Sentinel-1 Data via a Web Service Focused on Agricultural Field Monitoring
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - ESA provides Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar satellite data freely for research and industry. The Sentinel-1 data have shown the potential for remotely monitoring conditions in individual agricultural fields on a weekly basis. Researchers have access to the same Sentinel-1 dataset, so independent validation should be possible. Well documented studies performed with Sentinel-1 will allow other researchers the ability to reproduce the experiments and either validate or repudiate the presented findings. Based on the current state-of-the-art study, a web service was provided for the agricultural domain, which can be downloaded freely from Github. The running web service provides the ability to monitor local conditions by using the recorded Sentinel-1 information, combined with a priori knowledge from broad acre fields. Correlating the Sentinel-1 data to actual conditions related to a specific application is still a task that individual researchers must perform to utilize the service. In this paper, we present our methodology for converting the Sentinel-1 data to a form that is more accessible to researchers in the agricultural domain. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to make the Sentinel-1 data available efficiently, so that the experts in this field can focus on correlating and comparing it to reference data and measurements collected in the field. The function of the web service is illustrated with concrete application examples in the agricultural domain.

TI  - Assessing the impact of different landscape features on post-fire forest recovery with multitemporal remote sensing data: the case of Mount Taygetos (southern Greece)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires affecting large areas usually create a mosaic of recovering plant communities reflecting their pre-fire composition and local conditions of burning. However, post-fire recovery patterns may also reveal the effects of landscape heterogeneity on the natural regeneration process of plant communities. This study combines field data and remote sensing image interpretation techniques to assess the role of various landscape characteristics in the post-fire recovery process in a mountainous region of Greece burned by a severe wildfire. Remote sensing techniques were used to accurately map secluded, large burned areas. By introducing a temporal component, we explored the correlation between post-fire regeneration and underlying topography, soils and basement rock. Pre-fire forest cover was reduced by more than half 8 years after fire. Regarding the dominant pre-fire forest trees, Abies cephalonica did not regenerate well after fire and most pre-fire stands were converted to grasslands and shrublands. In contrast, Pinus nigra regenerated sufficiently to return to its pre-fire cover, especially in areas underlain by softer basement rock. The use of different time series of high-resolution images improved the quality of the results obtained, justifying their use despite their high cost.

AB  - Forest biodiversity is an essential indicator of the sustainability and functioning of forest ecosystems worldwide. Improvements in remote sensing data characteristics such as temporal, spectral, radiometric and spatial resolution, elevates the potential of satellite imagery for species diversity monitoring at various spatial and temporal scales.This study investigated the use of Sentinel-2 MSI and RapidEye imagery for estimating and mapping a-diversity in a protected forest area in Northern Greece. Additional objectives of the study included the comparative evaluation of the information content of the two sensors and the assessment of the optimum diversity index (S, H and D1) that could be related with the spectral and spatial information content of the images.Field data were collected during summer 2018, from 60 square plots within the Natura 2000 sites of the Northern Pindos National Park. Sentinel-2 and RapidEye satellite images were acquired over the same season and pre-processed for minimizing errors and variability due to atmosphere and topography.A robust machine learning algorithm was used to model the relationship between diversity indices and spectral and spatial features of the images. The results of the analysis demonstrated the potential of the remote sensing technology for monitoring and reporting biodiversity over forest protected areas.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The article considers the problems of envisaging a paradise on earth, with special reference to Jehovah’s Witnesses. After an explanation of their relationship to the Christian Protestant tradition, particularly Adventism and American fundamentalism, some key doctrines of the Watch Tower organisation are identified, with particular reference to their belief in a coming earthly paradise. Jehovah’s Witnesses are a restorationist movement, seeking a restored paradise on earth, and endeavouring to restore authentic Christianity in what they take to be its original form. Discussion is given to the possibility of physical accommodation on the earth, the position of animals, family life, language, and technology. Finally, brief comparison is made with the expected paradise of the Daesoon Jinrihoe, which is based on a radically different worldview. It is concluded that such differences help to explain why Jehovah’s Witnesses have limited success in Korea, as compared with indigenous Korean new religions such as Daesoon Jinrihoe.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An uncertainty in the relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) comes from the uncertainty of AOD by aerosol models and the estimated surface reflectance, a mismatch in spatiotemporal resolution, integration of AOD and PM2.5 data, and data modeling. In this study, an integrated geographically temporally weighted regression (GTWR) and RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) models, which provide fine goodness-of-fit between observed PM2.5 and AOD data, were used for mapping of PM2.5 over Taiwan for the year 2014. For this, dark target (DT) AOD observations at 3-km resolution (DT3K) only for high-quality assurance flag (QA=3) were obtained from the scientific data set (SDS) Optical_Depth_Land_And_Ocean. AOD observations were also obtained from the merged DT and DB (deep blue) product (DTB3K) which was generated using the simplified merge scheme (SMS), i.e., using an average of the DT and DB highest quality AOD retrievals or the available one. The GTWR model integrated with RANSAC can use the effective sampling and fitting to overcome the estimation problem of AOD-PM2.5 with the uncertainty and outliers of observation data. Results showed that the model dealing with spatiotemporal heterogeneity and uncertainty is a powerful tool to infer patterns of PM2.5 from a RANSAC subset samples. Moreover, spatial variability and hotspot analysis were applied after PM2.5 mapping. The hotspot and spatial variability of PM2.5 maps can give us a summary of the spatiotemporal patterns of PM2.5 variations.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The radiometric stability of selected thermal emissive bands (TEBs) of Terra and Aqua MODIS is evaluated via a direct intersensor comparison with SNPP VIIRS. The analysis adapts a "nadir-only" refinement of the simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNOs) analysis to evaluate radiometric deviations in MODIS Collection 6.0 and 6.1 data releases, the latter having been implemented with a version of crosstalk effect mitigation for Terra MODIS Bands 27-30. The comparison time series shows radiometric deviation in Terra MODIS Band 29 (8.55 mm) up to 6%, or 3 K in brightness temperature (BT), in Collection 6.0, and -1.5%, or -0.7 K in BT, in Collection 6.1. In particular, the safe mode event of February 2016 has significantly worsened the effect. This study includes the inter-TEB comparisons of MODIS bands B31 and B32 with SNPP VIIRS, and also describes a procedure using both radiance-to-radiance comparison and BT-difference time series to estimate the BT-difference uncertainty specifications as well as the radiance-to-radiance time series baselines. The Terra MODIS Band 29 result highlights the continual impact of crosstalk effect on numerous TEBs of MODIS Collection 6.1 that is not fully mitigated, which can further impact cloud masks, sea surface temperatures and other product retrievals.

TI  - On-orbit calibration performance of Sentinel-3A OLCI referencing to SNPP VIIRS: 2-year result
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The on-orbit calibration performance of the Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel-3A satellite, launched on 16 February 2016, is evaluated via a radiometric intersensor comparison referencing to SNPP VIIRS. Among the 21 OLCI bands, which are reflective solar bands (RSBs), seven of the bands match up spectrally with the seven shortest wavelength SNPP VIIRS bands. The radiometric comparison utilizes a "nadir-only" refinement of the simultaneous nadir overpass (SNO) approach for analysis. The time series result for OLCI bands Oa02, Oa03, Oa08 and Oa17, which well spreads out over the spectral range of OLCI, shows a two-year stability at the level of 0.3% that supports nominally correct on-orbit calibration for Sentinel-3A OLCI. The result for Oa08, Oa09 and Oa10, the three spectrally adjacent bands matching to SMPP VIIRS Band M5, demonstrates the impact of spectral mismatch - different radiometric ratio baselines and seasonally modulating patterns.

AB  - The radiometric performance of the reflective solar bands (RSBs) of NOAA-20 VIIRS, recently launched on 18 November 2017, is evaluated through an intercomparison with Aqua MODIS in a continuation of previous year's effort. The analysis adapts a "nadir-only" refinement of the simultaneous nadir overpass (SNO) to generate comparison time series for assessment of the on-orbit calibration of NOAA-20 VIIRS RSBs using the official sensor data records (SDRs). Result shows improved radiometric stability in the past year but upward radiometric drift in Bands M1 and M2 is possibly emerging, indicative of the active solar diffuser effect that is known for SNPP VIIRS. NOAA-20 VIIRS RSBs continues to maintain a 2 to 8% radiometric deficit relative to SNPP VIIRS RSBs.

AB  - Terrain affects surface solar radiation (SSR) of mountainous area greatly. However, reliable observational data and methods are absent in mountainous areas. The stations located in these areas, typically built on flat places equipped with horizontal radiometers, are hard to capture the topographic effects. We proposed a tilted SSR observation group for mountainous areas based on ground stations. In 2015 and 2016, the method was tested in Chengde, China. Five ground stations were built on hilltop, valley, and three slopes to measure SSR. The radiometers on slopes and hilltop were set up parallel to the ground surfaces, while the radiometer in the valley was set horizontally to compare with the tilted observation method. A topographic radiation model along with a 12.5m digital elevation model (DEM) data was used to simulate the downward SSR and compare with observations. The result showed good consistency with the observations on slopes with R-2 values as high as 0.99, but relatively big deviations were found at the hilltop and valley stations, caused by the slope calculation errors and unsuitable observational method. The results demonstrate the fact of that the topographic radiation model should be validated using proposed method with high accuracy DEM.

AB  - In robotic tasks that require physical interactions such as manipulation and legged locomotion, it is important to simultaneously measure contact forces and contact angles. This paper presents a unified solution for simultaneously measuring three axis contact forces and contact angles for legged locomotion or manipulation. Unlike most tactile sensors, the presented design utilizes the stress field method by sampling pressures over multiple locations within an elastomer, enabling inherently robust operation against impact and abrasive interactions. The presented sensor is designed for point-feet quadrupedal robots and can be easily scaled down for other applications such as grasping. The sampled stress distribution is mapped to output forces f(x), f(y), and f(z) and two contact angles, theta and phi on the hemispherical sensor surface via Gaussian process regression. The prototype sensor is able track normal and shear forces accurately, achieving a normalized root mean (RMS) squared error of only 1.00% - 1.36% for f(z) across multiple tests with up to 180N normal force, and a normalized RMS error of 1.71% - 4.67% and 1.82% - 6.68% for f(x) and f(y), respectively, with up to 80N shear force. Additionally, the footpad is able to estimate the contact location coordinates theta and phi with a normalized RMS error of 2.69% 7.51% over a range of 0 40ffi and 2.79% - 9.62% over a range of 0 - 30 degrees, respectively. The footpad can estimate contact location over a maximum range of theta = +/- 45 degrees and phi = +/- 45 degrees, and can withstand over 450N of normal force at location theta = phi = 0 degrees without reaching saturation. This prototype demonstrates the ability to simultaneously measure force in three axes and contact angles using Gaussian process regression, with the potential to explore other regression methods for embedded computing and miniaturization of the design for finger tip scale sensors.

AB  - In this study, the correlation analysis was conducted between observed air temperature(maximum, minimum, and mean air temperature) and the daytime and nighttime data ofTerra/Aqua MODIS LST(Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Land SurfaceTemperature) for 86 weather stations. All the data of the recent 11 years from 2008 to2018 were prepared with daily base. In particular, the characteristics of the cold andheat waves incidence period in 2018 were analyzed. The correlation analysis wasperformed using the Pearson correlation coefficient(R) and root mean squareerror(RMSE). As a result of time series analysis, the trend between observed airtemperature and MODIS LST were similar, showing the correlation above 0.9 inmaximum temperature, above 0.8 in mean and minimum temperature. Especially, themaximum temperature was found to have the highest accuracy with Terra MODIS LSTdaytime, and the minimum temperature had the highest correlation with Terra MODISLST nighttime. During the cold wave period, both Terra and Aqua MODIS LST showedhigher correlations with nighttime data than daytime data. For the heat wave period, theAqua MODIS LST daytime data was good, but the overall R was below 0.5. Additionalanalysis is necessary for further study considering such as land cover and elevationcharacteristics.

AB  - This study analyzed the surface temperature mitigation effect of wetlands during cold waves (below –12℃ from January to February) and heat waves (above 33℃ from July to August) in 2018. We used Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Daytime and Nighttime Land Surface Temperature (LST) product, and the maximum and minimum air temperature observed at 86 stations of Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). For the cold wave analysis, the LST of Terra MODIS nighttime was the highest at forest area with –12.7℃, followed by upland crop and wetland areas of –12.9℃ and –13.0℃ respectively. The urban area showed the lowest value of –14.4℃. During the heat wave, the urban area was the highest with + 34.6℃ in Aqua MODIS LST daytime. The wetland area was + 33.0℃ showing - 1.6℃ decrease comparing with urban area.

AB  - Recently, the drastic climate changes have increased the importance of wildfire monitoring and damage assessment as well as the possibility of wildfire occurrence. Estimation of wildfire damage provides the information on wildfire-induced ecological changes and supports the decision-making process for post-fire treatment activities. For accurate wildfire damage assessment, the discrimination between disaster-induced and natural changes is crucial because they usually coupled together.In this study, Sentinel-2 images were employed to assess the damage from a wildfire, which occurred in the coniferous forest of Gangneung, Gangwon Province, South Korea on April 2019. The images were captured from both Sentinel-2A and -2B, shortening the temporal interval of available pre- and post-fire images. Multi-temporal image analysis was performed in both object and pixel-based with two commonly used spectral indices, NDVI and NBR. Additional image pair from the same period of 2018 was used to distinguish the fire-affected regions from the naturally changed area and compared with the results from using only one pair of images from 2019. The experimental results showed that the change detection performance could be affected by the number of image pairs and spectral indices used to discriminate burned region from unburned region. Thus it verified the significance of adequately employing annual multi-pair satellite images for wildfire damage assessment.

AB  - In childhood environmental education, the teacher plays an important role in the developing awareness of children on environmental issues, helping them gain environmental sensitivity and ensuring that they contribute to solutions on environmental problems. This study aims to explore the environmental worldview of kindergarten teachers. The study was conducted on 195 kindergarten teachers who work in the areas of Mokpo City and Muan Gun. “Environmental Attitudes Measuring Scale” and “Environmental Sensitivity Measuring Scale" were used as data collection tools. The environmental attitudes of kindergarten teachers could be classified into three groups with distinct characteristics through the k-mean cluster analysis. Considering their characteristics, each of these groups corresponds exactly to technology-oriented (42.6%), ecology-oriented (41.0%), and sustainable development-oriented (16.4%) environmental worldview. It was found that, among the background variables of kindergarten teachers who participated in this study, age, education career, environmental concern and experience in environmental conservation activities during their school days are significant variables affecting the teachers’ environmental worldview. However, experiences in pre-service or in-service training related to environmental education do not create significant difference in the environmental worldview of kindergarten teachers, suggesting that the contents and methods of environmental education program were not very efficient. Kindergarten teachers, classified as groups with ecology-oriented and sustainable development-oriented environmental worldview, were more environmentally sensitive than those with technology-oriented environmental worldview. These results emphasize that environmental experience education is more effective than knowledge-centered education in order to develop kindergarten teachers' environmental worldview into an eco-friendly worldview. The findings of this study could be taken into consideration while planning and formulating suitable pre-service and in-service training programs in accordance with the type of environmental worldview of the trainees.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Alfred N. Whitehead, one of modern Western philosophers, founded ‘process philosophy.’ His philosophy has been influencing on many areas such as theology, religion, science, art, and culture. As he expressed that his philosophy was very close to Eastern thoughts, his philosophy of process has been used as a major tool for interreligious dialogue and comparative study of regions. Particularly, his philosophy is expected to make a significant contribution for peace in the world in times of conflicts among religions. Process philosophy which was developed in the United States in the 20 century was greatly influenced by Whitehead’s philosophy of process. Whitehead’s philosophy is also called ‘philosophy of organism’ and it regards the universe as a living organism that has impact on one another in all thing of the world. His philosophy opposes the traditional worldview that is fixed and static.Whitehead embraced a theme of religion in his philosophy.The theory of religion he proposed gives a new insight to theology and the study of religion. He insisted that religion started from individual’s loneliness and internal dimension. He proposed ‘panentheism’ that understood God as the one who was one of actual entities and transcended actual entities at the same time, had both primordial nature and consequent nature.His panentheism is a new concept of God which is composed of theism and pantheism. It is very helpful to complement the problems of traditional theism. For him, a concept of God is a final one that completes his cosmology. Whitehead assures God’s goodness without paradoxes and perversions repeatedly appeared in traditional Christian doctrines. He also explains convincingly power of God. In particular, his concept of God makes us recognize the mutual relation between God and the world and importance of dynamic creation in divine life.Whitehead criticized some concepts of God applied to Western traditional Christianity in history. Those concepts are God as an aboriginal, eminently real, transcendent creator, an imperial ruler, a personification of moral energy, the unmoved mover, and an ultimate philosophical principle. These concepts of God are far away from Christianity of the Galilean origin.Therefore, whitehead attempts to provide a new concept of God, analyzing various concepts of God in the history of world religions.In this article, the author first explores a general scheme of process cosmology which is a foundation of process philo sophy and then studies Whitehead’s panentheism with a special attention. In conclusion, the author examines how this study influences the making of Christian spirituality and finally suggests the significance and limitations of this study and some tasks for the further study.

T2  - ST PETERSBURG POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY JOURNAL-PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the paper, the field studies of powerful infrasonic disturbances in the range of "voice of the sea" (7 - 9 Hz) caused by tropical cyclones (typhoons) in the southeastern region of the Far Eastern Federal District (Russia) and the water area of the Sea of Japan have been presented. Event monitoring was carried out using the laser-interference measuring complex located permanently in the South of Primorski Krai. The dynamic spectrograms of the observable events were analyzed and their connection with various meteorological phenomena, such as wind and sea waves, was followed. Using the satellite data, a connection between the distribution of the area of typhoons influence in the region and the observed infrasound excitation was found. The conclusions were drawn regarding the correlation between the exhibition of the "voice of the sea" microseisms and the initiation of primary and secondary microseisms, as well as the one between the "voice of the sea" microseisms' disappearance and the corresponding end of primary microseisms. No dependence of the signal level on the wind speed in the area of the measuring range location was established.

AB  - Biomass burnings (including forest, grassland, peatland and agricultural fires) have important impacts on global terrestrial and atmospheric systems, affecting land cover, surface albedo, and the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Several products have been generated in the last years to estimate total burned area, but uncertainties remain, particularly those associated to small and low intensity fires. The Fire_CCI project of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative has generated consistent time series of burned area products to assess the extents of biomass burnings, as well as their spatial and temporal characteristics. Two global burned area products have been generated based on the MERIS and MODIS sensors, both at the highest resolution available (300 and 250 m resolution, respectively), covering the full time series of these sensors. These global products are complemented with a small-fire database for Subsaharian Africa, generated from Sentinel-2 images at 20 m spatial resolution for 2016. Validation of the global products was based on a statistical sampling design of Landsat frames including time and space variation.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been increasingly used in the management of early-stages cervical cancer instead of systematic pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). The aim of this article is to give a critical overview of key aspects related to this concept, such as a necessity for reliable detection of micrometastases (MIC) in SLN and the requirements for SLN pathologic ultrastaging, low accuracy of intraoperative detection of SLN involvement, and still a limited evidence of oncological safety of the replacement of PLND by SLN biopsy only in >= IB1 tumours due to unknown risk of MIC in non-SLN pelvic lymph nodes in patients with negative SLN, and absence of any prospective evidence.

TI  - A prospective multicenter trial on sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with early-stage cervical cancer (SENTIX)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been increasingly used in the management of early-stage cervical cancer. It appears in guidelines as an alternative option to systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy. The evidence about safety is, however, based mostly on retrospective studies, in which SLN was combined with systematic lymphadenectomy.Materials and methods SENTIX is a prospective multicenter trial aiming to prove that less-radical surgery with SLN is non-inferior to treatment with systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy. The primary end point is recurrence rate; the secondary end point is the prevalence of lower-leg lymphedema and symptomatic pelvic lymphocele. The reference recurrence rate was set up conservatively at 7% at 24 months after treatment. With a sample size of 300 patients treated per protocol, the trial is powered to detect a non-inferiority margin of 5% (90% power, p = 0.05) for recurrence rate, 30% reduction in the prevalence of symptomatic lymphocele or lower-leg lymphedema, with reference rates of 30% and 6% at 12 months (p = 0.025, Bonferroni correction). The patients eligible for SENTIX have stage IA1/LVSI+, IA2, IB1 (<2 cm for fertility sparing), with negative LN on pre-operative imaging. Intra-operatively, patients are excluded when there is a failure to detect SLN on both sides of the pelvis in cases of more advanced cancer (stage >IB1), or a positive intra-operative SLN assessment. The quality of SLN pathology evaluation will be assessed by central review. Three interim safety analyses are pre-planned when 30, 60, 150 patients complete 12 months' follow-up.Conclusions The first patient was enrolled into the study in June 2016 and, by June 2018, 340 patients had been enrolled. The first analysis of secondary outcomes should be available in 2019 and the oncological outcome of 300 patients at the end of 2021. The trial is registered as a CEEGOG trial (CEEGOG CX-01), ENGOT trial (ENGOT-Cx 2), and at the ClinicalTrials.gov database (NCT02494063).

AB  - Business email compromise (BEC) and employee impersonation have become one of the most costly cyber-security threats, causing over $12 billion in reported losses. Impersonation emails take several forms: for example, some ask for a wire transfer to the attacker's account, while others lead the recipient to following a link, which compromises their credentials. Email security systems are not effective in detecting these attacks, because the attacks do not contain a clearly malicious payload, and are personalized to the recipient.We present BEC-Guard, a detector used at Barracuda Networks that prevents business email compromise attacks in real-time using supervised learning. BEC-Guard has been in production since July 2017, and is part of the Barracuda Sentinel email security product. BEC-Guard detects attacks by relying on statistics about the historical email patterns that can be accessed via cloud email provider APIs. The two main challenges when designing BEC-Guard are the need to label millions of emails to train its classifiers, and to properly train the classifiers when the occurrence of employee impersonation emails is very rare, which can bias the classification. Our key insight is to split the classification problem into two parts, one analyzing the header of the email, and the second applying natural language processing to detect phrases associated with BEC or suspicious links in the email body. BEC-Guard utilizes the public APIs of cloud email providers both to automatically learn the historical communication patterns of each organization, and to quarantine emails in real-time. We evaluated BEC-Guard on a commercial dataset containing more than 4,000 attacks, and show it achieves a precision of 98.2% and a false positive rate of less than one in five million emails.

TI  - Combined use of remote sensing and geostatistical data sets for estimating the dynamics of shortwave radiation of bare arable soils in Europe
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoothing rough ploughed soils increases their albedo, which results in a lower amount of shortwave radiation being absorbed by their surface layer. That surface emits less longwave radiation, leading to a reduction in its temperature, which in turn can affect the climate. This article presents a multistage procedure using remote sensing and geostatistical data sets for quantification of the annual dynamics of shortwave radiation reflected from air-dried bare soils within arable lands of the European Union and its associated countries, Norway and Switzerland. The soils, being cultivated under conventional tillage, were treated as bare formed by a plough (Pd) and a smoothing harrow (Hs), when the major crops were planted there. Information about the areas of the soils and periods when they are bare was obtained from vectorized and rasterized geostatistical data sets. The spatial diversity of the spectral reflectance of the soils, characterized by thousands of their reflectance spectra (stored in the European Land Use and Cover Area frame Survey Top Soil Database), were used to predict the half-diurnal albedo variation of the soils on a given day of the year. The shortwave radiation reaching the examined soils was obtained from satellite data of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager instrument. It was found that the maximum radiation levels reflected from the soils occur between the beginning of April and the end of May. During these periods, the radiation reflected from the soils formed by Pd and Hs can reach about 220 and 250 PJ d(-1) in the western part of the EU, 150 and 190 PJ d(-1) in the central part, and up to 280 and 330 PJ d(-1) in the southern part.

AB  - This study is focused on detecting water stress on natural wetland ecosystems. In the Upper Biebrza Basin ( NE Poland), on the meteorological tower, continuous measurements of plant surface temperature and basic meteorological parameters (air temperature and humidity) were conducted. Based on this measurements Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) was calculated. Also Landsat 8 thermal images were used for similar calculation. Firstly, correlation of Landsat 8 based and tower based CWSI was evaluated. The high agreement of values regards this two sources was obtained (R-2 = 0.99, p-value < 0.01, slope of adjusted model is equal to 0.989 and its intercept is equal to 0.0003). Secondly, the Landsat based CWSI was calculated for all wetland ecosystems in the Upper Biebrza Basin for selected images from the period of 2014-2016 years. Results show positive verification of satellite images as a source for CWSI calculation for natural wetland ecosystem, additionally, water stress was indicated frequently during analyzed years.

AB  - Mountain forests are subject to increased pressure by different disturbance agents (logging, climate disturbances or salvage logging). The Carpathians Mountains faces significant landscape changes, primarily based on the logging activities, the economic base for forestry processing. The study aims to analyse the evolution of the deforested areas in Calimani Mountains and to establish a connection with the logging activities. We used an analysis of Landsat 7ETM+ from the Global Forest Change (GFC), provided by the University of Maryland. Firstly, we analyse the dynamics of the deforested areas from 2001 to 2016. The economic database at 4-digit level for the NACE code 0220 - specific for logging activities, containing the number of companies and employees, the values of turnover and profit have been used, to complete the analysis. The results validated our hypothesis that the highest deforested areas determine high values of economic activities based on logging. The results can be used in the future development plans, forestry strategies and sustainable management.

AB  - This paper addresses the feasibility of exploiting a radar-grammetric procedure for the retrieval of height estimates using stereo images acquired in a space-surface (spaceborne transmitter-stationary receiver) bistatic geometry. Currently, the research interest concerning this particular direction is still in its infancy, as there are very few papers partially covering the subject. The method proposed in this study is applied to a set of SAR images (displaying an urban area of the Bucharest city) in order to assess the elevation of a group of selected targets within the remotely sensed zone.

TI  - Sentinel Node Dissection
T2  - NECK DISSECTION
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The technology and indications for sentinel node dissection have continued to expand over the last several years. It is used routinely for intermediate thickness melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma, and has been used for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Sentinel node biopsy has been shown to be a reliable staging technique for intermediate thickness oral cavity cancer, with sensitivity and negative predictive value rates mirroring those for melanoma. Its use in pharyngeal and laryngeal cancer continues to be investigated. The use of Tc-99m tilmanocept, a CD206 receptor target, allows for more specificity for the first echelon sentinel lymph nodes and may result in improved accuracy and a lower false-negative rate. The widespread availability and accuracy of combined SPECT/CT imaging provides a scrollable three-dimensional analysis of the drainage basins, resulting in better targeted dissections and patient counseling. Despite these technological advances, the use of the gamma probe for sentinel node dissection is not always intuitive and requires specific training and expertise, especially in cutaneous lesions that show frequent metastases to the parotid gland. Serial step sectioning and immunohistochemistry analysis are critical to the detection of micrometastases. Intraoperative frozen section analysis has also shown great promise for identifying sentinel nodes in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, allowing for completion lymphadenectomy in the same setting. Sentinel node biopsy and dissection remains an intriguing prognostic and potentially therapeutic option for malignancies with an intermediate risk of regional metastases, with increased diagnostic information compared to watchful waiting with serial imaging but sparing the morbidity of a full elective neck dissection in patients who end up with microscopically negative lymphatic basins.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Our approach engages ELL students' positionality through a carefully sequenced critical geography activity. ELL students' awareness of their positionality is vital because their knowledge is based on a worldview that crosses borders and is situated in structures of power. We ask students to create a map of their daily life, list significant places and spaces, and identify their relationships to these places and spaces. Then, students develop a narrative related to their map and use both as primary sources to compare, contrast, and/or corroborate with their classmates. We then discuss the role of positionality in interpreting historical and current circumstances.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy without axillary lymphadenectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is accurate and safe for selected patients: the GANEA 2 study
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeGANEA2 study was designed to assess accuracy and safety of sentinel lymph node (SLN) after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients.MethodsEarly breast cancer patients treated with NAC were included. Before NAC, patients with cytologically proven node involvement were allocated into the pN1 group, other patient were allocated into the cN0 group. After NAC, pN1 group patients underwent SLN and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND); cN0 group patients underwent SLN and ALND only in case of mapping failure or SLN involvement. The main endpoint was SLN false negative rate (FNR). Secondary endpoints were predictive factors for remaining positive ALND and survival of patients treated with SLN alone.ResultsFrom 2010 to 2014, 957 patients were included. Among the 419 patients from the cN0 group treated with SLN alone, one axillary relapse occurred during the follow-up. Among pN1 group patients, with successful mapping, 103 had a negative SLN. The FNR was 11.9% (95% CI 7.3-17.9%). Multivariate analysis showed that residual breast tumor size after NAC5mm and lympho-vascular invasion remained independent predictors for involved ALND. For patients with initially involved node, with negative SLN after NAC, no lympho-vascular invasion and a remaining breast tumor size 5mm, the risk of a positive ALND is 3.7% regardless the number of SLN removed.ConclusionIn patients with no initial node involvement, negative SLN after NAC allows to safely avoid an ALND. Residual breast tumor and lympho-vascular invasion after NAC allow identifying patients with initially involved node with a low risk of ALND involvement.

TI  - Re-excision rate after sector resection for breast cancer: A 5-year retrospective cohort study.
T2  - Breast disease
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Positive margins after Breast conserving surgery (BCS) for breast cancer can result in local recurrence (LR) requiring further surgery. This can lead to unnecessary patient anxiety, poor prognosis and impose additional economic burden to our health system. The aim of this study is to assess the rate of re-excision for positive margins after BCS using the sector resection technique.METHODS: This single centre retrospective cohort study included all women who underwent BCS using sector resection between the years of 2012 and 2016. A total of 456 patients underwent sector resection. We evaluated the margin status, re-excision rates and their predictive risk factors.RESULTS: 415 (91%) patients had clear margins. 41 (9%) patients underwent further re-excision for positive or close margin. 75.6% of those patients had DCIS and 51% had invasive carcinoma involving the margins. Patient and tumour characteristics associated with an increased risk of positive margin were women under the age of 50 (p = 0.19), tumours >50 mm (p = 0.001), grade-2 (p = 0.48) and grade-3 (p = 0.63), HER-2 positivity (p = 0.02), sentinel lymph node positivity (p = 0.03), and patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection (p = 0.01).CONCLUSION: BCS using the sector resection technique has a low re-excision rate for positive margins. Younger patients and aggressive tumour biology are important predictive risk factors for positive margins.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Symposium on Astronomical Optics - Design, Manufacture, and Test of Space and Ground Systems II held at SPIE Optical Engineering + Applications Conference
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - An in-orbit calibration assembly is designed and tested to ensure the radiometric accuracy of Sentinel-4/UVN. One of the calibration method consists in measuring the Sun's irradiance through a diffuser. A major challenge was the apparition of so-called spectral features, which come from speckle patterns due to the thin spectral bands of the instrument. A stack of diffuser was built to increase the average optical path difference above coherence length, thus decreasing the speckle contrast. A unique spectral feature test bench has been developed to validate the performance. A second calibration approach consists in illuminating the instrument with a white light source whose drift is characterized and limited. This paper discusses the design of the calibration assembly and the challenge which were encountered in the process. Also, on-ground tests results are presented, including the description of the test setup, in particular the spectral feature test bench.

TI  - Primal World Beliefs
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Beck's insight-that beliefs about one's self, future, and environment shape behavior-transformed depression treatment. Yet environment beliefs remain relatively understudied. We introduce a set of environment beliefs-primal world beliefs or primals-that concern the world's overall character (e.g., the world is interesting, the world is dangerous). To create a measure, we systematically identified candidate primals (e.g., analyzing tweets, historical texts, etc.); conducted exploratory factor analysis (N = 930) and two confirmatory factor analyses (N = 524; N = 529); examined sequence effects (N = 219) and concurrent validity (N = 122); and conducted test-retests over 2 weeks (n = 122), 9 months (n = 134), and 19 months (n = 398). The resulting 99-item Primals Inventory (PI-99) measures 26 primals with three overarching beliefs-Safe, Enticing, and Alive (mean alpha = .93)-that typically explain similar to 55% of the common variance. These beliefs were normally distributed; stable (2 weeks, 9 months, and 19 month test-retest results averaged .88, .75, and .77, respectively); strongly correlated with many personality and wellbeing variables (e.g., Safe and optimism, r = .61; Enticing and depression, r = -.52; Alive and meaning, r = .54); and explained more variance in life satisfaction, transcendent experience, trust, and gratitude than the BIG 5 (3%, 3%, 6%, and 12% more variance, respectively). In sum, the PI-99 showed strong psychometric characteristics, primals plausibly shape many personality and wellbeing variables, and a broad research effort examining these relationships is warranted.

AB  - Auditing Remote Sensing (RS) data can be a tough task due to the huge heterogeneity of RS data and geoprocessing tools available. In this sense, provenance information, part of the metadata that describes "what", "when", "who", "how" and "where" have generated a particular geospatial data, can be very useful. This contribution focuses on how to query provenance information in order to receive back data sources and geoprocessing tools that have participated in the generation of datasets in a catalog. This way, queries over data provenance can be used to infer data quality, trace errors sources, trust and authority of a geospatial information.

AB  - We explore a state-of-art architecture based on convolutional recurrent networks, designed to ingest and extract information of a sequence of satellite images, for large area LULC classification in the Brazilian Amazon biome. We fine-tune and evaluate it according to multiple combinations between MODIS archives at 250 m for a single year, providing surface reflectance time series data and derived indices, and external environmental data. Qualitative and quantitative differences between the trained models were evident according the input features assessed. The combination of surface reflectance and auxiliary data yield slightly better performance than only using surface reflectance data. In specific, the auxiliary data contributed to the accuracy of Mixed Forest, Savanna, Grassland and Cropland. In contrast, the arrangement including derived indices showed lower performance and therefore they negatively contribute to the classification task in the area of study.

TI  - Assessment of prior opioid tolerance among new users of fentanyl transdermal system in FDA's Sentinel System
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Fentanyl transdermal system (FTS) is intended only for patients with prior opioid tolerance. The purpose of this study is to identify the proportion of new FTS users who had evidence of prior opioid tolerance, by dosage strength, in FDA's Sentinel System. Methods We identified new FTS episodes (183-day washout) from 2009 through 2013. Members were <65 years and enrolled in medical and pharmacy coverage for 183 days prior to initial FTS dispensing (index). We assessed the proportion of users with prior tolerance stratified by dosage strength of FTS using four definitions of opioid tolerance: >= 30-mg oxycodone equivalents/day in each of 7 consecutive days immediately prior to index; >= 30-mg oxycodone equivalents/day for any 7 days in the 30 days prior to index (secondary); any dose in each of 7 days in the 7 consecutive days immediately prior to index (tertiary); and any dose for any 7 days in the 30 days prior to index (quaternary). Results Of 44 450 episodes of 25 mcg/hr FTS, 37% met the primary definition, and 77% met the quaternary definition. Of 3507 episodes of 100 mcg/hr FTS, 57% and 74% met the primary and quaternary definitions, respectively. Those aged 25 to 34 years had the highest proportion of episodes with prior tolerance; those aged 55 to 64 accounted for more of the episodes overall. Conclusions In Sentinel, many new users of FTS did not have evidence of prior opioid tolerance by the primary definition, ie, the product label definition, which is the minimum standard for the lowest FTS dose (12 mcg/hr), especially at the highest strength (100 mcg/hr). Validation of this metric is warranted, but our findings suggest the need for further prescriber education regarding appropriate prescribing of FTS.

AB  - Jung's Ethics: Moral Psychology and His Cure of Souls by Dan Merkur is the late scholar's compelling journey into Jung's psychology, worldview, and methods. Merkur, who sees Jung through a psychoanalytic lens, conducts an open-minded inquiry into many of Jung's ethically relevant theoretical and clinical discoveries, including the phenomenon of "neurotic denial of guilt" and the thesis of the inborn foundations of morality. Although these ideas diverged from Freud's conceptions, they also anticipated many future developments in psychoanalysis. The possibility of a convergence between the ethical views of Freud and Jung, via a critical comparison with Nietzsche, is also considered.

AB  - Turkey, due to increased demand for energy has made plans for nuclear power generation since 1970. Sinop Nuclear Power Plant, which will be built on Sinop Inceburun peninsula at the Black Sea coast of Turkey, is one of the three different nuclear power plants planned to be built in Turkey. The Sinop Nuclear Power Plant consist of four different reactors. The construction of the first unit is expected to be completed by 2023, and the fourth unit is planned to be activated by 2028. On the other hand, the construction of the nuclear power plant will alter the land use at the actual plant site and its surroundings and hence may cause significant environmental changes. As an indicator, more than 650000 trees have been cut so far for the construction of nuclear power plant, and this can adversely affect the ecological balances of the region by endangering habitats and creating ecological damages. The aim of this study is to analyse the land use/land cover changes (LULC) in the forestry-dominated areas due to the construction of nuclear power plants using the multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical satellite images. For this purpose, different change detection methods such as SAR intensity image differencing, supervised image classification method (Support Vector Machine algorithm) were applied to Sentinel 1 satellite image datasets (2016-2019) to evaluate the annual changes due to construction. In addition, a correlation analysis was performed between the canopy structure and vegetation biomass using Sentinel 2 NDVI dataset (2016-2019) and calibrated Sentinel 1 backscatter values. Furthermore, using the Google Earth Engine (GEE), the Landsat 8 NDVI time series of the affected forest area, generated at 8-day intervals, was used to validate changes in vegetation.

AB  - Climate change causes a critical increase of temperature and frequency of heat waves, whose impact is particularly sensitive within the urban environment. Here, the loss of natural areas, beside morphological and thermal properties, makes urban temperature to be significantly higher compared to peri-urban and rural areas. This phenomenon is commonly known as urban heat island (UHI). Because green infrastructure provides an effective strategy for reducing the UHI effect, we explore the feasibility of remotely sensed data and statistical modelling for assessing the effectiveness of green measures. We simulated how implementing green roofs over the city of Milan could affect temperature. Geographically weighted regression has been used to model the correlation among satellite-derived vegetation map and near-surface air temperature.

TI  - Operational oceanography applied to skipjack tuna (<i>Katsuwonus pelamis</i>) habitat monitoring and fishing in south-western Atlantic
T2  - FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) ranks third among marine resources that sustain global fisheries. This study delimits the spatiotemporal habitat of the species in the south-western Atlantic Ocean, based on operational oceanography. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) and catch data from six pole-and-line fishing vessels operating during 2014 and 2015 fishing seasons to assess the effect of environmental variables on catch. We also analysed Modis sensor images of sea surface temperature (SST) and surface chlorophyll-alpha concentration (SCC) to describe fishing ground characteristics in time and space. Catch was positively related to thermocline depth (24-45 m), SST (22-24.5 degrees C), SCC (0.08-0.14 mg/m(3)) and salinity (34.9-35.8). Through SST images, we identified that thermal fronts were the main surface feature associated with a higher probability to find skipjack. Also, we state that skipjack fishery is tightly related to shelf break because bottom topography drives the position of fronts in this area. Ocean colour fronts and plankton enrichment were important proxies, accessible through SCC, used to delineate skipjack fishing grounds. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was higher towards summer (median 14 t/fishing day) due to the oceanographic characteristics of the southern region. High productivity in this sector of the Brazilian coast defines the main skipjack feeding areas and, as a consequence, the greatest abundance and availability for fishing.

TI  - Embedding indigenous principles in genomic research of culturally significant species: a conservation genomics case study
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous peoples around the world are leading discusions regarding genomic research of humans, and more recently, species of cultural significance, to ensure the ethical and equitable use of DNA. Within a Maori (indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand) worldview, genomic data obtained from taonga (treasured) species has whakapapa - generally defined as genealogy, whakapapa layers the contemporary, historical and mythological aspects of bioheritage - thus genomic data obtained from taonga species are taonga in their own right and are best studied using Maori principles. We contend it is the responsibility of researchers working with genomic data from taonga species to move beyond one-off Maori consultation toward building meaningful relationships with relevant Maori communities. Here, we reflect on our experience embedding Maori principles in genomics research as leaders of a BioHeritage National Science Challenge project entitled 'Characterising adaptive variation in Aotearoa New Zealand's terrestrial and freshwater biota'. We are co-developing a culturally-responsive evidence-based position statement regarding the benefits and risks of prioritising adaptive potential to build resilience in threatened taonga species, including species destined for customary or commercial harvest. To achieve this, we co-developed a research programme with the local subtribe, Ngai Tuahuriri, that integrates Maori knowledge with emerging genomic technologies and extensive ecological data for two taonga species, kowaro (Canterbury mudfish; Neochanna burrowsius) and kekewai (freshwater crayfish; Paranephrops zealandicus). The foundation of our research programme is an iterative decision-making framework that includes tissue sampling as well as data generation, storage and access. Beyond upholding the promises made in The Treaty of Waitangi, we contend the integration of Maori principles in genomics research will enhance the recovery of taonga species and enable the realisation of Maori values.

TI  - THE URBAN PLANNING OF DOCLEA: REMOTE SENSING AND TOPOGRAPHICAL SURVEY
T2  - ARCHEOLOGIA E CALCOLATORI
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the study of Doclea by remote sensing (satellite, aerial photos, drone) and the first results of the topographic survey conducted within the urban walls. The analysis of the images has highlighted buried structures that follow the same alignment as the walls visible above ground. The same anomalies are detected on the geophysical maps. The territorial survey, conducted with the aid of a differential GPS to position the emerging structures, has allowed one to identify numerous ancient structures, sometimes preserved to some height, which have the same orientation of the buildings of the forum and a stone paved road corresponding to a cardo of the city. Analysing the archaeological findings, the geophysical results and the measurements of the principal monuments and the roads, a hypothetical reconstruction of the Doclea urban plan is presented, which, naturally, can only be verified with further research and with excavation on the spot.

TI  - A novel emotional and cognitive approach to welfare phenotyping in rainbow trout exposed to poor water quality
T2  - APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent scientific evidence for fish sentience has stressed the need for novel sentience-based detection tools of fish welfare impairment in commercial farms. In order to mimic a well-characterised stress situation, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to poor water quality (hypoxia combined with high ammonia level) for three weeks (stressed group, S) and compared to a non-stressed control group (NS). After a return to water quality standard, emotional responses were assessed in fish subjected to two potentially threatening situations: (i) social isolation in a novel environment and (ii) human presence, In addition, we used an appetitive-conditioning paradigm to determine whether previous chronic deterioration of water quality disturbs cognitive abilities in fish. Spontaneous behaviour in the tanks was also recorded during the environmental challenge as a reference for fish activity. We observed that in S fish, plasma cortisol levels were increased before and after social isolation in a novel environment compared to the plasma cortisol levels in the NS group, despite the absence of a behavioural difference between the two groups. Under deteriorated water quality, fish locomotor activity was globally reduced and this reduction was correlated to increased shoaling behaviour. Farmers can use these first behavioural modifications as a sentinel detector for fish welfare impairment. More importantly, we demonstrated that reactivity to a human presence in a home-environment and food-anticipatory behaviour were both inhibited in the S group. We consider that these two sentience-based tests are highly relevant for fish welfare assessment at the group level and are easy to use in the aquaculture industry.

TI  - On field vaccine effectiveness in three periods of 2018/2019 influenza season in Emilia-Romagna Region.
T2  - Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Epidemic influenza is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in people at risk. The vaccine reduces complications, hospitalization and mortality excess, as well as health care and social costs. Aim of the study was to estimate the influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in Emilia-Romagna Region during the 2018/2019 season.METHODS: Within the context of virological surveillance conducted at the Regional Reference Laboratory of Parma, nasal/throat swabs were performed by sentinel practitioners and clinicians, on patients with ILI (Influenza-like illness). VE estimates, overall and against subtype A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), were evaluated in three periods of the season, using a test-negative case-control design.RESULTS: From November 2018 to April 2019, 2,230 specimens were analyzed: 1,674 (75.1%) performed by clinicians and 556 (24.9%) by sentinel practitioners of the regional network. The season was characterized by the predominant circulation of influenza type A viruses: 57.4% belonged to subtype A(H3N2), 41.2% to subtype A(H1N1)pdm09. 23.5% of patients was vaccinated against influenza with quadrivalent or adjuvate vaccine. The overall VE was -5% (95% CI -33% - 18%) with a decreasing trend during the season. The overall VE against subtype A(H1N1)pdm09 was 39% (95% CI 11% - 58%) and remained stable during the season. The overall VE against subtype A(H3N2) was -43% (95% CI -89% - -9%), and showed an important decreasing trend.CONCLUSIONS: The possibility to make accurate and continuous VE estimates during the season will help to better define the composition of the vaccine for the following season.

TI  - Investigating climate variability and long-term vegetation activity across heterogeneous Basilicata agroecosystems
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The Basilicata region summarizes many basic features of the biogeographic complexity characterizing Mediterranean countries. The intricate geomorphology and the long history of human management generated the current landscapes, which include both high-value ecosystems and areas prone to desertification. Preserving goods and services provided by such composite land cover mosaics poses many problems due to the interference/overlap of diverse natural and anthropic factors which make the correct selection of relevant parameters and the interpretation of observational data rather difficult. Here, we study interconnections between local climate and vegetation activity by correlating parameters characterizing the interannual statistics of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), derived from satellite data, with a recently devised multivariate statistical index of meteoclimatic variability. We used a 15-year sequence of remote images concerning a set of plots located around meteorological ground stations of the central-eastern part of the region to pick up spatial structures in the vegetation-climate relationships. Our analyses were able to correlate spatial heterogeneity to variations in water exchanges between vegetation and atmosphere. This study represents a first step to improve the description of relevant processes to protect natural habitats and quality agriculture, therefore combating land degradation and climate change detrimental effects.

TI  - Illegal Selective Logging and Forest Fires in the Northern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Illegal selective logging and forest fires occur on a large scale in the northern Brazilian Amazon, contributing to an increase in tree mortality and a reduction in forest carbon stock. A total of 120 plots of 0.25 ha (30 ha) were installed in transitional ecosystems or ecotones (LOt) between the forested shade-loving campinarana (Ld) and dense-canopy rainforest, submontane (Ds), in the National Forest (Flona) of Anaua, southern Roraima. Measuring the diameters at breast height (DBH 10 cm) and the heights of 171 dead trees (fallen naturally, illegally exploited, and affected by forest fires), enabled the estimation of carbon content from the application of a biomass equation developed at Manaus, and the calculation of a correction factor, using the average height of the largest trees. From 2015-2017, we mapped the real extent of illegal selective logging and forest fires across the region with CLASlite and INPE/Queimadas. From measurements of 14,730 live and dead trees across 30 hectares (491 +/- 15 treesha(-1)), the illegal selective logging and associated forest fires, and aggravation by severe El Nino droughts resulted in an 8.2% mortality of trees (40 +/- 9 dead treesha(-1)) and a 3.5% reduction in forest carbon stock (6 +/- 3 Mgha(-1)) in the short-term. The surface area or influence of forest fires of very high density were estimated in the south-central region of Roraima (8374 km(2)) and the eastern region of the Flona Anaua (37 km(2)). Illegal selective logging and forest fires in forest areas totaled 357 km(2) in the mosaic area, and 6 km(2) within Flona Anaua. Illegal selective logging and forest fires in the years of severe El Nino droughts threatened the maintenance of environmental services provided by Amazonian forests.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry is currently providing displacement measurements over large areas and recently also maps of water vapor in atmosphere. However, the interferometric phase can also capture tiny contributions due to soil moisture. In this work the results obtained in a 1-year experiment with in-situ measurements of soil moisture in agricultural area, in the flat land around the Tagus river, Lisbon, Portugal, are presented. We analyze two interferometric models for the estimation of soil moisture from SAR images. Sentinel-1 SAR images in the C-band are used due to their regular acquisition plan and the short revisiting time. We present examples of soil maps from Sentinel-1 data, characterized by a high spatial resolution and short updating time and comments on their use in precision farming.

TI  - Axillary management still needed for patients with sentinel node micrometastases
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - More attention has been paid to the axillary management over the past 50 years, and clinical practice has been changed as results of the random controlled trials. The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 and International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) 23-01 trials provided high-level evidence to support the omission of axillary lymph nodes dissection (ALND) in sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive patients receiving breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and adjuvant systemic treatment. In patients treated with BCS, whole breast irradiation (WBI) with tangential fields could lead to substantial axillary irradiation and control the residual tumor burden in axilla, whereas (intraoperative) partial breast irradiation has no therapeutic effect on these residual axillary metastases. In the observation group of the IBCSG 23-01 trial, 425 patients received BCS and 80 (18.8%) of them just underwent intraoperative radiotherapy. While the 10-year axillary recurrence rate was acceptable low (1.7%, 8/467) in the no ALND group, it was 4.5% (6/134) in patients without axillary management, which was significantly higher than that of 0.6% (2/333) in patients with axillary management (P=0.0024). Should we accept an axillary recurrence rate as high as 4.5% in patients with only SLNs micrometastases? What is the best way to control the residual tumor burden in the axilla and decrease the recurrence rate if there is no ALND? The evidence showed that both WBI after BCS (Z0011, AATRM [Agencia d'Avaluacio de Tecnologia i Recerca Mediques]) and axillary regional nodal irradiation after mastectomy/BCS OTOASOR (Optimal Treatment Of the Axilla - Surgery Or Radiotherapy), AMAROS (After Mapping of the Axilla: Radiotherapy Or Surgery) could control the regional residual tumor burden when the SLN is positive and an ALND is omitted. In the modern era, systemic therapy could further decrease the risk of local/regional recurrences. After the subanalysis of the POSNOC (POsitive Sentinel NOde: adjuvant therapy alone versus adjuvant therapy plus Clearance or axillary radiotherapy), SERC (Sentinelle Envahiet Randomisation du Curage), and Dutch BOOG (BOrstkanker Onderzoek Groep) trials, a prediction model might be established to identify those patients who could beneft from no axillary management as a guide to clinical practice. At present, axillary management should still be required for patients with SLN micrometastases.

TI  - Evolution of the northern Fujian coast under the impact of natural and anthropogenic forces, 1976-2017: an analysis of coastal monitoring and satellite images
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The province of Fujian on China's southeast coast is severely impacted by typhoons. Based on coastal profile monitoring and 40 years of satellite data, this paper analyzed the response of coastal profiles to natural and anthropogenic forces along the northern part of Fujian's coast. Results indicated that the pattern of coastal evolution differed largely on cross-shore profiles and longshore coastlines. Only a few sandy coasts were severely affected by extreme weather events in summer, such as typhoons and storm surges, which may result from the wind direction relative to the coast. The cross-shore profiles changed drastically while the mean high-water coastline remained stable. In contrast, anthropogenic forces had a dual effect due to artificial sand extraction and reclamation. Artificial sand extraction usually occurred on sandy coasts, resulting in a decrease in some local surface profiles of tens of centimeters to metres in two years. Reclamation had the main impact on muddy coasts, especially in bays, causing seaward progradation during the past 40 years. The impacts of human activities on muddy coasts were far greater than natural factors. Findings from our coastal monitoring study for both sandy and muddy coasts provide an important scientific basis for practical applications, such as Fujian coastal protection, coastal zone exploitation, and utilization planning.

TI  - The inextricable link between sport and the press in the Victorian era: the example of the 'Sentinel Cup'
T2  - SPORT IN HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - During the Victorian era sport underwent what has been described by academics as a 'revolution'. What began the nineteenth century as largely informal, recreational pastimes with few written rules and a small commercial fringe was transformed into a codified, commercialised, mass-spectator entertainment industry. During this period an inextricable link developed between sport and the press and both became mutually beneficial; sport provided a continuous conveyor belt of content for journalists to report whilst newspapers provided enhanced publicity and exposure in return. However, the press were not merely commentators and observers of sport and several publications took a more central role in its development and organisation. This is exemplified by the Staffordshire Sentinel, a regional newspaper that circulated across North Staffordshire and South Cheshire, which established the self-titled 'Sentinel Cup' in 1892. The competition was officially created to develop junior association football in the region, although key stakeholders also had other alternative motives, and it has been contested for 125 consecutive years, making it the longest continuous football cup in Britain. This paper uses the 'Sentinel Cup' as an exemplar of how the press became increasingly involved in sport during the Victorian era and explores the competition's inauguration.

TI  - Comparison of Office and Field Techniques for Validating Landscape Change Classification in Pacific Northwest National Parks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the feasibility of using aerial photo-based office methods rather than field-collected data to validate Landsat-based change detection products in national parks in Washington State. Landscape change was performed using LandTrendr algorithm. The resulting change patches were labeled in the office using aerial imagery and a random sample of patches was visited in the field by experienced analysts. Comparison of the two labels and associated confidence shows that the magnitude or severity of the change is a strong indicator of whether field assessment is warranted, and that confusion about patches with lower magnitude changes is not always resolved with a field visit. Our work demonstrates that validation of Landsat-derived landscape change patches can be done using office based tools such as aerial imagery, and that such methods provide an adequate validation for most change types, thus reducing the need for expensive field visits.

TI  - Influence of climate, post-treatment weather extremes, and soil factors on vegetation recovery after restoration treatments in the southwestern US
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Understanding the conditions associated with dryland vegetation recovery after restoration treatments is challenging due to a lack of monitoring data and high environmental variability over time and space. Tracking recovery trajectories with satellite-based vegetation indices can strengthen predictions of restoration outcomes across broad areas with varying environmental conditions. Location Southwestern United States. Methods We quantified the recovery trajectories of spring and summer soil-adjusted total vegetation index (SATVI) for 5-10 year periods following post-wildfire seeding or prescribed burns for 241 treatment sites and related SATVI to ground-based vegetation cover. We modeled SATVI based on time since treatment, yearly temperature and precipitation, weather extremes following treatment, soil available water capacity, invasive species presence, and treatment type. We also tested for the effects of environmental variables on trajectories, by examining interactions with years post-treatment. Results Ground-based vegetation cover and SATVI were highly correlated. Most treatment sites had positive recovery rates for spring (82%) and summer (85%) SATVI. Several environmental variables affected vegetation recovery trajectories as indicated by interactions with time since treatment. Yearly warm season precipitation had a positive effect on SATVI recovery that increased over time, whereas the positive effect of extreme high warm season precipitation following treatment decreased over time for both seasons of vegetation measurements. For spring SATVI, the positive effect of cool season yearly precipitation increased over time while the negative effect of extreme high temperatures following treatment became more negative over time. Invasive species presence led to higher spring, but not summer, SATVI. Conclusions Satellite-based remote sensing is a promising tool to assess vegetation recovery following restoration treatments, particularly when it is combined with ground-based monitoring. Our results suggest that weather extremes following restoration treatments can affect vegetation recovery trajectories and may be considered in management decisions such as the timing of restoration treatments.

AB  - The 2014-2015 eruption at Holuhraun has produced more than 1.5 km(3) of basaltic magma and can be considered one of the major effusive events of the last two centuries in the world. During this eruption the MIROVA system (a volcanic hot-spot detection system based on MODIS middle infrared - MIR - data) has been used to detect and locate the active portions of the lava flow(s), and to measure the heat radiated by the growing lava field. According to these data the eruption was characterized by a slow decay of the radiant power, accompanied by a change in the lava transport mechanism that shifted from open channels, at the beginning of the eruption, to lava tubes, during the last months of activity. Despite the evident evolution of lava transport mechanism, we found that the overall decreasing trend of the thermal flux was mainly controlled by the exponential decline of lava discharge rates, while the increasing insulation of the flow field had a strong impact in transporting efficiently the lava at the distal flow front(s). Our results suggest the apparent time averaged lava discharge rates (TADR), derived from satellite thermal data, may fluctuate around the real effusion rate at the vent, especially in the case of large lava flows emplacing in nearly flat conditions. The magnitude and frequency of these fluctuations are mainly controlled by the emplacement dynamic, (i.e. occurrence of distinct major flow units), while the transition from channel- to tube-fed lava transport mechanism play only a minor role (+/- 30%) in the retrieval of TADR using MIR data. When the TADR values are integrated to calculate erupted lava volumes, the effects of pulsating emplacement dynamic become smoothed and the eruptive trend become more clear. We suggest that during the Holuhraun's eruption, as well as during many other effusive eruptions, the MIR-derived radiant flux essentially mimic the overall trend of lava discharge rates, with only a minor influence due to the emplacement style and evolving eruptive conditions. From a monitoring and operational perspective, MIROVA demonstrates to be a very valuable tool to follow and, possibly, forecast the evolution of on-going effusive eruptions.

AB  - In this work data observed by the geostationary MSG-SEVIRI and the polar NASA-Terra/AquaMODIS orbiting satellite instruments, have been used for the proximal and distal monitoring of the 24-30 December 2018 Etna eruption. The combined use of the SEVIRI high repetition time and the MODIS high spatial resolution allows a reliable near real time volcanic characterization from the source to the atmosphere. For the proximal monitoring the parameters estimated are the eruption starts and duration and the volcanic plume top height, while the distal monitoring was inverted relying on the determination of the volcanic cloud altitude and the ash/SO2 retrievals. Achieved products were validated by comparing these results with those observed remotely by ground based networks.Results obtained in this study show the ability of satellite-based systems to entirely follow eruptive events in near real time, offering a powerful tool to mitigate volcanic risk on both local population and airspace.

AB  - This study applied Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) to estimate terrain displacements using four Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). The InSAR workflow was implemented in a region located at southwestern of Colombia. The radar images were processed using ESA's SNAP Toolbox, varying a DEM at the stages back-geocoding, topographic phase removal, and geometric correction. A SLC IW TOPSAR Sentinel-1 A/B radar images were analyzed between October 2014 and November 2016 for 51-A and between October 2016 and March 2017 for S-1B. Four SLC pairs were selected with the smaller perpendicular and temporal baseline for the displacement estimation. The work process implemented was, co-registering, interferogram formation, topographic phase removal, filtering, unwrapping phase and geocoding. The DEMs, SRTM3 (3 arc-second resolution), SRTM1 (1 arc-second resolution), PALSAR-RTC data and interpolation of contour lines at the scale of 1:25K (Topo-map) were used. Exploratory, paired-means and ANOVA analysis allowed to compare the distributions. Likewise, Principal Components Analysis method allowed establishing the relationship between the InSAR parameters - phase, coherence, unwrapped phase, and the displacement -. This analysis was complemented by Logistic Regression methods and Weight of Evidence. As a result of this study, we confirmed an inverse relationship between the unwrapped phase and displacement. Also, the coherence estimated from the four DEMs is highly correlated with the Colombian Geological Service landslide inventory. By WofE analysis, we found that coherence values between 0.43 and 0.67 are significantly related to landslide inventory, as well as displacement values between 0.14 and 0.19 m.

TI  - WAITING FOR "INSTITUTIONAL" MONITORING SERVICES OF RICE CROPS BY REMOTE SENSING: IS CADASTRAL PARCEL THE PROPER REFERENCE GEOMETRY?
T2  - EARTH OBSERVATION ADVANCEMENTS IN A CHANGING WORLD
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Monitoring of agricultural areas in Europe is generally operated at cadastral parcel level. Nevertheless, especially in Italy, many parcels are internally inconsistent in terms of crop type or management techniques. In this work, based on free satellite data (Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2), authors tested differences between a parcel- and segment-based approach for rice monitoring. Consequently, ordinary cadastre-based tessellation scheme was compared with a different one obtained by image segmentation operating in the multitemporal NDVI spectral domain. With reference to these two approaches, the available time series of spectral measures (NDVI and NDWI) were processed aggregating spectral information at parcel and segment level by averaging. NDI and NDWI differences were tested computing: a) MAE(x, y)(t) to measure the "average" spectral difference over the scene at the generic date; it was intended to explore seasonality of differences; b) MAE(t)(x,y) to measure the average local spectral difference along time; it was intended to explore spatial distribution of differences. The analysis concerned the 2016 rice growing season in the study area (Piemonte Region, NW Italy). Differences proved to be significant and seasonal showing that, if not considered, can lead to wrong deductions concerning both area computations (important for CAP payments) and time of water releases. Authors retain that this approach should be mandatory for whatever institutional remote sensing driven service aimed at monitoring crops at regional level. Once more, it is clear that standardized and certified procedures are presently needed to make the ongoing technology transfer reliable and robust for Institutional Administrators.

TI  - Care Escalation: Teaching Residents How to Effectively Communicate Patient Care Concerns.
T2  - MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction: Care escalation for patients at risk of deterioration requires that care team members are able to effectively communicate patient care concerns to more senior team members. However, multiple factors inhibit residents from escalating their concerns, which contributes to treatment delays and sentinel events.Methods: We developed and implemented an annual 1- and 2-hour escalation curriculum for senior pediatric residents from the University of Colorado. The curriculum consisted of case presentations (one for the 1-hour or two for the 2-hour session), lecture, large-group discussion, and small-group activities. Faculty and fellows facilitated small groups, in which barriers to care escalation and specific tools for effective escalation were discussed. We administered precurriculum surveys for resident self-reflection and postcurriculum surveys for curriculum evaluation.Results: The curriculum was delivered to 179 residents over 3 years (2016-2018). Surveys were administered during the first 2 years, and 87% of participants completed pre- and postcurriculum surveys. Of all respondents, 88% believed that the curriculum helped them recognize care escalation barriers, and 85% believed that they learned skills for effective escalation. Resident comfort in asking for attending physician help improved from 52% to 95% (p < .001). Analysis of postsurvey open-ended responses indicated that residents valued listening to faculty share their personal experiences of escalating care.Discussion: The development and implementation of a curriculum to improve resident comfort and perceived ability to escalate patient care concerns are feasible and effective. Further work is needed to evaluate the impact of this curriculum in the clinical setting.

TI  - Loving Kindness and Mercy: their Human and Cosmic Significance
T2  - PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper starts by examining the language used in some well known scriptural passages where the importance of mercy or compassion is stressed. Such passages underline the ethical importance of a direct, physically and emotionally involved response. This leads on to a critique of the shortcomings of approaches to ethics which advocate the impersonal promotion of welfare; our lives as ethical beings depend intimately on the immediate responses arising from our encounters with others in our day-to-day lives. The paper then further explores the special status of loving kindness and mercy in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, and argues that secular ethical systems, whether grounded in human nature or in the supposed requirements of rationality, are unlikely to be able to underwrite this kind of status. The final section reflects further on the 'cosmic' significance of love in a theistic worldview.

AB  - The assessment of yield variability at the territory scale is often difficult due to the lack of knowledge on various factors involved, e.g., the agricultural practices of farmers and phenological calendars. Remote sensing can help to provide precise and timely information on crops particularly with the unprecedented amount of free Sentinel data within the Copernicus programme. This study focuses on the evaluation of the contribution of the new Sentinel 2 data to provide phenological information on rice cropping systems in the Camargue region in the South-Eastern France. Dense time series of data acquired at high spatial resolution (10m) were analyzed for 2016 and 2017 and were used to map rice, compute Leaf Area Index. Various methods combining remote sensing information were compared with two different crop models (STICS and SAFY) to assess the yields. The performances are discussed according to surveys made with farmers.

AB  - In the global change context, an efficient management of the available resources has become one of the most important topic particularly for sustainable crop development. Many questions concern the evolution of the rice farming systems in Camargue, in the Southeastern France, which play a crucial role to control the soil salinity and whose the surfaces significantly decreased these last years from 20 000 ha in 2010 to around 14000 ha in 2014. The arrival of the new satellites Sentinel makes it possible to evaluate these crop evolutions. The objectives of this study were to propose operational methodologies to: 1) accurately assess the surfaces of the main crops, rice, wheat and grassland in 2016 and 2017 from classifications based on multispectral data, (2) map some agricultural practices (sowing and harvest residue burning), and (3) elaborate a farm typology for the Camargue region based on variables computed from remote sensing data to better understand the farmer strategies.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY BRACHYTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Breast-conserving treatment (BCT) have emerged as an alternative to mastectomy in patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). We evaluated survival outcomes and treatment-related toxicity in a series of 40 patients with IBTR, who underwent tumorectomy plus interstitial brachytherapy (APBI) as a salvage treatment.Material and methods: Retrospective analysis included 40 patients diagnosed with IBTR and treated with intraoperative (26 patients) or post-operative (14 patients) multicatheter brachytherapy for APBI at our institution between June 2002 and October 2017. We assessed cosmesis, toxicity, overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS).Results: Tumorectomy was performed in all cases, including intraoperative tumor margin assessment and sentinel node biopsy. Median age was 65 years (range, 41-92). The total prescribed dose was 32 Gy (8 fractions) in 19 patients and 34 Gy (10 fractions) in 20 patients. One elderly patient (age 92) received a single fraction of 16 Gy. Median follow-up was 61.5 months (range, 6-153). A median of 14 tubes were inserted. Mean treated V-100 was 115(cc). Two patients developed a second relapse at 3 and 5 years after salvage treatment: one patient underwent salvage mastectomy and remains alive 10 years after brachytherapy, and the second one developed both local relapse and bone metastasis. The disease is stable at present. Five-year OS and CSS rates were 85.3% and 97.5%, respectively. Two patients died from cancer-related causes. Acute and late toxicity rates were low; seven patients developed acute infectious mastitis. Late fibrosis > grade 3 and late mastitis were observed in 14 and 6 cases, respectively.Conclusions: Second BCT with APBI as a salvage treatment in ipsilateral breast recurrence achieves good local disease control, with a satisfactory toxicity profile compared to mastectomy. This approach seems to be safe and effective, although more data from randomized trials are needed.

CP  - Combined Otolaryngology Sections Meeting
CL  - National Harbor, MD
AB  - Objectives Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been shown to be an accurate technique for staging the neck in early-stage oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) and has been incorporated in treatment guidelines as an option instead of elective neck dissection (END). However, utilization of SLNB in the United States remains unclear, and existing prospective studies did not directly compare survival between SLNB and END. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with stage I to II OCSCC (cT1-2cN0cM0) who underwent staging of the neck in the National Cancer Data Base from 2012 to 2015. We compared the practice patterns and outcomes of patients who underwent SLNB versus END. Results We identified 8,328 eligible patients with a median follow-up of 35.4 months. SLNB was used for 240 patients, or 2.9% of stage I to II OCSCC. Completion neck dissection was avoided in 63.8% of patients undergoing SLNB. SLNB was associated with reduced perioperative morbidity, with median length of hospital stay of 1.0 days versus 3.0 days after END (P < 0.001). Perioperative 30-day mortality was 0% after SLNB versus 0.7% after END (P = 0.42). Overall 3-year survival was 82.0% after SLNB and 77.5% after END (P = 0.40). After adjustment, overall survival was equivalent between patients who underwent SLNB versus END (adjusted hazard ratio 1.03, confidence interval 0.67-1.59). Conclusions SLNB for stage I to II OCSCC is associated with reduced length of hospital stay and equivalent overall survival compared with END. Despite these attributes, SLNB remains rarely used in the United States.

AB  - Gene expression monitoring within whole plants is critical for many applications ranging from plant biology to biofuel development. Herein, we report a unique multimodal method for in vivo imaging and biosensing of nucleic acid biotargets, specifically microRNA, within whole plant leaves by integrating three complementary techniques: surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and plasmonics-enhanced two-photon luminescence (TPL). The method described utilizes plasmonic nanostar-based inverse molecular sentinel (iMS) nanoprobes, which not only provide large Raman signal enhancement upon target binding, but also allow for localization and quantification by XRF and plasmonics-enhanced TPL. This report lays the foundation for the use of plasmonic nanoprobes for in vivo functional imaging of nucleic acid biotargets in whole plants.

AB  - The ability to monitor gene expression within living plants is of importance in many applications ranging from plant biology research to biofuel development; however, no method currently exists without requiring sample extraction. Herein, we report a multimodal imaging method based on plasmonic nanoprobes for in vivo imaging and biosensing of microRNA biotargets within whole plant leaves. This method integrates three different but complementary techniques: surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and plasmonics-enhanced two-photon luminescence (TPL). The multimodal method utilizes plasmonic nanostars, which not only provide large Raman signal enhancement, but also allow for localization and quantification by XRF and plasmonics-enhanced TPL, owing to gold content and high two-photon luminescence cross-sections. For the sensing mechanism, inverse molecular sentinel (iMS) nanoprobes are used for SERS bioimaging of microRNA within Arabidopsis thaliana leaves to provide a dynamic SERS map of detected microRNA targets while also quantifying nanoprobe concentrations using XRF and TPL. This report lays the foundation for the use of plasmonic nanoprobes for in vivo functional imaging of nucleic acid biotargets in whole plants, a tool that will allow the study of these biotargets with previously unmet spatial and temporal resolution.

AB  - Development of simple techniques for detection of nucleic acids is essential for clinical diagnostics. MicroRNA (miRNA) have been identified as potential biomarkers in early detection of various diseases, including esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and Barrett's esophagus (BE). However, these small molecules have not been adopted into clinical practice because of challenging aspects in the lab. The technology described herein is a label-free nanoprobe referred to as "inverse molecular sentinel" (iMS) for gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection. The results of this study provide evidence supporting the robust iMS method for miRNA sensing without the need for PCR.

TI  - Virtual Healing: Militarizing the Psyche in Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy
T2  - TELEVISION & NEW MEDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the use of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) to treat combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder. In this therapeutic practice, patients wear a head-mounted virtual reality display and enter a simulation designed to incarnate their triggering memories. VRET visualizes the formerly invisible site of psychotherapy, achieving a medical aspiration that has been pursued since the turn of the twentieth century. This visualization subjects therapy to a mode of surveillance and mediates the conditions in which trauma is processed. In this article, I consider how VRET's user interfaces produce feelings of agency that reconfigure how power is distributed at the scene of therapy. I situate this novel practice at the intersection of two technological histories: the industrial history of the military-entertainment complex that spawned VRET, and the theoretical history that unites psychoanalysis and computation in their mutual ambition to formalize thought. Contending that neither of these histories can be disarticulated from the violent projects they have sustained, I interrogate the politics of a practice that visualizes and virtualizes psychotherapy, arguing that VRET processes trauma according to a militarized worldview.

AB  - A major issue affecting optical imagery is the presence of clouds. The need of cloud-free scenes at specific date is crucial in a number of operational monitoring applications. On the other hand, the cloud-insensitive SAR sensors are a solid asset and they provide orthogonal information with respect to optical satellite, that enable the retrieval of information lost in optical images due to cloud cover. In the context of an increasing availability of both optical and SAR images, thank to the Sentinel constellation, we propose a deep learning method to reconstruct (gap-fill) optical data, polluted by cloud phenomena, exploiting multi-temporal SAR and optical images.

AB  - Vegetation indexes (VIs) Time-Series (TS) data can be used to deliver in-season yield forecasts and to extract key phenological metrics. The present work addresses the TS analysis of different VIs, obtained from Sentinel 2 data for the 2015-17 growing seasons, for yield assessment and for the determination of the beginning of the reproductive stage (silking) of maize seed crops cultivated in the Po plain. Yields (expressed as green ears weight and grain weight) and silking dates (DoY - Day of Year) were collected for 17 maize seed crops (2 crops for the 2015 growing season, 11 for 2016, 4 for 2017) and correlated with different temporal parameters extracted from VIs' field average TS by fitting different functions (Gaussian, Asymmetric Gaussian, Double Logistic, Double Sigmoid and Growth function). Extracted parameters included large integrals and small integrals between the fitted curve and the Greenness baseline as determined by the tangent at the first inflection point or by an arbitrary VI threshold. Results showed best linear correlations of yields with the small integrals of EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) field average TS, fitted by the Gaussian function and with an arbitrary EVI threshold in the 0.15-0.25 range. The date of maximum Green-up at the first inflection point of the Double Logistic fitting was the best silking date estimator, regardless of the VI used.

TI  - Neonatal iron distribution and infection susceptibility in full term, preterm and low birthweight babies in urban Gambia: study protocol for an observational study.
T2  - Gates open research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Neonatal infection is the third largest cause of death in children under five worldwide. Nutritional immunity is the process by which the host innate immune system limits nutrient availability to invading organisms. Iron is an essential micronutrient for both microbial pathogens and their mammalian hosts. Changes in iron availability and distribution have significant effects on pathogen virulence and on the immune response to infection. Our previously published data shows that, during the first 24 hours of life, full-term neonates have reduced overall serum iron. Transferrin saturation decreases rapidly from 45% in cord blood to ~20% by six hours post-delivery. Methods: To study neonatal nutritional immunity and its role in neonatal susceptibility to infection, we will conduct an observational study on 300 full-term normal birth weight (FTB+NBW), 50 preterm normal birth weight (PTB+NBW), 50 preterm low birth weight (PTB+LBW) and 50 full-term low birth weight (FTB+LBW), vaginally-delivered neonates born at Kanifing General Hospital, The Gambia. We will characterize and quantify iron-related nutritional immunity during the early neonatal period and use ex vivo sentinel bacterial growth assays to assess how differences in serum iron affect bacterial growth. Blood samples will be collected from the umbilical cord (arterial and venous) and at serial time points from the neonates over the first week of life. Discussion: Currently, little is known about nutritional immunity in neonates. In this study, we will increase understanding of how nutritional immunity may protect neonates from infection during the first critical days of life by limiting the pathogenicity and virulence of neonatal sepsis causing organisms by reducing the availability of iron. Additionally, we will investigate the hypothesis that this protective mechanism may not be activated in preterm and low birth weight neonates, potentially putting these babies at an enhanced risk of neonatal infection.

AB  - High-resolution soil moisture dataset is important for studying cold and humid temperate forest climates, estimating forest carbon emissions and storage, and identifying the influence of water circulation and global change in Genhe area. Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an important vegetation biophysical variable and has been widely used for analysis of the vegetation biomass, land-surface process simulation, and many other global change studies. This paper based on LAI from Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS), microwave polarization difference index (MPDI) from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L band Brightness Temperature (TB), and synthetic Land Surface Temperature (LST) from combine AMSR-2 TB and MODIS LST data proposed a downscaling method for SMAP L3 soil moisture product. Using the multiple linear regression method, we obtained 1km spatial resolution of soil moisture data in Genhe area. The results showed that downscaling SMAP soil moisture can present more details than before with low errors.

AB  - Ship detection is an important application in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image. A novel saliency detector for PolSAR ship detection has been proposed in this work, which considers ship targets as salient candidates from sea clutter in low and medium sea conditions. Firstly, the similarity test based on polarimetric covariance matrix is applied on each pixel within its neighborhood. Then, saliency feature named Similar Pixel Number (SPN) is generated by calculating the similar samples within its neighborhood. Finally, ship targets can be obtained through proper thresholding procedure and morphological filtering. Experimental studies with two Radarsat-2 datasets validate the advantages of the proposed method.

AB  - Soil moisture is a key variable in the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. Long time series of and spatio-temporal continuous soil moisture is of great importance to meteorological and hydrological applications, such as weather forecasting, global change and drought monitoring. In this study, the Essential Climate Variable (ECV) soil moisture product of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2002 to 2015 was reconstructed using the General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) based on reconstructed MODIS products, i.e., LST, NDVI, and Albedo. Results show that the ECV soil moisture could be well reconstructed with R-2 higher than 0.71, RMSE less than 0.05 cm(3) cm(-3) and absolute Bias less than 0.03 cm(3) cm(-3) for both grids of 0.25 degrees x0.25 degrees and 1 degrees x1 degrees, compared with the in-situ measurements in 2012 over the TP. The reconstructed long time series of and spatio-temporal continuous soil moisture could be valuable in hydrometeorological studies of the TP.

AB  - Vegetation biophysical parameter retrieval is an important earth remote sensing system application. In this paper, we studied the potential impact of the addition of new spectral bands in the red edge region in future Landsat satellites on agroecosystem canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) retrieval. The test data were simulated from SPARC '03 field campaign HyMap hyperspectral data. Two retrieval approaches were tested: empirical regression based on vegetation index (VI) and physical model-based look-up-table (LUT) inversion. The results of both approaches showed that a potential new spectral band located between the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) red and NIR bands slightly improved the agroecosystem CCC retrieval accuracy (R-2 of 0.853 vs. 0.875 for vegetation index approach, 0.500 vs. 0.570 for LUT inversion approach).

AB  - Agricultural productivity, and yield quantity are depended on climate, soil characteristics, and use of the factors of production. Agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, irrigation, seeds, pesticides, and farmers' skills also influence farm productivity. Precision agriculture is a new farming management approach, where farmers capture and analyze data in order to optimize inputs and practices for best outcomes. This data then guides decisions on which crop to plant or when and where to apply fertilizer, agrochemicals, or water. As a result, farmers can optimize the use of inputs, making maximum use of the little resources they have. Improving the production capacity of agriculture in Turkey through productivity increases is an important policy goal where agriculture represents an essential sector in the economy. In recent years, projects and research is focused on the precision agriculture sectors in order to increase farmer's income. Research supported by GAP regional development administration is conducting at the South Eastern Anatolia Region for extensification of precision agricultural applications. In the research, spatial and remote sensing data were integrated in order to analysis field. Spatial variation of soil properties is most important in precision agriculture that affecting the crop yields. In the project, detailed soil mapping, at 1:10.000 scale, was completed containing all soil characteristics and productivity map in GIS.

AB  - The present work exploits multi-frequency SAR and optical imagery in order to assess soil and vegetation water content values in agricultural areas in Italy and Argentina. Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ALOS-2, RADARSAT-2, and COSMO-SkyMed imagery were used in a retrieval algorithm based on Support Vector Machine (SVR) approach. Preliminary results indicate that the integration of optical and SAR data (C and L band) by the mean of machine learning techniques leads to an accurate retrieval of soil moisture (RMSE = 4%). Moreover, a preliminary test for the retrieval of Vegetation Water Content (VWC) indicates that ALOS-2 L-Band backscattering, combined with L-Band simulated backscattering, leads to a reliable model to compute VWC, without any optical information.

TI  - PARENTS' ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE INTRODUCTION OF INFORMATICS AS A COMPULSORY SUBJECT IN PRIMARY EDUCATION IN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - For about 25 years the subject Informatics used to be only an elective subject in the primary education in the Republic of Croatia. It was offered to students from the 5th to the 8th grade (ages 11 to 14). Because it was only an elective subject it was possible that some students did not attend any classes in that subject. After finishing their primary education, such students were formally computer and information illiterate.Since the end of 2014 in the Republic of Croatia there has been an organized government effort to reform and improve not only the curriculum of the subject Informatics, but also curricula in other subjects in the primary and secondary education. One of the goals is to introduce more problemsolving teaching methods and skills and to reduce learning and memorizing the facts.This effort became known as The Complete Curricular Reform (Croatian: Cjelovita kurikularna reforma). After the first successful results in the development of the new curriculum in 2016, the parliamentary elections were held which resulted in the change of the government. Despite these changes, the curricular reform has been continuing today under the new name The School for Life (Croatian: Skola za zivot). However, since this project has a significant importance and influence on the nation's primary and secondary education curricula, after the parliamentary elections the politics got even more involved, with some political parties supporting the reform and some not because of their worldview differences on some subjects. It seems that the public support for the curricular reform is split as well.Since students' parents are a part of the public to whom the quality of education is most important, the authors have decided to explore their attitudes towards the introduction of the subject Informatics as a compulsory subject in the primary education.In March 2018, six months before the new curriculum had been introduced to the primary education, the authors conducted a research study on parents' attitudes towards the introduction of Informatics as a compulsory subject in the primary education. In this paper they present some of the results of that research study.The results of the research conducted on a sample of 410 parents (N=410) show that 89% of the surveyed parents either agree or totally agree with the introduction of Informatics as a compulsory subject in the primary education. Other results have shown that there is no statistically significant correlation between the parents' age and their attitudes towards the introduction of Informatics as a compulsory subject. There is no correlation between the parents' level of education and their attitude towards the introduction of Informatics as a compulsory subject as well.The results show that parents, as the members of the public, are well aware of the importance of the subject Informatics for their children's education and that most of them support the introduction of Informatics as a compulsory subject in the new curriculum for the primary education in the Republic of Croatia.In September 2018, the Ministry of Science and Education of the Republic of Croatia introduced the new curriculum in the primary education. The subject Informatics became the compulsory subject in grades 5 and 6 (ages 11-12).

AB  - The BELCAM webplatform (www.belcam.info) provides to Belgian farmers a set of innovative products and services, mainly derived from the ESA Copernicus programme, allowing to improve daily management of parcels and subsequently the durability of agricultural practices.The products and the services freely available on the BELCAM webplatform have been selected based on continuous interactions with farmers and extension services. They are focused on the monitoring of crops growth and on the optimal management of nitrogen inputs. The BELCAM webplatform also provides meteorological observations and weather forecasts as well as yield estimations. Three crops are currently concerned: winter wheat, maize and potato.By allowing to exchange in near real-time information and feedbacks between farmers and scientists ('farmsourcing'), the collaborative BELCAM webplatform is continuously improved. Farmers become not only users but also actors of the research conducted for them.

T2  - EUROPEAN SURGICAL RESEARCH

AB  - Sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) may play a significant role in future delivery of colon cancer surgery because of an increase in early-stage, node-negative disease due to national bowel cancer screening programmes. Traditionally, colon lymphatic drainage has not been thought relevant as the operative approach cannot be tailored. Recent advances in local and endoscopic risk-reducing interventions for colonic malignancy have caused a rethink in approach. SLNM was initially attempted with blue dye techniques with limited success. Technological improvement has allowed surgeons to use near-infrared (NIR) light and NIR active tracers such as indocyanine green. This review provides an overview of the current status of intraoperative lymph node mapping in the colon, identifies challenges to the delivery of the techniques, and discusses potential solutions that may help SLNM play a role in improving the delivery of surgical care for patients with colon cancer.

AB  - Environmentally Assisted Fatigue (EAF) is receiving nowadays an increased level of attention for existing Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) as utilities are now working to extend their life. In the wake of numerous experimental fatigue tests carried out in air and also in a PWR environment, the French RCC-M code [1] has recently been amended (in its 2016 edition) with two Rules in Probatory Phase (RPP), equivalent to ASME code-cases, "RPP-2" and "RPP-3" [2] [3]. RPP-2 consists of an update of the design fatigue curve in air for stainless steels (SSs) and nickel-based alloys, and is also associated with RPP-3 which provides guidelines for incorporating the environmental penalty "Fen" factor in fatigue usage factor calculations.Alongside this codification effort, an EAF screening has recently been carried out within EDF DT [4] on various areas of the primary circuit of the 900 MWe plants of the EDF fleet. This screening led to the identification of a list of 35 "sentinel locations" which are defined as areas most prone to EAF degradation process. These locations will be subjected to detailed EAF analysis in the stress report calculations (according to the above-mentioned RCC-M code cases) for the fourth decennial inspection of the 900 MWe (VD4 900 MWe) power plants.The potential impact of EAF on the secondary circuit components is another question to address in anticipation of the VD4 900 MWe, as they may be considered as class 1 or class 2 equipment for RCC-M application according to the equipment specification. This paper presents the approach proposed by EDF towards an exemption of environmental effects consideration for secondary circuit components. The argument is first based on a review of experimental campaigns led in Japan and France (respectively on fatigue test specimens and at the component scale) which indicate a Dissolved Oxygen (DO) content threshold below which environmental effects are almost inexistent. The (conservative) value of 40 ppb has been selected consistently with NUREG/CR-6909 revision 0 [5]. The second part of the argument is built, on the one hand, on the analysis of the EDF Technical Specifications for Operation (STE) which narrows the scope of the study only to unit outages, and, on the other hand, on the analysis of 5 years of operations of all 900 MWe plants of the EDF fleet (equivalent to 170 reactor-years). It has been shown that the DO content rarely exceeded the 40 ppb threshold in the secondary coolant, and that in this case, the considered locations were not submitted to any fatigue loading.

AB  - The GOES-16 satellite was launched on 19 Nov 2016, and it became operational as the GOES-East satellite on 18 Dec 2017. The GOES-17 satellite was launched on 1 Mar 2018, and it became the GOES-West operational satellite on 12 Feb 2019. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is one of six instruments onboard GOES-16 and -17. ABI has 16 spectral bands, a spatial resolution of 0.5 km to 2.0 km, and five times the temporal coverage of the previous GOES Imager series of sensors. The Radiometric Calibration Test Site (RadCaTS) is an automated facility at Railroad Valley, Nevada, USA, which contains ground based instruments that measure the surface reflectance and atmosphere throughout the day. It was developed by the Remote Sensing Group (RSG) of the James C. Wyant College of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona, and it is currently used to monitor such low Earth orbit (LEO) sensors as Landsat-7 ETM+, Landsat-8 OLI, Terra and Aqua MODIS, Sentinel-2A and -2B MSI, Sentinel-3A and -3B OLCI and SLSTR, and others. The improved spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics of ABI create an excellent opportunity to intercompare results obtained from a geosynchronous sensor to those obtained from typical LEO sensors. This work describes current efforts to validate the radiometric calibration of ABI as well as perform an intercomparison with various LEO sensors.

AB  - This paper describes the winning contribution to the 2019 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest Multi-view Semantic Stereo Challenge. In this challenge, a digital surface model (DSM) and a semantic segmentation should be derived from a large number of multi-spectral WorldView-3 images. Results from 50 stereo pairs matched using Semi-Global Matching (SGM) are fused into a DSM. Semantic segmentation is performed with an ensemble of FCN networks taking as input RGB, multi-spectral and height data. Their results are then merged with pixel-wise detectors for the classes water and high vegetation. Compared to the second and third placed teams (mIOU-3 scores of 0.73 and 0.7295), our contribution reached a significantly higher score of 0.745.

AB  - In August 2009, Typhoon Morakot caused a record-breaking rainfall in Taiwan. The heavy rainfall triggered thousands of landslides, in particular in the central-southern part of the island. Large landslides can block rivers and can lead to the formation of landslide-dammed lakes. Cascading hazards like floods and debris flows after landslide dam breaches pose a high risk for people and infrastructure downstream. Thus, better knowledge about landslides that significantly impact the channel system and about the resulting landslide-dammed lakes are key elements for assessing the direct and indirect hazards caused by the moving mass. The main objectives of this study are 1) to develop an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach for semi-automated detection of landslides that caused the formation of landslide-dammed lakes and 2) to monitor the evolution of landslide-dammed lakes based on Landsat imagery. For landslide and lake mapping, primarily spectral indices and contextual information were used. By integrating morphological and hydrological parameters derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) into the OBIA framework, we automatically identified landslide-dammed lakes, and the landslides that likely caused the formation of those lakes, due to the input of large amounts of debris into the channel system. The proposed approach can be adapted to other remote sensing platforms and can be used to monitor the evolution of landslide-dammed lakes and triggering landslides at regional scale after typhoon and heavy rainstorm events within an efficient time range after suitable remote sensing data has been provided.

AB  - On July 7, 2018, a large landslide occurred at the eastern slope of the Fagraskogarfjall Mountain in Hitardalur valley in West Iceland. The landslide dammed the river, led to the formation of a lake and, consequently, to a change in the river course. The main focus of this research is to develop a knowledge-based expert system using an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach for identifying morphology changes caused by the Hitardalur landslide. We use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data, in particular from Sentinel-1/2 for detection of the landslide and its effects on the river system. We extracted and classified the landslide area, the landslide-dammed lake, other lakes and the river course using intensity information from S1 and spectral information from S2 in the object-based framework. Future research will focus on further developing this approach to support mapping and monitoring of the spatio-temporal dynamics of surface morphology in an object-based framework by combining SAR and optical data. The results can reveal details on the applicability of different remote sensing data for the spatio-temporal investigation of landslides, landslide-induced river course changes and lake formation and lead to a better understanding of the impact of large landslides on river systems.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scale is a critical factor when studying patterns and the processes that cause them. A variety of approaches have been used to define the concept of scale but confusion and ambiguities remain regarding scale types and their definitions. The objectives of this study were therefore (1) to review existing types and definitions of scale, and (2) to systematically investigate the ambiguities in scale definitions and to determine the applicability of the various scale types and definitions. Through a comprehensive literature review, we identified seven types of scales and designed a survey for the seven definitions of scale and interviewed 150 scientists. The results show that the more cartography related types of scale are relatively well known while the more abstract dimensions are less known and are most ambiguous. Based on graphical examples, participants were asked which spatial scales are most relevant for their work. Surprisingly, composite objects such as a forest stand were most relevant followed by individual objects such as single trees and, lastly, more generalized categorizes or meta-objects such as forested area. We have drawn some conclusions that will help to clarify the different types of scale in regard to their practical use.

AB  - The importance of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and water parameters for the structure and function of rivers and lake ecosystems has led to the development of a way to estimate the amount of CDOM, TP (total phosphorus) and TN (total nitrogen) in rivers and lakes over large geographic areas. Operational Land Imager (OLI) images have been obtained of the North and South Islands of New Zealand for the March 2014 and 2015, with in-situ measurements of bio-optical properties and the water parameters of 18 stations. Satellite images of the date closest to the water sampling were used to statistically correlate the in-situ measurements with various combinations of Landsat 8 bands in order to develop algorithms that best describe those relationships and calculate accurately the aforementioned water quality components. Optimal models were selected based on statistical criteria and indices; finally, the predictive models of CDOM, TP and TN concentrations involving the combination of ultra-blue (B1), blue (B2) and green (B3) OLI bands of Landsat 8 satellite sensor were achieved. As a result of the validation process, CDOM absorption at 420 nm (R = 0.35), TP (R = 0.57) and TN (R = 0.71) concentrations were shown to be the most accurately estimated components, respectively.

AB  - Vulnerability in agriculture is influenced, among others, by extended periods of water shortage in regions exposed to droughts. In order to assess irrigation water requirements, remote sensing (RS) techniques are integrated for the estimation and monitoring of cotton crop evapotranspiration ETc. Cotton fields in a small agricultural sub-catchment in Thessaly, Central Greece, are used as an experimental site. Daily meteorological data and weekly field data are recorded throughout seven (2004-2010) growing seasons for the computation of reference evapotranspiration ETo, crop coefficient K-c and cotton crop ETc based on conventional data, which are compared during the corresponding period with the satellite-based method (Landsat TM) for the estimation of cotton crop coefficient K-c and cotton crop ETc, which also delineates its spatiotemporal variability. The methodology is applied for monitoring K-c and ETc during growing season in the selected sub-catchment. Several error statistics are used showing very good agreement with ground-truth observations.

M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1960s, warming air and sea surface temperatures have led to decreasing sea ice extent and longer periods of open water in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA), together with changes in glacier discharge patterns. An important question, therefore, is whether there is a relationship between changing sea ice conditions, glacier dynamics, and iceberg production in this region. Using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (Radarsat-1, Radarsat-2, and ALOS PALSAR) and optical (Landsat 7 and 8) satellite imagery, iceberg plume events and sea ice break-up/freeze-up dates between 1997 and 2015 are investigated for 40 tidewater glaciers around the Prince of Wales (POW) Icefield, Ellesmere Island. Results show a clear relationship between the presence of sea ice and the production of icebergs, with similar to 49% of total iceberg plume events occurring during the 3-4 month long summer open water season and similar to 51% of events when sea ice was present the remaining 8-9 months of the year. There is no clear evidence of recent increases in iceberg production on a regional basis, but on a local, individual glacier scale there has been a connection between periods of increased iceberg plume events and: (a) acceleration in the surface velocity of Trinity and Wykeham glaciers; (b) increase in terminus retreat rates for glaciers which have not accelerated in flow speed over the past similar to 5-10 years. Comparisons with ocean temperature, surface air temperature from NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, and tidal data showed no clear relationship with iceberg plume events.

AB  - A preliminary tool for the identification of palaeoforms and forms attributable to archaeological emergencies in environmental context with high hydrogeological risk is proposed; in particular the study area represents one of the most characteristic phases of the Average Bronze Age (2000-1550 B.C.) in the Po fluvial plain: the "terramaricola" culture. The historical reconstruction and the geomorphological structure analysis took place using a methodological approach based on the analysis of optical and radar satellite data, in order to better understand the landscape forms and development. The methods utilized are photointerpretation and image processing of satellite data, with the aim of promoting the preservation and protection of cultural, historical and archaeological heritage. This methodological approach allows to produce useful data from a geo-archaeological reconstruction of the study area, which can assist the most traditional methods of research, such as archival documentation and cartography (historical and archaeological map). Moreover, the possibility to favor the communication with the public administrations to assist the land management in environmental monitoring and prevention of geological risk is added to the scientific interest.

The achievement of these challenges requires the realization of a continuous crop monitoring in the field to identify and forecast possible anomalies in plant growth and health status due to short- and long-term environmental constrictions (e.g. climate change). Several indicators are currently used to evaluate plant growth, based on in situ data collection or remote sensing. In this study, we propose a multi-scale approach to assess and interpret plant growth indicators in vineyard systems. We not only monitor plant growth and eco-physiology in-vivo during cultivation, but also reconstruct past eco-physiological behavior by transferring the approach of dendro-sciences, typical of the forest science domain, to viticulture. More specifically, we extract anatomical and stable isotope traits (linked with hydraulic and resource efficiency parameters) from tree-ring series to evaluate plant plasticity to past fluctuations in environmental conditions and to changes in the vineyard management. We also check whether the reconstructed eco-physiological behavior corresponds with the indexes obtained from the retrospective analysis of space-borne and UAVs data.

AB  - One of the main issues that concerns mankind today is the problem of domestic waste and how it affects climate change, air pollution and the environment. In the present work the heat pollution from the waste disposal site is tracked at various time points. The waste disposal site near Vidin was selected for the purpose of the research. Optical satellite data from the Sentinel 2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI) and synthetic - aperture radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel 1 platform of the Copernicus program of the European Space Agency were used. The Landsat 5-7 (ETM) and Landsat 8 (OLI / TIRS) sensors were used to calculate the surface thermal pollution of the waste disposal sites. Orthogonalization of satellite imagery was made to trace the dynamics of the main components of the Earth's surface - vegetation, moisture and soil. On this basis, a correlation is made to trace the link between the different components of the Earth's surface at different time points. Climate data on average air temperature, evapotranspiration, radiation and rainfall was used and a comparative analysis of surface temperature from landfill and climatic data was made.

AB  - The temperature of Earth's surface is one of the most frequently used parameters when researching chemical and physical processes and phenomena.This paper analyses temperature changes in some waste disposal sites (WDS) on the territory of Bulgaria and they are different according to their spatial distribution. The results for different points in time are obtained using remote sensing methods and GIS.Spectral reflectance characteristics of the WDS are used for the evaluation of these changes (collected through the satellite data by multispectral instrument (MSI) of the platform Sentinel 2 of the Copernicus program).The data evaluated is for average air temperature, evapotranspiration, radiation and rainfall. The heat thermal band of the sensors Landsat 5 - 7 (ETM) and Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) is used for the measurement of land surface temperature, especially the heat transfer from the WDS, as this band has a high spatial resolution and is suitable for the observation of the dynamics in the processes on surface of the Earth.The satellite images selected for this purpose are from different seasons in different years. A comparative analysis between the surface temperature of the WDS and the climate data used has been carried out. In order to trace the dynamics of the main components of the surface (vegetation, soil, moisture) the satellite images have been orthogonalised.

TI  - Characterization of surface currents from subsequent satellite images of organic slicks on the sea surface
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2019
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - The problem of characterization of marine currents using ocean remote sensing data is very challenging and has not been completely resolved by now. Optical and IR satellite images of the ocean have been traditionally used to estimate the current velocities when comparing color or temperature inhomogeneities in co-located subsequent scenes. SAR as all-weather and all-day instrument with high spatial resolution is very perspective for ocean remote sensing, and the procedure similar to the optical/IR observations seems to be usable for SAR for the current velocity estimation, too. Marine biogenic film slicks often observed on the sea surface as systems of "filamentary" structures at low/moderate wind conditions can be considered as appropriate features for marine current tracking. However, very few attempts have been made to study the current velocity field when studying slick features in SAR images acquired from different satellites at a comparably short time interval. In this paper two sequential satellite SAR images acquired with Envisat ASAR and ERS-2 SAR have been analyzed in order to estimate the surface marine currents. The acquisition time difference between the images was nearly 30 min. The images were characterized by a number of slick features which were nearly identical within the 30 min time shift, so that it was rather easy to track any chosen slick structure and to retrieve the velocity field. A Maximum Cross-Correlation ( MCC) method has been used for the current retrieval, when analyzing correlation between the sequential images. It has been obtained that for some slick filamentary structures or for their parts the retrieved current velocities were directed nearly along the filaments, so that the slicks can be considered as the current streamlines. On the contrary, for some other slicks the retrieved current velocity vectors were directed at quite large angles to the filament tangent lines. We believe that the latter effect appears for varying currents due to the "memory" of slicks which cannot change their orientation or appear/disappear instantaneously according to fast changes of environmental conditions, in particular according to wind speed velocity/direction changes.

M3  - Article
AB  - A methodology is presented for the estimation of the annual spatial distribution of solid precipitation using GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite data. The data are provided in the grid cells of 1 degrees (latitude and longitude) and allow calculating the water thickness changes near the Earth's surface including the snow cover water. The GRACE-based difference in water equivalent between the beginning and end of winter was found to be caused by both snow water and land surface characteristics which control the groundwater movement. The regularities revealed for the analyzed region and spatial detailing enable the construction of annual raster low- and mediumresolution (1 degrees and 90 m, respectively) images of solid precipitation.

TI  - Forming of Historical and Cultural Landscape of Yakuts: Ethno-Local Models and Spatial Concepts
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The strategies of space development, mechanisms of adaptation and identification of local cultures of the Sakha (Yakut) people in constant close connection with the natural environment are considered. The invariant features of the ethno-cultural landscape of the Yakuts, formed on the basis of local worldview, are revealed. The material for cross-cultural research was folklore, ethnographic and linguistic data reflecting and revealing the fundamental and symbolic meanings of the dominant symbols of spaces and ecological traditions based on the spiritualization of the landscape environment. The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that the work for the first time analyzes natural objects (alas, forest, ponds, mountain), which played a key role in the formation of local identities, in the semantic context. Historical-cognitive and linguistic analysis of the mental-cultural layer of natural objects showed that the cultural model of the Yakuts preserved archaic elements associated with the Turkic-Mongolian substrate. It is shown that the Yakuts transferred the metaphor of the South and stereotypes of spatial behaviour based on the perception of the southern ancestral home to a new geographical space. The author argues that natural objects accumulate ideas about the habitable terrain and "feeding landscape" and become key ethno-differentiating markers and the basis of the national-cultural narrative of the Yakut people. Thus, the conceptual foundations for the perception of natural objects in the minds of the Yakut people are determined, on the one hand, by utilitarian ideas about the territory as an economically developed space, on the other hand - by the mythological perception of real geographical space as value-heterogeneous loci according to the universal division of "own / alien."

CL  - Bogor, INDONESIA
AB  - This study developed a method of satellite imagery-based land-cover/land-use mapping for Indonesia at 1:50,000 scale, but with a very detailed level of categorization. The method was developed by taking into account: (a) categorization target specified in the reference classification scheme, (b) the ecological characteristics of the Indonesian region, (c) the type of data used, and (d) the main approach that can be applied to all regions in Indonesia. A landscape ecological approach was selected, by combining digital and visual interpretation. The main data source was Landsat-8 OLI recorded in various dates of recording between 2016 and 2018, supported with SPOT-7 and Sentinel 2A imagery. Digital analysis includes geometric and radiometric corrections, pan-sharpening, and vegetation index transformation. Visual interpretation was carried out with an interpretive overlays strategy and/or land unit approach. Field work was carried out for collecting information on terrain characteristics that are relevant to the land-cover/land-use variation, to be used as a basis for re-interpretation process. Based on the developed methods, a set of land-cover/land-use maps on a scale of 1: 50,000 of the southern part of Sumatera, except Lampung Province, was delivered. It covers 247 map sheets. The interpretation accuracies have been assessed statistically, and they reached 79.54% for Bengkulu, 80.75% for Jambi, 79.2% for Riau Islands, and 81.02% for Bangka-Belitung. With a large number of classes has been mapped, i.e. over 70 categories, the accuracy levels achieved in this study were considerably high. Some notes on the results of the mapping were also included in this report.

T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing science has proven fruitful for land surface temperature (LST) determination contrary to other techniques used especially for the rugged terrain like the Himalayan mountain system. In this study, an attempt has been made to estimate the land surface temperature in parts of Chenab basin, Jammu & Kashmir, by using Landsat-7 ETM+, TM, and Terra ASTER satellite data. The current study basically utilizes different surface temperature estimation techniques i.e. Reference Channel Method (RCM), Emissivity Normalization Method (ENM), Classification based and Stefan Boltzmann's approach to inter-compare various temperature estimation techniques and to examine the influence of the difference in sensor characteristics on the estimated surface temperature on a glacier terrain. For the effect of spatial resolution variation in the determined (LST) values for ETM+ and TM was estimated and for radiometric resolution, effect comparison was carried between the ETM+ and ASTER-derived LST image. Furthermore, an effect of spatial resolution has been quantified and has been evaluated successfully due to the fact that two sensors used for the purpose did not differ much in their characteristics features.

TI  - Preventive lipid-based nutrient supplements given with complementary foods to infants and young children 6 to 23 months of age for health, nutrition, and developmental outcomes
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundOne nutritional intervention advocated to prevent malnutrition among children is lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS). LNS provide a range of vitamins and minerals, but unlike most other micronutrient supplements, LNS also provide energy, protein and essential fatty acids. Alternative recipes and formulations to LNS include fortified blended foods (FBF), which are foods fortified with vitamins and minerals, and micronutrient powders (MNP), which are a combination of vitamins and minerals.ObjectivesTo assess the effects and safety of preventive LNS given with complementary foods on health, nutrition and developmental outcomes of non-hospitalised infants and children six to 23 months of age, and whether or not they are more effective than other foods (including FBF or MNP). This review did not assess the effects of LNS as supplementary foods or therapeutic foods in the management of moderate and severe acute malnutrition.Search methodsIn October 2018, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 21 other databases and two trials registers for relevant studies. We also checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews and contacted the authors of studies and other experts in the area for any ongoing and unpublished studies.Selection criteriaRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that evaluated the impact of LNS plus complementary foods given at point-of-use (for any dose, frequency, duration) to non-hospitalised infants and young children aged six to 23months in stable or emergency settings and compared to no intervention, other supplementary foods (i. e. FBF), nutrition counselling or multiple micronutrient supplements or powders for point-of-use fortification of complementary foods.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently screened studies for relevance and, for those studies included in the review, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager software. We used a random-effects meta-analysis for combining data as the interventions differed significantly. We set out the main findings of the review in 'Summary of findings' tables,.Main resultsOur search identified a total of 8124 records, from which we included 17 studies (54 papers) with 23,200 children in the review. The included studies reported on one or more of the pre-specified primary outcomes, and five studies included multiple comparison groups.Overall, the majority of trials were at low risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other sources of bias, but at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel due to the nature of the intervention. Using the GRADE approach, we judged the quality of the evidence for most outcomes as low or moderate.LNS+complementary feeding compared with no intervention Thirteen studies compared LNS plus complementary feeding with no intervention. LNS plus complementary feeding reduced the prevalence of moderate stunting by 7% (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 0.98; nine studies, 13,372 participants; moderate-quality evidence), severe stunting by 15% (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; five studies, 6151 participants; moderate-quality evidence), moderate wasting by 18%(RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; eight studies; 13,172 participants; moderate-quality evidence), moderate underweight by 15% (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.91; eight studies, 13,073 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and anaemia by 21%(RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; five studies, 2332 participants; low-quality evidence). There was no impact of LNS plus complementary feeding on severe wasting (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.46; three studies, 2329 participants) and severe underweight (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.13; two studies, 1729 participants). Adverse effects did not differ between the groups (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.01; three studies, 3382 participants).LNS+complementary feeding compared with FBF Five studies compared LNS plus complementary feedingwith other FBF, including corn soy blend and UNIMIX. We pooled four of the five studies in meta-analyses and found that, when compared to other FBF, LNS plus complementary feeding significantly reduced the prevalence of moderate stunting (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97; three studies, 2828 participants; moderate-quality evidence), moderate wasting (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.97; two studies, 2290 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and moderate underweight (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.91; two studies, 2280 participants; moderatequality evidence). We found no difference between LNS plus complementary feeding and FBF for severe stunting (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.42; two studies, 729 participants; low-quality evidence), severe wasting (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.81; two studies, 735 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and severe underweight (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.25; one study, 173 participants; lowquality evidence).LNS+complementary feeding compared withMNP Four studies compared LNS plus complementary feeding withMNP. We pooled data from three of the four studies in meta-analyses and found that compared to MNP, LNS plus complementary feeding significantly reduced the prevalence of moderate underweight (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99; two studies, 2004 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and anaemia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.68; two studies, 557 participants; low-quality evidence). There was no difference between LNS plus complementary feeding and MNP for moderate stunting (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.02; three studies, 2365 participants) and moderate wasting (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; two studies, 2004 participants).Authors' conclusionsThe findings of this review suggest that LNS plus complementary feeding compared to no intervention is effective at improving growth outcomes and anaemia without adverse effects among children aged six to 23 months in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) in Asia and Africa, and more effective if provided over a longer duration of time (over 12 months). Limited evidence also suggests that LNS plus complementary feeding is more effective than FBF and MNP at improving growth outcomes.

TI  - Mass balance of Chhota Shigri glacier using dual-polarized C band SAR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chhota Shigri glacier of the Himalaya has been monitored by dual-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to estimate mass balance for four consecutive years, 2012-2015. A liner decision rule based classification model has been developed previously and is employed to identify glacial zones throughout the ablation and accumulation periods to study transition of the zones and their temporal changes. Equilibrium Line Altitudes (ELAs) and mass balances of the glacier for the four years are calculated using the SAR derived classified outputs. The mass balance figures are - 0.65, - 0.59, - 0.25 and - 0.03 m water equivalent (w.e.) for the years 2012-2015, which are close to the previously reported mass balance figures. The work mainly demonstrates the application of the linear decision rule based classification model to study the transient glacial zones throughout the year and the use of the classified outputs to determine ELAs and mass balances of the glaciers. Optical remote sensing data are also used for comparison and showed a good match with the SAR data derived results. The SAR data based methodology is independent of glacier location and season of study; therefore, less user intervention is required, which makes the procedure more robust and objective.

AB  - Climate change studies require a large number of parameters to be handled simultaneously and machine-learning techniques are now-a-days widely used to solve this kind of situation. One of the interesting problem in climate studies to identify the homogeneous regions for trend analysis as it is rather impractical to study the time series for each measurement points. The concept of spatial clustering is applied to the TRMM satellite data to improve the classification of homogeneous rain zone. Instead of relying on the rain rate only, a number of spatial rain features are included in re-classification of the regions. The present approach clearly improves the decadal trend detection as opposed to the existing climatology as evident from the preliminary results presented in this paper.

AB  - There have been several efforts to utilize satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements to determine surface soil moisture conditions of agricultural regions. The results have been mixed since the relation between the SAR signal and surface soil moisture is confounded by variations in topographic features, surface roughness and vegetation density etc. We designed an experiment to investigate SAR based soil moisture retrieval using different machine learning techniques. In addition, a high resolution land surface model customized and deployed for generating soil moisture at 250m resolution using various static and dynamics input data.

TI  - Scenario-based land change modelling in the Indian Sundarban delta: an exploratory analysis of plausible alternative regional futures
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper narrates an empirical research conducted for developing four alternative socio-ecological scenarios for the lower Gangetic delta in India (aka the Indian Sundarban). We used the Story and Simulation (SAS) approach' to build four short-term, landscape-scale scenarios for 2030, which include a Business as Usual (BAU)', and three alternative scenarios, namely Market forces', Delta Republic' and Green Sundarban'. The storylines were built after careful screening of existing development and conservation plans, as well as by consulting local government officials. The storylines were then simulated using the Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain Analysis (MLP-MCA) model, with a multitude of factors, constraints, and attributes for each scenario. Historical and current land use maps of 2006 and 2016, derived from Landsat series (ETM+ and OLI), were used as the fundamental input to the model, which were also utilized to locate decadal changes, create several independent driver variables, calculate transition potentials and ultimately to develop future land use maps. To generate the scenarios, we used a Linear Programming (LP)-based land demand optimization method to alter the transition potential matrix. Our results indicated considerable loss of mud/tidal flats and viz.-a-viz. increase in river/water areas under all the four scenarios. We further observed moderate to a significant expansion of aquaculture for all the scenarios, with an almost two-fold increase under the Market forces scenario. In addition, three of the four scenarios indicated moderate loss of mangroves. The future extent of mangroves may vary from 1997.92km(2) (BAU) to 2172.25km(2) (Green Sundarban), which indicates to 3.72% overall decline (0.31% decline/year) to 4.67% (or 0.38% increase/year) overall gain from the present extent. As such, the Green Sundarban scenario was identified to the best possible pathway to serve the conservation interests and future sustainability of the delta. The results from the scenario analysis remain imperative to understand, plan and prepare for the plausible alternative regional futures, thereby optimizing conservation and development through proactive policy planning.

AB  - Seagrass is a flowering plant (Angiospermae) that lives submerged in the water. The sustainability of seagrass meadow depends on oceanographic conditions on its habitats including salinity, sea surface temperature, and total suspended solids (TSS). In the Banten Bay, there has been a change in oceanographic condition by natural process and human activities. The change of oceanographic condition will have an impact on the seagrass growth. Remote sensing method can be used to determine the spatial distribution of seagrass and the oceanographic condition that consist of salinity, sea surface temperature, and suspended materials. Therefore, this purposes of this study were 1) mapping the spatial distribution of seagrass and oceanographic condition using Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery and 2) to explain the correlation between seagrass distribution and the salinity, temperature, and suspended materials distribution. The results of this study areseagrasses in Banten Bay were lives are in the salinity condition between 27 parts per thousand/ - 32 parts per thousand, at the sea surface temperatures between 29 degrees C-31 degrees C, and at total suspended solids value between 19mg/l -30 mg/l. The sea surface temperature is the oceanographic parameters that have the highest correlation with seagrass, followed by total suspended solids and salinity.

T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th WESTPAC International Scientific Conference
CL  - Qingdao, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a natural phenomenon that relates to the fluctuation of temperatures over the Pacific Ocean. The ENSO significantly affects the ocean dynamics including upwelling event and coastal front. A recent study discovered the seasonal upwelling in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia (ECPM), which is significant to the fishery industry in this region. Thus, it is vital to have a better understanding of the influence of ENSO towards the coastal upwelling and thermal front in the ECPM. The sea surface temperature (SST) data achieved from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Aqua satellite are used in this study to observe the SST changes from 2005 to 2015. However, due to cloud cover issue, a reconstruction of data set is applied to MODIS data using the data interpolating empirical orthogonal function (DINEOF) to fill in the missing gap in the dataset based on spatial and temporal available data. Besides, a wavelet transformation analysis is done to determine the temperature fluctuation throughout the time series. The DINEOF results show the coastal upwelling in the ECPM develops in July and reaches its peak in August with a clear cold water patch off the coast. There is also a significant change of SST distribution during the El Nino years which weaken the coastal upwelling event along the ECPM. The wavelet transformation analysis shows the highest temperature fluctuation is in 2009-2010 which indicates the strongest El Nino throughout the time period. It is suggested that the El Nino is favourable for the stratification in water column thus it is weakening the upwelling and thermal frontal zone formation in ECPM waters.

AB  - Rapid assessment of water quality at a regular interval is important to monitor changes in water quality caused by manmade and natural interventions. However, large expanse of water bodies cannot be frequently monitored by sample collection and analysed due to economical and practical reasons. In the present study, water samples were collected during Sept 2017-May 2018 from inland water bodies: Narmada River and Reserviors (Bargi, Ukai, and Ujjani), and analysed for various water quality parameters. Two optically active water quality parameters viz., Chl-a and turbidity were correlated with Landsat 8 remote sensing data (LASRC). Surface reflectance values obtained from Band 1(0.435-0.451 mu m), Band 2 (0.452-0.512 mu m), Band 3 (0.533-0.590 mu m), Band 4 (0.636-0.673 mu m), Band 5 (0.851-0.879 mu m) were used to derive various single and multiple band algorithms to predict these two parameters. Multiple linear regression using B3, B4, and B5 provided good correlation between predicted and actual turbidity data (R-2=0.62) with root mean squared error (RMSE) 27.85%. In case of Chl-a, ratio of B1/B3; and B2/B3 correlated well with actual Chl-a data with R-2=0.62 and RMSE=34.70% and R-2=0.72 and RMSE=23.69% for Chl-a values between 1 and 7 mg/m(3), and 5 and 25 mg/m(3), respectively. The study revealed that remote sensing data can be used to predict fairly accurate values of turbidity and Chl-a temporally in inland water bodies. Values derived using remote sensing data can be confirmed by sporadic collection and analysis of water samples enabling rapid and economical monitoring of vast water bodies.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research was to relate natural vegetation dynamics to environmental policies and agricultural pressure surrounding the Irati National Forest (INF), in the state of Parana, Brazil. We mapped landuses and detected their changes over a period of 25 years (1992 to 2017), emphasising gains and losses of natural vegetation to other uses. Employing a pixel-based approach, Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI data were used to classify landuse surrounding the INF. We reviewed records of agricultural expansion and environmental policies in Parana to explain losses and gains in vegetation cover detected in the landuse change analysis. During the study period the area surrounding the INF gained -10,000 ha of natural vegetation cover regenerated from areas formerly under crop or pasture cover and planted forests, but lost -20,000 ha, largely to agricultural expansion, likely for soybeans. We discuss environmental policies, particularly the Ecological ICMS (a Brazilian ecological fiscal incentive paid to counties that shelter protected areas) as the most important reason for the vegetation regeneration and nature conservation.

AB  - Change detection is the challenging process of identifying meaningful changes on an image sequence. In this work, we propose a new change detector for SAR images. We show that by controlling the a priori number of false alarms, one can detect events and filter out very small detections without first applying an anti-speckle filter. A detection is made in the absolute log-ratio image when enough pixels in a neighborhood exceed a statistically pre-determined threshold. This flexible approach allows several neighborhood shapes and sizes to be tested while controlling the number of false alarms. A global bound on the desired expected number of false alarms automatically determines the detection thresholds for each tested configuration.

T2  - QUAESTIO IURIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to discuss the space of religion in the public sphere within a democratically inclined Rule of law. The text highlights how the development of the liberal constitutional state influenced the supervenience of a restrictive conception of the role of religion in the public sphere, creating a concept of tolerance as "indifference", based on absolute dissociation between public and private space. It correlates to the strengthening of the view that removes the religious element from public debate and, especially, from the institutional sphere of the state, to the postmodern worldview. Stemming from the distinction between state and society, it defends the inefficiency of the concept of liberal tolerance to handle a society characterized as "post-secular" in demanding that the state engage with the religious element. Based on texts by Jurgen Habermas and Michael Sandel, the article defends not only the possibility but also the effective need for, as long as determined epistemological postulates are followed, the religious argument to be incorporated to the political and even institutional debate. It defends the necessity of substituting the idea of neutrality as "indifference" for neutrality as "inclusion", as more able to facilitate the appearance of a social and legal scenario of greater commitment to moral divergences and greater democratic density.

TI  - Predicting wildfire vulnerability using logistic regression and artificial neural networks: a case study in Brazil's Federal District
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting the spatial distribution of wildfires is an important step towards proper wildfire management. In this work, we applied two data-mining models commonly used to predict fire occurrence - logistic regression (LR) and an artificial neural network (ANN) - to Brazil's Federal District, located inside the Brazilian Cerrado. We used Landsat-based burned area products to generate the dependent variable, and nine different anthropogenic and environmental factors as explanatory variables. The models were optimised via feature selection for best area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and then validated with real burn area data. The models had similar performance, but the ANN model showed better AUC (0.77) and accuracy values when evaluating exclusively non-burned areas (73.39%), whereas it had worse accuracy overall (66.55%) when classifying burned areas, in which LR performed better (65.24%). Moreover, we compared the contribution of each variable to the models, adding some insight into the main causes of wildfires in the region. The main driving aspects of the burned area distribution were land-use type and elevation. The results showed good performance for both models tested. These studies are still scarce despite the importance of the Brazilian savanna.

AB  - The present research aims to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the normalized difference, vegetation index (NDVI) by the exclusion of fire in the Aguas Emendadas Ecological Station, Central Brazil. The study area presents savanna vegetation, in which fire is an integral part of the ecosystem. The results indicate that the fire exclusion for more than 15 years resulted in a significant increase of NDVI within the ecological season. This increase in vegetation may result in more severe fires in the future given the greater availability of fuels.

T2  - GEO UERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article was to analyze the spatial distribution of target temperatures and the frequency of surface heat island intensities in areas with characteristics relating to land use, vegetation cover, densities and different construction patterns in Presidente Prudente, SP. The procedures adopted consisted of the use of 24 images of the Landsat 8 satellite, band 10, available and without cloud cover, between February 2013 and January 2016. The results showed that the higher frequency of high intensities of surface heat islands was recorded in a housing complex with a low building standard, followed by a neighborhood with a medium building standard. The areas with the lowest building density and presence of permeable soils with ground cover and tree cover were the ones that presented the highest frequency of low intensities of surface heat islands or fresh islands. The spatial variability of surface temperatures in the neighboring urban and rural environment results from the physical characteristics of the targets (types of building materials, soil waterproofing, density of buildings, and vegetation). These characteristics, resulting from the urbanization process, may cause the poorest, and therefore, most vulnerable, population to be more susceptible to situations of thermal discomfort and health problems.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXIV, held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - In this paper, we present a 2-Dimensional (2D) Optimal Interpolation (OI) technique for spatially scattered infrared satellite observations, from which level 2 products have been obtained, in order to yield level 3, regularly gridded, data. The scheme derives from a Bayesian predictor-corrector scheme used in data assimilation and is based on the Kalman filter estimation. It has been applied to 15-minutes temporal resolution Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) emissivity and temperature products and to Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) atmospheric ammonia (NH3) retrievals, a gas affecting the air quality. Results have been exemplified for target areas over Italy. In particular temperature retrievals have been compared with gridded data from MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) observations. Our findings show that the proposed strategy is quite effective to fill gaps because of data voids due, e.g., to clouds, gains more efficiency in capturing the daily cycle for surface parameters and provides valuable information on NH3 concentration and variability in regions not yet covered by ground-based instruments.

AB  - The monitoring of the recovery phase in the aftermath of an emergency scenario is tackled in this paper in terms of a change-detection perspective and through the integration of multisensor, multisource, and contextual information associated with high resolution optical and SAR data. The method makes use of the Markov random field theory to integrate the spatial context and the temporal correlation associated with images acquired at different dates. Moreover, the adoption of a region-based approach allows the characterization of the geometrical structures in the images through the employment of multiple segmentation maps at different scales. The performances of the proposed approach are evaluated on pairs of COSMO-SkyMed/Pleiades images acquired over Haiti in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew.

AB  - Over a 3-year period, we asked indigenous VhaVhenda and AmaSwati (n = 135, male = 57, female = 78, elders = 53, young people = 82) in two purposively selected, severely challenged remote sites in South Africa to tell us: 'If you go to bed tonight, how do you know this was a good day?' Employing Participatory Reflection and Action, we used an indigenous-appropriate prompt to elicit emic perspectives in home-languages during participatory diagramming. We used thematic analysis for in-case and cross-case analysis of back-translated, verbatim transcriptions of audio-recorded PRA-answers, as well as observation data generated by multiple researchers (visual data, field notes, researcher journals). Several themes of indigenous pathways to resilience with positive wellbeing outcomes became evident - one of which we discuss in this chapter. Similar to findings in other studies from non-western perspectives, participating indigenous South Africans leverage social connectedness in relationships where there is reciprocity and where their valuing of socio-cultural identity exist in social engagement. In times of hardship they leverage social connectedness to flock together for social support in order to resile. Regardless of worldview or harshness of challenges, social connectedness appears to make people happy. Our findings suggest that social connectedness enable eudaimonic wellbeing which reflects positive social functioning and positive psychological functioning.

AB  - The main objective of this work is to estimate Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) by jointly exploiting the information derived from X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery acquired by the Italian Space Agency COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation in StripMap HIMAGE mode and manual SWE ground measurements. The idea is to verify the sensitivity of the backscattering coefficient at X-band to the SWE and, by means of a Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm, to estimate the SWE for the South Tyrol region, north-eastern Italy. The regressor is trained by exploiting about 1,000 simulated backscattering coefficients corresponding to different snowpack conditions, obtained with a theoretical model based on the Dense Media Radiative Transfer theory - Quasi-crystalline approximation Mie scattering of Sticky spheres (DMRT-QMS). Then, the performance is evaluated on the backscattering values derived from COSMO-SkyMed satellite images and using the corresponding ground measurements of SWE as references. The results show a correlation coefficient equal to 0.6, a bias of 10.5 mm and a RMSE of 51.8 mm between estimated SWE values and ground measurements. The limited performance could be related to the DMRT-QMS theoretical model used for the simulations that results to be very sensitive to snow grain size and may have generated a training dataset only partially representative of satellite derived backscattering coefficients used for testing the algorithm.

TI  - Ethical Considerations for Movement Mapping to Identify Disease Transmission Hotspots.
T2  - Emerging infectious diseases
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Traditional public health methods for detecting infectious disease transmission, such as contact tracing and molecular epidemiology, are time-consuming and costly. Information and communication technologies, such as global positioning systems, smartphones, and mobile phones, offer opportunities for novel approaches to identifying transmission hotspots. However, mapping the movements of potentially infected persons comes with ethical challenges. During an interdisciplinary meeting of researchers, ethicists, data security specialists, information and communication technology experts, epidemiologists, microbiologists, and others, we arrived at suggestions to mitigate the ethical concerns of movement mapping. These suggestions include a template Data Protection Impact Assessment that follows European Union General Data Protection Regulations.

TI  - Urban Parks and Social Inequalities in the Access to Ecosystem Services in Santiago, Chile

AB  - In emergent economies, severe social inequalities can produce high exposure to deprived environmental conditions, affecting people's wellbeing. Urban parks can greatly help to increase the urban environmental quality by providing fundamental ecosystem services, such as local climate regulation, recreation and sense of place. Urban parks are, therefore, key elements for urban sustainability. This is particularly important in urban settings where investment in green spaces is deficient. In this work, we monitor the relationships between socioeconomic features and the provision of local climate regulation. To look at the potential mitigation of air temperatures we analysed a sample of seven parks and their surroundings in Santiago de Chile. Three physical variables were measured: land surface temperature (LST) as a proxy of air temperature, and vegetation cover and soil imperviousness as predictors. These variables were obtained from calculations based on Landsat imagery (2015), using the thermal bands, and estimated through normalised differences of vegetation (NDVI) and built-up (NDBI) indices. We used socio-economic as another predictor variable. Data used classifies households in five groups according to the family income and education level. The socio-economic data was obtained at census track level and served to explore the relationship between physical variables (LST, NDVI and NDBI) relate to socio-economic data. In addition, we measure air temperature using 8 in-situ sensors inside and outside of each park measuring each 150 seconds during two days of high temperatures (over 25 degrees C). Results showed that LST correlated significantly with vegetation cover and imperviousness (r spearman = -0.706 and 0.645, respectively). Socioeconomic variables correlated with the same variables, where wealthier neighbourhoods correlated negatively to LST and NDBI but positively to NDVI, while poorer neighbourhoods had higher values of LST and NDBI and correlated negatively to NDVI. Differences between air temperature inside and outside parks were higher in poorer than in wealthier neighbourhoods with an average difference of 2.5 degrees C with a maximum observed difference of 7.1 degrees C. Our results highlight the importance of implementing urban parks in deprived urban settings, to contribute to reduce shortages and inequalities in the access to ecosystem services.

AB  - This paper provides an analysis of Heidegger's early writings, within the context of his catholic and anti-modem background, in order to highlight some characteristic aspects. Its main purpose is to point out the worldview and value defining elements that guided his philosophical beginnings. Thus, the question may be posited about whether such elements still play a significant, albeit less explicit, role in the whole of the young Heidegger's philosophy.

CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) constitutes a fundamental asset for wide-areas monitoring with high-resolution requirements. The first SAR sensors have given rise to coarse coastal and maritime monitoring applications, including oil spill, ship and ice floes detection. With the upgrade to very high-resolution sensors in the recent years, with relatively new SAR missions such as Sentinel-1, a great deal of data providing a stronger information content has been released, enabling more refined studies on general targets features and thus permitting complex classifications, as for ship classification, which has become increasingly relevant given the growing need for coastal surveillance in commercial and military segments. In the last decade, several works focused on this topic have been presented, generally based on radiometric features processing; furthermore, in the very recent years a significant amount of research works have focused on emerging deep learning techniques, in particular on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Recently Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNets) have been presented, demonstrating a notable improvement in capturing the properties of given entities, improving the use of spatial informations, in particular of spatial dependence between features, a severely lacking feature in CNNs. In fact, CNNs pooling operations have been criticized for losing spatial relations, thus special capsules, along with a new iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism, have been proposed. In this work a comparison between Capsule and CNNs potential in the ship classification application domain is shown, by leveraging the OpenSARShip, a SAR Sentinel-1 ship chips dataset; in particular, a performance comparison between capsule and various convolutional architectures is built, demonstrating better performances of CapsNet in classifying ships within a small dataset.

AB  - In this work we present a cloud-computing based strategy for generating surface displacement time series and mean deformation velocity maps of very large areas by exploiting Sentinel-1 (Si) data. Our approach relies on the simultaneous exploitation of a fast access to the Si data archives, High Performance Computing resources and external geodetic data.The presented pipeline is based on an advanced cloud computing implementation of the differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) processing chain, which allows the fully unsupervised processing of huge Interferometric Wide Swath (IWS) Sentinel-1 data volumes.In particular, for what concerns the Si data archives, we benefited from the NASA's Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC), which stores and distributes Si SAR data from Amazon Web Service (AWS) for advancing Earth science research. The ASF-DAAC allowed us to reach a very high performance level in terms of downloading time and system reliability. Moreover, we exploited the geodetic measurements provided from the Magnet + Global GPS Network Map of the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory at the University of Nevada, Reno, USA (TJNR-NGL), which supply GPS measurements daily updated and continuosly available. The GPS measurements were used to account for regional trends and to better discriminate the low (tectonic) and high (local) frequency deformation patterns.The presented solution is highly scalable and has been migrated to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) environment. It runs out along an automatic routine to generate the mean deformation velocity maps of the vertical and horizontal (East-West) displacement components of the whole investigated area.The developed pipeline has been tested on ascending and descending Sentinel-1 archives acquired over a large area of Southern California (US), which extends over about 150,000 square kilometers.

AB  - Introduction: Malaria and leishmaniases are transmitted by vectors during blood-feeding. Vector-infected animals develop antibodies against the vector's saliva. This study evaluated IgY antibody detection in the chicken eggs exposed to bites from Migonemyia migonei, Lutzomyia longipalpis and Anopheles aquasalis. Methods: We used ELISA to quantify the antibody levels in the sera and exposed chicken eggs. Results: High IgY levels were observed following immunization; furthermore, higher reactivity was observed in the eggs and species-specific immune response was observed post final immunization. Conclusions: Chicken eggs can be used as sentinels to surveil vector saliva antibodies.

T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - According to previous studies involving biometric variables modeling using remote sensing (RS), data did not consider the effects of anthropogenic disturbance as relevant factor. The main objective of this study was to model aboveground biomass (AGB) and total wood volume (TWV) of Brazilian Savanna biome using vegetation indices (VI) from LANDSAT 5 TM. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) algorithm were applied across 641 field plots of cerrado sensu stricto of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, comparing two models: non-stratified, and stratified according to plot's anthropization degree. AGB and TWV obtained from non-anthropized plots presented linear relation with VIs (R-2 = 0.82 and 0.74, respectively) and, on the other hand, presented nonlinear relation when plots were affected by anthropogenic disturbances or were not stratified. This finding helps improving estimates by stratifying plots into their anthropization degree, mainly in the Brazilian Savanna biome undergoing anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - The ocha and ifa tradition (traditionally known as "santeria") are said to maintain a close relationship with nature. However, both traditions are characterized by a worldview that does not separate nature from non-nature (culture). Starting from the "letter of the year" of ifa and the psychology of the "children of the Oricha" (omo oricha) this paper illustrates the ocha-ifa worldview, which differs from the nature-culture dichotomy prevalent in the dominant thinking of the environment. The article seeks to understand how climate change- a very expression of the nature and culture distinction- was incorporated into ifa and its annual prophecies.

AB  - Plant Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a key variable for several land surface processes related to vegetation dynamics. Satellite systems offer the opportunity to estimate LAI by remote, allowing to reduce costs for crop monitoring over large areas. Indeed, LAI, is a process variable of several models used for the prediction of crop biomass accumulation, yield and canopy coverage over space and time. Uncertainty of LAI estimation by means of Vegetation Indices extrapolated from multispectral satellite images is related to several factors: ( i) crop type (due to the variability of plant architectures, the light extinction coefficient highly variable among crop species), (ii) the effect of environmental covariates, which affects the crop development together with the farm management. This study aimed at evaluating how the ground-LAI (Leaf Area Index) measurements and satellite vegetation indexes from Sentinel 2 reflectance were affected by the variety of crop type and the uncertainties related to different farm managements. We used Sentinel-2 imagery spanning across the growth seasons, over three agricultural sites located in the Mediterranean agroecosystem (Central Italy) and we produced satellite NDVI index to estimate LAI by remote over the sites. In the same period, with a monthly stratified random ground sampling design, the three agricultural farms with prevalent herbaceous crop cover were monitored in terms of groundLAI variations. The novelty and the added value extracted from the results was that the uncertainty induced by farm management (FARM) variability can be relevant as much as the one caused by crop type (CROP) and seasonality (TIME) variations when ground-LAI measurements and satellite NDVI were analyzed by a set of non-liner regression models.

TI  - MODIS EVI TIME SERIES TO ASSESS NEW OIL PALM PLANTATION DYNAMICS IN BORNEO
T2  - EARTH OBSERVATION ADVANCEMENTS IN A CHANGING WORLD
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Palm oil is the highest yielding oil crop of the world. Oil palms are extensively planted in the equator zone, especially in Indonesia where plantations have been spreading in response of the increasing market demand. Cultivation of oil palm in tropical countries it has already proved of endangering biodiversity and degrading environment with a global impact related to forest loss. From this point of view, remote sensing can support a more efficient plantation management that takes into account its effects over environment. In this work a time series of EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) maps, covering the period 2000-2018, was generated from the MODIS Vegetation Index product (MOD13Q1-v5) with the aim of automatically detecting new oil palm plantations and possibly giving an estimate of their age. To achieve these goals a self-developed routine was implemented to automatically operate the EVI time series analysis. Accuracy assessment showed an overall accuracy in new palm oil plantations detection of about 94%. Starting age estimation proved to be accurate enough: 76% of estimates were placed in a time range of +/- 1 year in respect of the actual plantation date, as communicated by farmers. The method was thought to be reliable and simple enough to be easily engineered in a web based geo service useful for the main players of the sector.

AB  - In green extensive context, RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems) can provide information with a high geometric resolution. The photogrammetric survey shows the possibility of measuring morphometric parameters of forest stand or individual trees. The free accessibility to Copernicus Sentinel-2 (S2) data addresses to hypothesize scenarios where satellite spectral information and high geometric resolution of RPAS photogrammetric survey, jointly used, determine a deeper knowledge of tree characteristics. Study area is located within the "La Mandria" park (NW Italy). Survey was operated by a DJI-Phantom4 RPAS (GSD images = 5 cm). Image photogrammetric processing was achieved by AGISOFT Photoscan v1.2.4. The resulting point cloud was filtered and a raster DSM (Digital Surface Model) was generated with a GSD = 10 cm. The correspondent CHM (Canopy Height Model) was computed by difference using a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) available from the regional cartographic archive. An object-based approach (watershed segmentation) aimed at bordering tree crowns as vector polygons was run. Some tree stability parameters were obtained from CHM by zonal statistics for each crown that was also spectrally characterized (to explore its vigor) using a S2 image time series. The proposed method finds applications in the arboricultural field (ornamental context) for the survey of tree inventory data; the detected parameters can be used as input data for tree risk assessment/management models, especially in extensive contexts representing a new approach to single tree risk management based on innovative technologies and algorithms that can reduce costs of ground control/survey campaigns.

AB  - This study aims at analysing local government efficiency using EO data to focus on the construction of new buildings in burned areas. We detected all forests and pastures of Sardinia (Sardinia) that witnessed at least a one-hectare wildfire, for biennium 2005-2006, using Landsat-TM data.We then monitored all the burned areas for a period of at least 10 years following the wildfire, up until 2016, by using Landsat products and VHR imagery provided by the Sardinian Region.The idea was to verify compliance with the Italian Framework Law on forest fires, which prohibits the construction of any structure or infrastructure aimed at civil settlements on woods and pastures affected by a fire for the next ten years.We retrieved as many as 748 burned areas, over which 148 violations were detected. These data have been used to carry out an econometric pilot analysis. Results suggest that, in general, the emergence of violations is inversely related to wildfire dimensions and that, on average, law-breaking occurs within the first five years.

TI  - Cell Death And Zika Virus: An Integrated Network Of The Mechanisms Of Cell Injury
T2  - INFECTION AND DRUG RESISTANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus that is transmitted by Aedes mosquitos. Its prototype was isolated in 1947 from serum of a sentinel Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) in the Zika forest of Uganda. As a member of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, ZIKV is enveloped and icosahedral and possesses a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 10.7 kb. Epidemiologically, infection by ZIKV has become a global health concern in recent years because of the occurrence of epidemics, its speed of dissemination, routes of transmission, and the sequelae it can cause especially in newborns. At the neural level, there are still many gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms that induce ZIKV infection-associated microcephaly. However, some studies already demonstrated that underlying cell death is determinant to induce the congenital malformation. In this report, we reviewed the various mechanisms of cell injury involved in the immunopathogenesis of ZIKV infection and discussed its relationship with the death of neuronal and glial cells development and microcephaly.

TI  - Evolution and Salvation
T2  - REVELETEO-REVISTA ELECTRONICA ESPACO TEOLOGICO
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the assumptions of evolutionary theory, the theology of nature reinterprets the Christian worldview and delivers otherwise to traditional biblical understanding of Creation, free will, sin, fall, and redemption. The present manuscript shows how these variations affect the biblical conception of salvation. One verifies that the entire evolution of man is inconceivable by the triviality of the Darwinian mechanism, whose overvalued application comprises a divine action restricted to ordinary interior tracking compassionate to human suffering. In these aspects, the divine intervention for the immediate salvation is mischaracterized. It is also shown that the Scriptures contain own display of body-spiritual evolution of man, hence it is not necessary to consider the Darwinian paradigm. On the contrary, it appears that variations in Christian conceptions are results of change in basics of thought, whose extrapolation gives way to heresy.

AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate the socio-spatial transformations in two municipalities, Rondonia State, southern Brazilian Amazon. Thus, we used indirect methods of landscape analysis, including products generated from sensor MODIS, in the TERRA and AQUA satellites. Deforestation data were obtained from the results of deforestation monitoring project in the Brazilian Amazon by means of Satellite (PRODES) and a human pressure model. The results showed that deforestation occur mainly in the northern part, especially in Nova Mamore. In addition, it was observed that 82.62% of the deforested areas are located within 5 km from the highways of the study area. Consequently, it was observed that the special areas located in Nova Mamore are subject to significant anthropogenic pressure levels, reaching moderate, as is the case Guajara-Mirim Park, in addition to part of the extractive reserve Jaci-Parana. In the case of the municipality of Guajara-Mirim, the extractive reserve of Rio Ouro Preto has portions at low and moderate anthropic pressure.

TI  - Engaging with the Sustainable Development Goals by going beyond Modernity: An ethical evaluation within a worldview framework
T2  - GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-technical summaryThe UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets are an important achievement. They largely reflect the worldview of Modernity, with its emphasis on scientific and planning rationality and emancipatory ideals. This worldview is no longer evident and dominant, and it is time to systematically explore complementing worldviews. Explicit use of worldviews, as sets of values and beliefs, and ethics enriches the interpretation and implementation of the SDGs. This facilitates the engagement of citizens in their real-world diversity and the development of respect for and empathy and cooperation with people holding other values, beliefs and morals. Dialogue around 'the middle road' can give guidance to just, fair and sustainable development pathways.Technical summaryThe UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets are formulated within the Modernity worldview, characterized by science-driven processes of standardization, formalization and rationalization, as well as emancipatory and planning ideals. Since its appearance, Modernity has been confronted with opposition from outside, such as in art and religion and in non-Western former colonies, and from inside, such as in philosophy of science and in physics and complexity science. It is arguably no longer an adequate frame for the human predicament in the twenty-first century. I introduce the worldview framework as a possible remedy. It uses two dimensions: (the tension between) particular and universal, individual and group, private and public; and (the tension between) material and immaterial. The agency of individual human beings can be framed as a personal voyage through this 'worldview space'. The SDGs present ambitions for future action and are as such ethical. I discuss briefly the important schools in ethics: libertarianism and utilitarianism; the Enlightenment ethics and its elaborations in development and eco-spiritual ethics; and virtue ethics. Each can be associated with certain positions in worldview space. Thus, the interpretation of the goals and targets in the SDGs can be enriched in order to identify and incorporate broader sets of values and beliefs about what 'the good life' is about. This is illustrated with a couple of specific examples.

AB  - The capacity of SAR interferometry to measure surface deformation with accuracy of 1 mm/year or better are well known. However this is typically limited to relative motion at short distance. Thanks to several advances in SAR sensor quality, data availability, orbit determination, processing, and calibration of atmospheric delays it is now possible to achieve that accuracy even across large distances of hundreds of kilometers.In this paper we revise the main contributions to the large scale error, considering available mitigation techniques. We provide a first validation for a processing based on Sentinel-1 data, by comparing our results with GNSS stations.For future SAR's operating at lower frequencies, it is vital to consider ionospheric corrections and likely also the influence of moisture variations in natural scatterers. The choice of processing algorithms, though typically not discussed, can also have a significant effect on the quality of the result.

T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study is to evaluate the potential of C-band SAR data from the Sentinel-1/2 instruments and machine learning algorithms for the estimation of forest above ground forest biomass (AGB) in a high-biomass tropical ecosystem. This study was carried out in Jamari National Forest, located in the Brazilian Amazon. The response variable was AGB (Mg/ha) estimated from airborne laser surveys. The following treatments were considered as model predictors: 1) Sentinel-1 Sigma 0 at VV and VH polarizations; 2) (1) plus Sentinel-1 textural metrics; 3) (2) plus Sentinel-2 bands and derived vegetation indices (LAI, RVI, SAVI, NDVI). Our modeling design estimated the relative importance of SAR vs. optical variables in explaining AGB. The modeling was performed with twelve machine-learning algorithms including, neural network and regression tree. The addition of texture and optical data provided a noticeable improvement (3%) over models with SAR backscatter only. The best model performance was achieved with the Random Tree algorithm. Our results demonstrate the potential of freely-available SAR data and machine learning for mapping AGB in tropical ecosystems.

TI  - NARRATING THE HUMANITARIAN BORDER: MORAL DELIBERATIONS OF TERRITORIAL BORDERWORKERS AT THE EU'S MEDITERRANEAN BORDER
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDITERRANEAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Union's external border regime in the Mediterranean is the classic 'humanitarian border'. It is presented and performed as a humanitarian and caring enterprise, but conceals strong elements of exclusionary border control. Important actors in its daily social construction are territorial borderworkers who are tasked with the implementation of the laws and policies underpinning the humanitarian border. Their narratives are passionate and articulated using emotive language and expressions denoting an intensity of personal feelings, while the moral framing of the issues indicates a moral discomfort. Drawing on multi-sited and long-term ethnographic fieldwork in Lampedusa and Sicily, situated on the external Mediterranean border of the European Union, this article explores the key themes and form of the personal narratives of territorial borderworkers who discuss border processes and deliberate their own roles within it. Their narratives reveal insights about their worldview, and add empirical depth to our understanding of the humanitarian border and the enterprise of constructing it.

AB  - We evaluate the feasibility of using various clear-sky models or purchased satellite data for estimating the soiling of a reference cell irradiance sensor. We find results to be more accurate for models that consider local meteorological conditions. We conclude that given the data sets considered, and depending on the requirements of the data analyst, choosing to use purchased satellite irradiance data from Solargis to estimate the soiling of a reference cell sensor tends to yield more accurate results, although there are instances where a clear-sky model performs better. The SOLIS clear-sky model in PVLIB with variable P-wat provided useful soiling results, implying that the general method of using a clear-sky model with local meteorological data may provide a low-cost tool for detecting soiling of irradiance sensors.

AB  - The assessment of cliffs instability to understand the dynamics of erosive phenomena and the dynamics of coastlines, in relation to the geomorphological and hydrodynamic characteristics of the coast is an important challenge worldwide, mainly where coastal retreat imply an economic impact. The MAREGOT Project (MAnagement des Risques de l'Erosion cotiere et actions de GOuvernance Transfrontaliere - "Managing the Risks of Coastal Erosion and Cross-border Governance Actions), funded under the Programme: 2014 - 2020 INTERREG V-A Italy - France (Maritime), aims at the joint prevention and management of the risks arising from coastal erosion in the cooperation area. In this context, a methodology consisting in the characterization of morphological and geological features collecting data from remote and proximal sensing sensors either on the sub-aerial or in the submerged cliff has been proposed. These data will be integrated by direct observation and surveys of the different geological features and with laboratory analysis of the geotechnical properties of sampled rocks and terrains. The main aim of this study is to integrate data acquired by different sensors as optical and Lidar data, side scan sonar and multibeam information to propose methodologies to assess and monitor coastal cliff landslide susceptibility.

TI  - Spatial accessibility analysis of healthcare service centers in Gamo Gofa Zone, Ethiopia through Geospatial technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The population of Ethiopia has been facing a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Most of the people live in rural areas where healthcare service is detrimental and very poor and their accessibility to these services is abysmally low. Spatial healthcare accessibility is determined by the availability and location of healthcare facilities as well as the location of people. It can be measured by distance traveled and traveling time. This study was carried out to analyze the distribution and spatial accessibility of healthcare service centers by using Geospatial technologies in Gamo Gofa zone of SNNP (Southern Nations and Nationalities People) region, Ethiopia. Satellite data, DEM (Digital Elevation Model), road network, population data and healthcare service centers location data was used for further analysis by using AccessMod extension 4.0 to Arc GIS 9.3.1 software. 30- and 60-min traveling time were considered to analyze the accessibility by means of walking and motor vehicle as the mode of transportation. It was found that 12.62%, 36.60%, 29.10% and 59% peoples of the total population were able to access the healthcare service centers by means of 30-min walking, 60-min walking, 30min walking and motor vehicle and 60-min walking and motor vehicle respectively. Health and disease management is key to social, cultural and economic development of any society so this approach offers considerable benefit.

TI  - CLASSIFICATION OF DOMINANT FOREST TREE SPECIES BY MULTI-SOURCE VERY HIGH RESOLUTION REMOTE SENSING DATA
T2  - EARTH OBSERVATION ADVANCEMENTS IN A CHANGING WORLD
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In this study we classified dominant forest tree species in a Mediterranean study area that hosted forest stands dominated by seven tree species, both coniferous and broadleaf, plus two mixed formations, for a total of nine classes. Airborne laser scanning data with a point density of 10 pts/m(2) and multispectral data (RGB and NIR) with 20 cm spatial resolution were taken using a helicopter. We divided the study area into a grid of quadrats of side 23 m and each quadrat was assigned to a dominant forest tree species class by visual inspection of remote sensing data. For each quadrat multispectral features and point cloud-derived metrics were extracted. For classification purposes, the quadrats were divided into training sites (35%) and test sites (65%). Two supervised classifiers were tested: Random Forest (RF) and k-NN. Several combinations of data sources were used. The accuracy of the supervised classifications was assessed against the visual one. The best accuracy of dominant forest tree species was obtained with RF using all data sources, achieving an overall accuracy of 71%. The overall accuracy increased up to 83% when forest categories (coniferous, broadleaf and mixed forest) instead of forest tree species were considered.

TI  - Eddy-Induced Salinity Changes in the Tropical Pacific
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The signature of westward propagating mesoscale eddies in sea surface salinity (SSS) is analyzed for the tropical Pacific by collocating 7years (2010-2016) of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity SSS satellite data with coherent mesoscale eddies automatically identified and tracked from altimetry-derived sea level anomalies. First, the main characteristics of the long-lived coherent eddies are inferred from sea level anomalies maps. Then, the mean signature of the mesoscale eddies on SSS is depicted for the whole tropical Pacific before focusing in regions centered around the central and eastern parts of the tropical North Pacific. In these areas, composite analyses based on thousands of eddies reveal regionally dependent eddy impacts with opposite SSS anomalies for cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. In the central region, where the largest meridional SSS large-scale gradients and smallest eddy amplitudes are observed, results show dipole-like SSS changes with maximum anomalies on the leading edge of the composite eddy. In contrast, in the eastern region, where the largest near-surface vertical salinity gradients and largest eddy amplitudes are observed, the composite eddy shows monopole-like SSS changes with maximum anomalies near the composite eddy center. These distinct dipole/monopole SSS patterns suggest the dominant role of horizontal advection and vertical processes in the central and eastern regions, respectively. Other possible explanations, notably one involving the contrasted eddy amplitudes of the two regions, are discussed.Plain Language Summary Sea surface salinity (SSS) is an Essential Climate Variable needed to improve our knowledge of the Earth's water cycle and climate. SSS has proven to be valuable for improving estimates of evaporation minus precipitation (E-P) budgets, describing and understanding climate variability at seasonal to decadal time scales, testing physical processes, assessing numerical model skills, quantifying the role of salinity on sea level change, improving El Nino prediction lead time, and quantifying the ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchanges. Very few studies have, however, focused on what we call small-scale (that is mainly eddies of the order of 50- to 300-km radius) SSS changes in the open ocean, mainly due to the lack of high-resolution measurements. Relying on unprecedented satellite measurements of SSS, the present study shows how eddies in the tropical Pacific can modify the spatial distribution of SSS. We suggest that these modifications are likely due (i) to the rotational sense of the eddies, which move SSS horizontally, and (ii) to their capability to move or mix waters up and down while rotating.

TI  - MULTI-TEMPORAL SPECKLE REDUCTION OF POLARIMETRIC SAR IMAGES: A RATIO-BASED APPROACH
T2  - 2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS 2019)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - The availability of multi-temporal stacks of SAR images opens the way to new speckle reduction methods. Beyond mere spatial filtering, the time series can be used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of structures that persist for several dates. Among multi-temporal filtering strategies to reduce speckle fluctuations, a recent approach has proved to be very effective: ratio-based filtering (RABASAR). This method, developed to reduce the speckle in multi-temporal intensity images, first computes a "mean image" with a high signal-to-noise ratio (a so-called super-image), and then processes the ratio between the multi-temporal stack and the super-image. In this paper, we propose an extension of this approach to polarimetric SAR images. We illustrate its potential on a stack of fully-polarimetric images from RADARSAT-2 satellite.

TI  - Measuring Urban Subsidence in the Rome Metropolitan Area (Italy) with Sentinel-1 SNAP-StaMPS Persistent Scatterer Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence in urban environments is an increasingly prominent aspect in the monitoring and maintenance of urban infrastructures. In this study we update the subsidence information over Rome and its surroundings (already the subject of past research with other sensors) for the first time using Copernicus Sentinel-1 data and open source tools. With this aim, we have developed a fully automatic processing chain for land deformation monitoring using the European Space Agency (ESA) SentiNel Application Platform (SNAP) and Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS). We have applied this automatic processing chain to more than 160 Sentinel-1A images over ascending and descending orbits to depict primarily the Line-Of-Sight ground deformation rates. Results of both geometries were then combined to compute the actual vertical motion component, which resulted in more than 2 million point targets, over their common area. Deformation measurements are in agreement with past studies over the city of Rome, identifying main subsidence areas in: (i) Fiumicino; (ii) along the Tiber River; (iii) Ostia and coastal area; (iv) Ostiense quarter; and (v) Tivoli area. Finally, post-processing of Persistent Scatterer Inteferometry (PSI) results, in a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment, for the extraction of ground displacements on urban infrastructures (including road networks, buildings and bridges) is considered.

TI  - Assessment of Image Quality of Waveform-Encoded Synthetic Aperture Radar Using Real Satellite Data
T2  - 2019 20TH INTERNATIONAL RADAR SYMPOSIUM (IRS)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 20th International Radar Symposium (IRS)
CL  - Ulm, GERMANY
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing is very attractive for the systematic observation of dynamic processes on the Earth's surface since it allows high resolution imaging independently of weather conditions and sunlight illumination.Waveform-encoded SAR is a novel SAR concept based on pulse-to-pulse variation of the transmitted waveform that allows focusing the nadir echo and the range ambiguities and suppressing them through a multi focus post-processing.However, the assessment of the ambiguity suppression performance for such a system is not trivial, as the processing involves a (non-linear) thresholding and blanking approach. This work proposes a novel methodology, which exploits real TerraSAR-X data to accurately simulate the effect of the range ambiguity on the useful signal and allows for a quantitative assessment of the image quality of a waveform-encoded SAR. The analysis considers different waveform variation schemes (e.g., up- and down-chirps, cyclically-shifted chirps) and a contrast-minimization technique for threshold selection, whose performance is compared to the best achievable one (i.e., optimum threshold).The results of this work further highlight the potentialities of the waveform-encoded SAR concept and also allow accounting for its ambiguity suppression capability in the design of a SAR system.

TI  - In-Season Mapping of Irrigated Crops Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have reported the use of multi-spectral and multi-temporal remote sensing images to map irrigated crops. Such maps are useful for water management. The recent availability of optical and radar image time series such as the Sentinel data offers new opportunities to map land cover with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Early identification of irrigated crops is of major importance for irrigation scheduling, but the cloud coverage might significantly reduce the number of available optical images, making crop identification difficult. SAR image time series such as those provided by Sentinel-1 offer the possibility of improving early crop mapping. This paper studies the impact of the Sentinel-1 images when used jointly with optical imagery (Landsat8) and a digital elevation model of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The study site is located in a temperate zone (southwest France) with irrigated maize crops. The classifier used is the Random Forest. The combined use of the different data (radar, optical, and SRTM) improves the early classifications of the irrigated crops (k = 0.89) compared to classifications obtained using each type of data separately (k = 0.84). The use of the DEM is significant for the early stages but becomes useless once crops have reached their full development. In conclusion, compared to a "full optical" approach, the "combined" method is more robust over time as radar images permit cloudy conditions to be overcome.

TI  - STUDY OF THE MOISTURE CONTENT OF THE TROPOSPHERE OVER THE ULAB (ULAANBAATAR) MONITORING STATION USING GPS MEASUREMENT, RADIO SOUNDING AND SURFACE METEOROLOGY DATA
T2  - GEODYNAMICS & TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The water vapor content is calculated in a conditional vertical column to the tropopause level from remote sensing data on the lower atmosphere. The calculations are based on GPS measurements, surface meteorological data and vertical meteorological profiles produced by radiosondes. A total zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD) is estimated as a difference between an estimated straight line, along which the GPS signal propagates in vacuum, and a length of the path between the signal source and the receiver, which is refracted in the real medium. A direct correlation is noted between changes in the 'wet' component of the tropospheric delay of the GPS signal and variations in the moisture content of the troposphere. A 'wet' component value of the tropospheric delay can be converted with a very high confidence into a value of integral water vapor above the observation point. In order to determine the integral water vapor amounts over the ULAB (Ulaanbaatar) permanent GPS monitoring station, empirical equations were used for the linear regressions of the ratios of surface temperature and mean weighted temperature for the water vapor elasticity using the data of radiosondes launched in the city of Ulaanbaatar and Muren settlement. We studied the features of the dynamics of variations in the integral water vapor, surface values of atmospheric pressure, air temperature and precipitation volumes over the ULAB station, using the data of July 2016.

TI  - <i>HEART</i>-<i>TO</i>-<i>HEART TALK</i> IN THE SYSTEM OF VALUES OF RUSSIAN SPEECH COMMUNICATION
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article considers heart-to-heart talk (Rus.), a genre of harmonious communication belonging to the informal sphere of immediate oral spontaneous communication mostly aimed at establishing or strengthening interpersonal intimacy, moral support, and the exchange of important personal information. The author provides linguo-communicative (speech genre), linguocultural, linguo-cognitive (value), and linguo-statistical (corpus) analysis of the genre, which is regarded as a genre of communication and speech with no equivalents in other cultures, a scenario and value of Russian speech communication and Russian culture as a whole. Analysis of the genre reveals its significant complexity and inconsistency, including value inconsistency: heart-to-heart talk can be "simple" - and beyond someone's capacity to understand; with an "simple" interlocutor - and a highly educated specialist; with "one's own" - and with a stranger; it can be short - and long; relaxed, "light" - and tense, "hard"; it can be pleasant, "partial", and include elements of flattery - and harsh criticism; it can lead to reconciliation - and to a quarrel; it can be calm - and include elements of a dispute (razgovor po dusham between men) or hysterics (between women); usually a heart-to-heart talk cannot take place "on demand". Razgovor po dusham is regarded positively when conducted (successfully) by psychologists with mentally ill or unstable people. In the majority of cases, the evaluative characteristics of the razgovor po dusham reflected in the examples are positive and highly positive; at the same time, there are negative characteristics. The article takes into account studies of cultural concepts in the Russian national and linguistic worldview ( truth, friendship, sincerity, "Toka" longing, etc.) and complements the picture with a number of important concepts, associated with the communicative-pragmatic and genrerole nature of the phenomenon, and with the peculiarities of paradigmatics and syntagmatics in the contexts of modern Russian speech.

AB  - Shorelines change rapidly, and the natural disasters such as earthquakes may destroy their morphologies. Therefore, shoreline monitoring is vital for preservation. Traditional methods, such as field surveys, are inefficient for monitoring coastal regions in terms of both time and cost. Alternatively, remote sensing technologies and image processing techniques can be used to derive such information effectively. The objective of this study is to investigate shoreline changes before and after an earthquake in Christchurch city from Canterbury region of New Zealand by non-parametrically processing of SAR imagery. The segmentation parameters were determined using optical SENTINEL 2A images and changes in the shoreline were determined using SAR data. The main motivation of the study is to use Optic SAR as a replacement for LiDAR data to analyze the shoreline changes. Experiments were performed to evaluate the proposed method by comparing the obtained results with the reference data. It was observed that the proposed method was effective in determining the changes in the shoreline with high accuracy.

TI  - cuneyd/spaef: SPAEF version 1.0 with histogram match (Python-R-Matlab)
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Developing new metrics for spatial pattern comparison of observed and simulated variables has been planned as major part of the first work package (WP1) of the SPACE project. This goal was achieved by developing SPAtial EFficiency metric (SPAEF) described below. For that first we have extensively investigated the current state-of-art spatial comparison metrics. We tested available metrics such as coefficient of variation, correlation coefficient, Goodman and Kruskal's lambda (Goodman and Kruskal, 1954), Mapcurves (Hargrove et al., 2006), agreement coefficient (Ji and Gallo, 2006), FSS, Theil's Uncertainty, EOF and Cramer's V (Cramer, 1946; Koch et al., 2015; Rees, 2008) in calibration of a distributed hydrologic model. However, after many calibration attempts we found them inadequate due to the unexpected resultant visual patterns resulted in high correlation but too low standard deviation or highly separate groups. Therefore, we introduced a brand new multi-component SPAEF metric in Demirel et al. (2017a) which showed the utility of SPAEF in an ensemble model calibration case. For further comparison of the SPAEF with other metrics and particularly analysing each component separately in a calibration framework please refer to the subsequent study by Koch et al. (2017). Illustrative examples and source codes are available in Python 2.7 and Matlab (Demirel et al., 2017b).

AB  - Developing new metrics for spatial pattern comparison of observed and simulated variables has been planned as major part of the first work package (WP1) of the SPACE project. This goal was achieved by developing SPAtial EFficiency metric (SPAEF) described below. For that first we have extensively investigated the current state-of-art spatial comparison metrics. We tested available metrics such as coefficient of variation, correlation coefficient, Goodman and Kruskal's lambda (Goodman and Kruskal, 1954), Mapcurves (Hargrove et al., 2006), agreement coefficient (Ji and Gallo, 2006), FSS, Theil's Uncertainty, EOF and Cramer's V (Cramer, 1946; Koch et al., 2015; Rees, 2008) in calibration of a distributed hydrologic model. However, after many calibration attempts we found them inadequate due to the unexpected resultant visual patterns resulted in high correlation but too low standard deviation or highly separate groups. Therefore, we introduced a brand new multi-component SPAEF metric in Demirel et al. (2017a) which showed the utility of SPAEF in an ensemble model calibration case. For further comparison of the SPAEF with other metrics and particularly analysing each component separately in a calibration framework please refer to the subsequent study by Koch et al. (2017). Illustrative examples and source codes are available in Python 2.7 and Matlab (Demirel et al., 2017b).

TI  - Picoeukaryotes of the <i>Micromonas</i> genus: sentinels of a warming ocean
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Photosynthetic picoeukaryotesx in the genus Micromonas show among the widest latitudinal distributions on Earth, experiencing large thermal gradients from poles to tropics. Micromonas comprises at least four different species often found in sympatry. While such ubiquity might suggest a wide thermal niche, the temperature response of the different strains is still unexplored, leaving many questions as for their ecological success over such diverse ecosystems. Using combined experiments and theory, we characterize the thermal response of eleven Micromonas strains belonging to four species. We demonstrate that the variety of specific responses to temperature in the Micromonas genus makes this environmental factor an ideal marker to describe its global distribution and diversity. We then propose a diversity model for the genus Micromonas, which proves to be representative of the whole phytoplankton diversity. This prominent primary producer is therefore a sentinel organism of phytoplankton diversity at the global scale. We use the diversity within Micromonas to anticipate the potential impact of global warming on oceanic phytoplankton. We develop a dynamic, adaptive model and run forecast simulations, exploring a range of adaptation time scales, to probe the likely responses to climate change. Results stress how biodiversity erosion depends on the ability of organisms to adapt rapidly to temperature increase.

AB  - Relative radiometric normalization (RRN) minimizes radiometric differences among images caused by inconsistencies of acquisition condition. In this study, a cross-sensor RRN method is proposed for optical satellite images from Landsat 8 OLI (L8) and Landsat 7 ETM+ (L7) sensors. The data from these two sensors have different pixel depths. Therefore, a rescaling on the radiometry resolution is performed in the preprocessing. Then, multivariate alteration detection (MAD) based on kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) is adopted, which is called KCCA-based MAD, to select pseudo-invariant features (PIFs). The process of RRN is performed by using polynomial regression with Gaussian weighted regression. In experiments, qualitative and quantitative analyses on images from different sensors are conducted. The experimental result demonstrates the superiority of the proposed nonlinear transformation, in terms of regression quality and radiometric consistency, compared with RRN using linear regression.

T2  - REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CONTAMINACION AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The upstream of Minjiang River, which was one of the main water sources for Chengdu Plain and the Yangtze River, was selected as the study area in the paper. With a series of cloud-free Landsat TM/OLI images acquired on June 24, 1994 and June 1, 2014, the vegetation coverage of the study area was calculated based on the vegetation index and dimidiate pixel model. The temporal and spatial changes of vegetation coverage were analyzed with digital elevation model and county area. The average vegetation coverage of the study area was decreased from 68.97% in 1994 to 60.39% in 2014. The analysis results showed that vegetation changes were closely related to topographical characteristics. The proportion of vegetation degradation area increased with the elevation increase and vegetation degradation was the most serious at the elevation range from 3500 m to 4500 m. The vegetation degeneration was the most obvious in Wenchuan County and Songpan County. Geological hazards caused by the earthquake and human disturbance were the main cause of the vegetation degradation and the aridity trend in the study area was another important factor.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN SHELTERBELT LANDSCAPE IN NORTHEAST CHINA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the shelterbelt development in northeast China over the past 30 years will provide a scientific decision support for its management in future. In this paper, Landsat images were selected to extract shelterbelt information covering three points in time (1990, 2000 and 2010). Shelterbelt density and landscape indexes (ratio of belt to patch, connectivity, and dominance) were introduced to analyze changes in landscape. Farmland landscape indexes (ratio of farmland to zone and fragmentation) were used to analyze the effect of farmland on shelterbelt distribution and change. The result showed that: (1) shelterbelt density had considerable spatial variation. These changes were strong correlated with land -use type. Farmland fragmentation was a main index which significantly affected the connectivity and evenness of shelterbelt, especially on connectivity; (2) shelterbelt density increased about 10% over the 30 years. This modest increase included two contrasting trends, an increase by 13.2% from 1990 to 2000 followed by a 2.8% reduction by 2010. Even the quantity reduced over 2000-2010, the qualities including connectivity and evenness were getting better overall. The temporal changes of shelterbelt density had little relationship with farmland changes. This research can provide valuable information for decision makers to guide and develop future policies.

AB  - Researches described in the paper are aimed at studying the methods of data preprocessing from a sample of observations of a system characterized by input-output values of variables. We consider the data containing omissions and outliers. Algorithms for leveling outliers in a sample of observations, as well as algorithms for filling data gaps are presented. In addition, it is implemented a data repair algorithm that is able to recover lost values (outliers) after their exclusion. Our studies are useful in geographic information systems or in the analysis of information received from satellites during remote sensing of the earth.

AB  - Many ecological applications (e.g., human activity management in protected areas, conservation status assignment) require actual forest inventory data. However, frequent field research of forest areas is very expensive. Therefore, in practice, forest inventory data are slowly updated, approximately one time per decade. From the other hand, modern remote sensing systems combine high-quality imagery with short revisiting time and can be used for the forest inventory data clarification. Our paper presents an investigation of tree species classification based on seasonal Sentinel-2 data (2018) and the latest forest inventory information (2013-2014). The main advantages of Sentinel-2 satellites are a short revisiting time and a large field of view that is important in large area analysis. Our classification model was based on support vector machines method combined with specific spatial processing methods. We used the known inventory data for training and validation the classifier. Misclassified regions were further analyzed in ground surveys to produce the inventory data clarification. The paper addresses the optimal image dates selection, image preprocessing and classification procedure evaluation issues. The study was carried out for the territory of the Krasnosamarskoe forestry in Samara region, Russia. The experiments have shown that the proper Sentinel-2 data selection and classification procedure configuration allow reaching the classification accuracy of about 0.82 for the control sample. The ground survey confirmed that classification errors are mainly caused by the dominant tree species changes. Thus, we concluded that Sentinel-2 data can be effectively used for the forest inventory data clarification.

TI  - Evaluation of Using Sentinel-1 and-2 Time-Series to Identify Winter Land Use in Agricultural Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring vegetation cover during winter is a major environmental and scientific issue in agricultural areas. From an environmental viewpoint, the presence and type of vegetation cover in winter influences the transport of pollutants to water resources. From a methodological viewpoint, characterizing spatio-temporal dynamics of land cover and land use at the field scale is challenging due to the diversity of farming strategies and practices in winter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the respective advantages of Sentinel optical and SAR time-series to identify land use in winter. To this end, Sentinel-1 and -2 time-series were classified using Support Vector Machine and Random Forest algorithms in a 130 km(2) agricultural area. From the classification, the Sentinel-2 time-series identified winter land use more accurately (overall accuracy (OA) = 75%, Kappa index = 0.70) than that of Sentinel-1 (OA = 70%, Kappa = 0.66) but a combination of the Sentinel-1 and -2 time-series was the most accurate (OA = 81%, Kappa = 0.77). Our study outlines the effectiveness of Sentinel-1 and -2 for identify land use in winter, which can help to change agricultural practices.

AB  - Satellite data on total ozone content for 1985-2015 have been used. Methods of evaluating ozone deficit in the polar region and its excess in middle latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere have been developed. In early spring the ozone molecules outflow and the ozone anomaly forms. Ozone inflows the middle latitudes, its total content increases and a ring with elevated TO forms. In October-November the dynamic process reverses, from the ring the ozone molecules transfer to the polar latitudes. The amount of ozone leaving the ring into the polar regions and filling the ozone anomaly is virtually the same. The results produces indicate that the Antarctic ozone hole is a natural geophysical formation.

AB  - Lakes and wetlands have a variety of uses in keeping the ecological balance and the well-being of a basin. Turkey has almost 303 water bodies among which Konya Closed Basin bears 29 of those where two of them have been registered as Ramsar sites. In this study, one of these sites, Meke Lake, and its nearby Akgol Wetland and Acigol Lake that are of international value are temporally assessed by means of satellite images regarding their water surfaces. Meke Lake has been declared as a Ramsar site in 2005, whereas Acigol is one of the volcanic lakes of the world with a depth of 300 m. Akgol has been registered as 1st level Natural Site and Natural Protection Area. Four classified images belonging to years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2016 are further correlated with the ground truth measurements to assess the temporal variation of the sites. Producing such scientific data and conducting similar analyses are important for especially the local, regional and national authorities and planners in charge of the rehabilitation and restoration of natural sites that have lost a significant amount of land and water in the past years.

TI  - The value of MRI in the detection of axillary lymph node metastases in breast cancer: a systematic review
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Staging of the axillary lymph nodes is an essential step to determine the appropriate treatment for breast cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is currently the first step in staging and the gold standard. However, if the sentinel node is positive, a full dissection of the axillary lymph nodes should be performed (axillary lymph node dissection or ALND). This technique used to be the gold standard but had considerable sequelae which diminished quality of life. SLNB still has sequelae but the incidence is much lower. The goal of this systematic review is to assess whether MRI can replace or assist the current gold standard for axillary lymph node staging in breast cancer. With the use of these non-invasive techniques, the risk of morbidity could be reduced even more. A comprehensive search and an additional brief search in several databases has been performed using PRISMA. Studies were selected based on titles and abstracts and were included or excluded using predetermined criteria. The studies were assessed for validity and applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool by two readers. Data of three studies using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) were pooled and statistical analysis was performed. A total of seven studies were included for review. Three studies used DWI, others used T2-weighted imaging, contrast-enhanced imaging, T1-weighted imaging or an MRI scoring system. Due to the heterogeneously divided MRI modalities, a small meta-analysis of DWI was performed. Other studies were evaluated qualitatively. DWI reached a sensitivity of 87.67% (95% CI 77.88-94.20) and a specificity of 59.31% (95% CI 50.85-67.38), a positive predictive value (PPV) of 52.03% (95 CI 42.84-61.12), and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90.53% (95% CI 82.78-95.58). MRI can aid in the detection of axillary lymph node metastasis, but it cannot replace the current gold standard (SLNB/ALND).

AB  - Band ratios are one of the most common features for discrimination and identification of minerals using remotely sensed data. The band ratios to be used are determined mainly by spectral analysis and trial experiments. In the present work, we systematically examine the best features and best band ratios using Bhattacharyya distance based optimal band analysis. The experiments indicate that the ASTER nine bands and band ratios within the wavelength range of 2200 nm to 2300 nm are significant for hydrothermal alteration minerals.

TI  - Hindcasting eutrophication and changes in temperature and storage volume in a semi-arid reservoir: a multi-decadal Landsat-based assessment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ monitoring of freshwater systems is often constrained by cost and accessibility, particularly in developing countries and in remote areas. Satellite remote sensing is therefore increasingly being integrated with existing in situ water quality monitoring programs. In this study, we use the Landsat TM/ETM+ image record collected between 1984 and 2015 to track temporal changes in trophic status, chlorophyll-a levels, algal bloom incidences, water clarity, water temperature, and reservoir water volume in a poorly monitored hypereutrophic semi-arid reservoir. Historical reservoir water quality data are inferred from calibrated Landsat-based empirical algorithms. The results show that, although the reservoir has existed in a eutrophic to hypereutrophic state over the past 30years, its water quality has significantly deteriorated in the most recent decade. Mean summer chlorophyll-a concentrations were found to have increased by around 163% between 1984 and 2015, while water clarity dropped by more than 58% over the same period. Statistically significant changes in surface water temperatures were also apparent for the month of August, with a cumulative increase of 1.24 degrees C over the 31-year study period. The rise in temperature appears to correlate with the incidence of Microcystis blooms observed in the reservoir over the past decade. On the other hand, the water volume in the reservoir was found to have been fairly stable over time, likely as a result of adaptive reservoir management. This study demonstrates the strength of using Landsat data to hindcast and quantify changes in water quality and quantity in poorly monitored freshwater systems.

AB  - The rapid increase in the number of online videos provides the marketing and advertising agents ample opportunities to reach out to their audience. One of the most widely used strategies is product placement, or embedded marketing, wherein new advertisements are integrated seamlessly into existing advertisements in videos. Such strategies involve accurately localizing the position of the advert in the image frame, either manually in the video editing phase, or by using machine learning frameworks. However, these machine learning techniques and deep neural networks need a massive amount of data for training. In this paper, we propose and release the first large-scale dataset of advertisement billboards, captured in outdoor scenes. We also benchmark several state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms on our proposed dataset.

CP  - 37th EARSeL Symposium on Smart Future with Remote Sensing
CL  - Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC
AB  - This paper describes a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry procedure to process Sentinel-1 SAR data. Its most original part includes a set of tools to perform two key processing stages: a first 2 + 1D phase unwrapping, prior to atmospheric filtering, and a second 2 + 1D phase unwrapping, to generate the deformation time series. These tools address two fundamental aspects of a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry processing chain: the quality control of the intermediate and final results, and the generation of quality indices to characterise such results. The effectiveness of the proposed tools is illustrated using a case study located in Catalonia (Northern Iberian Peninsula).

TI  - Potential of Sentinel-2 satellite images to monitor vine fields grown at a territorial scale
T2  - OENO ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The aim of this short note is to provide first insights into the ability of Sentinel-2 images to monitor vine growth across a whole season. It focuses on verifying the practical temporal resolution that can be reached with Sentinel-2 images, the main stages of Mediterranean vineyard development as well as potential relevant agronomic information that can be seen on the temporal vegetation curves arising from Sentinel-2 images.Methods and results: The study was carried out in 2017 in a production vineyard located in southern France, 2 km from the Mediterranean seashore. Sentinel-2 images acquired during the whole vine growing cycle were considered, i.e. between the 3(rd) of March 2017 and the 10(th) of October 2017. The images were used to compute the classical normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Time series of NDVI values were analyzed on four blocks chosen for exhibiting different features, e.g. age, missing plants, weeding practices. The practical time lag between two usable images was closer to 16 days than to the 10 theoretical days (with only one satellite available at the date of the experiment), i.e. near 60% of the theoretical one. Results show that it might be possible to identify i) the main steps of vine development (e.g. budburst, growth, trimming, growth stop and senescence), ii) weed management and inter-row management practices, and iii) possible reasons for significant inter-block differences in vegetative expression (e.g. young vines that have recently been planted, low-productive blocks affected by many missing vines).Conclusions: Although this experiment was conducted at a time when Sentinel-2b was not fully operational, results showed that a sufficient number of usable images was available to monitor vine development. The availability of two Sentinel satellites (2a and 2b) in upcoming seasons should increase the number of usable images and the temporal resolution of the time series. This study also showed the limitations of the Sentinel-2 images' resolution to provide within-block information in the case of small blocks or blocks with complex borders or both.Significance and impact of the study: This technical note demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-2 images to characterize vineyard blocks' vigor and to monitor winegrowers' practices at a territorial (regional) scale. The impact of management operations such as weeding and trimming, along with their incidence on canopy size, were observed on the NDVI time series. Some relevant parameters (slope, maximum values) may be derived from the NDVI time series, providing new insights into the monitoring of vineyards at a large scale. These results provided areas for further investigation, especially regarding the development of new indicators to characterize block-climate relationships.

AB  - This work deals with the classification of wheat phenology by regressing the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter coefficients (VV, VH) to vegetation water content (VWC) and plant area index (PAI) through a representation learning network. The representation network architecture consists of a pair (VV, VH) of two regression layers (VWC, PAI) which finally converge to a classification (crop phenology) layer. The study was conducted with the Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data acquired during the SMAPVEX16 campaign in Manitoba, Canada. Using this framework, the wheat phenology was classified to an accuracy of 86.67%. However, in comparison, the classification accuracy reduced by similar to 20% while using only the backscatter coefficients of (VV, VH) polarization channels. The results obtained from this study justifies the potential of using a representation learning scheme for crop phenology classification with SAR data.

In this paper, this technique has been applied on 23 X-band COSMO-SKyMed (CSK) datasets during 2011 - 2016 to get the annual subsidence rate over Jharia Coal Field (JCF), India. Validation of the subsidence result with ground water level data strongly indicates the predominant underground coal mining induced surface deformation over Jharia area.

AB  - Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) is considered to be one of the most accurate geodetic techniques for monitoring Earth's surface change phenomena. Corner reflectors (CR) are widely used to validate the DInSAR generated deformation results because of their better phase stability and higher radar cross-section. A controlled experiment has been performed for carrying out a sensitivity analysis of DInSAR technique with the controlled vertical movement of CR in between two COSMO-SkyMed tandem passes over Jharia Coal Field. From the results, it has been observed that CR-based DInSAR experiment followed the similar displacement trend with a maximum of 10% error limit.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st Springer Conference of the Arabian-Journal-of-Geosciences (CAJG)
CL  - Hammamet, TUNISIA
AB  - For proper monitoring and scheduling of the supply of drinking water in reservoirs, it is necessary to carry out the capacity surveys. Remote sensing techniques can be used to estimate the capacity of the reservoirs in an inexpensive and less laborious way. In this paper, a super resolution mapping based on hybrid approach was developed and applied to Landsat OLI image of the Puzhal reservoir, Chennai city, southern India and the reservoir water-spread area was estimated. The estimated water-spread was used to find the capacity of the reservoir using Trapezoidal formula. The hybrid approach uses New Fuzzy Cluster Centroid (NFCC) algorithm for sub-pixel mapping and multi-objective genetic algorithm for super resolution mapping. The super resolution mapping is an advanced classification technique which accurately maps the location of classes within a pixel. The capacity determined from the image processing technique is compared with that estimated from the field survey data with a meagre 1.35% error. Hence, it is observed that the super resolution mapping is a prominent methodology to estimate the water-spread area of the reservoir which in turn increases the accuracy of the estimation capacity of the reservoir.

T2  - MARKETING IN A DIGITAL WORLD
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The dominant worldview among marketers is one of technology optimism, which holds that technological advances influence consumers and businesses in positive ways. In direct contrast to this perspective, I advance the thesis that at the organizational frontlines where marketers interact with consumers by observing, informing, persuading, negotiating and co-creating with, and entertaining them, technology commonly produces unforeseen and unexpected effects on consumers with significant negative implications for marketers. The result is Adverse Technology-Consumer Interactions (ATCIs). Marketing practitioners play an instrumental role in producing and exacerbating ATCIs. Yet, I argue they have few incentives to fully investigate the underlying reasons, understand their scope, or find solutions to these potentially troublesome phenomena. Academic researchers, however, are uniquely poised to identify ATCIs, investigate them in depth by considering their industry-wide and society-wide import, develop appropriate theoretical frameworks, and design and test solutions to alleviate their effects. I develop these ideas by considering two ATCIs, falling response rates to customer surveys and customer reactance to frequent price changes. I also point out promising research opportunities for both these phenomena.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are commonly used for the identification of oil slicks at the sea surface, shared half in natural oil seeps and half in oil spill pollutions. We tasked satellite data to monitor oil seepages in the Lower Congo Basin considered as a first class natural laboratory for the study of natural oil releases. At least one SAR image was acquired every 12 hours during 21 days. Concomitantly, we have launched two autonomous underwater gliders for in-situ ocean measurements. The detection of ocean hydrocarbons using fluorescence sensors mounted on the subsea gliders provides an efficient proxy to monitor hydrocarbon concentration in seawater without sampling but also to evaluate the detection performance of the gliders by comparison with the SAR. A main result is that vertical pipes of hydrocarbon fluids imaged by the gliders correlate well with the location of active seep sites identified on SAR images. Complementary glider acquisitions also reveal that dissolved hydrocarbons remain trapped in underwater layers in relation with contrasts in water density.

TI  - Urban green space classification and water consumption analysis with remote-sensing technology: a case study in Beijing, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The water consumption of green space in a large region is difficult to attain through traditional methods. In this article, a practical method is developed using different sources of remote-sensing data. The green space was first derived from a high spatial resolution RapidEye image using the stratified classification method. Then the primary vegetation types of green space were identified using the object-oriented classification method. Afterwards regional green space evapotranspiration was inversed based on multi-temporal Landsat 8 images using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model. Finally, water consumption patterns for different types of vegetation were analysed, and regional water consumption was estimated. The method was applied to the northwest region of Beijing City with an area of 147.5km(2) where the green space area was 56.87km(2), and the deciduous broadleaf forest area was the largest among six vegetation types. The total quantity of water consumption for green space in the growing period in the study region was 41.52x10(6)m(3) (Mm(3)). The quantity of water consumed by different types of vegetation in an order from high to low were deciduous broadleaf forest, mixed green space, grassland, evergreen needleleaf forest, golf course, and aquatic vegetation, ranging from 17.43 to 0.79Mm(3). The results are helpful for identifying vegetation types, monitoring vegetation growth status, managing green space, and optimizing green space ecological functions in the Beijing region. The method presented in this article, having higher accuracy and more convenience, has great potential to be applied to other areas across the world.

TI  - Identifying the Cause of Abnormal Building Damage in Mining Subsidence Areas Using InSAR Technology
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Under normal geological and mining conditions, surface subsidence caused by underground coal mining generally adheres to current subsidence theory. However, due to the presence of complex geological structures, abnormal mining-induced surface deformation has become increasingly frequent. In this study, we investigate abnormal surface deformation and building damage caused by the excavation of working face 162601 in Xinsan Mine, Fengfeng Mining District, using seven RadarSat-2 SAR images from October 2013 to March 2014. The spatial distribution of surface deformation is identical to the strike of the F29 fault, indicating that the abnormal damage suffered by buildings in Shiqiao Village is related to the existence of this fault. A theoretical analysis and similitude material simulation experiments are conducted to determine the relationship between the fault and the mining-induced subsidence. In both instances, fault "activation" is the root cause of the abnormal surface deformation and building damage. This study reveals the mechanism behind abnormal damage in a mining-induced subsidence area by analyzing the InSAR derived spatial distribution of surface deformation. The findings of this study will contribute towards improving subsidence control theory, developing preventive measures against abnormal damage in subsidence-affected areas, and conserving the ecological environment of such areas.

AB  - Pixelwise remote sensing image classification has benefited from temporal contextual information encoded in time series. In this paper, we investigate the use of data-driven features extracted from time series representations based on recurrence plots, with the goal of improving the effectiveness of classification systems. Performed experiments considered the classification of eucalyptus plantations based on time series profiles. Achieved results demonstrate that the combination of recurrence plot representations with deep-learning features are a promising research venue for addressing pixelwise classification problems.

AB  - Soil classification is a method of encoding the most relevant information about a given soil, namely its composition and characteristics, in a single class, to be used in areas like agriculture and forestry. In this paper, we evaluate how confidently we can predict soil classes, following the World Reference Base classification system, based on the physical and chemical characteristics of its layers. The Random Forests classifier was used with data consisting of 6 760 soil profiles composed by 19 464 horizons, collected in Mexico. Four methods of modelling the data were tested (i.e., standard depths, n first layers, thickness, and area weighted thickness). We also fine-tuned the best parameters for the classifier and for a k-NN imputation algorithm, used for addressing problems of missing data. Under-represented classes showed significantly worse results, by being repeatedly predicted as one of the majority classes. The best method to model the data was found to be the n first layers approach, with missing values being imputed with k-NN (k = 1). The results present a Kappa value from 0.36 to 0.48 and were in line with the state of the art methods, which mostly use remote sensing data.

AB  - MODIS has 16 Thermal Emissive Bands (TEBs) whose wavelengths range from 3.7 mu m to 14.4 mu m and are calibrated using scan-by-scan observations of its on-board blackbody (BB). Specific Earth surface targets are used to track the long-term consistency, stability, and relative bias between the two MODIS instruments onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Previous studies displayed that cold targets have exhibited a relative bias (between Terra and Aqua MODIS Band 31 (11 mu m)) of less than 0.10K for more than a decade. However, these brightness temperatures are typically outside the MODIS BB calibration range. Hence, in-situ and remotely-sensed (RS) sea surface temperature (SST) measurements provide useful references for the more characteristic higher scene temperatures. Prior literature indicates that the MODIS TEBs have not been extensively evaluated for calibration stability using warmer targets for Collection 6.1 (C6.1), as it was recently implemented. This manuscript expands on the techniques previously applied to all TEBs using SST ocean buoys as reference for C6 by extending the long-term calibration stability and relative bias (between Terra and Aqua MODIS) discussion to present day and incorporating RS data provided by The Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) as proxy.

AB  - Around 600 million people worldwide live in coastal areas being exposed to coastal flooding. Global coastal flooding risk can be determined by the chance of surpassing a certain elevation (e.g. maximum height of the dunes) by the total sea level at the coast (depending on the beach slope). Considering this, beach slopes and local maximum elevation, hence topographies, are required on a global scale to assess globally changing flood risk exposure. Several satellite-derived Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) exist that cover most of the world and can provide these required data. In this study we explore the use of these DEMs (NASA' SRTM, JAXA' ALOS and Airbus' WorldDEM) in terms of beach slope, dune top elevation in comparison to airborne-LiDAR derived values. The results show the ability to extract coastal features, in particular at the upper beach face. The DEMs perform better in case of steep beaches with slopes between 0.1 - 0.15 The ability to extract beach slope accurately seems not to depend on the DEM' accuracy nor resolution but mainly a function of the reconstruction and/or sensing method. Coastal zones, often large area, require fine resolution for flood risks assessments. Very-high resolution satellites such as the Pleiades constellation can provide the required kind of detail (DEMs 2m x 2m).

AB  - In recent year, the flooding has been occurred with higher frequency at Long Xuyen Quadrangle areas of Mekong Delta, Vietnam. It was considered as a major natural disaster which effects on the physical and spiritual in people's life in this area. This research aims to generate a flood hazard map and assess the flood situation at Long Xuyen quadrangle in 2015. The MNDWI (Modification of Normalized Difference Water Index) extracting from Sentinel 2 image was used to map the flood extent at Long Xuyen quadrangle during rainy season in 2015. The statistics method was estimated correlation coefficient between flooding spatial distribution and hydrological stations on SPSS software. The results showed that the severe flood occurred from August to December in 2015. There were about 47.6% and 28.2% of the total area were inundated in October and August, respectively. The correlation between inundated areas and water level at Ha Tien and Chau Doc hydrological stations was 0.73 and 0.65 (p<0.01), respectively. The derived information was very essential and valuable for local managers in making decision on responding and mitigating to the flood disaster.

AB  - Background: The sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard procedure to assess the lymph node status in women with early stage breast cancer. It is uncertain whether SLNB is useful after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) given to women with locally advanced breast cancer. Materials and Methods: A literature search was conducted over a timeframe of 22 years (1994-2016). Forty-three studies evaluating the feasibility and accuracy of SLNB after NACT were identified. Results: The pooled identification rate was 88% and the pooled false negative ratio was 12%. Conclusion: SLNB could be considered as a standard procedure after NACT.

T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The city of Istanbul situated on a geostrategic location connecting two continents. In order to maintain transportation link between Europe and Asia, passages such as bridges or underwater tunnels were built on Istanbul strait. These are necessary manmade structures to enhance the continuity of East to West. Recently due to dense urbanization observed in Istanbul, available transportation infrastructure failed in meeting comfortable transportation facilities as a result of heavy traffic on southern side of the city. Therefore government decided to design new routes on northern side with a new bridge called Yavuz Sultan Selim. In this study the changes of Land Use/Cover structure before and after the bridge construction project were investigated using Remote Sensing and Landscape metrics. It was found that areal extension of impervious surfaces was increased as a result of fragmented natural landscape. It was concluded that quantitative monitoring of LULC changes in prior and post stages of such big projects is necessary to see positive or negative environmental impacts. This study summarizes the observed changes for the first time in the region by taking into account Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge and its connection highways.

M3  - Article
AB  - Water plays a vital role for the survival of life. We get water in different forms of precipitation and rain is the most beneficial of all types. The demand for water is very high throughout the Pakistan, especially where we have limited natural water resources. Summer monsoon season has profound impact in reducing water scarcity in Pakistan. Heavy rainfall results into floods whereas less rainfall creates drought which not only affects the economy but also puts human life in risk. The aim of this research is to manage the movement of clouds from heavy rainfall areas to those areas where there is paucity of water, through satellite using electromagnetic waves. To accommodate such a sensitive satellite data which is paramount to a country, it is required to have some special systems based on quantum mechanics that are more efficient and pregnable than conventional computers. The consequences will be very high of not securing weather management system, implies to country level disasters. In this paper we first discuss the technology behind quantum computer then proposed a secure architecture by employing quantum computers to ensure the security of data transmission for weather management system.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-lived bird species, such as the Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita), are exposed to heavy metals through air, water and food because they are at the highest point in the food supply chain Birds accumulate heavy metals in their bodies, organs, and in their feathers. The article aimed to investigate the trace element and heavy metal content of Northern bald ibis feathers using ICP-MS, as an endangered sentinel species, in order to both determine the contamination level of the area and evaluate the risk the species is facing. The study included 34 samples of feathers obtained from bald ibises released into their natural habitat. The results of the study showed that the average values of the trace elements (Na-11(+), Mg-24, Ca-20(+), K-39(+), P, Al-27(+), Fe-56(+)) which are necessary for the survival of living organisms were above 100 mu g g(-1), the second group of metals (Ti-205(+), Mn-55, Cu-63(+), Zn-66(+), Br-82) which are toxic to the body in high amounts were between 8.24-22.4 mu g g(-1) and those which are highly toxic at very low doses (Sb-51(+), Ni-60, As, Co-60, Ba-138(+), Pb-208(+), Cd-111(+), Mo, Se-75) were lower than 1 mu g g(-1). This study of the Northern Bald Ibis species, animals threatened by extinction due to environmental pollution, investigated their levels of heavy metal pollution in the feathers and indicates that Bald Ibis are possible bioindicators of environmental trace element contamination.

AB  - In developing countries such as Turkey, transportation investments maintain their popularity. With these investments, short-term solutions are being sought for urban infrastructure problems that are the result of growth-based model in construction sector. The main purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between transportation investments and urban sprawl. To this end, in the capital of Turkey, Ankara, the results of transportation investment in the protocol road that is the main route which provides transportation service to the north of the city, are evaluated in terms of urban sprawl. In this evaluation, Landsat satellite images of the study area are obtained every four years between 2004 and 2016, and land use is classified by remote sensing and GIS methods. As a result of this classification, it is observed that the built-up areas increased by 164 % and the total population by 33 %. Since the population of Ankara has increased by 27% between 2004 and 2016, it is seen that the study area has improved more rapidly with the contribution of the transportation investment, compared with the general urban area.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to determine the spatial distribution of total soil organic carbon (TSOC) content in surface soils in the karst ecosystem located in the Mediterranean region of Turkey. Land use types and depression areas were determined using Landsat8 and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, respectively. Topsoil samples (0-10 cm) were collected in 108 sites and analysed for soil pH, SOC, bulk density (BD), total nitrogen content (N) and particle size distribution. The exponential model was the best model to describe SOC contents, stable model for BD and circular model for TSOC. The SOC content in different land uses ranked as forest (4.10%) > rangeland (2.60%) > cropland (1.41%) areas. Mean TSOC content was identified as 27.22 MgCha(-1) in non-depressed areas and 48.71 MgCha(-1) in depressed areas. TSOC dramatically changed from none-depressed areas to depressed areas were identified in cropland (Delta TSOCcropland = 68.05%). Forest areas were more stable in view of the change of carbon sequestration compared to the other areas (Delta TSOCforest3 = 28.24%). Depression areas play very important role in terms of carbon storage capacity in the Karst ecosystem.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, some soil characteristics of fragmented green belt forest ecosystem were analyzed located in Ahir Mountain, Kahramanmaras. Fragmented forest areas were detected using Landsat8 satellite images and selected 30 different trial areas. pH, electrical conductivity (EC), texture, dispersion ratio (DR), field capacity (FC), organic matter content (OM), total Nitrogen (N) cation exchange capacity (CEC), lime content (LC), porosity (PR), bulk density (BD), grain density (GD) and water retention capacity (WRC) analyzes were performed with soil samples. Different fragmented forest size (0.54 ha and 69.9 ha) and distance (4.79 m-980 m) were determined in the study area. According to correlation analysis, the tendency of OM, PR and WRC to decrease, the tendency of BD and DR to increase as forest areas become smaller. According to the results of variance analysis, forest size and EC, clay, silt, OM, lime content, DR, FC, CEC, permeability, PR, BD, WRC, N, C/N values statistically (Sig<0.05) significant differences were determined. A significant difference could be detected between distance and pH only. According to the correlation analysis the small fragmentation of the forest and the long distance between them caused a significant reduction in the porosity values of soil and thus increased the soil erosion sensitivity and degradation. Green belt of forest ecosystems should be protected and not be allowed to 2B applications and convert to different land use.

AB  - Recently, Jiao et al. developed a snow kernel in the kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model framework to better characterize the anisotropic reflectance of pure snow surface. In this study, we assess performances of this snow kernel in the kernel-driven model framework and original kernel-driven model (hereinafter named the RTS and RTR models) in retrieving snow albedo based on the bicontinuous photon tracking (bic-PT) model. Our results show that: (1) The spectral albedo retrieved by these two models has a high consistency with the bic-PT model. However, the results of the spectral albedo for RTR model has a slight underestimation, especially at SZA=0 degrees in the visible bands, and the RTS model performs well compared with simulated data. (2) The albedo retrieved by these two models agrees reasonably well with the simulated data (R-2=similar to 0.9). Yet, the result of the RTR model underestimates 0.50% and 0.52% compared simulated albedo in the red and near-infrared bands, respectively, and the RTS model has a negligible bias for all bands. This assessment provide a priori knowledge of these two models performances, and thus, suggests the RTS model can be applied to future researches of estimating snow albedo.

AB  - Quantifying sand dune movements might contribute to deepen the understanding of local aeolian processes and offer decision support for disasters prevention. Different with the traditional field survey, the increasingly rich satellite images may provide the possibility to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of dune migration from the perspective of synoptic view. In this study, one new pairing strategy for optical imagery correlation is proposed. With this strategy, least-squares adjustment, and singular values decomposition (SVD) approaches, we investigate the dune displacement time series and rates near Minqin and Dunhuang oasis with the time series observations of Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel 2 (S2) collected from 2013 to 2018. The displacement time series and rates derived from this technique can better interpret the spatio-temporal dynamic patterns of dune migration, which is consistent with local wind conditions and other related observations. The technique provides an interesting attempt to investigate the dynamic characteristics of dune migration on dune-field scale with free-accessible optical satellite observations.

AB  - This paper presents a preliminary work of a simulation study for the evaluation of human-machine team (HMT) performance with assistance of a sentinel system under cyberattacks. Sentinel system is an intelligent agent of cyberattack-detection kit, whose user interface (UI) was designed and implemented as a proof-of-concept in the simulation. The goal for this sentinel system is to improve the pilots' Situation Awareness (SA) of the system vulnerability and resiliency, such that the HMT performance can be improved against disruptive events. Based on the literature of cyberattacks on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control systems, realistic mission operation and cyberattack scenarios were identified and implemented on a simulated UAV ground control station (GCS). In the follow-up experiment, up to twenty-four Air Force pilots will be instructed to supervise the UAVs under specific mission scenarios, and to respond for system recovery solutions generated on Sentinel UI after detection of cyberattacks. Understanding the interactive behaviors of the pilot and Sentinel under mission contexts and cyberattacks is expected to help improve HMT performance.

AB  - Full-polarimetric SAR image is very useful for the landslide monitoring especially in the well vegetation-covered mountainous region. GaoFen-3 (GF-3) is the first civil C-band fully polarimetric SAR satellite in China. In order to test the ability of GF-3 full-polarimetric SAR data on landslide monitoring, 2 cases of mountainous landslide in southwestern part of China in 2017 and 4 polarimetric decomposition methods (Pauli, Krogager, Freeman, and H-alpha/A) were selected. It was found that GF-3 full-polarimetric SAR data had a good performance on that. The scattering mode had changed from volume to surface mode by the four methods which indicated the vegetation covered has been destroyed by landslide. In the incoherent decomposition methods, the scattering mode in the vegetation region around the landslides had a more consistent result than that in the incoherent decomposition methods. It can also be a good tool to do the autonomous landslide recognition in a larger region combined with some change detection methods.

AB  - Satellite images with the advantage of wide coverage, short update times can help to establish land-cover maps quickly and efficiently. However, due to the influence of natural conditions, satellite images often contain noise, outliers, the boundary of the objects on the image is unclear and this makes it difficult for many clustering algorithms. The possibilistic fuzzy c-means clustering (PFCM) algorithm has advantages of both fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) and possibilistic c-means clustering (PCM) algorithms due to the simultaneous use of both fuzzy and function functions, but it also has limitations such as sensitivity with noise and outliers. The paper proposes a general semi-supervised possibilistic fuzzy c-means clustering (GSPFCM) algorithm to improve the clustering quality of PFCM. Our proposed method can solve problems that labeled data has very little compared to unlabeled data. Results of land-cover classification using satellite images (Landsat-7 ETM+, Sentinel-2A) show that the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy of classification results when compared to some previous methods.

T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, with the potential to metastasise to other parts of the body via the lymphatic system and the bloodstream. Melanoma accounts for a small percentage of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. Various imaging tests can be used with the aim of detecting metastatic spread of disease following a primary diagnosis of melanoma (primary staging) or on clinical suspicion of disease recurrence (re-staging). Accurate staging is crucial to ensuring that patients are directed to the most appropriate and effective treatment at different points on the clinical pathway. Establishing the comparative accuracy of ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT imaging for detection of nodal or distant metastases, or both, is critical to understanding if, how, and where on the pathway these tests might be used.ObjectivesPrimary objectivesWe estimated accuracy separately according to the point in the clinical pathway at which imaging tests were used. Our objectives were:to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound or PET-CT for detection of nodal metastases before sentinel lymph node biopsy in adults with confirmed cutaneous invasive melanoma; andto determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET-CT for whole body imaging in adults with cutaneous invasive melanoma:for detection of any metastasis in adults with a primary diagnosis of melanoma (i.e. primary staging at presentation); andfor detection of any metastasis in adults undergoing staging of recurrence of melanoma (i.e. re-staging prompted by findings on routine follow-up).We undertook separate analyses according to whether accuracy data were reported per patient or per lesion.Secondary objectivesWe sought to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET-CT for whole body imaging (detection of any metastasis) in mixed or not clearly described populations of adults with cutaneous invasive melanoma. For study participants undergoing primary staging or re-staging (for possible recurrence), and for mixed or unclear populations, our objectives were:to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET-CT for detection of nodal metastases;to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET-CT for detection of distant metastases; andto determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET-CT for detection of distant metastases according to metastatic site.Search methodsWe undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists as well as published systematic review articles.Selection criteriaWe included studies of any design that evaluated ultrasound (with or without the use of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)), CT, MRI, or PET-CT for staging of cutaneous melanoma in adults, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation or imaging with clinical follow-up of at least three months' duration. We excluded studies reporting multiple applications of the same test in more than 10% of study participants.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2)). We estimated accuracy using the bivariate hierarchical method to produce summary sensitivities and specificities with 95% confidence and prediction regions. We undertook analysis of studies allowing direct and indirect comparison between tests. We examined heterogeneity between studies by visually inspecting the forest plots of sensitivity and specificity and summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. Numbers of identified studies were insufficient to allow formal investigation of potential sources of heterogeneity.Main resultsWe included a total of 39 publications reporting on 5204 study participants; 34 studies reporting data per patient included 4980 study participants with 1265 cases of metastatic disease, and seven studies reporting data per lesion included 417 study participants with 1846 potentially metastatic lesions, 1061 of which were confirmed metastases. The risk of bias was low or unclear for all domains apart from participant flow. Concerns regarding applicability of the evidence were high or unclear for almost all domains. Participant selection from mixed or not clearly defined populations and poorly described application and interpretation of index tests were particularly problematic.The accuracy of imaging for detection of regional nodal metastases before sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was evaluated in 18 studies. In 11 studies (2614 participants; 542 cases), the summary sensitivity of ultrasound alone was 35.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 17.0% to 59.4%) and specificity was 93.9% (95% CI 86.1% to 97.5%). Combining pre-SLNB ultrasound with FNAC revealed summary sensitivity of 18.0% (95% CI 3.58% to 56.5%) and specificity of 99.8% (95% CI 99.1% to 99.9%) (1164 participants; 259 cases). Four studies demonstrated lower sensitivity (10.2%, 95% CI 4.31% to 22.3%) and specificity (96.5%,95% CI 87.1% to 99.1%) for PET-CT before SLNB (170 participants, 49 cases). When these data are translated to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 people eligible for SLNB, 237 of whom have nodal metastases (median prevalence), the combination of ultrasound with FNAC potentially allows 43 people with nodal metastases to be triaged directly to adjuvant therapy rather than having SLNB first, at a cost of two people with false positive results (who are incorrectly managed). Those with a false negative ultrasound will be identified on subsequent SLNB.Limited test accuracy data were available for whole body imaging via PET-CT for primary staging or re-staging for disease recurrence, and none evaluated MRI. Twenty-four studies evaluated whole body imaging. Six of these studies explored primary staging following a confirmed diagnosis of melanoma (492 participants), three evaluated re-staging of disease following some clinical indication of recurrence (589 participants), and 15 included mixed or not clearly described population groups comprising participants at a number of different points on the clinical pathway and at varying stages of disease (1265 participants). Results for whole body imaging could not be translated to a hypothetical cohort of people due to paucity of data.Most of the studies (6/9) of primary disease or re-staging of disease considered PET-CT, two in comparison to CT alone, and three studies examined the use of ultrasound. No eligible evaluations of MRI in these groups were identified. All studies used histological reference standards combined with follow-up, and two included FNAC for some participants. Observed accuracy for detection of any metastases for PET-CT was higher for re-staging of disease (summary sensitivity from two studies: 92.6%, 95% CI 85.3% to 96.4%; specificity: 89.7%, 95% CI 78.8% to 95.3%; 153 participants; 95 cases) compared to primary staging (sensitivities from individual studies ranged from 30% to 47% and specificities from 73% to 88%), and was more sensitive than CT alone in both population groups, but participant numbers were very small.No conclusions can be drawn regarding routine imaging of the brain via MRI or CT.Authors' conclusionsReview authors found a disappointing lack of evidence on the accuracy of imaging in people with a diagnosis of melanoma at different points on the clinical pathway. Studies were small and often reported data according to the number of lesions rather than the number of study participants. Imaging with ultrasound combined with FNAC before SLNB may identify around one-fifth of those with nodal disease, but confidence intervals are wide and further work is needed to establish cost-effectiveness. Much of the evidence for whole body imaging for primary staging or re-staging of disease is focused on PET-CT, and comparative data with CT or MRI are lacking. Future studies should go beyond diagnostic accuracy and consider the effects of different imaging tests on disease management. The increasing availability of adjuvant therapies for people with melanoma at high risk of disease spread at presentation will have a considerable impact on imaging services, yet evidence for the relative diagnostic accuracy of available tests is limited.PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARYHow good are ultrasound, CT, MRI, and PET-CT for identifying spread of disease in the body among people with melanoma? What is the aim of the review?We wanted to find out which imaging tests are better for identifying spread of disease among people with a first diagnosis of melanoma (primary staging) and among people with possible recurrence of melanoma (re-staging). We looked at the evidence for ultrasound, CT, MRI, and PET-CT and included 39 studies to answer these questions.Why are imaging tests for melanoma important?Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, with potential for metastases (cancer cells) to spread to the lymph nodes and other organs of the body. To make sure that people with melanoma receive the most appropriate and effective treatment, it is important to identify whether the disease has spread and to which parts of the body it has spread. This is called 'staging of disease'. Staging is done to find out if a melanoma has spread to regional lymph nodes or to lymph nodes close to the original melanoma, and to determine if the melanoma has spread to lymph nodes in other parts of the body or to organs of the body such as the liver or the brain (distant metastases). Imaging tests are tools that can be used to help find out how much the disease has spread. Several new treatments are now available for reducing the risk of spread of melanoma and for treating melanoma when it has spread.What was studied in the review?The review includes four imaging tests that create images of the body in different ways. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create images, CT scans use ionising radiation in the form of X-rays (a very low dose of radiation), and MRI uses large magnets and non-ionising radiation in the form of radio waves (which are not harmful) to generate images of the body. PET-CT requires injection of a weakly radioactive substance (FDG). The PET part of the scan identifies areas of the body that take up a lot of FDG (indicating possibly cancerous cells), and the CT part of the scan helps to improve image quality and to more accurately pinpoint areas using more FDG. Ultrasound can also be performed along with a fairly simple procedure called 'fine needle aspiration cytology' (FNAC), by which a very fine needle is used to take a small sample of cells from a lymph node that looks suspicious on ultrasound. A microscope is then used to identify whether or not the cells are malignant.Imaging can be used at different time points after diagnosis of melanoma. Healthcare providers can use imaging to look at the regional lymph nodes closest to the melanoma before a type of surgery called sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed. Sentinel lymph node biopsy takes out the lymph nodes that are most likely to have metastases inside them so they can be tested in a laboratory. Imaging can also be used after sentinel lymph node biopsy or in people with higher-risk melanoma to look for any spread of disease. Imaging can be used in people who were treated for melanoma at an earlier point and who might be having a recurrence of their disease. What are the main results of the review?What are the main results of the review?Ultrasound of regional lymph nodes before sentinel lymph node biopsyWe found 11 relevant studies including 2614 people. Three of these studies compared ultrasound on its own to ultrasound combined with FNAC. Results suggest that the combined procedure correctly identifies around one-fifth of people with metastases in the lymph nodes with very few false positive results (people with incorrect diagnosis of metastasis). These results can be illustrated by imagining a group of 1000 people with melanoma who are going to have sentinel lymph node biopsy, of whom 237 (24%) have metastases in the lymph nodes. The combination of ultrasound with FNAC potentially allows 43 people with lymph node metastases to be identified and avoid a sentinel lymph node biopsy, at a cost of two people with false positive results who might go on to have the wrong treatment. Those with metastases in the lymph nodes that are missed on ultrasound (false negatives) will be identified on subsequent SLNB.Whole body imaging (detection of any metastases)We found 24 studies, but only nine were clear about the point in the time course of disease that imaging was carried out. Six studies including 492 people looked at imaging for primary staging following a confirmed diagnosis of melanoma, and three studies in 589 people evaluated re-staging of disease in people with possible recurrence of disease.Most of the studies (6/9) considered PET-CT, two in comparison to CT alone, and three studies examined the use of ultrasound. We did not find any suitable studies of MRI in these groups.Overall results suggest that PET-CT is better for correctly identifying people with metastatic spread of disease who might be having a recurrence of disease (re-staging) than people who have a new diagnosis of melanoma (primary staging). PET-CT also seems to be better than CT for identifying spread of disease in both groups of people, but studies were very small and results might not be reliable.How reliable are the results of the studies included in this review?In most of our studies, a reliable diagnosis of spread of disease (or reference standard) was made by performing biopsy and by following up with people over time using clinical assessment and imaging. There was often a lack of detail on how patients were followed up and which tests were used. Lots of studies did not include people at clearly defined time points in the disease process, making it difficult to assess the relevance of their results. Reporting of application and interpretation of tests was poor. To whom do the results of this review apply?Thirty-three studies were done in Europe (85%), and the rest in North America (n = 4), Asia (n = 1), or Oceania (n = 1). The average age of people in the studies was between 50 and 67 years, and around half were men. Studies mostly included people with melanoma on any part of the body, but two included only people with melanoma on the head or neck. Studies often included people at different stages of disease, and we were not able to look at the accuracy of tests for people at any particular disease stage. Studies were small, and their results might not match what happens in real life.What are the implications of this review?Reviewers found some evidence to support the use of imaging with ultrasound combined with FNAC before sentinel lymph node biopsy, but further work is needed to establish cost-effectiveness. Limited evidence is available for whole body imaging for primary staging or re-staging of disease. Available evidence is focused on PET-CT; there are few comparisons with CT and no comparisons with MRI. Future research needs to look at more than test accuracy and must consider the effects of different imaging tests on treatment decisions for patients.How up-to-date is this review?The reviewers searched for and included studies published up to August 2016.**In these studies, biopsy and clinical or imaging follow-up were the reference standards (methods of establishing the final diagnosis).

TI  - Impact of Urban Surface Characteristics and Socio-Economic Variables on the Spatial Variation of Land Surface Temperature in Lagos City, Nigeria
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) and its consequences have become a key research focus of various disciplines because of its negative externalities on urban ecology and the total livability of cities. Identifying spatial variation of the land surface temperature (LST) provides a clear picture to understand the UHI phenomenon, and it will help to introduce appropriate mitigation technique to address the advanced impact of UHI. Hence, the aim of the research is to examine the spatial variation of LST concerning the UHI phenomenon in rapidly urbanizing Lagos City. Four variables were examined to identify the impact of urban surface characteristics and socio-economic activities on LST. The gradient analysis was employed to assess the distribution outline of LST from the city center point to rural areas over the vegetation and built-up areas. Partial least square (PLS) regression analysis was used to assess the correlation and statistically significance of the variables. Landsat data captured in 2002 and 2013 were used as primary data sources and other gridded data, such as PD and FFCOE, were employed. The results of the analyses show that the distribution pattern of the LST in 2002 and 2013 has changed over the study period as results of changing urban surface characteristics (USC) and the influence of socio-economic activities. LST has a strong positive relationship with NDBI and a strong negative relationship with NDVI. The rapid development of Lagos City has been directly affected by conversion more green areas to build up areas over the time, and it has resulted in formulating more surface urban heat island (SUHI). Further, the increasing population and their socio-economic activities including industrialization and infrastructure development have also caused a significant impact on LST changes. We recommend that the results of this research be used as a proxy tool to introduce appropriate landscape and town planning in a sustainable viewpoint to make healthier and livable urban environments in Lagos City, Nigeria.

TI  - Wind speed deficit downstream offshore wind parks - A new automised estimation technique based on satellite synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind speed deficit behind offshore wind parks in the German Bight are estimated from satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data using a new f lter technique. The def cit computation requires knowledge about the undisturbed wind f eld, which is derived by a two-dimensional (2D) convolution f lter tailored to the geometry of the wake. Both the wind direction and the size of the wind farm are taken into account. The most relevant scale for the wind speed defici estimator (WISDEM) is the width. of the wake. Unlike approaches used so far, the proposed technique is suitable for a full automisation of the estimation process. Furthermore, the rigorous definitio of the method and the reproducibility of the results can help in the consistent analysis of big data sets and the meaningful intercomparison of different geographic study areas. The f lter is applied to Sentinel-1 SAR data demonstrating the ability of the method to quantify and visualise wind speed deficit in a very efficie t way. The method also allows the study of the 2D structure of wakes, in particular curved shapes, which are found frequently. A statistical wake analysis is performed for one year of data showing the most frequent occurrence of wakes during the spring and summer seasons. According to mast measurements taken at the FINO-1 platform, this period is characterised by relatively strong atmospheric stability. Error estimates are derived for WISDEM wind speed defici estimates based on a 2D spectral analysis of a Sentinel-1 SAR data set acquired over one year. The impact of the wake f lter on the background wind spectrum is quantif ed by application of the convolution theorem. The defici estimation error is shown to increase with decreasing def cit values and with increasing wake width. The error is most sensitive to spectral components with wavelength in the across wake direction near 2 xi. The slope of the derived wind spectra is very close to the Kolmogorov k(-5/3) law, at least down to wave length of about 3 km. A signif cant dependence of the spectra on the atmospheric stability was found with energy levels increasing with instability. This relationship is beneficia for wake estimations, because wakes are more likely to occur in stable conditions, where relatively homogeneous background wind f elds lead to reduced def cit estimation errors.

TI  - Extraction Of Built-up Areas From Remote Sensing Imagery Using One-Class Classification
T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXV
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Mapping of built-up areas were always a main concern to researchers in the field of remote sensing. Thus, several techniques have been proposed to saving technicians from digitizing hundreds of areas by hand. Multiclass classifiers exhibit a very promising performance in terms of classification accuracy. However, they require that all classes in the study area to be labeled. In many applications, users may only be interested in a specific land class. This referred to as one-class classification (OC) problem. In this paper, we compare a Binary Support Vector Machine (BSVM) classifier, with two OC classifiers, OC SVM (OCSVM), and Presence and Background Learning (PBL) framework for the extracting built-up areas from Gaofen-2 and Aster satellites imagery. The obtained classification accuracies show that PBL provides competitive extraction results due to the fact that PBL is a positive-unlabeled method based on neural network in which large amounts of available unlabeled samples is incorporated into the training phase, allowing the classifier to model the built-up class more effectively.

AB  - The task of using multispectral satellite images of high spatial resolution WorldView-2 to determine the species and age composition of tree stands is considered. The solution of this task has great importance for the implementation of the program of the State Forest Inventory on the territory of the Russian Federation and for solution of a number of issues of strategic planning of forest management. The site of the Valuisky forest area of the Belgorod region is considered as a test area. The article shows the features of the joint use of spectral and textural features during the classification to solve the investigated problem. For thematic processing of high-resolution satellite images, a modified decoding method is used. A distinctive feature of the proposed algorithm is the ability to use more informative features while maintaining stability. Ground survey data are used to build training samples and validate results. The presented analysis of the results of thematic processing allows us to conclude that the proposed method can be used to determine the species composition and age classes of tree stands from satellite images. The obtained results can help automate the work on updating forest management data.

AB  - State forest inventory (SFI) program has been adopted for obtaining and updating forest inventory data in the territory of the Russian Federation. In the course of SFI, circular permanent sample plots (PSP) of constant radii are laid out. The number of PSP depends on the representation of plantations in the work object. Currently, high resolution satellite images are used within the framework of SFI mainly for updating the cartographic basis of forest inventory. We propose a method for joint processing of multispectral and panchromatic satellite images of high spatial resolution in order to retrieve the species composition and age classes of mixed forest stands. The method consists of several steps. The preprocessing step includes calibration, correction, matching satellite and ground data. The next step is obtaining regional specific training data from PSP measurements. For the retrieval of forest parameters, we propose the recognition method based on the modified ECOC (Error Correcting Output Codes) classifier and regularized stepwise forward feature selection. This allows us to combine spectral and texture features more effectively. The last postprocessing step is the correction of classification results using the methods of mathematical morphology. The proposed method contributes to the automation of updating data on species composition and age classes of forest stands and allows improving the efficiency of SFI works. The accuracy of the retrieval of the species composition of mixed forests using high-resolution satellite images is comparable with the accuracy of the standard archival ground inventory data.

TI  - The Estimation and Evaluation of Shoreline Locations, Shoreline-Change Rates, and Coastal Volume Changes Derived from Landsat Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline-change data are of primary importance for understanding coastal erosion and deposition as well as for studying coastal morphodynamics. Shoreline extraction from satellite images has been used as a low-cost alternative and as an addition to traditional methods. In this work, satellite-derived shorelines and corresponding shoreline-change rates and changes in volumes of coastal sediments have been estimated and evaluated for the case of the data-rich North-Holland coast. This coast is globally unique for its long in situ monitoring record and provides a perfect case to evaluate the potential of shoreline mapping techniques. A total of 13 Landsat images and 233 observed cross-shore profiles (from the JAaRlijkse KUStmeting [JARKUS] database) between 1985 and 2010 have been used in this study. Satellite-derived shorelines are found to be biased in seaward direction relative to the JARKUS-derived shorelines, with an average ranging 8 m to 9 m over 25 years. Shoreline-change rates have been estimated using time series of satellite-derived shorelines and applying linear regression. The satellite-derived shoreline-change rates show a high correlation coefficient (R-2 > 0.78) when compared with the JARKUS-derived shoreline-change rates over a period of 20 and 25 years. Volume changes were calculated from the satellite-derived shoreline-change rates using assumptions defining a closure depth. Satellite-derived volume changes also show a good agreement with JARKUS-based values. Satellite-derived shorelines compare better with in situ data on beaches that have intertidal zone widths ranging from one-to two-pixel sizes (30 m-60 m). The results show that the use of Landsat images for deriving shorelines, shoreline-change rates, and volume changes have accuracies comparable to observed JARKUS-based values when considering decadal scales of measurements. This shows the potential of applying Landsat images to monitor shoreline change and coastal volume change over decades.

In this article we propose a new approach to calculation of functions with random arguments, which is a technique of fast computations, based on the idea of parallel computations and the application of numerical probability analysis. To calculate a function with random arguments we apply one of the basic concepts of numerical probabilistic analysis as the probabilistic extension. To implement the technique of fast computations, new method based on parallel recursive calculations is proposed.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next- Generation Satellites XXIII
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) project provides observed flux and cloud products for the climate community. To accomplish this goal, the CERES project must merge six CERES instruments, along with two MODIS sensors, two VIIRS sensors, and twenty GEO imagers in order to produce a climate-quality dataset. The input satellite sensors must be properly calibrated and known sensor anomalies must be removed before operational processing. The GEO imager radiances are radiometrically scaled to the Aqua-MODIS C6.1 calibration reference using all-sky tropical ocean ray-matched (ATO-RM) coincident radiance pairs. However, monthly-ATO-RM calibration analysis is inadequate for detecting sensor L1B radiance anomalies, which may span only a few days. The CERES monthly-ATO-RM calibration method was modified to increase the number of ray-matched pairs in order to apply the ATO-RM calibration method on a daily basis. The goal of the daily-ATO-RM calibration method is to detect slight L1B radiance anomalies by limiting the daily gain noise over the record. To test the daily-ATO-RM calibration method, the GOES-16 record, with known L1B radiance anomalies, was evaluated. The GOES-16 channel 2 (0.65 mu m) daily-ATO-RM gain standard error is 1% and thereby allows for confident identification of days with calibration anomalies greater 3%, or three standard deviations (sigma). The daily-ATO-RM calibration method detected the three known L1B calibration anomalies, however, there were two daily gains that exceeded three s that were not associated L1B anomalies. Similarly, the daily-ATO-RM was able to identify the calibration discontinuity of NOAA20-VIIRS in the Land SIPS L1B V001 processing.

AB  - Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved great results in pansharpening. Most pansharpening methods with CNN are based on PNN [1] inspired by super-resolution methods with CNN and learn the pansharpening of downsampled images. In this work, we presented a novel framework for pansharpening based on two desired property of pansharpened images: downsampled pansharpened images become low-resolution multi-spectral images (spectral consistency) and panchromatic images are approximated by weighted addition of each bands of pansharpened images (spatial consistency). Our framework train CNN to learn this spectral-spatial consistency. The advantage of our framework is that there is no scale mismatch between training and test data. We applied our method to Landsat-8 images and compared it with some previous methods.

TI  - LIDAR FOR MEASUREMENT OF OZONE VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE ATMOSPHERE
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main climate-forming factors from the point of view of the radiation balance of the atmosphere are greenhouse gases, primarily ozone and gas components of the ozone cycles. Currently, operational information on their vertical distribution in the atmosphere can be obtained only using remote sensing, including laser one (lidar), which determines the relevance and scientific significance of this scientific and technical problem.The main aim of the study is to develop a lidar for studies of vertical distribution of ozone in the upper troposphere-stratosphere in the altitude range similar to (5-45) km at 299/341 and 308/353 nm in comparison with satellite measurements.Methods: differential absorption lidar (DIAL).Results. The paper introduces the lidar for measuring ozone vertical distribution above the city of Tomsk (56,5 N, 85,0 E). Lidar sounding of ozone was carried out on pairs of wavelengths 299/341 and 308/353 nm. The wavelengths used allow monitoring ozone vertical stratification within the upper troposphere, the stratosphere. The results of ozone lidar sensing as of Januar), 2018 are given in comparison with the data of the satellites IASI/MetOp and AURA, as well as with the mid-latitude model of Kruger. The difference between the lidar profiles of ozone and the model ones is natural for the dynamics of the ozone layer on different observation days. The large differences in ozone vertical distribution in the values of lidar and the MetOp satellite at the altitudes of the stratosphere are explained by the need to correct the a priori model in the algorithm for reconstructing satellite data.Conclusion. The lidar was developed to measure ozone profiles in the upper troposphere-the stratosphere. It allows reconstructing the vertical distribution of ozone in the altitude range similar to (5 45) km at wavelengths 299/341 and 308/353 nm.

TI  - Influence of soil moisture on mesoscale convective initiation in central Mexico
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of deep moist convection in a large part of Mexico is a condition typical of summer; the effects of land surface processes and mesoscale circulations are usually not included in the diagnostic and forecasting of deep moist convection, mainly because of the scale at which they occur. This study examines the effect of the soil moisture fluxes on convective initiation in the central region of Mexico during the summer periods of 2010-2014. Other aspects considered are the function of the average flux of the boundary layer in the transport of humidity towards the initiation zone. Remote sensing satellite data used are the cloud-top temperature, soil moisture, land surface temperature and precipitation. The results show over the initiation zone an increase in the soil moisture and a decrease in the land surface temperature in the direction of the mean flux at low levels. The soil moisture anomaly (SMA) presents a temporal variability being May, the composite more similar to previous studies, initiation zone drier and warmer than surroundings. The background low-level winds have an important role in the displacement of convection core and creating different features of SMA and land surface temperature anomaly.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - The present paper is devoted to multimodal texts and multimedia technology used in education, particularly in foreign language classroom.The recent years are characterized by the increased volume of visual information, which has a higher information energy capacity and wider pragmatic potential than verbal information. Visual information, impact on individuals, is becoming more widespread, breaking the monopoly of the printed text on the transfer of information.In education and academic discourse a natural language is the most important and most versatile, but not the only means of communication. The study shows that it is in the interaction with characters of a different nature, verbal signs most successfully realize their communicative functions. Nonverbal means in education evolved from a secondary, subordinate source component in an equivalent text, not inferior in importance to verbal row.The experience of teaching and learning is inherently multisemiotic and multimodal. A multimodal text captures the interaction of different codes, semiotic systems, symbols, signs, and rules of their combination with each other to transmit information. Multimodal or digital text is fundamentally different from printed books, even if they are equipped with colorful pictures. Its semantic range is extremely wide and changeable; such components as picture sound and video can complement and reinforce the message written in letters.The objectives of the paper are to analyze the notion of multimodal text in the modern digital environment, to describe the types of multimodal texts, correlate them with students' learning types and to justify its use in teaching foreign languages.When learning a foreign language students differ from each other according to learner's inner characteristics such as personality, aptitude, language learning strategies, cognitive style, motivation and worldview. In multimodal texts the meaning is communicated through combinations of two or more modes. Modes include written language, spoken language, and patterns of meaning that are visual, audio, gestural, tactile and spatial.The hypothesis that we put forward is the following: as multimodal text involves all channels of information perception, the cognitive and creative abilities of students will be developed at a higher level, since interest in the subject will increase and key competences will be formed and developed.Such learning styles as Kolb's model, Jungian learning styles, Neil Fleming's VARK model and discursive and communicative approaches comprise the methodological base of the research. The mentioned models describe methods of teaching and identify the different ways that students learn best according to their learning type. At each stage of work, the methods that best meet the goals and objectives of the research were involved.The obtained results can be used in the process of teaching foreign languages to choose the best means of communication in contemporary foreign language classroom depending upon the learner's inner characteristics.

TI  - L-band remote-sensing increases sampled levels of global soil moisture-air temperature coupling strength
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to their shallow penetration of the soil column, remote-sensing (RS) soil moisture retrievals are often considered ill-suited for measuring the strength of soil moisture-air temperature coupling. Consequently, soil moisture proxies derived from antecedent rainfall considerations are commonly applied in their place. However, the suitably of satellite RS products has not yet been examined for newer soil moisture products derived from L-band microwave radiometry. This study globally compares correlations between monthly soil moisture and the monthly number of summertime hot days (NHD) for the case of three separate RS-based soil moisture products and a fourth soil moisture proxy derived from the standard precipitation index (SPI). Compared with SPI-based estimates, C- and X-band RS soil moisture products demonstrate a significantly (at p = 0.05 [-] confidence) weaker correlation with NHD. However, 2010-2018 L-band Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) based soil moisture-NHD correlation is generally comparable to the SPI case. Furthermore, utilizing higher-precision 2015-2018 soil moisture products from the L-band Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission further strengthens soil moisture-NHD correlation and leads to stronger sampled correlations than SPI over global hot spot regions (significant at p = 0.05 [-] confidence). Combined with the general equivalence of monthly surface and root zone soil moisture anomalies, these results suggest that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, i.e. the relative size of soil moisture signal and random observation error variances) of RS-based surface soil moisture product, instead of their vertical measurement depth, is the key limiting factor determining their ability to quantify land atmosphere coupling strengths. Based on this, we argue that L-band soil moisture products have reached a sufficient level of SNR to be of value for the study of land-atmosphere coupling.

TI  - Differentiating the lymph node metastasis of breast cancer through dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.
T2  - BJR open
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lymph node metastasis is an important trait of breast cancer, and tumors with different lymph node statuses require various clinical treatments. This study was designed to evaluate the lymph node metastasis of breast cancer through pharmacokinetic and histogram analysis via dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective analysis was conducted to quantitatively evaluate the lymph node statuses of patients with breast cancer. A total of 75 patients, i.e. 34 patients with lymph node metastasis and 41 patients without lymph node metastasis, were involved in this research. Of the patients with lymph node metastases, 19 had sentinel lymph node metastasis, and 15 had axillary lymph node metastasis. MRI was conducted using a 3.0 T imaging device. Segmentation was carried out on the regions of interest (ROIs) in breast tumors under DCE-MRI, and pharmacokinetic and histogram parameters were calculated from the same ROIs. Mann-Whitney U test was performed, and receiver operating characteristic curves for the parameters of the two groups were constructed to determine their diagnostic values.RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic parameters, including Ktrans, Kep, area under the curve of time-concentration, and time to peak, which were derived from the extended Tofts linear model for DCE-MRI, could highlight the tumor areas in the breast and reveal the increased perfusion. Conversely, the pharmacokinetic parameters showed no significant difference between the patients with and without lymph node metastases. By contrast, the parameters from the histogram analysis yielded promising results. The entropy of the ROIs exhibited the best diagnostic ability between patients with and without lymph node metastases (p < 0.01, area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic = 0.765, specificity = 0.706, sensitivity = 0.780).CONCLUSION: In comparison with the pharmacokinetic parameters, the histogram analysis of the MR images could reveal the differences between patients with and without lymph node metastases. The entropy from the histogram indicated that the diagnostic ability was highly sensitive and specific.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This research gave out a promising result on the differentiating lymph node metastases through histogram analysis on tumors in DCE-MR images. Histogram could reveal the tumors heterogenicity between patients with different lymph node status.

AB  - The foliage Clumping Index (CI) is a key vegetation structure parameter for leaf area index (LAI) estimating and ecological modelling. Previously, several global CI products have been retrieved from the Collection V005 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) products with a temporal resolution of one year, one month or 8 day. The Collection V006 MODIS BRDF products provide a chance to retrieve a global CI product with higher temporal resolution and data accuracy. However, the large size of the Collection V006 MODIS BRDF products (similar to 150 terabyte from January 2001 to December 2017) and the retrieved CI products (similar to 9 terabyte) increases the difficulty in retrieving and publishing the global CI product. In this study, we develop a software tool that enable users to produce CI product of their desired date, region and temporal resolution based on the Collection V006 MODIS land cover type and BRDF products. The software tool reduces the requirements of the processing and storage capacity for researchers and thus facilitate the publication and widespread application of the CI product.

AB  - Infected areas and damage levels due to pest and disease have been growing seriously according to the global climate changes. The government department of plant protection normally collects the crop pest and disease information by manual inspection, which is unable to provide timely and spatially continuous crop growth status and pest / disease development over large areas. The manuscript aims to bring together and produce cutting edge research to provide crop pest and disease monitoring and forecasting information, integrating multi-source (Earth Observation-EO, meteorological, entomological and plant pathological, etc.) to support decision making in sustainable management of pest and disease. Taking national disease - a fungal disease of wheat rust and national pest - a serious insect pest locust as the experimental object, we conducted the following research: 1) the sensitive spectral features of rust and locust with capability of stresses differentiation would be identified or formed based on field hyperspectral data and UAV hyperspectral images for detection, 2) multi-sources of data that are composed by remote sensing images (eg. GF, Landsat and Sentinel) and meteorological observations would he integrated to evaluating habitat of rust and locust in farmland level, 3) multi-temporal remote sensing images and vegetation ecological dataset are combined to provide environmental information of rust and locust dispersion, and forecast the damaged areas and levels in regional scales. Moreover, an automatic system is developed to do the disease and pest timeseries monitoring and forecasting, also the visual display of the thematic maps and analysis reports. The system is constructed based on WebGIS platform. It selected Browser/Server (B/S) architecture, access the system interface through a web browser, simple, quick and easy to operate. And, it could timely, efficiently, quantitatively do the extraction and analysis of crop pest and disease occurrence and developing information, also produce pest and disease thematic maps and scientific report. The crop pest and disease monitoring and forecasting system, can provide effective information of pest and disease developing for our agricultural sector, provide a scientific basis to formulate pest and disease prevention and control measures, and also provide data basis and technical support for the crop network management. Based on the system, we analysed the damaged situation and changes of national wheat rust in 2019, and locust in Tianjing 2019. The results would not only promote efficacy of pest and disease management and prevention by improving the accuracy of monitoring and forecasting, but also help to reduce the amount of chemical pesticides, which could thus guarantee the food security and sustainable development of agriculture in China.

AB  - The urban heat island phenomenon not only increases the surface temperature of cities but also reduces biodiversity, which means a significant environmental adverse impact.Urban heat island phenomenon can also have a negative effect on the quality of life of the citizen. Therefore, efforts should be made to reduce urban heat island phenomenon and a policy study should be conducted. This study analyzed urban heat island phenomena with the characteristics of built environment including physical environment characteristics and socio-economic characteristics of Seoul. The data on urban heat island was measured based on Landsat8 high-resolution satellite images using spatial information system. According to the Moran’s I test, the urban heat island phenomenon is showing spatial autocorrelation. The study adopted a spatial regression model to control this spatial autocorrelation. The main analysis results are as follows: population density, residential area ratio and bus stop density are the main factors that negatively affect urban heat island phenomenon. On the other hand, gross floor area of residential buildings, NDVI, have been shown to be major factors in reducing urban heat island phenomena.In particular, it was confirmed that NDVI has significant impact on reducing urban heat island phenomena. Meanwhile, the population ratio under national basic living security level, the population ratio aged over 65 and the share of elderly persons who lives alone have not shown statistically significant relationships. In the future, effective policy development will be needed to reduce the phenomenon of urban heat islands considering the characteristics of the built environment.

TI  - Digital Conquerors: <i>Minecraft</i> and the Apologetics of Neoliberalism
T2  - GAMES AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The widespread popularity of sandbox games, and Minecraft in particular, may be a recent phenomenon, but their appeal may be much older. Rather than representing a wholly new development in gaming, these games may participate in a larger media ecology that flatters a neoliberal worldview. This research calls for greater attention to the coercive economic assumptions encoded in game mechanics. Drawing on scholarship in ludology, postcolonial studies, and phenomenology, it suggests that sandbox games like Minecraft habituate players to myths of empire and capital that rationalize political and economic inequality. More than simply offering a blank slate for player creation, Minecraft rewards players for assuming their entitlement to the world's resources and thus their superiority over other inhabitants of the game world.

T2  - ISPRS ICWG III/IVA GI4DM 2019 - GEOINFORMATION FOR DISASTER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Geo-information for Disaster Management (Gi4DM)
CL  - Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC
AB  - New contributions to disaster research need to address the increasing vulnerability of informal settlements in a changing climate situation. Informal settlements are frequently built in hazardous areas and are often left out of traditional disaster risk management concepts. Hence, formal and informal societal structures, as well as technical systems to warn against, handle or mitigate natural hazards, need to evolve. Within the project Inform@Risk we are addressing these issues based on a case study in Medellin (Colombia). Here, as a result of civil conflicts informal dwellings were partly constructed by people displaced from rural areas. They are mainly located in the urban peripheral areas along steep and unstable slopes, where the resettlement of all inhabitants at risk of landslides is unfeasible. This contribution presents the technical infrastructure and the concept to incorporate geodata from different sources in an integrated landslide early warning system for some selected informal settlements of Medellin. Special attention is given to possibilities on how building societal institutions, supported by information systems, increases local resilience. Using geoformation as a basis, we will combine classical participatory planning methods with digitally assisted concepts. These include combining satellite and UAS based remote sensing data with terrestrial sensor networks, crowd sourcing and citizen science to collect volunteered geographic information about the settlement and its environmental parameters, as well as distribute this information and disseminate warnings to the local population.

M3  - Article
AB  - The results of simulation of Black Sea ecosystem dynamics with the use of a three-dimensional interdisciplinary model are given. An important feature of the simulation is the assimilation of measurement data of satellite color scanners. The calculations were made for fifteen years starting from 1998. The result was a set of three-dimensional biogeochemical fields of the Black Sea on a regular grid with a time step of 1 day. The major biogeochemical parameters of the marine ecosystem were analyzed. The quality of the obtained fields was evaluated by comparison with the available data of in-situ measurements.

TI  - A Characterological Function of the Liturgical Text in the Novel "The Ways of Heaven" by I. Shmelev
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article focuses upon the liturgical text in Ivan Shmelev's novel "The Ways of Heaven" and its characterological function as a major component of ethnopoetics. The author himself classifies his novel as "spiritual" and peculiarities of this genre find expression in the principles of creation of the characters capable of self-evolution, inherent in the literature of psychological realism. The most relevant in the novel's hierarchy of determinants is a "spiritual determinism" where the participation of Divine Providence in development of the plot and heroes' characters becomes essencial. Liturgical quotations remain inseparably related to the images of the main characters throughout the whole novel, referring to different stages of their spiritual paths. More significantly, quotations are actively involved in the characters' internal decision-making process as well as in their formation. A remarkable variety of theological meanings shapes the spiritual space of the novel and of the protagonists, frequently serving as a means of characterization. Testifying to the author's Orthodox worldview, heroes' "ways of heaven", regarded in soteriological terms, are of two types: the one of discovering Christ (the hero) and the other one of following Christ (the heroine). The detailed analysis of the key liturgical quotations in their relation to Victor Alexeevich and Dania Koroleva (the protagonists) revealed a particular significance of the liturgical quotations in structuring the heroes' inner space. We believe it to be Ivan Shmelev's artistic discovery and a testimony to a "new aesthetics", defined by a spiritual quest of the author himself.

TI  - RELATION BETWEEN WATER TRANSPARENCY AND THE REFLECTION OF THE LANDSAT 5 TM IMAGE OF THE PASSO REAL RESERVOIR
T2  - GEOAMBIENTE ON-LINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present research verified the relationship between water transparency data identified in situ and the values of spectral reflection of the Passo Real Reservoir obtained through Landsat 5 images. The water transparency was measured in situ with the use of a Secchi disc in 31 sample points of the reservoir. The satellite images used for the temporal analysis of the water reflection were produced by the Landsat (Land Remote Sensing Satellite) 5 TM (Thematic Mapper). The image processing for the correction of atmospheric effects and the transformation of digital numbers into reflection values were done with the ENVI 5.0 software. The spacings of the transparency data and reflection values were done by the interpolation in the Spring 4.3.3 software. The reflection data in the space-temporal context indicates that the main alterations correspond to the tributary sectors of the Passo Real Reservoir. The spectral data of the Band 3 of the TM sensor were related with the water transparency variable in the 31 sample points. The models generated by linear regression showed that the water transparency have significant correlation with the reflection data in the red region.

TI  - Association between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and sentinel lymph node positivity in thin melanoma
T2  - ANAIS BRASILEIROS DE DERMATOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy in thin invasive primary cutaneous melanoma (up to 1mm thick) is a controversial subject. The presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes could be a factor to be considered in the decision to perform this procedure.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and lymph node metastases caused by thin primary cutaneous melanoma.METHODS: Cross-sectional study with 137 records of thin invasive primary cutaneous melanoma submitted to sentinel lymph node biopsy from 2003 to 2015. The clinical variables considered were age, sex and topography of the lesion. The histopathological variables assessed were: tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, melanoma subtype, Breslow thickness, Clark levels, number of mitoses per mm(2), ulceration, regression and satellitosis. Univariate analyzes and logistic regression tests were performed as well the odds ratio and statistical relevance was considered when p <0.05.RESULTS: Among the 137 cases of thin primary cutaneous melanoma submitted to sentinel lymph node biopsy, 10 (7.3%) had metastatic involvement. Ulceration on histopathology was positively associated with the presence of metastatic lymph node, with odds ratio =12.8 (2.77-59.4 95% CI, p=0.001). The presence of moderate/marked tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was shown to be a protective factor for the presence of metastatic lymph node, with OR=0.20 (0.05-0.72 95% CI, p=0.014). The other variables - clinical and histopathological - were not associated with the outcome.STUDY LIMITATIONS: The relatively small number of positive sentinel lymph node biopsy may explain such an expressive association of ulceration with metastatization.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with thin invasive primary cutaneous melanoma, few or absent tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, as well as ulceration, represent independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis.

AB  - This research was carried out in Caceres - Mato Grosso, on the Paraguay River, upper Pantanal - Brazil, and its objective was to analyze the changes of coverage with the advance of land use and occupation along the period from 1980 to 2013. Thus, images LANDSAT were georeferenced, classified and processed, while the thematic class, quantified and edited. In addition to the cabinet procedures, fieldwork was carried out, which allowed the identification of the main ways of using the banks and channels of the river system. The research showed that the main economic activity developed is cattle ranching with gradual values over the years - the same more than doubled from 1984 to 2003. The results evidenced important transformations in the landscape with significant suppressions of the vegetal cover, that is, in the period analyzed, in more than 50% of the area there was some kind of transformation - deforestation or conversion of uses (pasture areas for urban expansion). Concerning to the edges' channel, engineering repairs were the main alternatives adopted to contain the erosive processes, especially in the urban perimeter and in concave sections, parallel to BR-070.

AB  - Climate change and increase of extreme weather events, besides the numerous consequences, affect significantly and put in risk the agriculture sectors. Natural disasters, such as floods and wildfires, are responsible for a great loss in agriculture production. National governments together with international bodies make an important effort to cooperate towards the response and resilience when a disaster occurs. In this frame the European Earth Observation Programme - Copernicus provides a series of observation data, in-situ measurements and services related, amongst others, to different types of disasters. Concerning the availability of this big volume of observation data, the aim of DiAS (Disaster and Agriculture Sentinel Applications) project is to revise the existing knowledge on remote sensing methods for mapping the extent of natural and/or man-made disaster over agricultural areas and propose improvements. The developed methodology will be implemented in a Decision Support System (DSS), which will be freely available and easy-to-use by non-experts. In this paper, the developed methodology focuses on mapping floods over agricultural areas. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery are used as input information for the comparison analysis before and after the event. The reference for results' evaluation is the corresponding information delivered by Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS). Although, the evaluation results are in good agreement when they could be used, a reference of higher accuracy is needed in order to estimate accurately the quality of the output products.

T2  - FORUM FOR DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - A central motivation for engaging in humanitarian development assistance, nongovernmental as well as governmental, is to facilitate wellbeing of people considered poor and needy. During the last decades, there has been a debate about a more comprehensive understanding of development and wellbeing. Wellbeing has become a main concept in humanitarian aid targeting needy people in the global south. This article focuses on how the concept of wellbeing is understood in varying traditions and contexts that meet in development cooperation: by Andean indigenous peoples, by Western aid workers based in evangelical Faith-based organizations working in the Andes, and by the Capability Approach 'CA', which has influenced development cooperation considerably the last decades. How will differences in understanding wellbeing by the actors affect the performance and the results of development cooperation? What consequences may it have for the cooperation if the aid worker is not aware of the differences?

AB  - These last years, earth observation imagery has significantly improved. Public satellites such as WorldView-3 can now produce images with a Ground Sample Distance of 31cm, reaching a resolution equivalent to aerial images. Perhaps more importantly, the revisit frequency has also been greatly enhanced: providers such as Planet can now acquire images of a given ground location on a daily basis. These major improvements are fueled by an increasing demand for frequent objects detection. An application generating a particular interest is vehicle detection. Indeed, vehicle detection can give to public and private actors valuable data such as traffic monitoring and parking occupancy rate estimations. Several datasets, such as DOTA or VehSat, already exist, allowing researchers to train machine learning algorithms to detect vehicles. However, these datasets focus on relatively high definition and expensive aerial and satellite images. In this paper, we will present a method for detecting vehicles on medium resolution satellite images, with a GSD comprised between 1 and 5 meters. This approach can notably he used on Planet images, allowing to monitor traffic of an area on a daily basis.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Medical Imaging - Computer-Aided Diagnosis

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate breast MRI radiomics in predicting, prior to any treatment, the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with invasive lymph node-positive breast cancer for 2 tasks: 1) prediction of pathologic complete response and 2) prediction of post-NAC lymph node (LN) status. Our study included 158 patients with 19 showing post-NAC complete pathologic response (pathologic TNM stage T0,N0,MX) and 139 showing incomplete response, 42 patients were post-NAC LN-negative and 116 were post-NAC LN-positive. Only pre-NAC MRIs underwent computer analysis, initialized by an expert breast radiologist indicating index cancers and metastatic axillary sentinel lymph nodes on DCE-MRI images. Forty-nine radiomic features were extracted, both for the primary cancers and for the metastatic sentinel lymph nodes. Since the dataset contained MRIs acquired at 1.5T and at 3.0T, we eliminated features affected by magnet strength as demonstrated in the Mann-Whitney U-test by rejection of the null-hypothesis that samples were selected from populations having the same distribution. ROC analysis was used to assess performance of individual features in the 2 classification tasks. Eighteen features appeared unaffected by magnet strength, of which only a single pre-NAC tumor feature outperformed random guessing in predicting pathologic complete response. On the other hand, 13 and 10 pre-NAC lymph node features were able to predict pathologic complete response and post-NAC LN-status, respectively, with as most promising feature the standard deviation within the LN at the first post-contrast DCE-MRI time-point (areas under the ROC curve: 0.79 (standard error 0.06) and 0.70 (0.05), respectively).

AB  - Cloud and snow detection is one of the most important tasks in remote sensing (RS) image processing areas. Distinguishing cloud and snow from RS images is a challenging task. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) band has been widely used for ice/snow detection. However, due to the lack of SWIR in high-resolution multispectral images, such as ZY-3 satellite imagery, traditional SWIR-based methods are no longer practical. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of cloud and snow detection, in this work, we propose an effective convolutional neural network (CNN) with a multi-level/scale feature fusion module (MFFM), a channel and spatial attention module, and an encoder-decoder network structure for cloud and snow detection form ZY-3 satellite imageries. The MFFM can aggregate multiple-level/scale feature maps from the backbone network, ResNet50, for providing representative semantic feature information for cloud and snow detection. Channel and spatial attention module (CSAM) is used to further refine the semantic feature maps that outputs by MFFM thus making the network have better detection performance. The encoder-decoder structure allows the proposed CNN to restore detailed object boundaries thus making the detection results more accuracy. Experimental results on the ZY-3 satellite imageries dataset demonstrate that the proposed network can accurately detect cloud and snow, and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - The Ejin Banner, as an essential and vulnerable oasis area, locates in arid and semi-arid region, northwestern China. To assess the water and vegetation variation from 2000 to 2015, this study selected the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) as indicators to interpret the Landsat TM/OLI images. The results indicate that the water have witnessed a significant increase from 0 to 70.7283 km(2) during this period. Meanwhile, the area of vegetation had a growth of 92.8%, rising from 137.3508 km(2) in 2000 to 264.7539 km(2) in 2015. In addition, the meteorological statistics test suggested that the warmer and wetter climate promoted the vegetation and water resources recover. Important as the oases are, results suggest that the oases reversion can effectively suppress the expansion of the Badain Jaran Desert, emphasizing the value of the oases protection for preventing the eco-environment deterioration and desertification.

AB  - Classifier fusion methods integrate complementary information from multiple classifiers or detectors and can aid remote sensing applications such as target detection and hyperspectral image analysis. The Choquet integral (CI), parameterized by fuzzy measures (FMs), has been widely used in the literature as an effective non-linear fusion framework. Standard supervised CI fusion algorithms often require precise ground-truth labels for each training data point, which can be difficult or impossible to obtain for remote sensing data. Previously, we proposed a Multiple Instance Choquet Integral (MICI) classifier fusion approach to address such label uncertainty, yet it can be slow to train due to large search space for FM variables. In this paper, we propose a new efficient learning scheme using binary fuzzy measures (BFMs) with the MICI framework for two-class classifier fusion given ambiguously and imprecisely labeled training data. We present experimental results on both synthetic data and real target detection problems and show that the proposed MICI-BFM algorithm can effectively and efficiently perform classifier fusion given remote sensing data with imprecise labels.

TI  - A Method for Surface Water Body Detection and DEM Generation With Multigeometry TanDEM-X Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel method for surface water body detection and digital elevation model (DEM) generation simultaneously using multigeometry TanDEM-X pairs. The amplitude, coherence, and slope maps of the multigeometry data are used to detect water bodies. An iterative strategy by considering the perpendicular baseline and phase error is used to generate the fused DEM. The proposed method can overcome the disadvantages of the empirical threshold-based methods and the geometric distortion in the single-geometry synthetic aperture radar (SAR) water body detection. It can also improve the quality and accuracy of the fused DEM, especially in water areas and areas with geometric distortion. Five ascending and four descending TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X pairs covering Zhuhai, China, were selected to validate the proposed method. Visual interpretation and quantitative analyses were applied to evaluate the accuracy of the detected water bodies and the fused DEM. The results show that: 1) more complete water body information is obtained compared with the single-geometry empirical threshold-based method; 2) the fused DEM refined by the detected water bodies displays good performance in separating water bodies from linear objects, e.g., bridges, and calculating the elevations of water areas; 3) the proposed method yields a high reliability and accuracy in surface water body detection, with a correctness of 90.2% and an overall accuracy of 92.0%; and 4) the accuracy of the fused DEM is about 3.4 m in a mountainous area and 10.2 m in an urban area with a high density of tall buildings.

AB  - Relatively few studies have been published to reveal the vegetation status of the largest wetland reserve in China-Yancheng National Nature Reserve. In this study, the vegetation coverage (VC) was estimated based on Landsat data and dimidiate pixel model, then the variation of VC from 1998 to 2018 was evaluated by coefficient of variation and change rate, finally the VC in 2022 was predicted by cellular automata and Markov chain. Results showed the VC was relatively stable during the past 20 years, the VC (0-0.1) occupied most. Three improving trends occupied more than three deteriorating trends, overall, VC presented a trend of stability and improvement. The core zone showed a higher VC, a higher stability and a greater proportion of improving trends. The VC in 2022 would remain stable. This study revealed the vegetation status when migrant birds wintered here, it provided data support for scientific and effective decisions in future protection.

T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th WESTPAC International Scientific Conference
CL  - Qingdao, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of inland water body requires a high spatial resolution and a multiband narrow spectral resolution, which makes the fusion between panchromatic (PAN) and multi-spectral (MS) images particularly important. Taking the Daquekou section of the Qiantang River as an observation target, four conventional fusion methods widely accepted in satellite image processing, including pan sharpening (PS), principal component analysis (PCA), Gram-Schmidt (GS), and wavelet fusion (WF), are utilized to fuse MS and PAN images of GF-1. The results of subjective and objective evaluation methods application indicate that GS performs the best, followed by the PCA, the WF and the PS in the order of descending. The existence of a large area of the water body is a dominant factor impacting the fusion performance. Meanwhile, the ability of retaining spatial and spectral informations is an important factor affecting the fusion performance of different fusion methods. The fundamental difference of reflectivity information acquisition between water and land is the reason for the failure of conventional fusion methods for land observation such as the PS to be used in the presence of the large water body. It is suggested that the adoption of the conventional fusion methods in the observing water body as the main target should be taken with caution. The performances of the fusion methods need re-assessment when the large-scale water body is present in the remote sensing image or when the research aims for the water body observation.

AB  - In this study, we used the multi-temporal Landsat images of 1985, 2000 and 2017 to evaluate the land use/cover change of Horqin sandy land in the past 33 years by using the classification method of Support Vector Machine (SVM). The study shows that grassland, cropland, woodland, water area and sandy land changed significantly during this period. The analysis of Land cover/use in the Horqin sandy land reveals two separate specific trends between the first 16 years (1985-2000) and the subsequent 17 years (20012017). Generally, grassland and woodland decreased gradually, replaced by a significant increase in cropland area and a gradual expansion of sandy land prior to 2000. This could be related to the household responsibility system. While after 2000 the grassland increased. This could be due to the policy of returning grazing to grassland. From 1985 to 2017, however, the water area has continued to decrease.

AB  - In this study, the long term land subsidence (similar to 15 years) in the Mexico City, Mexico mapped using two in-house InSAR methods GEOS (Geoscience and Earth Observing Systems Group)-ATSA (Advance Time-Series Analysis) and GEOS-SBAS (Small Baseline Subset) has been presented. An IDW (Inverse Distance Weighted)-based integration module and MLR (maximum likelihood regression)-based M-estimator are introduced to further enhance these two methods. The land subsidence was continuously mapped using Envisat (2004 - 2007), ALOS-1 (2007 - 2011), CSK (2011 - 2014), ALOS-2 (2014 - 2018), and Sentinel-1 (2015 - 2017) datasets. A comparison between InSAR time series and GPS measurement shows that the subsidence rates were consistent over 2004 - 2018, and five evidences were given to support this argument. The 15-year accumulated subsidence map was generated and the maximum subsidence over 4.5 m was found. By comparing the InSAR result with land use map, it has been found that there are some relations between the local subsidence rate and land use type while residential usage and consumption of the groundwater has quite significant contribution to the local subsidence rate.

T2  - POLISH POLAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the recent ice regime variations in the Kara Sea have been described and quantified based on the high-resolution remote sensing database from 2003 to 2017. In general, the Kara Sea is fully covered with thicker sea ice in winter, but sea ice cover is continuously declining during the summer. The year 2003 was the year with the most severe ice conditions, while 2012 and 2016 were the least severe. The extensive sea ice begins to break up before May and becomes completely frozen at the end of December again. The duration of ice melting is approximately twice than that of the freezing. Since 2(X)7, the minimum ice coverage has always been below 5%, resulting in wide open-waters in summer. Furthermore, the relevant local driving factors of external atmospheric forcing on ice conditions have been quantitatively calculated and analyzed. Winter accumulated surface air temperature has been playing a primary role on the ice concentration and thickness condition in winter and determining ice coverage index in the following melt-freeze stage. Correlation coefficients between winter accumulated temperature and ice thickness anomaly index, the ice coverage anomaly index, duration of melt-freeze stage can approach -0.72, -0.83 and 0.80, respectively. In summer, meridional winds contribute closely to summer ice coverage anomaly index, with correlation coefficient exceeding 0.80 since 2007 and 0.90 since 2010.

TI  - Spatial downscaling algorithm of TRMM precipitation based on multiple high-resolution satellite data for Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily precipitation data from 42 stations in Inner Mongolia, China for the 10 years period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2010 was utilized along with downscaled data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) with a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees for the same period based on the statistical relationships between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), meteorological variables, and digital elevation models (DEM) using the leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation method and multivariate step regression. The results indicate that (1) TRMM data can indeed be used to estimate annual precipitation in Inner Mongolia and there is a linear relationship between annual TRMM and observed precipitation; (2) there is a significant relationship between TRMM-based precipitation and predicted precipitation, with a spatial resolution of 0.50 degrees x 0.50 degrees; (3) NDVI and temperature are important factors influencing the downscaling of TRMM precipitation data for DEM and the slope is not the most significant factor affecting the downscaled TRMM data; and (4) the downscaled TRMM data reflects spatial patterns in annual precipitation reasonably well, showing less precipitation falling in west Inner Mongolia and more in the south and southeast. The new approach proposed here provides a useful alternative for evaluating spatial patterns in precipitation and can thus be applied to generate a more accurate precipitation dataset to support both irrigation management and the conservation of this fragile grassland ecosystem.

AB  - In remote sensing, Digital Terrain Models (DTM) generation is a long-standing problem involving bare-terrain extraction and surface reconstruction to estimate a DTM from a Digital Surface Model (DSM). Most existing methods (including commercial software packages) have difficulty handling large-scale satellite data of inhomogeneous quality and resolution, and often need an expert-driven manual parameter-tuning process for each geographical type of DSM. In this paper we propose an automated and versatile DTM generation method from satellite data that is perfectly suited to large-scale applications. A novel set of feature descriptors based on multiscale morphological analysis are first computed to extract reliable bare-terrain elevations from DSMs. This terrain extraction algorithm is robust to noise and adapts well to local reliefs in both flat and highly mountainous areas. Then, we reconstruct the final DTM mesh using relative coordinates with respect to the sparse elevations previously detected, and induce preservation of geometric details by adapting these coordinates based on local relief attributes. Experiments on worldwide DSMs show the potential of our approach for large-scale DTM generation without parameter tuning. Our system is flexible as well, as it allows for a straightforward integration of multiple external masks (e.g. forest, road line, buildings, lake etc.) to better handle complex cases, resulting in further improvements of the quality of the output DTM.

AB  - Four Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) / Operational Land Imager (OLI) remote sensing images in 2000, 2004, 2011 and 2014 are used and a single-window algorithm is adopted to quantitatively retrieve land surface temperatures (LST) of Taiyuan City. A density slicing method is used to classify the city as an urban heat island. Land use types are classified in combination with a support vector machine. The relationships between LST and land use/land cover types, vegetation coverage and impermeable surfaces are analyzed, and those relationships between surface temperatures and impervious surfaces, vegetation, bare land and water bodies are studied quantitatively. The results show that the influence of the impervious surface on LST is much larger than that of vegetation, bare land and water bodies. The main factors affecting the surface temperature of Taiyuan City in the past 14 years are identified. Although the area of vegetation and bare land has either slightly increased or decreased, the increase in impervious surface area is the direct cause of the urban heat island effect of Taiyuan.

TI  - Land-surface temperature retrieval from Landsat 8 single-channel thermal infrared data in combination with NCEP reanalysis data and ASTER GED product
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in the climatological, hydrological, ecological, and meteorological studies. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) on board the Landsat 8 is a key instrument to collect thermal infrared (TIR) data. The Landsat series sensors provide continuously acquired collection of space-based TIR data. In this study, we proposed a method for retrieving LST from Landsat 8 TIRS single-channel data. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data in conjunction with the Moderate Resolution Transmittance Code 5 were used to correct atmospheric effects. The ASTER Global Emissivity Database product was used to correct the effects of surface emissivity. In situ LST measurements were collected by eight and four SI-111 infrared radiometers in the study areas A and B, respectively. The in situ LST was used to validate the retrieved LST. For the study area A (sands), the bias varies from approximately -1.3 to 1.7K, and the root mean square error (RMSE) from approximately 1.2 to 2.1K. For the study area B (grasslands/snow), the bias ranges from approximately -1.0 to 0.4K, and the RMSE from approximately 1.1 to 1.5K. To further compare the retrieved LST and the in situ LST at coarser pixel scale, all of the retrieved LST and the in situ LST were, respectively, averaged as the corresponding LST at 1km pixel scale (e.g. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The biases of the differences between the two averaged LST at 1km pixel scale for all TIRS scenes are approximately -0.2 and -0.5K for the study areas A and B, respectively, and the RMSE values are approximately 1.2 and 1.0K for the study area A and B, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed method can be used to retrieve LST from single-channel TIR data with a reasonable accuracy.

AB  - Jinsha River Valley area is located in the complex fault zone of southwest China. As the region has been strongly affected by landslide disaster in the past few years, it is very imperative to detect the regions with large deformation around this area. InSAR technique is widely used in obtaining the terrain displacement, especially for this inaccessible areas. Thus this work utilizes time series InSAR (TSInSAR) method to investigate the landslide risk for the Ruba-Lagang section of Jinsha River by using Sentinel-1 images. Several landslide-hidden areas are identified and the deformation time series for them are analyzed, which will be of great importance to the disaster prevention and local infrastructure construction.

AB  - Due to the different shapes of buildings and the cross-distribution with various surface types around them, it is difficult to extract buildings in high precision using traditional classification methods. The deep learning method based on neural network can mine useful information of remote sensing image in depth and improve the accuracy of building recognition. However, the application of neural network in building extraction is limited because of the large number of parameters involved and the large demand for training samples. In order to improve the accuracy of building extraction in remote sensing images by using deep learning method, identity skip connection is inserted into U-net network for samples training, which effectively reduces the number of parameters, significantly reduces the size of the model, and avoids the gradient explosion caused by the deepening of the number of layers, and obviously improves the accuracy of segmentation. By comparing the results of different layers, it is shown that with the deepening of layers, the accuracy increases.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed the use of the water balance, precipitation, temperature and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to determine the optimum moment for evaluating infestation by the nematode Meloidogyne exigua in a rubber tree plantation by remote sensing. Nineteen sampling points were defined, divided into three areas, with high and low defoliation degrees, on a property in the Triangulo Mineiro region, where soil and root samples were collected for nematological analysis. Monthly digital images (OLI - Landsat 8 sensor) were obtained from August 2015 to August 2016. Rainfall, temperature and water balance were analyzed. The latter had no correlation with the indices; in contrast, temperature and precipitation correlated directly with NDVI. The best months for nematode soil infestation analysis were December, January and February, while for root infection it was August.

AB  - Soil erosion constitute a major threat to human lives and assets worldwide, as well as a major environmental disturbance. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with Geographical Information System (GIS) has been the most widely used model in predicting and mapping soil erosion loss. Remote sensing has particular utility for soil loss model applications, providing observations on several key aspects of Land use and Land cover (LULC) linked to the cover-management factor C of the RUSLE, over wide areas and in consistent and repeatable measurements. A free and open source GIS application coupled with remote sensing data was developed under QGIS software allowing to improve the C factor functionality: (i) automatically download satellite images; (ii) clip with the study case and; (ii) perform a supervised or unsupervised classification, in order to obtain the land cover classification and produce the final C map. One of the most efficient supervised classification algorithms is the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Random Forest (RF) is also an easy-to-use machine learning algorithm for supervised classification. The automation of this functionality was based in the R and SAGA software, both integrated in QGIS. To perform the supervised classification, SVM and RF methods were incorporated. The overall accuracy and Kappa values are also automatically obtained by the R script and GRASS algorithms, which allows to evaluate the result obtained. To perform the unsupervised classification K-means algorithm from SAGA was used. This updating in RUSLE application improve the results obtained for C factor and help us to obtain a most accurate estimation of RUSLE erosion risk map. The application was tested using Sentinel 2A images in two different periods, after and before the forest fire event in Coimbra region, Portugal. In the end, the three resulted maps from SVM, RF and K-means classification were compared.

TI  - Meandering Evolution and Width Variations: A Physics-Statistics-Based Modeling Approach
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many models have been so far proposed to simulate and understand the long-term evolution of meandering rivers. Nevertheless, some modeling problems still need to be solved, for example, the physical soundness of long-term simulations when width variations are accounted for. The present work proposes the use of statistical tools to capture the spatiotemporal variations of channel width and to embed their effect into a physics-statistics-based model that simulates the river bank evolution. Erosion and deposition processes are assumed to act independently, with a specific shear stress threshold for each of them. In addition, the width evolution is linked with a river-specific probability density function. The analysis of a representative sample of meandering configurations, extracted from Landsat images, indicates that in many cases a generalized extreme value distribution nicely describes the along-channel distribution of cross-section width. For a given river, the parameters of this distribution keep almost constant in time. Significant variations are observed only after cutoff events that shorten the length of the river. The constraint of the river width based on the assumption of a generalized extreme value distribution ensures physically plausible configurations as the river moves throughout the floodplain, adapting continuously its local width. The application of the model to a reach of the Ucayali River appears to reasonably reproduce the planform river morphodynamics and yields realistic values of the cross-section widths.

AB  - Droughts have significant negative impacts on environment, economy and population of Kazakhstan. Despite the magnitude of the negative impacts of the droughts, the drought monitoring system is largely missing in the country. To fill the existing gap, we analyzed the spatial distribution of the drought in the country by calculating drought index data set based on medium resolution image time series for years 2000-2016. Further, we linked the information with the land cover map to understand better spatial distribution of the drought occurrence and its magnitude. The performed straightforward assessment, when linked with the ground-based observations, could be used by national authorities to establish nation-wide drought monitoring system.

In this case study, production oil was said to be wasted in the desert, in Northern Africa, in the vicinity of a production area. If a dark spot can be seen on the satellite images, how can we state for sure that it is hydrocarbon, or water? How can we answer that question, as a partner, or a government agency with no access or no easy access to the site? Hyperspectral data are not available. How far can we go with open-access multispectral, thermal and SAR images to answer the question and provide a tool to monitor the facility over time.

AB  - Park Go-gyeong published a lot of pieces of children’s literature including children’s songs(children’s poems), children’s stories(novles for boys), reviews and compositions. This is not a small amount in comparison to children’s literature produced by other authors of the time. The challenge is to identify the various pen names under which he has composed these pieces. In addition to ‘Park Go-gyeong(朴古京, 朴苦京)’, he wrote as ‘Mok Go-gyeong(木古京)’, ‘Park Sun-seok (朴順錫, 朴珣石)’, ‘Park Chun-geuk(朴春極)’, or ‘Gaksital(각시탈)’.Park Go-gyeong was a social activist active around Jinnampo(鎭南浦) of Pyeongannamdo and the general area of Pyeongyang(平壤). He has a record of having been imprisoned for taking part in the reconstruction of the Communist Party in Korea. In line with his active participation in social movement based on class theory, Park Go-gyeong’s literature overall reflects clear class consciousness, which is especially well manifested in his review, “The Way to Editing for the Public(「대중적 편집의 길로」)”.At the same time, Park Go-gyeong’s works keep a certain distance from being completely immersed in class theory, as he pays much attention to the formal aspects of literature such as literary devices.Children’s songs(children’s poems) by Park Go-gyeong are identified to be around 71 pieces. Initially it stresses literary expression, but gradually reinforces class-consciousness. This appears to result from not only his own perception of reality, but also the second redirection theory in literary trend of the 1930s. Nonetheless his works are considerably different from contemporary class-theory based children’s literature, which expressed unfiltered antagonism and contempt.Something similar can be said for his writings of children’s literature. Out of his 6 pieces, only “Where Lies were Formed(「거짓말이 생긴 곳」)” shows even partial class-consciousness. This would relate to the fact that his literary worldview does not comprise of class theory solely, and that this was immediately following his life in prison.As a prolific children’s literature author during the Japanese colonial period, Park Go-gyeong is a writer who ought not be overlooked. How he attempts to balance himself between literary form and the awareness for Japanese colonial regime is remarkable. Thus he succeeded in maintaining the quality of his pieces.

AB  - The article discusses the cultural philosophical paradigm of Thanatos - Eros, which manifested itself in the old Russian "Tale of Peter and Fevronia of Murom". The question is raised about the transformation of the folk tradition, about the emergence of ritual reality in the text of the story. The Christian worldview of the era of the creation of this work did not exclude the ideas of mythological and folklore consciousness. The story, chosen as the research material, is unique in its content, since it reflects the processes of transition from the traditional to the "revolutionary" type of culture, which is captured at the level of details and symbols in the text; it reflects socio-cultural transformations. As the main text in the text, the borderline (marginal) situation was chosen - illness and marriage and the complex of motives associated with it (the motive for searching for a narrowed bride, the motive for things of the wife, the motive for snaking, etc.). The methodological basis of the work was the materials of V.Ya. Propp, V.Ya. Petrukhina, V.M. Zhirmunsky, E.M. Meletinsky, M.B. Plukhanova. The comparative typological, structural-functional and systematic method of text analysis is applied. As a result, the contradiction between the interaction of two cultural traditions is resolved. Ethnographic parallels made it possible to read the work of Old Russian bookishness in a different way; raise the question of the interaction of folklore and literary tradition in theoretical terms.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) and nonhuman primates have been inextricably linked since the virus was first discovered in a sentinel rhesus macaque in Uganda in 1947. Soon after ZIKV was epidemiologically associated with birth defects in Brazil late in 2015, researchers capitalized on the fact that rhesus macaques are commonly used to model viral immunity and pathogenesis, quickly establishing macaque models for ZIKV infection. Within months, the susceptibility of pregnant macaques to experimental ZIKV challenge and ZIKV-associated abnormalities in fetuses was confirmed. This review discusses key unanswered questions in ZIKV immunity and in the pathogenesis of the congenital Zika virus syndrome. We focus on those questions that can be best addressed in pregnant nonhuman primates and lessons learned from developing macaque models for ZIKV amid an active epidemic.

AB  - Algorithms for the generation of a bedfast/floating lake ice product from Sentinel-1A/B synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data were implemented, cross-compared, and validated for various permafrost regions (Alaska, Canada and Russia). The algorithms consisted of: 1) thresholding; 2) Iteration Region Growing with Semantics (IRGS); and 3) K-means. The thresholding algorithm (92.4%) was found to perform slightly better on average than the IRGS algorithm (90.1%), and to outperform K-means (85.3%). The thresholding algorithm was therefore selected for implementation of a processing chain to generate a novel bedfast/floating lake ice product. Using a time series of Sentinel-1 SAR data, the new map product shows the day of year (DOY) when the ice becomes bedfast or remains afloat for individual lake sections.

AB  - The increased number of free and open satellite images has led to new applications of these data. Among them is the systematic classification of land cover/use types based on patterns of settlements or agriculture recorded by satellite imagers, in particular, the identification and quantification of temporal changes. In this paper, we will present guidelines and practical examples of how to obtain reliable image patch classification results based on data mining techniques for detecting possible changes that can appear within a data set. Here, we will focus on a scenario, namely forest monitoring using Earth observation Synthetic Aperture Radar data acquired by Sentinel-1, and multispectral data acquired by Sentinel-2.

AB  - In the following, we describe highly-automated image analysis approaches that help us classify satellite images, and allow us to monitor dynamical changes in image time series. We concentrated on flooding events within the Danube Delta as seen by the European Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, and describe systematic processing approaches to extract pre-defined categories from the image data (being either Synthetic Aperture Radar or multispectral images). One basic tool to monitor dynamical changes is to analyze and compare the compressibility of image patches using their Normalized Compression Distances. These distances can be converted into similarity matrices providing reliable maps of surface changes. The accuracy of these change maps was quantified for several typical test cases. In addition, we analyzed the performance of an alternative active learning approach, where Gabor filters and Weber local descriptors were used to extract features from image patches that were classified and semantically annotated. Then one can perform data analytics and generate maps based on the extracted semantic annotations; again, we used several representative test cases for benchmarking.

TI  - Tropical Cyclone Diurnal Cycle Signals in a Hurricane Nature Run
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The diurnal cycle of tropical convection and tropical cyclones (TCs) has been previously described in observational-, satellite-, and modeling-based studies. The main objective of this work is to expand on these earlier studies by identifying signals of the TC diurnal cycle (TCDC) in a hurricane nature run, characterize their evolution in time and space, and better understand the processes that cause them. Based on previous studies that identified optimal conditions for the TCDC, a select period of the hurricane nature run is examined when the simulated storm was intense, in a low shear environment, and sufficiently far from land. When analyses are constrained by these conditions, marked radially propagating diurnal signals in radiation, thermodynamics, winds, and precipitation that affect a deep layer of the troposphere become evident in the model. These propagating diurnal signals, or TC diurnal pulses, are a distinguishing characteristic of the TCDC and manifest as a surge in upper-level outflow with underlying radially propagating tropical squall-line-like features. The results of this work support previous studies that examined the TCDC using satellite data and have implications for numerical modeling of TCs and furthering our understanding of how the TCDC forms, evolves, and possibly impacts TC structure and intensity.

AB  - Cropland mapping is very important for food security, policy development, land use planning, and environmental protection. Scientists have developed methods and techniques for cropland mapping with remote sensing image data. Both single date and multitemporal image data are used for generation of cropland and crop type maps. Multitemporal image data has advantages over single date image data from reliability and accuracy point of view because multitemporal image data allows to eliminate seasonality of vegetation. In this paper, the authors present new algorithm for cropland and crop type mapping with multitemporal Landsat image data. The algorithm requires for analysis of all Landsat scenes observed during one year and if needed, scenes in some years back to compensate clouds and cloud shadows. Phenology of land cover is constructed based on six bimonthly cloud free land covers that were automatically classified using the selected scenes. By grouping land covers within two months to six land covers of periods January-February, March-April, May-June, July-August, September-October, and November-December we create six bimonthly cloud free land covers that formulate a database for mapping cropland and crop types. By analysis of 50 Landsat scenes of path/row number 128/45 (northwest of Vietnam) observed mainly from 2017, 2016 and 2015 we success to map upland cropland and 14 crop types with area ranging from 145,143 ha to 3,373 ha per crop type. The study pointed out that phenology characterized by six bimonthly land covers is acceptable to identify cropland distribution and some specific crop types. For better results, apparently we need higher temporal resolution of image data. Due to uncertainty of the atmosphere, it is almost impossible to rely only on optical remote sensing data to achieve high temporality of data so application of multitemporal SAR data could be a way to overcome this obstacle.

TI  - Feasibility of the use of touch imprint cytology for the assessment of axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer in the rural setting
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for the assessment of axillary lymph nodes (ALN) is the gold standard in the management of breast cancer. Patients with a positive SLN will undergo an axillary clearance on a later date. Intra-operative assessment of the SLN is a valuable tool and often performed using Frozen section (FS) in certain tertiary centres. Most rural centres do not have access to this facility due to lack of resources. As patients often travel long distances for specialist treatments within the rural networks, having access to an easy-to-perform intra-operative SLN assessment tool is invaluable.AimsThe aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and sensitivity of touch imprint cytology (TIC) and if it can be applied in the rural setting in assessment of SLN in invasive breast cancer.Methods100 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer were recruited in this cross-sectional study. The management of these patients was not altered in any manner. SLNs were assessed intra-operatively by TIC prior to being sent for formal histological (FH) analysis. We compared the intra-operative TIC assessment with the formal histopathology. This gave an indication of whether TIC assessment was comparable to alternative intra-operative SLN assessment.ResultsFrom the 100 patients selected, seventeen patients were found to be true positive, and 78 were found to be true negative. This gave TIC assessment a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.89 and a Negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.96. The limitations of TIC were its lack of sensitivity with micrometastasis.ConclusionOur trial was limited by the small number of patients enrolled. TIC lacks the sensitivity in assessing micrometastasis and therefore we do not recommend its use in the intra-operative assessment of SLN.

TI  - Monitoring forest disturbance using change detection on synthetic aperture radar imagery
T2  - APPLICATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Applications of Machine Learning
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Although monitoring forest disturbance is crucial to understanding atmospheric carbon accumulation and biodiversity loss, persistent cloud cover, especially in tropical areas, makes detecting forest disturbances using optical remotely sensed imagery difficult. In Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, forest clearings exhibit reduced backscatter as well as increased interferometric coherence. We combined SAR and Interferometric SAR metrics from Sentinel-1 data collected in Borneo between in 2017 and 2018 and applied unsupervised change detection methods to the time series. The results show that a simple log-ratio based detector performs similarly to a more sophisticated anomalous change detection algorithm. The log-ratio detector was deployed to compare a 2017 mean Sentinel-1 composite with a 2018 mean composite. Approximately 20000 newly deforested areas were identified in 2018, for a total of 3000 km(2). The findings suggest that leveraging SAR data to monitor deforestation has the potential to achieve better performance than Global Forest Watch, the current Landsat based gold standard. Future work will leverage the short revisit time (6-12 days) of Sentinel-1 as an opportunity for continuous monitoring of deforestation. The improved time resolution associated with SAR observations in cloudy regions might enable the identification of areas at risk of deforestation early enough in the clearing process to allow preventive actions to be taken.

AB  - Thales Alenia Space UK Limited (TAS-UK) have been at the forefront of the migration of terrestrial MEMS technology to the space domain for over the last 10 years. This has resulted in the development of the MEMS Rate Sensor products SiREUS, SENTINEL-3 and MTG, and the Rover Vehicle Inertial Measurement Unit (RVIMU) for ExoMars. The evolution of these developments towards next generation MEMS Gyro products is targeting both a significant reduction in recurring cost and an evolutionary improvement in performance over the next 5 years for telecom satellites, in particular within large constellations, with the products offering benefits to other space domains. The next evolution of the Unit design is based on the development and qualification of a modular gyro unit that maximizes the potential of the latest Silicon Sensing MEMS detector that provides medium level performance, but in a reduced cost package. The initial phase of the development is based on qualifying an FPGA/discrete electronics Unit and the MEMS Gyro Detector in order to provide a flight capability from mid-2019. Further enhancements address the completion of the development and qualification of a radiation hardened mixed signal ASIC, which will provide significant cost-reduction opportunities for both standalone and constellation usage. This paper presents the status of the on -going SiREUS NG I 0 Gyro development and the parallel detector qualification, as well the overall product development planning to place the technology in context.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Proglacial areas represent transitional zones between glacial and periglacial landscapes. Non-glacial processes in the proglacial zone might evolve under periglacial conditions, and vice versa periglacial processes often occur in proglacial zones. Hence, periglacial morphodynamics constitute an inherent part of proglacial studies and are therefore presented here in the context of the research project PROSA. To get an overview of periglacial morphodynamics in the Upper Kaunertal, we (i) established a permafrost model based on BTS measurements, (ii) analysed meteorological data in order to verify ground indications for thermal-contraction cracking and (iii) analysed both geophysical and remote sensing data for the identification of permafrost creep and thermokarst phenomena. In addition, this chapter includes a case study on the morphodynamics of a complex rock glacier in the Riffltal, a tributary valley to the Upper Kaunertal. Results show a diverse genesis and development of different rock glacier parts and lobes, which are mainly related to glacial advances during the Egesen and LIA stadials. More recent developments are largely dependent on (i) sediment sources and pathways constituting diverse states of activity, (i) dynamic interactions between the tongues and (iii) the topographic surrounding, that is already causing dynamic inactivity of parts of the rock glacier.

TI  - Image Segmentation Based Approach for the Purpose of Developing Satellite Image Spatial Information Extraction for Forestation and River Bed Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND GRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of remote sensing spatial information from multi spectral satellite imagery can be used to obtain multiple representation of the image and capture different structure lineaments. Pixels are grouped using clustering and morphology based segmentation for region based spatial information. This is used to calculate the spatial features of the contiguous regions by classifying the region into the statistics of the pixel properties. In the proposed work, analysis of Google Earth images for identification of morphological patterns of the river flow is done for remote sensing image using graph-cuts. Multi-temporal satellite images acquired from Google Earth to identify the digital elevation is used to formulate the energy function from images to compare the displacement in pixel value using similarity measure. A method is proposed to solve nonrigid image transformation via graph-cuts algorithm by modeling the registration process as a discrete labeling problem. A displacement vector associated to each pixel in the source image indicates the corresponding position in the moving image. The transformation matrix produced from change in the intensity of the pixels for a region is then optimized for energy minimization by using the graph-cuts algorithm and demon registration technique. The proposed study enhances the advantages of regional segmentation in order to know homogeneous areas for optimal image segmentation and digital footprints for change in the river bed patterns by identifying the change in LANDSAT data from temporal satellite images. By applying the proposed multi-level registration method, the number of labels used in each level is greatly reduced due to lower image resolution being used in coarser levels. The results demonstrate that the lineament detection for better accuracy compared to traditional sources of lineament identification methods. It has provided better geotectonic understanding of Cudappah rock in Ahobhilam with Quartzite. The imprints of Eastern Ghat orogeny are seen in upper stream section through a graph cut based segmentation approach.

The Israel policy of the four states also reflects the fact that they place particular importance on a nation state that is sovereign with regard to both domestic and foreign policy. Thus, their policy towards Israel is at the same time symbolic European policy and a part of the anything but uniform Israel policy of the EU. This applies in particular to Hungary and Poland, where the governments in power are also closest to Netanyahu's government in Israel both politically and in terms of their worldview. Poland, like Israel, also places great importance on its relations with the US. At the same time, the history policy in Warsaw is a source of conflict with Jerusalem, with its emphasis on Polish heroes and victims

M3  - Article
AB  - In musical scholarship in Russia and in other countries the actuality remains for the tendency of reconsideration of the most significant phenomena of history in light of "reevaluation of the past" and "substantiating the course of the future." There is a prevalence of a critical attitude towards of official holidays as an instrument of state policy directed at correcting the worldview-related perceptions of the people in the directions, presuming a severance of connections with the preceding tradition. The most important state holidays, the development of which has not been severed for over three-hundred years, are victory holidays. Research of holidays celebrating victories in the historical dynamics has shown a three-stage sequence of the processes of formation, transformation and revival. The structure of the victory holiday is formed out of stable (church and military rituals and ceremonials) and mobile elements (mass entertainments and sights). Music, as an inseparable component of all parts of any holiday, forms a carcass which supports the multidimensionality of the spatial/temporal continuum of ritualistic and playing forms of activity. It participates in the creation of the conceptual sphere of a holiday and forms the indispensable conditions for transmission of cultural values.

TI  - EKPHRASIS IN THE NOVEL "SKUTAREVSKY" BY LEONID LEONOV (TO THE 120TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WRITER'S BIRTH)
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies intertextual inclusions, allusions and ekphrasis in the novel "Skutarevsky" written by L. M. Leonov as an important feature of the poetic language of the writer's artistic texts. Ekphrasis here is one of the key ways of plotting and portraying the characters of the novel, and contributes to the formation of a complete view of the world. Passages of the texts created by means of ekphrasis are used by Lconov as building blocks of the whole narration. The writer tends to expand the semantic, temporal and spatial boundaries of the worldview he creates, including signs, symbols and codes of the world and phy; literary motives; national culture in the narrative images. The composition of "Skutarevsky" includes ekphrastic descriptions as constituent parts containing the main properties of Leonov's aesthetics. They are links within the author's sian writers; literary artistic optics and constructive elements of the poetic matter of the novel. The multiaspectual nature of the creation; novels. novel is associated with the presence of philosophical ideas in it. The central task of this article is to analyze the artistic and ideological features as well as thematic characteristics of the work, namely the manifestation of allusion in the novel "Skutarevsky" by Leonov, the disclosure of the form of ekphastic elements and their role in the poetics of the writer. Different types of ekphrases form the novel universe, becoming a way of the writer's artistic and philosophical self-reflection. After all, ekphrasis in the work of Leonov is not a simple description of artifacts in art; it is a way of transforming the material of art into philosophically significant entities, as a result of which an artistic image of increased semantic capacity is created. It is important to emphasize that ekphrasis reveals the peculiarities of the understanding of the characters and the author, and is a prism of philosophical, artistic and aesthetic knowledge of the world. Besides, the article touches upon the issue of fusion of arts in Leonov's works, and specifically synthesis of literature, painting and music, as well as the problem of relationship between the visual, the musical and the verbal. It is necessary to note that Leonid Leonov emerges as a writer with a pronounced visualization of the worldview and, consequently, of the poetic word.

TI  - Japan Society of Gynecologic Oncology guidelines 2017 for the treatment of uterine cervical cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Japan Society of Gynecologic Oncology (JSGO) Guidelines 2017 for the Treatment of Uterine Cervical Cancer are for the purpose of providing standard treatment strategies for cervical cancer, indicating treatment methods currently considered appropriate for cervical cancer, minimizing variances in treatment methods among institutions, improving the safety of treatment and prognosis of diseases, reducing the economic and psychosomatic burden of patients by promoting performance of appropriate treatment, and enhancing mutual understanding between patients and healthcare professionals. The guidelines were prepared through consensus of the JSGO Guideline Committee, based on careful review of evidence gathered through the literature searches and in view of the medical health insurance system and actual clinical practice situations in Japan. The guidelines comprise eight chapters and five algorithms. The main features of the 2017 revision are as follows: (1) evidence was collected using a search formula and with cooperation of the Japan Library Association. The bibliographical search formula was placed at the end of the book; (2) regarding clinical questions (CQs) where evidence or clinical inspection in Japan was lacking, opinions of the Guidelines Committee were described as proposals for future directions; (3) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) were treated as a cervical precancerous lesion; (4) the CQs of endoscopic surgery, radical trachelectomy, and sentinel node biopsy were newly added in Chapter3, primary treatment for stage IB-II cervical cancer; and (5) the CQ about hormone replacement therapy after cancer treatment was newly established. Each recommendation is accompanied by a classification of recommendation categories based on the consensus reached by the Guideline Committee members. Here, we present the English version of the JSGO Guidelines 2017 for the Treatment of Uterine Cervical Cancer.

AB  - Globally, 800 million people live within 100 km of a volcano thought to have been active in the last 10,000 years. The basis of forecasting the short term progression of volcanic unrest or onset of eruption is high quality monitoring data, ideally analysed in near real time consistently over long time periods. Volcanic deformation - the displacement of the Earth's surface in response to magmatic or volcanic processes - forms the foundation of many monitoring streams in combination with measurements of seismicity and gas emission. At present, < 10% of Holocene volcanoes are monitored routinely, while up to 45% are not monitored at all.

TI  - Age-Related Changes in HAPLN1 Increase Lymphatic Permeability and Affect Routes of Melanoma Metastasis
T2  - CANCER DISCOVERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Older patients with melanoma have lower rates of sentinel lymph node (LN) metastases yet paradoxically have inferior survival. Patient age correlated with an inability to retain Technetium radiotracer during sentinel LN biopsy in more than 1,000 patients, and high Technetium counts correlated to better survival. We hypothesized that loss of integrity in the lymphatic vasculature due to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation might play a role. We have implicated HAPLN1 in age-dependent ECM degradation in the dermis. Here, we queried whether HAPLN1 could be altered in the lymphatic ECM. Lymphatic HAPLN1 expression was prognostic of long-term patient survival. Adding recombinant HAPLN1 to aged fibroblast ECMs in vitro reduced endothelial permeability via modulation of VE-cadherin junctions, whereas endothelial permeability was increased following HAPLN1 knockdown in young fibroblasts. In vivo, reconstitution of HAPLN1 in aged mice increased the number of LN metastases, but reduced visceral metastases. These data suggest that age-related changes in ECM can contribute to impaired lymphatics.SIGNIFICANCE: Our studies reveal that changes in the stroma during aging may influence the way tumor cells traffic through the lymphatic vasculature. Aging may dictate the route of metastatic dissemination of tumor cells, and understanding these changes may help to reveal targetable moieties in the aging tumor microenvironment.

TI  - Beyond critical action learning?: Action learning's place in the world
T2  - ACTION LEARNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Action learning has evolved over a period of time when managerialism and performativity, which are aspects of neoliberalism, have become stronger and this explains, in part, the emergence of Critical Action Learning (CAL). Performativity, in particular, has increasingly become internalised by people at work. CAL seems to be limited to power relations within and between organisations and thus tends to ignore the dominant ideology of the day - neoliberalism. The paper asserts that action learning is antithetical to a neoliberal worldview and there are therefore practical implications for action learning practitioners.

TI  - GWAS of Uterine fibroids
T2  - GWAS Central
M3  - Data study
AB  - Uterine fibroids affect up to 77% of women by menopause and account for up to $34 billion in healthcare costs each year. Although fibroid risk is heritable, genetic risk for fibroids is not well understood. We conducted a two-stage case-control meta-analysis of genetic variants in European and African ancestry women with and without fibroids classified by a previously published algorithm requiring pelvic imaging or confirmed diagnosis. Women from seven electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network sites (3,704 imaging-confirmed cases and 5,591 imaging-confirmed controls) and women of African and European ancestry from UK Biobank (UKB, 5,772 cases and 61,457 controls) were included in the discovery genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis. Variants showing evidence of association in Stage I GWAS (P < 1 * 10-5) were targeted in an independent replication sample of African and European ancestry individuals from the UKB (Stage II) (12,358 cases and 138,477 controls). Logistic regression models were fit with genetic markers imputed to a 1000 Genomes reference and adjusted for principal components for each race- and site-specific dataset, followed by fixed-effects meta-analysis. Final analysis with 21,804 cases and 205,525 controls identified 326 genome-wide significant variants in 11 loci, with three novel loci at chromosome 1q24 (sentinel-SNP rs14361789; P = 4.7 * 10-8), chromosome 16q12.1 (sentinel-SNP rs4785384; P = 1.5 * 10-9) and chromosome 20q13.1 (sentinel-SNP rs6094982; P = 2.6 * 10-8). Our statistically significant findings further support previously reported loci including SNPs near WT1, TNRC6B, SYNE1, BET1L, and CDC42/WNT4. We report evidence of ancestry-specific findings for sentinel-SNP rs10917151 in the CDC42/WNT4 locus (P = 1.76 * 10-24). Ancestry-specific effect-estimates for rs10917151 were in opposite directions (P-Het-between-groups = 0.04) for predominantly African (OR = 0.84) and predominantly European women (OR = 1.16). Genetically-predicted gene expression of several genes including LUZP1 in vagina (P = 4.6 * 10-8), OBFC1 in esophageal mucosa (P = 8.7 * 10-8), NUDT13 in multiple tissues including subcutaneous adipose tissue (P = 3.3 * 10-6), and HEATR3 in skeletal muscle tissue (P = 5.8 * 10-6) were associated with fibroids. The finding for HEATR3 was supported by SNP-based summary Mendelian randomization analysis. Our study suggests that fibroid risk variants act through regulatory mechanisms affecting gene expression and are comprised of alleles that are both ancestry-specific and shared across continental ancestries.

TI  - For Merchants' Benefit: Hard Cases in the Practice of Enterpreneurs' Petitions Consideration in Peterhof in the Time of Great Reforms
T2  - HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The article adresses an important issue that ties together the history of the Ministry of the Imperial Court, interactions between merchants and government, and history of palace towns, such as Tsarskoe Selo, Gatchina and Peterhof. Palace towns were exempt from gubernia administration and were governed by special structures within the Court Department. Drawing on materials from the Russian State Historical Archive, the author analyses the procedure for consideration of the private entrepreneurs' petitions on trade establishment in Peterhof in 1855-1860s. The article focuses on petitions rejected by local authorities and reformulated and readdressed to superior authority. Having studied different scenarios of interaction between Peterhof merchants and the Ministry of the Imperial Court officials, the author concludes that submitted applications were tried on their merits and refusals were supported by evidence. The Court Department officials checked proposed edifices for conformity with construction rules, took into account the nature of future enterprises, personal and business qualities of the applicants, and, in case of alcoholic products, estimated their influence on the public order. Negative response to first petition did not preclude other, which could be addressed either to the town administration or to superior bodies, all the way to the Court Department. Merchants who wished to open a new trade enterprise or to expand business used this opportunity to renew their petition. When they reformulated the essence of their request or expressed their readiness to satisfy conditions set by the authorities, entrepreneurs were granted their applications.

TI  - Clerk or Heretic? The Problem of 'Profession' and 'Life-Creation' in the Nonfiction of Evgenij Zamjatin After 1917
T2  - STUDI SLAVISTICI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article explores the literary and self-described worldview of Evgenij Zamjatin after the October Revolution. In three 'autobiographies' from the 1920s he stressed the crucial role of the 1917 events in his destiny. Post-revolutionary years witnessed an explosion of Zamjatin's nonfiction, whereby the issue of self-determining in the face of a new Russia was pervasive. His articles and interviews from the 1920s and 1930s, at first sight, give two mutually contradictory definitions of his 'job' or, rather, 'profession' prior to emigration in 1931: a literary clerk in state service and a fundamentally opposed 'heretic'. He entered world culture, first of all, as the author of the dystopian novel We and a 'heretic'. However, his self-identification was far more complex and complicated, a case in point being the fact that in 1934, already apparently an emigrant, he applied for membership in the Union of Soviet Writers.This article tries to solve the contradiction, examining the storyline of an inner conflict - between an actor and a dreamer, a believer and a heretic, an officer of the state and a sceptic - that is recurrent in his nonfiction writing. Moreover, the author suggests that the ambivalence of Zamjatin resists definite evaluation. It is possible to view his ambivalence not only as a psychological or worldview peculiarity but as a manifestation of a 'life-creation' strategy.

TI  - International sentinel site surveillance of patients with transfusional hemosiderosis treated with deferasirox in actual practice setting
T2  - HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The study evaluates the long-term deferasirox treatment of adult and pediatric patients with chronic transfusional iron overload in clinical practice. Methods: In this non-interventional study, patients were observed for up to 3 years from initiation of deferasirox treatment both prospectively and retrospectively for up to 1 year prior to enrollment. The primary end points were the proportion of patients with >= 1 notable increase in serum creatinine (SCr), and >= 1 notable increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Results: Overall, 120 patients were enrolled and 51 completed the study, with a limited 3-year dropout rate of 12.5% due to adverse events (AEs). Increase in SCr > 33% above baseline and the age-adjusted ULN (upper limit of normal) was observed in 14 patients (95%CI, 7.1-19.2). The ALT levels >5 x ULN was observed in 1 patient. Most frequent AEs reported during treatment with deferasirox include gastrointestinal disturbances. Conclusions: The long-term treatment with deferasirox was manageable in most transfusion-dependent patients with no unexpected safety findings. Regular monitoring and an adjusted deferasirox dosing strategy per local labels allowed continued iron chelation treatment and control of transfusional iron in the majority of patients on study.

T2  - ICELANDIC AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A total of 480,495 test-day yield records of 33,052 cows were used to estimate the genetic parameters for daily milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY), protein yield (PY) and somatic cell score (SCS) of Icelandic dairy cows in the first three lactations with a random regression model.Heritability of all traits was lowest in early lactation in all lactations and highest in mid- or late lactation. Heritability of lactation yields for the first lactation was 0.43, 0.39 and 0.41 for MY, FY and PY, respectively, but was estimated as lower when using a lactation model. Heritability of SCS in the first lactation was 0.23 using the random regression model but 0.15 using the lactation model. Heritability of persistency of lactation MY, FY and PY were 0.14-0.24 in all lactations and genetic correlations to the whole lactation SCS were -0.08 to -0.13. Heritability of yields had increased from previous estimates for the breed. Genetic variation of persistency in the population makes change of the lactation curve possible through selection.

AB  - The study is aimed at implementing the methodology for development of core values of future designers studying multinational architecture. The article reflects the long-term experience of teachers and students of the Department of Design of the Institute of Construction, Architecture and Art. The authors emphasize importance of the process of nurturing values as the basis of the worldview of the younger generation. According to the authors, one of the effective ways is to familiarize students with the history and culture of all nations and small ethnic groups during study of traditional national architecture. Along with generally accepted teaching methods, it is proposed to rely on a value-oriented activity approach, based on the research work of students regarding preservation, revival, reconstruction and modernization of existing structures or lost pieces of architecture. Results of these activities can be reflected in architectural models. Such training leads to objectification of theoretical research results, to gradual development of core value through acquaintance with them.The most valuable models are those that reconstruct the appearance of once existing, and then destroyed religious buildings. Experience of carrying out such works shows that in the process, the authors of models, other students are promoted and developed, who are watching the process of creating the model as one of the stages of research work.The study conducted by the authors confirmed that the multinational architecture is a fertile research topic and an effective means of shaping the core values of students.

TI  - Surface mixing and biological activity in the North-West African upwelling
T2  - CHAOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-shore water along the North-West African margin is one of the world's major upwelling regions. It is associated with physical structures of oceanic fronts which influence the biological productivity. The study of these coherent structures in connection with chlorophyll concentration data is of fundamental importance for understanding the spatial distributions of the plankton. In this work, we study the horizontal stirring and mixing in different upwelling areas using Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs). These LCSs are calculated using the recent geodesic theory of LCSs. We use these LCSs to study the link between the chlorophyll fronts concentrations and surface mixing, based on 10 years of satellite data. These LCSs move with the flow as material lines, thus the horizontal mixing is calculated from the intersection of these LCSs with the finite time Lyapunov exponent maps. We compare our results with those of a recent study conducted over the same area, but based on finite size Lyapunov exponents (FSLEs), whose output is a plot of scalar distributions. We discuss the differences between FSLE and geodesic theory of LCS. The latter yields analytical solutions of LCSs, while FSLEs can only provide LCSs for sharp enough ridges of nearly constant height. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

AB  - Geothermal energy refers to any heat stored, naturally, in the earth's crust and is considered as renewable, ecological, universal and sustainable energy. In Morocco, geothermal energy is not yet exploited, neither considered, to support the institutional energy mainly focused on solar and wind energy. However, modest researches and some interventions related to geothermal resources were led and conducted by few Moroccan university. Remote sensing is a preliminary prospection tool for geothermal research allowing to face the lack of valuable data constraint and also the absence of officially credible data which will allow us to successfully complete our study. The main purpose of this research is to locate potential geothermal resources in the Moroccan Sahara using remote sensing and geospatial technologies. A set of satellite images (MODIS, ASTER and Landsat) were used and were completely processed and analyzed. Furthermore, significant indices were calculated from satellite images to prospect for potential deposits, namely diurnal and nocturnal surface temperature, hydrothermal alteration indices and lineaments density layer. This study allowed us to detect nocturnal thermal anomalies in the locality of Tichla. The statistical analysis showed a strong correlation between the intensities of the different indices in the prospected area of Tichla. Therefore, this significant concordance leads us to conclude that this locality has a strong potential for geothermal reservoirs. important tool for the preliminary identification of potential geothermal energy deposits.

TI  - Modeling and mapping of soil salinity in Tafilalet plain (Morocco)
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tafilalet plain in Morocco is a very rich ecosystem. It presents enormous ecological and natural values, such as groundwater and agricultural soil; however, it is undergoing rapid changes due to natural and anthropogenic factors, where soil salinity constitutes one of the major problems. In this context, remote sensing data/techniques used to map and to model soil salinity is a valuable tool in management activities and in decision-making. This paper focuses on modeling and mapping soil salinity in Tafilalet plain, Morocco, based on Landsat 8 OLI satellite data in combination with ground field data. Our results indicated that the coefficient of determination (R-2) varies from 0.53 to 0.75 and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) ranges between 0.62 and 0.80dS/m. Based on the results, we can conclude that this approach is an effective and valid methodology for modeling and spatial mapping soil salinity in this area and this method could also be applied for other regions with similar characteristics.

TI  - Penetration Analysis of SAR Signals in the C and L Bands for Wheat, Maize, and Grasslands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper assesses the potential of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in the C and L bands to penetrate into the canopy cover of wheat, maize and grasslands. For wheat and grasslands, the sensitivity of the C and L bands to in situ surface soil moisture (SSM) was first studied according to three levels of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI < 0.4, 0.4 < NDVI < 0.7, and NDVI > 0.7). Next, the temporal evolution of the SAR signal in the C and L bands was analyzed according to SSM and the NDVI. For wheat and grasslands, the results showed that the L-band in HH polarization penetrates the canopy even when the canopy is well-developed (NDVI > 0.7), whereas the penetration of the C-band into the canopy is limited for an NDVI < 0.7. For an NDVI less than 0.7, the sensitivity of the radar signal to SSM is approximately 0.27 dB/vol.% for the L-band in HH polarization and approximately 0.12 dB/vol.% for the C-band (in both VV and VH polarizations). For highly developed wheat and grassland cover (NDVI > 0.7), the sensitivity of the L-band in HH polarization to SSM is approximately 0.19 dB/vol.%, whereas as the C-band is insensitive to SSM. For maize, only the temporal evolution of the C-band according to SSM and the NDVI was studied because the swath of SAR images in the L-band did not cover the maize plots. The results showed that the C-band in VV polarization is able to penetrate the maize canopy even when the canopy is well developed (NDVI > 0.7) due to high-order scattering along the soil-vegetation pathway that contains a soil contribution. According to results obtained in this paper, the L-band would penetrate a well-developed maize cover since the penetration depth of the L-band is greater than that of the C-band.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVATION ADVANCEMENTS IN A CHANGING WORLD
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The main purpose of this research is to assess soil degradation combining GIS, remote sensing data and laboratory analysis. To achieve this aim, the study required Soil samples which were collected at 50 locations in the Oum Er Rbia high basin in the Middle Atlas of Morocco. These samples were dried, sieved at 2 mm and analyzed in a laboratory. Landsat 8 OLI images have been analyzed using physically-based or empirical methods to derive soil properties. The potential deterministic (Spline and Inverse Distance Weighted) interpolation method was used to produce maps of each textural classes and soil properties using GIS software. The severity of land degradation has been quantitatively estimated by analyzing physicochemical parameters in the laboratory to determine saline or salt-free soils and calcareous or sodium soils. WLC method was then used to generate the soil degradation map in a GIS environment, by overlaying indicator weights and thematic maps generated using interpolation method. The study area shows the distribution of the five soil degradation classes ranging from very low (1) to very high (5). From the calculations made, 17.28 % of the area is at low, 34.51 % at moderate, 32.88 % of high and 15.31 % of very high degradation area coverage.This approach developed in the current research will enhance the perspectives of using remotely sensed data for soil degradation mapping in arid and semi-arid environments.

TI  - Remote sensing and GIS techniques for prediction of land use land cover change effects on soil erosion in the high basin of the Oum Er Rbia River (Morocco)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion by water is one of the most important causes of land degradation throughout the world, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. The high basin of the Oum Er Rbia River, located in the Middle Atlas (Morocco), is a mountainous area dominated by steep slopes and clayey soils, which make it vulnerable to soil erosion due to human activities and severe weather. Multidate satellite images of Sentinel 2A, Landsat Oli-8 and ETM acquired respectively in 2017, 2013 and 2003, and the Cellular Automata Markov (CA_Markov) model were used to forecast the land use/land cover map and their change detections. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was integrated in a GIS environment to quantify soil loss and to map erosion risk of the specific years.The estimated annual soil losses average was 58 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2003, and the predicted annual soil loss average for 2030 was 142 60 t ha(-1) yr(-1). The results demonstrate that using CA_Marcov and RUSLE in combination with remote sensing and GIS is a suitable method for forecasting LUCC and accurately measuring the quantity of soil losses in the future.

AB  - Over the decades, anthropogenic air emissions have resulted in the degradation of ambient air quality and posed major health risks. In this context, efforts have increased to understand the dispersion of pollutants in the earth's atmosphere, their spatiotemporal patterns, and long-term effect on climate. Of interest in this domain is the relationship between atmospheric aerosols and trace gases, and their influence on pollutant dispersion. As such, this paper addressed the relationship between tropospheric Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and atmospheric aerosols; reflected by the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) parameter over Lebanon. NO2 column densities at low spatial resolution of about 7km were obtained from the Copernicus Sentinel 5p recently launched satellite, while AOT was retrieved at 10m resolution from the twin Sentinel-2 satellites. Results reveal a significant correlation between ln(NO2) and AOT on several days in different seasons, with correlation coefficient r(2) up to 0.775. This allows the determination of hotspots at 10m resolution. These hotspots were mainly on the Lebanese coastline, the most urbanized area in the country.

The synthesis of these lineaments allowed the establishment of morph-structural map and understanding the structural evolution of the area. The produced lineament map was then confronted to gravimetric maps and to the previous studies carried out on this area using geophysical data. This map is in high agreement with all these works.

T2  - GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR EFFECTIVE LAND GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This chapter highlights time series image processing for accurate agriculture characterization through two Moroccan experiences. The first case aims at crop mapping. A new classification approach based on multiple classifiers combination (MCC) was developed and applied to multi-temporal enhanced vegetation index (EVI) bands. The whole process is performed in three stages: (1) Landsat data preparation and multi-temporal staked EVI image extraction, (2) MCC construction from six advanced and supervised classifiers, and (3) stacked EVI image classification using the build-up MCC. Some post-classification contextual rules were also added in order to optimize the crops classification and the final parcel shape. In the second case, a post-classification change detection process was implemented to detect changes in forest area. Many classification schemes with different vegetation and texture indices were investigated. The two experiences are cost-effective, reproducible, and transferable. Consequently, they can regularly be used to produce up-to-date land use maps.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PARALLEL EMERGENT AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion processes which contribute to desertification and land degradation, constitute major environmental and social issues for the coming decades. This is particularly true in arid areas where rural populations mostly depend on soil ability to support crop production. Assessment of soil erosion across large and quite diverse areas is very difficult but crucial for planning and management of the natural resources. The purpose of this paper is to investigate a prediction model for soil vulnerability to erosion based on the use of the information contained in satellite images. Based on neural networks models, the used approach in this paper aims at checking a correlation between the digital content of satellite images and soil vulnerability factors: erosivity (R), the soil erodibility (K), and the slope length and steepness (LS); vulnerability (V) as described in the RUSLE model. Significant results have been obtained for R and K factors. This promising pilot study was conducted in South Ferlo, Senegal, a region with Sahelian environmental characteristics.[GRAPHICS]

AB  - Global Positioning System (GPS) has found wide application in many areas of our daily life. However, it has a very week signal making it vulnerable to external attacks like blocking, jamming or spoofing. Jamming is a technique that blocks the GPS from receiving location signals making it nonfunctional. In this paper, several Electronic Jamming methods are introduced and a comparison is done between them to observe which of them has the most jamming effect on the GPS receiver. The methods that will be analyzed are Pulse Jamming (PJ), Spot Jamming (SJ), Barrage Noise Jamming (BNJ) and Sweep Jamming (SWJ). The Jamming signals are modelled using MATLAB and their effect on the GPS receiver is quantified by observing their Bit Error Rate (BER) for different Jamming to Signal ratio.

AB  - As many developing countries, Iranian and Egyptian cities are growing in population and physically expanding at a high rate. The uncontrolled scattered construction causes loss of orchards, agricultural lands as well as spatial chaos, traffic congestion and increasing costs of municipal services. As a consequence, this also induces a loss of identity and social characteristics of neighborhoods, poor quality of life and degradation of natural landscapes, etc. To face with these issues, it is important to quantify trend and the rate of land cover conversion in order to support plan for a rational land use policy. The main purpose of this research is to set up low cost and reliable tools useful for the monitoring of the urban growth. In this paper, multi-temporal satellite data (Landsat TM 1984, Landsat TM 1998 and L8 2016) have been analyzed for investigating and assessing the effects of the urban expansion in Karaj (Iran) and Luxor (Egypt). According to the results obtained from change detection analysis, both of the investigated sites clearly exhibit an increasing trend in urban expansion much more evident in the case of Luxor than Karaj area. The integration between remote sensing and GIS and the joint use of analytical methods for quantitative-qualitative assessment enable the identification of changes and the mapping of new planned and unplanned urban construction. The availability of timely information free available from NASA web site and the data processing herein adopted provide useful information for supporting planning and sustainable developing policies.

AB  - As a result of natural disasters, soil subsidence or even new constructions, urban buildings structural integrity may be affected. Sometimes these effects can cause total structural failure and endanger human life. Therefore, InSAR technique has been introduced as a mean for urban hazards management, which can be an integral part for public safety assurance in several cities. InSAR technique can be used to estimate structural movements with few millimeters accuracy which gives an early warning about hazardous structures. In this paper, we propose an analysis technique for interferometric stack in urban areas that ensures high accuracy results for structural monitoring with low computational load. We applied the proposed technique to identify possible hazardous areas in Alexandria city, Egypt. We identified several regions that show high subsidence rate which caused by rapid construction. In other situation, the construction of illegal buildings causes several adjacent structures to tilt which is considered serious safety issue.

AB  - Wetland, an ecosystem of utmost importance, providing numerous beneficial resources to both flora and fauna is the most vital component of our environment. Wetlands perform a range of environmental functions and provide numerous socio-economic benefits to the local communities. Due to increased anthropogenic pressure the fragile yet diverse ecosystem is under constant threat requiring comprehensive monitoring in order to identify and analyze the changes occurring in the wetland area. Thus, the present research was conducted to study and visualize the spatio-temporal changes occurring in the wetland and upland areas in Renuka wetland, a Ramsar site since 2005 by Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULCC). The study focuses on monitoring the status of changes taking place in land use and land cover in the area (pre-Ramsar, 1994, 2000 and post-Ramsar, 2010, 2018) using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS). For conducting the study, identification and delineation of five major classes' viz., forest, agriculture, water, barren and built-up was carried out using Google Earth Engine and Quantum GIS using LANDSAT images for four different years (1994, 2000 and 2010, 2018). LULC maps identifying the seasonal changes for the years 1994 and 2018 and annual changes in the area were generated for pre-Ramsar (1994, 2000) and post-Ramsar years (2010, 2018). From the land use and land cover classification it was concluded that there has been a dynamic change in the extent of urban area and the dependency on natural resources in the wetland area has increased. Urbanization and other activities are major cause for the change, thereby requiring concerted management strategies and constant monitoring. The study also suggested that remote sensing and GIS is an efficient tool for studying the variation across various seasons and years as it helped in identifying the past and present scenarios in the area which will further help in decision making and will provide options for better and efficient designing of monitoring programs. Also, the study proved that the remote sensing and GIS tools are helping in simplification and visualization by incorporating datasets and easing the study of complex ecological processes.

AB  - A modification of the commonly used Price-Rind scheme for frequency of lightning flashes (FL), which can be used for calculations with large spatial and time steps, is developed. With such steps, the exponent in the relationship of LFF on convective cloud heights appears to be smaller by a factor of two over land and by one fourth over ocean in comparison to that in the original Price-Rind scheme. The modified version is implemented into the IAP RAS climate model (CM). The results of the lightning flash frequency simulations with the modified scheme agree better with the satellite data than those with the original one. In the IAP RAS CM, global warming (cooling) leads to FL increase (decrease) in all seasons. The sensitivity of lightning flashes frequency to the surface air temperature change at the global level is estimated equal to 10%/K.

T2  - Home healthcare now
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Over nine million people living in the United States are military Veterans over the age of 65. Many utilize civilian care providers, creating a need for civilian providers to have an understanding of the unique healthcare issues of this population. This article describes the qualitative results of a mixed-methods study of nine home care nurses' experiences caring for Veterans. Three themes emerged from the data: Challenges Coordinating Care, Building a Rapport Takes More Time, and Recognizing Impact of Military Service on Patient's Worldview. As demonstrated in this study, home care nurses care for Veterans every day. Although similarities exist, nurses readily described differences in caring for Veterans compared with non-Veterans that can impact patient outcomes. It is imperative for the nursing workforce to not only assess for military/Veteran status but to also have some knowledge of military culture and Veteran-specific healthcare issues.

AB  - Optical grain size (OGS) and specific surface area (SSA) are key parameters for measuring the atmospheric interactions of snow, as well as tracking metamorphosis and allowing for the ground truthing of remote sensing data. This paper describes a device using a shortwave infrared camera with changeable optical bandpass filters (centered at 1300 nm and 1550 nm) that can be used to quickly measure the spectral albedo over an area of 0.25 m(2) and from it derive SSA. The device and method are compared with measurements taken by a field spectral radiometer. The instrument is designed to be towed and powered by a four wheeled autonomous ground vehicle, and is built to run and collect data for hours or days without human intervention.

TI  - A PHENOMENAL DEFENSE OF REFLECTIVE EQUILIBRIUM
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The method of reflective equilibrium starts with a set of initial judgments about some subject matter and refines that set to arrive at an improved philosophical worldview. However, the method faces two, trenchant objections. The Garbage-In, Garbage-Out Objection argues that reflective equilibrium fails because it has no principled reason to rely on some inputs to the method rather than others and putting garbage-in assures you of getting garbage-out. The Circularity Objection argues that reflective equilibrium fails because it has no principled, non-circular way of sorting whatever is put into the method. The moves required to avoid both objections are instructive. Reflective equilibrium requires a metajustification, and we offer one that appeals to the epistemic goods that underwrite a view known as phenomenal conservatism. Reflective equilibrium calls on us to start with what seems most likely to be true and to alter that collection of judgments in the ways that seem most likely to get us to the truth. Proceeding in this way is epistemically defensible and unavoidable. Hence, reflective equilibrium is not just good, it's phenomenal.

TI  - Numerical Dust Storm Simulation Using Modified Geographical Domain and Data Assimilation: 3DVAR and 4DVAR (WRF-Chem/WRFDA)
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms have severe environmental, economic, health, weather, and climate change impacts. A severe dust storm that hit Egypt on 22 January 2004 was selected as a case study to establish an accurate numerical model to simulate dust storms over Egypt using the Weather Research Forecast with a chemistry module (WRF-Chem). Two simulation setups using WRF-Chem were conducted using two geographic domains: the first exclusively included dust sources within Egypt, while the second included an external dust source, the Bodele Depression in southwestern Chad. The first simulation was only able to capture the core of the dust plume from the internal dust source Egyptian Qattara Depression, but the second was able to capture the spatial dust distribution from both the Qattara Depression and the Bodele Depression. Moreover, the results from our second simulation model had less errors than comparable results using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). We then investigated the impact of meteorological data assimilation methods using both three-dimensional and four-dimensional variational assimilation algorithms to simulate the aerosol optical depth of the dust storm using weather research forecast data assimilation (WRFDA) framework.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - In this paper, the capability of Sentinel-1 data to map ocean surface currents in the Skagerrak Sea, with a focus on the Norwegian Coastal Current (NCC), is investigated. Post-processing methods for removing artefacts in the data and improving of the geophysical interpretation are suggested. Scalloping is one major artefact, which significantly degrades the quality of the velocity maps. Two methods, in spatial and spectral domain, for correcting this effect are proposed. It is also found that the radial velocity provided in the Sentinel-1 ocean data is biased, hence land is used as a reference to correct for the absolute and inter-beam bias. Finally, the retrieved (corrected) velocity is compared to a regional ocean circulation model (ROMS). It is shown that there is a good agreement between the ocean model and the retrieved velocity with values of approximate to 0.8 m/s in the core of the NCC.

AB  - The turning and atmospheric constants for fourteen years was obtained using the West African regional scale dispersion model (WASDM) from the AOD dataset 2013 showed a very high AOD value within the range of 0.1 to approximately 0.9. But, in the year 2009, an AOD value of 0.063 was observed and recorded. From the Pareto chart and seasons witnessed in Farafenni, we can deduce that the highest AOD distribution is within the cooler, dry season. The average distribution of the Angstrom exponent for the months from 2000 to 2013 was less than one (alpha < 1). This indicates that the size distributions over these years are dominated by coarse mode aerosols. The statistics of the Aerosol Optical Depth dataset showed that in 2013, the highest confidence interval of 99%, the standard deviation variance, the mean AOD, the confidence interval of 95%, and the coefficient of variation were achieved. The greatest inconsistency and kurtosis can be found in 2013. The highest Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics is available in 2000. The results show that the lower atmosphere of the Farafenni may not be as dynamic as the cities in West Africa. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study determined pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict land use change and analysed the impact of armed conflict on the intensity of land use change in northern Nimba County. Landsat images of 1986, 1990, 2002 and 2016 were classified into four dominant land use categories in the study area: cultivation, mine, forest and settlement using maximum likelihood classification algorithm. Land use change was determined by deriving pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict transition matrix. Based on the transition matrix, gain, loss, persistence, total change, swap and absolute value of net change were computed. Intensity of land use change was determined using the intensity analysis approach. The results show that the intensity of land use change was slow during the conflict but increased sharply after the conflict. Pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict mine occupied 0.63%, 0.78% and 17.68%, forest cover accounted for 71.08%, 69.26% and 56.42% and settlement was 1.99%, 1.96% and 25.63% respectively. Similarly, pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict uniform intensity of land use change was 4.09%, 1.51% and 5.01% respectively. Recent forest cover loss is primarily driven by sustained settlement expansion. The implications of rapid post-conflict settlement increase and forest loss in northern Nimba County include threat to habitat in a globally important biodiversity hotspot, increasing pressure on available agricultural land because of increasing population and potential exposure of the population to pollution from increase in mining activities. Therefore, more effective forest management strategies need to be developed to mitigate the prevailing trend. The use of intensity analysis has provided insights on the patterns and processes of pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict land use change in a biodiversity hotspot. This is important for defining effective conservation goals, planning sustainable conservation strategies and deploying relevant tools for forest conservation and governance in conflict and conflict prone areas.

TI  - Exploiting the Convergence of Evidence in Satellite Data for Advanced Weather Index Insurance Design
T2  - WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of drought-related weather index insurance (WII) is to protect smallholder farmers against the risk of weather shocks and to increase their agricultural productivity. Estimates of precipitation and vegetation greenness are the two dominant satellite datasets. However, ignoring additional moisture- and energy-related processes that influence the response of vegetation to rainfall leads to an incomplete representation of the hydrologic cycle. This study evaluates the added value of considering multiple independent satellite-based variables to design, calibrate, and validate weather insurance indices on the African continent. The satellite data include two rainfall datasets, soil moisture, the evaporative stress index (ESI), and vegetation greenness. We limit artificial advantages by resampling all datasets to the same spatial (0.25 degrees) and temporal (monthly) resolution, although datasets with a higher spatial resolution might have an added value, if considered as the single source of information for localized applications. A higher correlation coefficient between the moisture-focused variables and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), an indicator for vegetation vigor, provides evidence for the datasets' capability to capture agricultural drought conditions on the ground. The Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall dataset, soil moisture, and ESI show higher correlations with the (lagged) NDVI in large parts of Africa, for different land covers and various climate zones, than the African Rainfall Climatology, version 2 (ARC2), rainfall dataset, which is often used in WII. A comparison to drought years as reported by farmers in Ethiopia, Senegal, and Zambia indicates a high hit rate of all satellite-derived anomalies regarding the detection of severe droughts but limitations regarding moderate drought events.

AB  - Healthcare logistics is treated as a fundamentally emergent complex system primarily because a broad range of stakeholders are included. The patient is the primary "customer" of the service producers in the supply chain, including the doctors, nurses, medicine and insurance providers, and hospital administrators. Problematic issues regarding healthcare quality that need to be solved or improved are discussed, and suggestions for furthering and accelerating progress are offered. Careful application of information technology in designing appropriate information systems is advocated. Three specific illustrative cases of healthcare services that have been analyzed and assessed are summarized. The overall intent is to motivate creative processes for delivering more efficient and effective healthcare utilizing complex system behaviors and engineering principles, and an ethically-founded worldview.

TI  - Landsat 8: TIRS SSM Encoder Current Anomaly Resolution
T2  - 2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Aerospace Conference
CL  - Big Sky, MT
AB  - This paper will document the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) anomaly, the Anomaly Review Board (ARB) investigation, and the ultimate return to "new nominal" operations using an Alternate ConOps (ACO). The paper will include samples of the anomalous data, details of the ARB investigations, the ambient ground tests, the ACO paradigm and differences between the nominal and ACO.Launched in February 2013, Landsat 8 (L8) became the latest in the United States Geological Survey (USGS) series of Earth Observing satellites. Unfortunately, in November 2014 TIRS began displaying abnormal current behavior. The Flight Operations Team (FOT) were challenged, as this abnormal behavior was serious enough that if it could not be resolved with an alternative concept of operations, the probability was extremely high that TIRS A-side would become inoperable.In November 2014, telemetry trending data for the TIRS Scene Select Mechanism (SSM) encoder -12V current monitor (A-side) showed out-of-family behavior that started to approach the yellow HIGH limit. Further investigation showed this behavior had actually started as early as June 2013. However the SSM performance (which relies on a stable encoder) was never affected. During the initial investigation it was noted that by periodically cycling the encoder power, the current level would recover but never quite return to post-launch levels. As the current trend was unpredictable but continuously increasing, continuing nominal operations on A-side was considered too risky. TIRS was switched over to B-side for the Mechanism Control Electronics (MCE) and Focal Plane Electronics (FPE) in early March 2015.While the Anomaly Review Board (ARB) could not be certain of a proximate cause, the team's initial assessment was that the most likely cause was Conductive Anodic Filaments (CAFs) within the layers of the encoder printed circuit board (PCB). Various recommendations were made for B-side operations (e.g. changing the trending paradigm such that TIRS could meet science requirements with the encoder turned off or minimally used). Tests were conducted to understand SSM drift without positive feedback control.Approximately 5 months after resuming nominal operations on the TIRS B-side, indications of an anomalous current were observed in the +12V MCE current (similar to August 2015). The ARB reconvened to resume investigations. Nominal Ops were suspended in November 2015, and an Alternative ConOps (ACO) was tested on B-side, and started on B-side in December 2015. This ACO leaves the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) Scene Select Mechanism (SSM) encoder in an OFF mode, but being switched ON every two weeks for calibration activities. During the ACO mode of operation for TIRS, ambient tests on the flight spare SSM electronics were initiated in an attempt to discover the root cause for the anomaly. These tests ultimately led to the discovery of cracked and cracking capacitors in the encoder circuit, most likely thermally-induced upon installation of a susceptible lot of parts. The conditions of these capacitors has implications for mitigation of similar risks for currently flying and future missions.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Joint Urban Remote Sensing Event (JURSE)
CL  - Vannes, FRANCE
AB  - Extracting information about variations within urban areas using satellite imagery has generally focused on mapping individual buildings or slum versus non-slum areas. While these data are useful, they can run into issues in very dense urban areas, additionally slums have a subjective definition. In previous research we have found that contextual features are related to population, census variables, poverty, and other values, but have not explored which urban attributes (i.e., buildings and roads) these features represent. In this study we seek to determine the correlation between contextual features calculated on Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) satellite data and urban attributes derived from Open Street Map (OSM) for portions of multiple cities in Sri Lanka. Results indicate that individual contextual features are highly correlated with building area, building density, road area, road density, total built up areas and other features. Moreover, when multiple contextual features are combined within a model, they can explain from 70 to 92 percent of the variance of these urban features within the study area. This indicates that contextual features are very strong indicators of urban variability and can be used to map differences within the urban setting. This may allow us to forgo having to map each building and road individually for mapping urban areas in future projects.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2011, the US Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service started the complete implementation of the County Agricultural Production Survey (CAPS). The CAPS is an annual survey to provide accurate county level acreage and production estimates of approved federal and state crop commodities. The current top down method of producing official county level estimates that satisfy the county-district-state benchmarking constraint is an expert assessment incorporating multiple sources of information. We propose a model-based method that combines the CAPS acreage data with auxiliary data and improves county level survey estimation, while providing measures of uncertainty for the county level acreage estimates. Auxiliary sources of information include remote sensing data, weather data and planted acreage administrative data from other US agencies. A hierarchical Bayesian subarea level model is proposed and implemented, with an additional hierarchical level for the sampling variances. County level, model-based acreage estimates have lower coefficients of variation than the corresponding county level survey acreage estimates. Top down benchmarking methods are investigated and the final acreage estimates satisfy the county-district-state benchmarking constraint.

This form of publications about death (and about life too) is generated by a whole complex of causes in the Modem Era related to political, economic, and social changes as well as a change in the individual and their worldview. This paper explores the diversity of approaches to the study of obituaries and the potential value of included content.

TI  - Concept of TRAITOR in National Consciousness of Native Speakers of Russian and Chinese Languages (according to Data of Associative Experiment)
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of two associative experiments are presented. Russian-speaking respondents were presented with the word-incentive predatel' 'traitor,' Chinese respondents - with the word-incentive (sic) (beipanzhe / traitor). The psycholinguistic experiment involved 300 subjects aged 18-45. The aim of the study is to compare the ways of linguistic representation of the concept of TRAITOR in the Russian and Chinese linguistic cultures. The associative fields of the Russian concept of TRAITOR and the corresponding Chinese concept are modelled. The interpretation of the results of the experiment in the Russian-speaking audience shows that the core of the associative field of the concept of TRAITOR is formed by the symbols of values and military vocabulary, and its near periphery consists of semantic groups "violation of norms," "historical memory," "religion." Based on the data of the experiment conducted with Chinese informants, the associative field of the TRAITOR concept was modelled, the core of which includes associates representing the conceptual features of "historical memory" (names of parties, names of politicians, designations of events) and "war." It is found that the basic layer of the concept, relevant to the Chinese linguoculture, is formed by the concepts of "antivalue" and "violation of norms." It is reported that the near periphery includes associations of semantic groups "feelings and emotions" and "a bad person."

AB  - The implementation of efficient remote sensing workflows is essential to improve the access to and analysis of the vast amount of sensed data and to provide decision-makers with clear, timely, and useful information. The Dynamical Exascale Entry Platform (DEEP) is an European pre-exascale platform that incorporates heterogeneous High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, i.e., hardware modules which include specialised accelerators. This paper demonstrates the potential of such diverse modules for the deployment of remote sensing data workflows that include diverse processing tasks. Particular focus is put on pipelines which can use the Network Attached Memory (NAM), which is a novel supercomputer module that allows near processing and/or fast shared storage of big remote sensing datasets.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - River confluence is a ubiquitous phenomenon which plays an important role in river dynamics, mixing processes, pollution transport etc. It can be often visually observed that two converging rivers continue to flow as two parallel weakly mixing streams separated by a relatively thin transition region - a mixing zone (MZ), which can reach out for some distance downstream the junction apex. A typical example of a river confluence is the merging of the Volga and Oka rivers (Russia). This paper presents some new results on the Volga/Oka rivers confluence based on both 'in situ' measurements of hydrological characteristics in the MZ and on satellite observations. During the 'in situ' measurements a large set of data regarding velocity fields, chlorophyll-a concentration, water temperature, turbidity, parameters of organic surface films etc. was obtained. It is found that significant differences between the hydrological characteristics of the Volga and Oka flows are observed at sufficiently large distances downstream the junction apex (about 10 river widths or more); and the mixing zone remains quite narrow. Film sampling and further analysis of the surfactant films in the MZ were carried out. It is shown that the surface tension decreases and the film elasticity grows in the foam/slick bands separating the Volga and Oka flows thus indicating the increased concentration of surfactants in the bands. Satellite images of the Volga-Oka MZ are collected indicating that the confluence area is clearly seen in satellite optical imagery (MSI Sentinel-2 satellite) due to strong difference in color between the flows. The radar imagery shows the mixing zone in the form of a slick/foam band (SAR Sentinel-1) which manifests on the water surface due to enhanced damping of short wind waves.

AB  - The article discusses the processes of globalization and identification of spirituality in Russia. The essence of the spiritual personality as a carrier of the emotional and sensual beginnings, based on the values of goodness, truth and beauty of a person, is substantiated. It is proved that there are correlative links between the spiritual state of Russian society and the views of individuals.Special attention is paid to the exacerbation of the social problems of modern Russian society, which, in turn, confirms the need for the revival of spiritual values for the further development of the spiritual man. It is shown that the targeted formation of the intellectual, moral, aesthetic beginnings of the individual, we believe, will help stabilize the spiritual life of society and to some extent contribute to the success of future reforms.In our opinion, an understanding of the problem of spirituality on the basis of philosophical methodology will help outline strategic directions and concrete ways of educating the spiritual person in Russian society, which today needs a strong, active and purposeful personality.

AB  - Introduction. The article considers a number of works by Gennady Stepanovich Rayshcv as historical and ethnographic sources. The subjects of the research are components of his ethnic consciousness.Objective: to analyze the creative work of the Khanty artist as an original historical and ethnographic source reflecting the ethnic identity, the mentality of the indigenous people of the North and the features of contemporary epoch.Research materials: based on the visual, historical and cultural analysis of graphic and pictorial canvases and principal statements of G. S. Rayshev on the problems of artistic creativity.Results and novelty of the research. The extinction of traditional culture did not lead to the disappearance of a myth. Its forms and carriers changed, but its deep structure had preserved. A myth still exists, though it has changed its shape. As in the past, the intelligentsia of the indigenous people of the North retransmits and transforms the old and new mythical arrays.The analysis of the Khanty artist Rayshev's creativity shows that on meeting of different cultures the creative persons are as mediators between the past myths and modernity. Without losing previous ties with the native culture, G. S. Rayshev is engaged in verbal or pictorial design of worldview structures, identity and thoughts of the ethnos. He also reflects historical and cultural realities of his ethnos. On the example of G. S. Rayshev, the creative vision of the national character, which is wider than the usual philistine opinions, is clearly manifested. The vivid images, depicted in his paintings, contribute to the preservation of ethnic stereotypes, knowledge of everyday details and elements of everyday life that determine the specifics of the people's life. It is possible to assert that the works of G. S. Rayshev represent not only undeniable artistic value, but also they have the properties of historical and ethnographic source.

AB  - The period of 1900-1910 was marked by a notable impact of science on the most radical trends of art of modernism. In Russia new artistic trends were presented as "theories" with their own method and pedagogical systems. Collapse of the mechanical physics' world view was regarded as a dramatic sentence for scientific world view. Philosophy of Ostwald and Bogdanov reflected in theoretical works of the artists before the revolution 1917. Artists and critics thought about the common grounds for the scientific and artistic creation. Artistic creations include visual interpretations of the scientific ideas and notions (the fourth dimension, types of energy. cells structures, evolution). Malevich used the principles of energy and maximum economy in suprematism's theory. Scientific influence is traced in different trends of avant-garde: study of relations between art and nature, art and mind, art and construction contributed to development of art theory and visualized facets of the scientific worldview.

TI  - LANDSCAPE PATTERN AND URBAN COOLING ISLANDS
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation is an important factor related to microclimate and one of the main reasons for the formation of an Urban Heat Island (UHI). In the general sense, vegetated areas (e.g. forests, urban green spaces) form Urban Cooling Islands (UCIs), mitigate the adverse effects of UHI and deliver benefits for human health and urban sustainability. However, it is still unclear how the land use/land cover (LULC) pattern characteristics and different types of green spaces affect the UCI benefits. This paper uses landscape metrics and quantitative statistical analysis to assess the influence of the spatial pattern of the landscape and different types of green spaces on delivering the UCI benefits in the case of Samsun, Turkey. In this study, land surface temperature (LST) and LULC types in Samsun, Turkey were obtained from Landsat 8 imagery, Urban Atlas 2012 and ESM 2012 datasets. I found that forests, urban green spaces, and water features were the most-important components of the landscape in terms of delivering UCI benefits. The larger the patch area, edge perimeter and the more complex the shape of forests and urban green spaces with a more physically connected configuration had the stronger the UCI benefits. The paper concluded with a short review of how the findings of this study can be useful for future landscape planning regarding the UCI mitigation in urban areas.

TI  - Safeguarding global plant health: the rise of sentinels
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The number of alien plant pests and pathogens is rapidly increasing in many countries as a result of increasing trade, particularly the trade in living plants. Sentinel plantings in exporting countries to detect arthropod pests and agents of diseases prior to introduction provide information about the likelihood of introduction and the potential impact on plants native to the importing country. Such plantings can consist of species that are native to exporting or importing countries (in-patria and ex-patria plantings). In-patria plantings consist of young woody plants of species that are commonly exported and can be used to identify pests that may be introduced to new countries via the trade in live plants. Ex-patria plantings consist of exotic young or mature woody plants and surveys may provide information about potential impacts of pests if these were to become established in a new country. We discuss the methods and benefits of this powerful tool and list examples of studies that highlight the large number of unknown organisms and pest-host relationships that can be detected. The usefulness of sentinel plantings is illustrated using examples of arthropod pests and fungal pathogens of European and Asian tree species that were identified in sentinel studies in China and the Asian Russia.

TI  - Waterhole detection using a vegetation index in desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis cremnobates) habitat
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - In arid ecosystems, desert bighorn sheep are dependent on natural waterholes, particularly in summer when forage is scarce and environmental temperatures are high. To detect waterholes in Sierra Santa Isabel, which is the largest area of desert bighorn sheep habitat in the state of Baja California, Mexico, we used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) from Sentinel-2 satellite images. Waterhole detection was based on the premise that sites with greater water availability, where NDVI was higher, can be identified by their density of vegetation greenness. For the detected waterholes, we estimated the escape terrain (presence of cliffs or steep, rocky slopes) around each by the vector ruggedness measure to determine their potential use by desert bighorn sheep based on the animals presence as documented by camera traps. We detected 14 waterholes with the NDVI of which 11 were known by land owners and 3 were unrecorded. Desert bighorn were not detected in waterholes with high values of escape terrain, i.e., flat areas. Waterhole detection by NDVI is a simple method, and with the assistance and knowledge of the inhabitants of the Sierra, it was possible to confirm the presence each waterhole in the field.

TI  - DIAMAGNETIC STRUCTURES AS A BASIS OF QUASI-STATIONARY SLOW SOLAR WIND
T2  - SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results presented in this review reflect the fundamentals of the modern understanding of the slow solar wind (SW) structure along all the way from the Sun to Earth's orbit. The source of the slow quasistationary SW on the Sun is known to be coronal streamer belt and chains. The streamer belt encircles the Sun as a wave-like surface (skirt), representing a sequence of pairs of rays with increased brightness (plasma density) or two closely spaced lines of rays. The neutral line of the radial component of the global solar magnetic field goes along the belt between the rays of each of these pairs. The streamer belt extension in the heliosphere is the heliospheric plasma sheet (HPS). The detailed analysis of Wind and IMP-8 satellite data has shown that HPS parts in Earth's orbit are recorded as a sequence of diamagnetic tubes with increased density plasma and low interplanetary magnetic field. They represent an extension of rays with increased brightness of the streamer belt near the Sun. Their angular size remains the same over the entire way from the Sun to Earth's orbit. Each HPS diamagnetic tube has a fine internal structure on several scales, or fractality. In other words, the diamagnetic tube is a set of embedded diamagnetic tubes whose angular size can vary by almost two orders of magnitude. These sequences of diamagnetic tubes that form the basis of the slow SW in Earth's orbit has a more general name - diamagnetic structures (DS). In the final part of this article, a comparative analysis of several events is made using the results of this review. It allowed us to find out the morphology and origin of the new term "SW diamagnetic plasmoids" (local enhancements of plasma density), which appeared in several articles published in 2012-2018. The analysis carried out at the end of this article has shown for the first time that SW diamagnetic plasmoids are a small-scale component of the fractal diamagnetic structures of slow SW considered in this review.

T2  - IMAGEN [N] VISIBLE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 5th International Conference on Research in Visual Arts (ANIAV)
CL  - Polytechn Univ Valencia, Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - This project proposes the art appropriationism as a strategy used throughout the entire history of art, and now it could be a resource that acts almost as a response to the saturation of images that overwhelms the global societies. Firstly, we wonder whether the artworks based on other creations are less original. We resort to something already made to create: what is the point of it? Is there a completely original creation in which the author has not drawn his work from other references? Appropriationism implies a critique to the traditional concept of authorship, even though once we overcome these initial uncertainties, we take this practice as a fully validated resource. With this in mind we analyze how the fact of appropriating visible and recognizable images is an excellent incentive to develop a new concept. Appropriationism, as a way of communication and enrichment in the artistic discourses, allows us to reflect on the concept of image. Artists, in a process that is based on: perceive, identify, interpret and mean, take over images belonging to our collective worldview and they generate new readings. In that sense they extrapolate the original meaning to the present day, providing it with another narrative that responds to current issues. Finally, we undertake a review of the appropriationism throughout the history of art to put in value its ability to multiply ideas and enrich the artistic work. Besides that, we discuss the work of artists like Benjamin Dominguez, Eisen Bernard Bernardo and the Equipo Cronica who see an opportunity to expand their own technique: a study tool that explores the possibilities of the same idea/image, allowing the known work to be used as a medium for creative development.

TI  - Assessment and prediction of shoreline change using multi-temporal satellite images and statistics: Case study of Damietta coast, Egypt
T2  - APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The shoreline trajectory of Damietta city, locates at the Northern coast of Egypt, is dramatically subjected to kinematic changes. These variations mainly occur based on the incessant duel hydrodynamic impacts of both wave action and coastal currents. Several types of coastal measures have been applied substantially along the coastal stretch of Damietta to protect shoreline such as detached breakwaters, Jetties, groins, and seawalls. This study is essentially focused on the assessment of shoreline kinematics response due to the existence of these structures during the period from 1990 to 2015. In addition, the future changes of the shoreline at 2020, 2025 and 2035 are predicted using satellite images, Geo-spatial tools and Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) by the meaning of End Point Rate (EPR) and Linear Regression Rate (LRR) methods. Four Landsat images at different periods; TM1990, TM 1999, ETM 2003 and ETM 2015 are used to detect shoreline changes. Three semiautomatic extraction techniques are initially tempted for Landsat ETM 2003 imagery namely; Iso cluster technique, threshold method, and onscreen digitizing method to select the optimal one. Iso cluster technique is used as the optimal technique which achieves the least errors with the corresponding field data in 2003 by value of 0.34. Furthermore, the extraction shoreline change for Damietta coast is extensively measured for three zones: zone (1) the western sector encompassing Damietta port with two jetties; zone (2) the central sector including detached breakwaters; zone (3) the eastern portion of Damietta estuary passing through a seawall. Verification analysis shows that the EPR is the optimum method for shoreline detection with a value of RMSE by 0.27. The results show that, for zone (1), the western shoreline of Damietta port is progressed by a rate of +10.0 m/year. On the other hand, the shoreline on the down drift side at zone (2) has retreated by a rate of -5.0 m/year. While the shoreline behind the detached breakwaters in the central sector has advanced by +12.0 m/year from 1999 to 2003, then decreased gradually until become stable in 2015. For zone (3), alongshore currents have derived the disassembled sandy soil from west to east leaving a highly eroded area by average rate of -78m/year. The results of this study give indication to shoreline trend of near future which should be under consideration in planning of Damietta coastal zone.

AB  - We attempt to understand how a set of well known polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) features are impacted by the additive system noise for mineral oil and produced water slicks. For this, we use quad-polarimetric SAR scenes from Radarsat-2. Oil slicks at sea can be detected using SAR instruments, and the dual- (HH-VV) and quad-polarimetric modes can provide additional information about the characteristics of the oil. Therefore the increase in polarization dimensionality may be beneficial in a potential clean-up situation. For example, characterization could aid in separating different types of oil slicks, like mineral oil and produced water as studied here. Oil slick characterization using scattering properties can only be performed if the returned signal is well above the noise floor. To avoid misinterpretation it is important to understand how the noise impacts the measured radar signal. Most of the features investigated in this study were to a larger degree influenced by the additive noise. Further, a backscatter signal level of 10 dB above the noise floor is identified as necessary to support analysis of the scattering properties within the oil slicks without too much noise contamination of the signal. The mineral oils and produced water slicks showed similar polarimetric behavior, despite their chemical and physical differences at release.

TI  - Between Sport and Bioethics: Grounding the Philosophy of Mountaineering
T2  - SYNTHESIS PHILOSOPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountaineering encompasses a vast number of practices and it is becoming an umbrella term for a set of human outdoor practices. Although categorised as a sport, mountaineering resists to the standard definition of sport and especially to mainstream understanding of sport as a competitive activity. On the other haiut usual ethical questions concerning sports do not cover the vast majority of mountaineering practices, thus calling for a wider normative perspective - a bioethical analysis. It is argued that such an approach could ground the possibility of understanding mountaineering as a peculiar sort of sport and differentiate its special features by using bioethical analysis. Thus, it is showed that mountaineering is a unique sport, but also that mountaineer shares and promotes a genuine life philosophy exemplifying a truly bioethical worldview Mountaineer is guided by a unique set of core values encapsulated under something we can and should call the philosophy of mountaineering.

T2  - REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Describe the phenotypical and genotypical characteristics of Neisseria meningitidis isolates from cases of meningococcal disease in Paraguay between 1996 and 2015.Methods. Conventional microbiological methods and molecular techniques were used to study 114 isolates of N. meningitidis and 12 clinical samples without isolation (confirmed by polymerase chain reaction), provided by various sentinel centers and collaborating centers in Paraguay.Results. The most affected age group was children under 1 year (19.0%), followed by 1-5-year-olds (17.5%). The highest percentage of strains was isolated in men-ingitis cases (81.7%) and serogroup B was found in 60.3% of cases. The most frequent phenotypes were B:4:p1.14 (16.0%), B:15:p1.5, C:nt:nst, and W:nt:p1.2 (10.5%), respectively. The prevalent clonal complexes were: ST-11 / ET37 complex, 29.6% (8/27), predominantly serogroup W (6/8); ST-35 complex, 18.5% (5/27), in serogroup B (4/4); and ST-32/ ET5 complex, 14.8% (4/16), in serogroup B (5/5).Conclusions. Meningococcal meningitis is relatively uncommon in Paraguay. Distribution analysis showed that serogroup B is the most common and that the number of cases of meningococcal disease caused by serogroups C and W increased in the last two years. The identified clonal complexes were correlated with those found in the Southern Cone region. Due to the high virulence of N. meningitidis, its surveillance should be a strategic priority of national and regional public health systems to prevent epidemic outbreaks and support public health decision-making.

AB  - Coastal and inner water lagoon ecosystems are essential due to their high biodiversity and primary production. However, they are extremely complex. Remote sensing can be very useful due to the spatial and spectral improvement of satellites and the availability of airborne or drone hyperspectral sensors. Unfortunately, the mapping of coastal and inner lakes areas is challenging due to the low SNR received at the sensor, as a consequence of the minimum reflectivity of the water surface and the atmospheric disturbances. In this context, the goal of this work is to obtain a robust image processing methodology to generate accurate water quality maps in shallow waters using multiplatform imagery: WorldView-2 (High Resolution Satellite Multispectral Sensor), AHS (Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner) and Pika-L (Drone Hyperspectral Scanner) images. Maspalomas (Gran Canaria, Spain) inner water lagoon ecosystems was studied due to its complexity and the presence of important chlorophyll concentration.

TI  - PETRA KARIN KELLY AND HER "GREEN INITIATIVE"
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to Petra Karin Kelly, an active participant in the anti-war movement in the Federal Republic of Germany, one of the founders of the West German Green Party, a member of the Bundestag, who is undeservedly deprived of national historiography. Based on the works of P. Kelly, party and government documents, materials of German and foreign media, an analysis of the "green alternative" by P. Kelly is presented in a theoretical aspect and in terms of its practical implementation. The purpose of the article is to fmd out the reasons for the evolution of attitudes toward P. Kelly on the part of German society, from the sharp increase in its popularity to oblivion. The emergence of the "green" FRG party is seen as the result of the intensification of new social movements that had significant democratic potential in the conditions of the transition of West German society from materialistic to post-materialistic ones. The formation of the worldview and life position of P. Kelly is studied in the historical and political context taking into account the circumstances of her personal life, which contributed to the development of P. Kelly as a committed human rights defender, advocate of nonviolent actions, an active participant in the movement to save humanity from a nuclear and environmental disaster. Already at the turn of the 1970-1980s she acted as one of the first theorists of globalization, as her "green alternative" represented the system of views that was distinguished by extra-class "planetary" consciousness. The pillars of the "green policy" - protection of the environment, support for the socially deprived strata of the population, basic democracy, freedom from violence - did not have a national framework. The created party, which proclaimed itself as "anti-party", represented the interests of the protest potential outside the existing party-parliamentary system. It was at this stage - from the creation of the party to the first years of being in the Bundestag (1980-1984) - that P. Kelly's popularity in West German society reached its peak. When P. Kelly, as a member of the Bundestag (1985-1990), began to defend the security of human society on an international scale, seeking the "globalization of consciousness" of the German parliament, her strategy came into conflict with the political realities of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Green Party was becoming increasingly institutional, systemic, seeking to raise its status in power in the face of declining anti-war and environmental movement; P. Kelly in her turn was less institutional and non-systemic, striving to "be, not to have", who wanted to preserve her spiritual component and individuality. The end of the Cold War, changes in Western and Eastern Europe and their consequences for the development of the Third World countries were perceived by her as an imposed "globalization from above" which she contrasted to "globalization from the bottom". She reacted negatively to the unification of Germany, which led, from her point of view, to weakening of the "green" color of the "green" party. And that abandoned "non-German" Petra Kelly. The tragic, violent death, and so far unexplained, contradicted her whole life concept. For the German regional organizations of the "green" and the international civil society, she remained an example of a person who introduced the concept of "conscience" into political discourse.

AB  - In recent years urbanized areas have been expanding more and more into hillside areas, which increases the risk for landslides to destroy or gravely damage human settlements, industrial establishments and important infrastructure. Greece and in particular the northwestern tip of the Peloponnese Peninsula are often affected by landslides. A well-known and documented landslide south-east of Patras is located in that area and was chosen as the main focus for this study. The landslide collapsed and thus submerged the main road connecting the small village Moira and Patras on January 20, 2016. Immediately afterwards the geometry and geology of the affected area have been determined using GNSS Measurements, UAV Campaigns and DInSAR techniques. However, the velocity of the post-collapse movement has not been investigated.In order to make this determination two time series of SAR images acquired by the two Sentinel-1 satellites from an ascending and descending orbit were evaluated using the advanced InSAR technique of persistent scatterer interferometry. The result is a map of the mean velocities the identified persistent scatterers were experiencing in the time period from January 2017 to June 2019. The persistent scatterer density in the rural areas of the region was sufficient enough to identify the landslide within the results. Roughly 80 persistent scatterer with a velocity of more than +/- 8 mm/a in the line of sight of the sensor were identified within the outlines of the landslide (approximately 750 m(2)), indicating that the landslide is experiencing post-collapse movement.

AB  - Big Data is an emerged architecture and technology paradigm that is used by many organizations to extract valuable information either to take decisions. Big Data is a technique and method used to retrieve, collect, process and analyze a very big volume of unstructured and structured data. The challenge is processing and analyzing the huge volume of data coming in from network sensors. Practically, it's too late to stop an abnormal comportment, if we collect the incoming streams and wait for many days for processing and analyzing the stored streams. Big Data in video surveillance systems, offer ETL (Extract Transform and Load) challenges related to the Van Newman Bottleneck and Data Locality. In this chapter we propose a conceptual model with architectural elements and proposed tools for monitoring in RTAP (Real Time Analytical Processing) mode smart areas.Our model is based on lambda architecture, in order to resolve the problem of latency which is imposed in transactional requests (GAB Network). We consider the real example that data comes from different sources (Automatic monitoring Centers, GAB, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Medical Centers, Commercial Centers and any other data collected by satellites.) which is n dimension and we which to reduce with PCA algorithm the number of components to reduce the processing time and increase the speed of execution.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article deals with the multitemporal analysis of the network of roads in the Northern Perimetral Highway, Amapa State, Brazil, in order to understand the process of territorial occupation along the area. The development of the road network is analyzed on the basis of two categories of roads: official (resulting from political strategies) and endogenous (resulting from the action of private agents and possible spontaneous occupations). For the analysis, we used 12 scenes from the Landsat satellite series between 1988 and 2014, data from the road map database of the Economic Ecological Zoning Program (ZEE) and field interviews. The rate of increase of the road network was associated with socio-spatial events that influenced the expansion of that network. The results allowed us to determine that the main actors responsible for the process of expansion of the official road network were the projects of the INCRA settlements, linked to the political strategies of regional occupation. The evolution of the endogenous roads resulted from the action of mineral and logging capital, activities that have been expanding in the region independent of territorial planning guidelines. The influences of these activities are important for the changes in the space of use and occupation of the territory and consequently in the processes of deforestation and development of the region.

AB  - Preservation of the biodiversity of medicinal plants makes it possible to create a basis for the development and creation of new medicines through scientifically based nature management. Remote sensing techniques provide solutions for obtaining, analyzing and managing data at different scales: high-resolution satellite imagery and multi-spectral channels can provide information covering large areas, while aerial photography with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) allows you to collect comprehensive biometric information from key areas. Studies carried out on the territory of the Tula region in 2012-2016, showed the advisability of using the UAV for monitoring the reserves of wild medicinal plants. The planned accuracy of the created orthophoto, their photographic quality allowed confidently interprets the plant communities during flowering. Plant resources were estimated with an accuracy of not less than 10%. The result of the joint work was a map and database of stocks of medicinal plants for the study site. The use of multispectral aerial and space imagery, in addition to aerial photography data in the visible range, scales the research of medicinal plants resources on significant areas, which should accelerate the work on large areas. Nevertheless, one of the important problems remains the automation of interpretation of wild-growing herb medicinal plants, connected with the peculiarity of the growth of these communities. The solution of the problem is the application of complex analysis using digital terrain models.

T2  - RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Calibration and validation are two important steps in the application of sediment models requiring observed data. This study aims to investigate the potential use of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), water quality and remote sensing data to calibrate and validate a large-scale sediment model. Observed data from across 108 stations located in the Doce River basin was used for the period between 1997-2010. Ten calibration and validation experiments using the MOCOM-UA optimization algorithm coupled with the MGB-SED model were carried out, which, over the same period of time, resulted in 37 calibration and 111 validation tests. The experiments were performed by modifying metrics, spatial discretization, observed data and parameters of the MOCOM-UA algorithm. Results generally demonstrated that the values of correlation presented slight variations and were superior in the calibration step. Additionally, increasing spatial discretization or establishing a background concentration for the model allowed for improved results. In a station with high quantity of SSC data, calibration improved the ENS coefficient from -0.44 to 0.44. The experiments showed that the spectral surface reflectance, total suspended solids and turbidity data have the potential to enhance the performance of sediment models.

AB  - Strengthening the nation's technological workforce, competing and expanding its relevance in the global economy, and maintaining personal as well as homeland security will be highly dependent on the quantity, quality, and diversity of the next generations of scientists, engineers, technologists, and mathematicians. Production of a diverse generation of human resources with relevant, competitive skills is critical. However, so too is the need to raise an enlightened citizenry with cross-cultural experience and cultural awareness competency, with a broad worldview and global perspectives. These requirements are critical to understanding the challenges and opportunities of scholarly activity in a pluralistic global environment and positioning ourselves to capitalize upon them. Scholars with cross-cultural experience and competency are empowered to adapt and work collaboratively, nationally and globally, with scholars of different races, geopolitical, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds. Development of effective strategies to transform science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments for inclusion and to broaden the participation in STEM across cultures, socioeconomic standing, race, and gender in higher education has been a dominant topic of pedagogical interest of national priority in the last several decades. However, success in these endeavors is achievable only through systemic change and a cultural shift to address the underlying root causes of socioeconomic disparity, gender, and racial disparities and a paucity of cultural awareness among all educational stakeholders. STEM departments can only be truly transformed for inclusion through the development of sensitive, creative, and student-engaging curricula and targeted recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities in STEM. Formation of well-coordinated alliances spanning educational sectors, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and community engagement and outreach are also critical to promoting inclusive and broad participation in STEM education.The first section of the chapter gives an introduction to various challenges, obstacles, and hindrances that prevent a successful transformation of K-12 science education as well as STEM departments in higher education for inclusion. The second section discusses historical perspectives of the University of Arkansas-Fort Smith (UAFS) - the institutional profile, missions, and visions of UAFS as a regional university. Policies and strategies for addressing the socioeconomic disparity, faculty gender, and racial disparities and cultural competency awareness at UAFS are also highlighted in this section. Other approaches including targeted efforts to recruit and retain underrepresented minority students, provision of financial assistance for students from low-income families, and a creative "Math-up" curriculum innovation to promote inclusive and broad participation in STEM at UAFS are highlighted in the latter section of the chapter. Formation of alliances between UAFS, local K - 12 school districts, and governmental and non-governmental agencies to promote broad participation in STEM at UAFS are discussed. The last section of the chapter provides recommendations for adaptation and sustainability of strategies and efforts aimed at transforming national STEM departments for inclusion.

AB  - In mountainous areas with sparse woody vegetation, tree cover is among the most crucial indicators for landscape conservation and ecosystem stability. It is thus essential to be continuously monitored, which is yet seriously hurdled by harsh topography and inaccessibility. Field-based methods are time consuming and costly and are thus particularly prohibitive across large areas. Multispectral remote sensing data sources have been historically used via deriving various vegetation indices to enhance the visual interpretability as well as to deliver practical products from vegetation cover. Whereas indices like NDVI or even more empirically-parametrized indices provide convenient and easy-to-use proxies for large area cover mapping, their robustness to issues raised by shadow, atmospheric and illumination conditions and thus their interpretability for regional cover mapping in sparse vegetation cover are highly questioned. Here, we introduce an efficient method to optimize the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) by particle swarm optimization (PSO). We compared the efficiency of the optimized EVI against the NDVI and the traditional EVI across a portion of remote, sparsely vegetated and mountainous Zagros region in western Iran. The results based on Sentinel 2 sensor data show clear advantages of locally-optimized EVI over the conventional indices in both visual interpretability and explained variance.

AB  - Persistent scatterer Interferometry (PSI) is a technique that processes a stack of satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and measures displacement and 3D position, with millimetric and metric precision respectively in correspondence of sparse points named persistent scatterers (PS). Very dense measurements (e.g., up to tens of thousands of PS per square kilometer with high resolution COSMo-SkyMed SAR data) can be obtained in correspondence of each satellite acquisition date, and over each single infrastructure. This wealth of information is extremely meaningful, but at the same time requires expert knowledge to be converted in a concise description of the underlying phenomena. In this paper, we present a technique that can support end user decisions through automatic information extraction from the PS measurements. The proposed approach is based on: precise location of measurements trough integration with 3D models of the objects under investigation; reconstruction of a model of the displacement integrating measurement from different observation geometries; extraction of statistical indices related to the stability of the infrastructure. The proposed approach appears promising as demonstrated from the results achieved on real COSMO-SkyMed data.

AB  - RADARSAT-2 C-band quad-polarization ocean synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes are decomposed into resonant Bragg scattering from regular (no-breaking) surface and scattering from breaking waves. Analysis of the surface current signatures in dual co- and cross-pol SAR images revealed that governing imaging mechanism is modulations of wave breakings which are very sensitive to the presence of current non-uniformities. As found, due to small relaxation scale, short Bragg waves do not "feel" the current. Thus routinely observed current signatures in quad-pol SAR images originate essentially from wave breaking modulations, and modulation of Bragg waves does not matter this issue.

TI  - LAND USE CHANGES AND ITS DRIVING FACTORS: A CASE STUDY IN NANPING CITY, CHINA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use affect the living environment of humans, considering even the survival and development of human beings. Study on the driving mechanism of land use plays a vital role in the accurate prediction of the changing trends of land use, and sustainable development of land. In this study, the Landsat images in Nanping City from 1995, 2010 and 2015 were obtained and processed using ENVI 5.2 and Arcgis 10.1. Object-oriented classification was used as the land use classification in this study. Transition matrix was used to study the characteristics, directions and structures of land use changes. The driving factors that led to the land use changes were studied using qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis (principal component analysis). The results showed that the forestland increased greatly and the cultivated land decreased significantly over the 20 years. Population, economy, urban development, policy, spending power, and technical factors were the drivers of the land use changes. The impact of comprehensive factors on the land use changes gradually increased with time.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - Because of the thin optical depth, the cirrus cloud is one the clouds that commonly overlooked as clear sky by the cloud mask products. To study the influence of cirrus clouds on the satellite thermal infrared (TIR) data estimated sea surface temperature (SST), the MODIS Terra SST products are used in this study. Six buoy stations measured sea temperatures are acquired from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). In addition, the cirrus optical depth are calculated based on the cirrus reflectance of MODIS cloud mask products. The SST pixels with MODIS cloud products labeled as confident clear-sky and cirrus reflectance flag is cirrus or contrail pixel are taken as cirrus pixels. Taking buoy sea temperatures as the true values, the MODIS SST errors are between 1.2 K and -0.6 K. In addition, five stations' MODIS SST are tend to underestimated as cirrus optical depth increase.

AB  - We studied the quantity and spatial and dynamic changes of land use and ecosystem service functions in Nanping City from 1995 to 2015 using of Landsat TM/ETM images in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2005, and 2015. The results show that the main land use types in the study area were forest land, cultivated land, and grassland, and the rapid growth rate of forest land was in sharp contrast with the decrease of cultivated land. In the conversion of six land use types, conversions among the forest land, cultivated land, and grassland were the most frequent. The forest was spatially schistose distribution and the grassland was clustered in the central and eastern parts, and the construction land was clustered to the central urban area, and the cultivated land was particularly broken, and the distribution pattern changes of the water area and unused land were not obvious. The dynamic changes of cultivated land, construction land, and unused land were more intense and their stability were worse, and the activity of land use in the study area was also increasing. The value of ecosystem services in Nanping was on the rise, and the contribution rate of forest ecosystem services was the highest, which accounted for more than 85% of the whole ecosystem service function, followed by grassland and cultivated land. The contribution rate of water area and unused land decreased less, while the contribution rate of unused land was minimal. Population is one of the driving factors that affect land use changes and the value of ecosystem services in Nanping.

AB  - The SMAP (Soil Moisture Active/Passive) satellite provides global soil moisture (SM) estimates that can be used for scientific research and applications (such as the hydrological cycle, agriculture, ecology, and land atmosphere interactions). Currently, SMAP provides the enhanced radiometer-only SM product (L2SMP) at 9 km grid resolution. However, this spatial resolution is still not enough to satisfy the needs of some studies that require a finer spatial resolution SM product, particularly in agricultural and watershed applications. This study applied a downscaling algorithm to the SMAP 9 km SM product to produce a 1 km resolution over the CONUS (Contiguous United States). The downscaling algorithm is based on the relationship between temperature change and SM modulated by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of a given time period. This relationship was modeled using variables derived from NLDAS (North America Land Data Assimilation System) and NASA's LTDR (Land Long Term Data Record) between 1981 - 2018. The algorithm was implemented uses the 1 km MODIS Aqua LST (Land Surface Temperature) product. The downscaled SMAP 1 km SM was validated using in situ SM measurements from the ISMN (International Soil Moisture Network). The validation metrics show an improved overall accuracy of the downscaled SM.

AB  - The objective of this study is to validate the recent moderate resolution leaf area index (LAI) products generated by MODIS collection 6 (C6) and Geoland2/BioPar project (GEOV2) over major agricultural croplands. Field campaigns were conducted and seasonal continuous LAI measurements were obtained over rice, maize, soybean, and sorghum fields in the Honghe farm (2012 and 2013) and Hailun city (2016) in northeastern China. High resolution 30 m LAI maps were first derived from HJ-1 and Landsat with a look-up table (LUT) method and evaluated with ground-based measurements (R-2 >=.0.67 and RMSE <= 0.90). Consequently, the high resolution LAI was upscaled and compared with the moderate resolution LAI products. The results indicate that both MODIS and GEOV2 capture a consistent seasonal pattern of the crop LAI variation. The moderate resolution LAI products are very closed related to the upscaled high resolution reference LAI.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing of inland water bodies has great potential for ensuring water quality and for obtaining reliable data which can be used for decision making. This is a rapidly evolving technology that is now widely utilized throughout the globe for providing a broad as well as detailed perspective on earth-system status and change. Inland water processes, such as eutrophication, may have a major impact on human life and can lead to environmental disasters. This study investigates the optical effect of atmospheric aerosols on remote sensing of the water-leaving radiance (L-w) at Roodeplaat dam. An in-situ measurement field campaign was performed at Roodeplaat dam (Pretoria) during the 2016 winter season, in relation to calibration and validation of Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 3 satellite data. In-situ measurements were performed simultaneously with the satellite overpasses at the dam.In-situ measurements included Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), water vapor column and downwelling spectral irradiance as well as the remote sensing spectral reflectance of the dam, R-rs. A radiative transfer code (Modtran) was used to predict the radiance at the Top of Atmosphere (TOA), compared to actual measurements from Sentinel 2 and 3. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that retrieval of water-leaving radiance at small water bodies such as Roodeplaat dam was sensitive to aerosol optical properties as well as total column.

AB  - Providing an accurate and a timely daily weather forecast on regular basis is necessary but require a very expensive infrastructure especially when it relies on numerical weather prediction (NWP) technology. On the other hand, the needs to deliver probabilistic forecast product will require many ensemble-runs of the NWP model, leading to more computing time or power that will considerably increase computing costs. This study aims to test the performance of alternative approach for a regularly-scheduled daily weather forecast in Indonesia involving many ensemble members. It focuses on evaluating the forecast of daily rainfall occurrence operated under a relatively low computing cost by combining dynamical approach and bias correction technique. The dynamical approach is conducted by performing Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulation by using only one member of Global Forecast System (GFS) data as initial condition and boundary condition data. Meanwhile, the bias correction technique is performed as alternative to get as many as possible ensemble members that can be used for calculating probabilistic rainfall forecast. For this purpose, this study uses 20 ensemble members of forecasted data obtained from Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS). The combined dynamical and bias correction technique has considerably reduced forecast data production time, so it is possible to make it regularly-scheduled for daily updates. Evaluation on the forecast results show that the model forecasts are consistent with GPM satellite data and obtained adequate skills (Brier Skill Score similar to 0.7), especially over land areas with low to medium topography.

CL  - Marseille, FRANCE
AB  - The UK's National Marine Equipment Pool contains over 40 Autonomous Marine Vehicles (AMVs) for use by the UK marine science community. In order to deliver science consistently, the different types of vehicle each require considerable training and a large pool of trained operators to monitor and pilot these vehicles whilst at sea. However, the number of deployments that can be run in parallel is currently limited by the number of human pilots available and the considerable training overhead.At present, in order to pilot a heterogeneous fleet of AMVs, technical knowledge about each platform and a suite of different software is required, restricting the use of mobile devices. The disparate tools and difference in workflow between vehicle types currently makes it challenging to incorporate external knowledge of the environment within the piloting flow, such as ocean models and remote sensing data, which can he invaluable to the pilots and scientists alike. In this paper, we discuss the existing piloting workflows and present the development of a new unified piloting framework. Our work allows pilots to monitor and control a range of AMV types from any web -capable device. One of the overarching aims of the project is to greatly reduce the barrier of entry for piloting AMVs, allowing scientists and end -users to be more involved in the piloting process, subsequently allowing us to increase the efficiency of deployed vehicles, collect the most purposeful data and make best use of the different capabilities offered by each family of vehicle in multi-AMV operations.

TI  - Multicriteria Evaluation of Transport Plan for High-Speed Rail: An Application to Beijing-Xiongan
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Beijing has an enormous transportation challenge: to relieve the extreme congestion that has arisen, largely due to overpopulation. To meet this challenge, the city administration has decided to extend its territory; a new city will be planned and built. This new city, Xiongan, will reduce the burden on the capital. A new high-speed railway (HSR) line is designed to transport millions of people every day within less than an hour. This study applies the potential of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and multicriteria methods, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE II), to determine the best alternative of transportation for the new high-speed railway line between Beijing and Xiongan, comparing different ones. The methodology consists of two stages. In the first stage remote sensing datasets such as ASTER DEM and LANDSAT images and GIS software such as ERDAS IMAGINE and ArcGIS have been used to determine settlement distribution, station location, elevation model, slope percentage, vegetation percentage, and route alignment for a new high-speed railway line for better understanding of its spatial distribution pattern over the study area. The second phase of the study focusing on assessing the various alternatives of transportation has been determined, and three approaches to choosing the best alternative have been introduced. In the paper we examine criteria associated with travel and economic criteria: travel time, the number of train stops, public satisfaction with transport, the number of seats per day, connectivity, operating costs, profit, and the payback period. Six alternatives of transportation have been studied. The stops in Guan and stations in the metro's rings have been investigated. In the second stage, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and PROMETHEE II methods have been used to select the best alternative. The first approach uses only criteria related to the trip, as the criterion to choose the best alternative is the maximum of the net outranking flows by PROMETHEE II method; the second approach applies two independent criteria: the ratio of normalized operating costs and the normalized net outranking flows, and the ratio of the normalized payback period and the normalized net outranking flows; the third approach includes all defined criteria, and the criterion of choosing the best alternative is the maximum of net outranking flows as calculated by the PROMETHEE II method. The approaches have been analyzed with the purpose of comparing the results. The result indicates that it is expedient to have a station in Guan, which will increase the connection and connectivity among the cities while providing fast mobility options for a large number of inhabitants of Guan city. Furthermore, the result from Remote Sensing and GIS analysis demonstrates that the proposed high-speed railway line will be environmentally sustainable and is economically/socially feasible and that it will certainly attract current and future passengers because of their needs.

T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes worldviews and religious beliefs and practices in the Cape Flats area of Cape Town, South Africa, using a mall intercept survey of n=513 visitors to five shopping centers. Variables considered included demographic characteristics, measures of religiosity and religious pluralism, participation in religious activities, and supernaturalism (both related and unrelated to a traditional Christian-Abrahamic worldview). The majority (69.4%) of respondents identifies as Christian, though denominational affiliation is very diverse. The other two prevalent religious affiliations are the African Traditional Religion (16.4%) and Islam (11.7%). Only 1.6% of the respondents self-identified as non-religious, a smaller percentage than has been found in research on Cape Town as a whole or South Africa nationally. The degree of self-reported religiosity, participation in religious activities, and belief in supernatural phenomena are all high. Associations between demographic characteristics and religion and worldview variables are analyzed in detail.

TI  - THE "STONE WORD" IN RUSSIAN POETRY: THE FIGURATIVE PARALLEL "WORDS, POEMS - STONES, METALS"
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article studies a fragment of the figurative worldview of Russian poetry, i. e. comparative tropes which are characterised by the interaction of semantic fields "Words, poems" and "Stones, metals". The article aims to illustrate the ongoing lexicographic project Materials for the Dictionary of Metaphors and Similes of 19th and 20th Centuries Russian Literature and its significance for a systematic description of comparative tropes in terms of their evolution over two centuries. The research is based on the works of about 300 Russian poets, which are the source of the fourth issue of Materials for the Dictionary of Metaphors and Similes of 19th and 20th Centuries Russian Literature - "Stones, metals". Additionally, the authors use materials of the Poetic Sub-corpus of the Russian National Corpus. The figurative parallel considered in the article has not been studied previously as part of linguo-poetic analysis, which makes this research innovative. The study relics on methods of corpus poetics and the basic concepts of the theory of semantic fields. The authors describe the structure of the figurative field "Stones, metals", revealing the semantic relationships between its elements. A figurative field is defined as a hicrarchised set of images of comparison used in comparative tropes and united by a common semantic invariant. The concept of a figurative field is based on the notion of a linguistic semantic field as a set of lexical units concentrated around a general meaning and reflecting a certain conceptual field of the language. The figurative field "Stones, metals" chosen for analysis is divided into the following semantic classes whose elements are connected by genus-species relations: 1. Jewels and semi-precious stones; 2. Precious metals; 3. Metals and alloys; 4. Stones; 5. Metal working and stone working; 6. Deposits; 7. Metal corrosion. The main entities compared with stones and metals are words and poems. Along with these dominant concepts, the authors consider related notions: name, phrase, speech, mumbling swearing, curse, prayer, rumour, and terms related to poetry: sonnet, elegy, rhyme, rhythm, iamb, choree, caesura, line, stanza, etc. The authors provide a classification of formal types of comparative tropes realising the interaction of the semantic categories in question. They conclude that comparative tropes of Russian poetry form a system evolving in time.

TI  - Evolving management of positive regional lymph nodes in melanoma: Past, present and future directions
T2  - ONCOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has become the standard of care for lymph node staging in melanoma and the most important predictor of survival in clinically node-negative disease. Previous guidelines recommend completion lymph node dissection (CLND) in cases of positive SLN; however, the lymph nodes recovered during CLND are only positive in a minority of these cases. Recent evidence suggests that conservative management (i.e. observation) has similar outcomes compared to CLND. We sought to review the most current literature regarding the management of SLN in metastatic melanoma and to discuss potential future directions.

AB  - Flood mapping is important to do as part of emergency response efforts in the event of a disaster. Usually, there are limitations in flood mapping with a direct approach and ineffective mapping efforts, such as: lack of time, cost, and number of personnel in the field. Utilization of remote sensing data can be used as an alternative to overcome this problem with an indirect approach. One of the uses of remote sensing data can be used to provide objective information and can be used to monitor, detect and map floods spatially-temporally. In this paper we will discuss of flood inundation mapping with several color composite combinations from dual-polarization Sentinel 1-A data using three classification methods. The data used is Sentinel 1-A dual-polarization data, in vertical-vertical receive (VV) and vertical-horizontal receive (VH) transmission mode. These datasets were acquired pre- (08 December 2016) and post- (22 February 2017) the flood even of 20 - 22 February 2017. This method is the detection of flooding of surface changes, the classification process for flood inundation mapping (maximum likelihood, minimum distance, and Mahalanobis distance), and then calculating an accuracy assessment. Six kinds of color combinations polarization combination Red Green Blue from the three classification methods. Flood detection of surface changes from a combination of six types of color composites gives very diverse results. The six types are VH_pre-flood - VH_post-flood - VH_pre-flood / VH_post-flood. VH_pre-flood - VV_post-flood VH_pre-flood / VV_post-flood. VV_pre-flood - VV_post-flood - VV_pre-flood / VV_post-flood. VV_pre-flood - G: VH_post-flood - VV_pre-flood / VH_post-flood. VV_ pre-flood - VH_post-flood - VV_post-flood. VH_pre-flood VH_post-flood - VV_post-flood. From the calculation of accuracy for each classification method, the combination of VV_pre-flood - VH_post-flood - VV_post-flood using the minimum distance classification has the highest level of accuracy compared to other combinations. Therefore, to make a flood inundation map using dual-polarization dual-sentinel 1-A data, this composite is the best.

TI  - The Use of NDVI for the Analysis of the Effect of Drought on Vegetation Productivity in the Pre-Urals Steppe Area Where a Population of the Przewalski Horse Equus Ferus Przewalskii Polj., 1881 Had Been Established
T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN THE RESEARCH OF BIODIVERSITY

CP  - 1st International Conference on Information Technologies in the Research of Biodiversity
CL  - Irkutsk, RUSSIA
AB  - The comparison of seasonal dynamics of NDVI between years 2016 of normal-average rainfall and drought-affected 2010 was carried out in the Pre-Urals Steppe area (Orenburg State Nature Reserve, Russia), where a semi-free population of the Przewalski horse had been established. Landsat 7, 8 and Sentinel 2 satellite images were used to calculate NDVI. Vegetation productivity in 63 model-scientific plots were studied in between June 18 and 30, 2016 during the period of maximum development of the vegetation; NDVI for the plots were calculated too. The data were used to build a linear predictive model on the correlation between NDVI and vegetation productivity. Such modelling might prove effective in an estimation of pasture forage resources and the prediction of its changes in dry years. According to the model the extreme drought in 2010 resulted in a 60% decrease in vegetation productivity during the period of maximum development of the vegetation. After a severe drought the drop in winter forage resources may be much more drastic. Yet, a study of the depth and spatial distribution of snow cover is necessary for accurate predictions of a supply of pasture forage for the population of the Przewalski horses.

TI  - FORECAST CHANGES IN THE PRODUCTIVITY OF PLANT COMMUNITIES IN THE PRE-URALS STEPPE SITE OF ORENBURG STATE NATURE RESERVE (RUSSIA) IN EXTREME DROUGHT CONDITIONS USING NDVI
T2  - NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalised-difference vegetative index (NDVI) seasonal dynamics of 15 types of vegetation communities in dry 2010 and in 2016 with favourable weather conditions was studied in the Pre-Urals Steppe site where the Programme on establishing a semi-free population of the Przewalski's horse Equus ferus przewalskii in Orenburg State Nature Reserve started. The NDVI seasonal dynamics in a year with normal weather conditions includes four main phases including the 1st phase of spring NDVI increasing, the 2nd phase of the productivity maximisation of the dominant vegetation, the 3rd phase of the summer progressive decrease in photosynthetic activity in response to the heat and lack of moisture, the 4th phase of low photosynthetic activity lasting from midsummer to the late autumn. The dependence of NDVI on vegetation productivity during its maximum development in the Pre-Urals Steppe in 2016 was described by the linear regression equation. Vegetation productivity on 20 June 2010 and that on 20 June 2016, calculated by the linear regression equation, were compared. The comparison revealed that in 2010, the decline in productivity during vegetation maximum development varied between 19% and 65% depending on the type of plant community. The following plant communities were the least resilient to drought: communities of fallow lands on the locations of previous true steppes, communities which appeared under the influence of overgrazing in the locations of the previous true steppes and the communities of meadow-steppes. Good moistening resulted in a slight decline in productivity communities located in topographical depressions. Productivity of plant communities with early-spring growth of dominating species declined to a lesser degree as the communities are located on a well-warmed surface. Some biological features of the Caragana frutex + Spiraea crenata vegetation type also result in the less decline in productivity. The NDVI coefficient does not accurately reflect productivity at the end of the growing season. Therefore, patterns of declines in productivity of similar vegetation types during the drought in Trans-Urals region in 1998 were used to project the autumn decline in vegetation productivity during the drought in the Pre-Urals Steppe. Based on these findings, the average vegetation productivity in the Pre-Urals Steppe in autumn in dry 2010 were four to five times lower than that during the maximum plant development in 2016 which had favourable weather conditions. As the height of vegetation considerably reduces during drought, the availability of pasture forage may sharply drop in winter, especially if a deep snow cover accumulates and unevenly distributes according to terrain relief. In the Pre-Urals Steppe, only some steppe communities, covering about 20% of the area, are the most accessible to supply Przewalski's horses with dry pasture forage in winter. Projecting the winter supply of pasture forage after a severe drought should be based on the assumption that the forage availability may reduce by 8 to 10 times as compared with calculated summer productivity in a year with favourable weather conditions. In this regard, there is a need to make stocks of hay for feeding horses in winter after a drought. For potentially repeated droughts the sufficient amount of hay to feed Przewalski's horses in the Pre-Urals Steppe over two winter seasons should be stocked in years with normal precipitation as it will be difficult to make the stock in a dry year.For a final assessment of the accessibility of winter pasture forage stock for Przewalski's horses in the Pre-Urals Steppe, some additional field studies of productivity of the main vegetation types at the end of the growing season using the harvest method are necessary as well as an analysis of the distribution and height of snow cover on the territory in years with high winter precipitation.

TI  - Predictive Ecosystem Mapping of South-Eastern Australian Temperate Forests Using Lidar-Derived Structural Profiles and Species Distribution Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern approaches to predictive ecosystem mapping (PEM) have not thoroughly explored the use of characteristic' gradients, which describe vegetation structure (e.g., light detection and ranging (lidar)-derived structural profiles). In this study, we apply a PEM approach by classifying the dominant stand types within the Central Highlands region of south-eastern Australia using both lidar and species distribution models (SDMs). Similarity percentages analysis (SIMPER) was applied to comprehensive floristic surveys to identify five species which best separated stand types. The predicted distributions of these species, modelled using random forests with environmental (i.e., climate, topography) and optical characteristic gradients (Landsat-derived seasonal fractional cover), provided an ecological basis for refining stand type classifications based only on lidar-derived structural profiles. The resulting PEM model represents the first continuous distribution map of stand types across the study region that delineates ecotone stands, which are seral communities comprised of species typical of both rainforest and eucalypt forests. The spatial variability of vegetation structure incorporated into the PEM model suggests that many stand types are not as continuous in cover as represented by current ecological vegetation class distributions that describe the region. Improved PEM models can facilitate sustainable forest management, enhanced forest monitoring, and informed decision making at landscape scales.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Event-driven monitoring policies enable to significantly reduce the power consumption of wireless sensor networks by reducing the recording period to those time intervals that provide valuable data. The resulting longer operation lifetime increase discloses fields of application that require long monitoring periods. This paper presents a structural monitoring system that uses specialized sentinel nodes for detecting possibly heavy road vehicles and for alarming monitoring nodes, which are specialized on strain sensing. Heavy vehicles are identified by estimating nearly in real time height and length of vehicles of a traffic flow by processing data recorded from low-cost ultrasonic and magnetic displacement sensors. Field tests demonstrated that while height detection is very reliable, length detection is too imprecise to discriminate with high success rates between trucks and delivery vans.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel method for building change detection using coherent and incoherent features of high resolution multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Three coherent and incoherent features are used to define pixel-level building change, while initial result is obtained through multi-threshold. After that, initial result is segmented into different areas based on the same time of change. Then, dynamic time warping (DTW) similarity measure is selected for binary classification in each area to separate it into changed and unchanged classes. Experimental result obtained from 10 TerraSAR-X Stripmap SAR images, shows the effective performance of the proposed approach.

TI  - Multisource Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Fusion for Urban Land-Use Mapping based on a Modified Two-Branch Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate urban land-use mapping is a challenging task in the remote-sensing field. With the availability of diverse remote sensors, synthetic use and integration of multisource data provides an opportunity for improving urban land-use classification accuracy. Neural networks for Deep Learning have achieved very promising results in computer-vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection. However, the problem of designing an effective deep-learning model for the fusion of multisource remote-sensing data still remains. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a modified two-branch convolutional neural network for the adaptive fusion of hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. Specifically, the proposed model consists of a HSI branch and a LiDAR branch, sharing the same network structure to reduce the time cost of network design. A residual block is utilized in each branch to extract hierarchical, parallel, and multiscale features. An adaptive-feature fusion module is proposed to integrate HSI and LiDAR features in a more reasonable and natural way (based on "Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks"). Experiments indicate that the proposed two-branch network shows good performance, with an overall accuracy of almost 92%. Compared with single-source data, the introduction of multisource data improves accuracy by at least 8%. The adaptive fusion model can also increase classification accuracy by more than 3% when compared with the feature-stacking method (simple concatenation). The results demonstrate that the proposed network can effectively extract and fuse features for a better urban land-use mapping accuracy.

AB  - Paddy rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Information of the area and spatial distribution of paddy rice is significant for food security, water resources management, and greenhouse gas (methane) emissions. Paddy rice field is characterized by an initial period of flooding and transplanting, during which period open canopy (a mixture of rice crops and surface water) exists. The present algorithms for paddy rice recognition are mainly based on the unique physical features of paddy rice and the vegetation indices, which are sensitive to dynamics of the canopy and surface water content. In this study, the rice growth calendar data and the cropping pattern (e.g., single rice or double rice) information were used to improve present phenology-based rice recognition approach by determining the potential temporal window of flooding and transplanting periods over a year. Other land cover types (e.g., snow, evergreen vegetation and permanent water bodies) with potential influences on paddy rice identification were removed (masked out) due to different temporal profiles. The results showed that the estimated rice area is in line with the provincial agricultural statistics with R-2 and slope are 0.951, 1.049, respectively, and the relative errors of the different province are between -15.81% to 25.75%.

AB  - The problem of class imbalance is often encountered in remote sensing data and has a negative effect on the classification performance of supervised classifiers even in ensemble models. The ensemble margin is a fundamental concept in ensemble learning with potential effectiveness in improving the classification of remote sensing data. This paper proposes a novel margin based extended random forest algorithm to address the class imbalance issues in the difficult context of remote sensing classification. This algorithm combines ensemble learning with data sampling. A comparative analysis is conducted with respect to standard random forest, under-sampling and over-sampling combined ensembles.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)

AB  - High spatial resolution multi-temporal data provide more spatial details for mapping and monitoring urban land change from unbuilt to built-up areas. Spatio-temporal contextual information has been recognized as useful features in identification of urban land expansion. This paper adopts a multi-band temporal texture measure with pseudo cross multivariate variogram (PCMV) to quantify local spatio-temporal dependence between bi-temporal multispectral images. The multi-band temporal texture features obtained are combined with bi-temporal multispectral images to detect urban built-up area change using direct multi-temporal image classification. One-class random forest (OCRF), a recently proposed one-class classifier, is used in multi-temporal image classification by sampling one specific class of interest, i.e., built-up area expansion. Experimental results demonstrated that the incorporation of multi-band temporal textures outperformed that using spectral features alone, with increases of 10.55% and 1.74% in overall accuracy, for SPOT-5 and Sentinel-2 data, respectively. Similarly, its overall accuracy is 11.08% and 0.24% higher than incorporating single-band temporal textures. The inclusion of PCMV multi-band temporal texture in direct multi-temporal image classification by OCRF is found effective in urban built-up area change detection.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a fundamental Earth parameter, on both regional and global scales. We used seven Landsat images to derive LST at Suzhou City, in spring and summer 1996, 2004, and 2016, and examined the spatial factors that influence the LST patterns. Candidate spatial factors include (1) land coverage indices, such as the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the normalized difference water index (NDWI), (2) proximity factors such as the distances to the city center, town centers, and major roads, and (3) the LST location. Our results showed that the intensity of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) has continuously increased, over time, and the spatial distribution of SUHI was different between the two seasons. The SUHIs in Suzhou were mainly distributed in the city center, in 1996, but expanded to near suburban, in 2004 and 2016, with a substantial expansion at the highest level of SUHIs. Our buffer-zone-based gradient analysis showed that the LST decays logarithmically, or decreases linearly, with the distance to the Suzhou city center. As inferred by the generalized additive models (GAMs), strong relationships exist between the LST and the candidate factors, where the dominant factor was NDBI, followed by NDWI and NDVI. While the land coverage indices were the LST dominant factors, the spatial proximity and location also substantially influenced the LST and the SUHIs. This work improved our understanding of the SUHIs and their impacts in Suzhou, and should be helpful for policymakers to formulate counter-measures for mitigating SUHI effects.

TI  - A Block Ramp Errors Correction Method of Planet Subpixel Offset: Application to the 2018 Mw 7.5 Palu Earthquake, Indonesia
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Planet optical images have a short revisit period and high spatial resolution, so they have great potential in surface offset monitoring. However, few studies have focused on the error source analysis and accuracy improvement in the offset field of Planet images. In this study, we investigate the optimal band selection of the Planet images and the error sources for subpixel offset monitoring, using the 28 Sept. 2018 Mw7.5 Palu earthquake as an example. The results show that Band 2 is the optimal band for surface offset monitoring and ramp errors are the dominating error source in the offset field. Considering the imaging characteristics of Planet satellites, we propose a block ramp errors correction method. Our proposed method can improve the accuracy of the Planet subpixel offset by 25% in comparison with the traditional method. We also compare the Planet images subpixel offset result with the Sentinel-2 subpixel offset result and find they are in good consistency. We combine the corrected Planet images offset and SAR images offset to solve the complete 3D deformation field of the Palu earthquake, which shows that the ruptured fault is a left-lateral strike-slip fault accommodated with normal component in the Palu-Koro fault. The earthquake was dominated by south-north and vertical deformation, with the maximum deformation of 6 m and 4 m in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. This study also has set a good example for using the Planet images for natural hazards monitoring (such as earthquakes and landslides).

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - To explore the shifting status of the street in contemporary mapping culture, this chapter attends to two map-based walking performances by US-born artist Jeremy Wood, who uses Global Positioning Systems to transform grounded mobility into a means of cartographic inscription. Whereas Michel de Certeau describes cartography as an elevated visuality, regimenting urban practice from above, my argument stresses how Wood's mappings conflate lived mobility and synoptic cartography. Extending mapping to the street, his practice exemplifies digital mapping's expansion beyond institutional domains. To close, however, I show how Wood's art also exposes slippages and pretentions of existential security in digital mapping's worldview of securely calculated locations, which are recast as ghostly projections in a universe without essential orientation.

AB  - Soil salinity is one of the most important controlling factors in agricultural production. For an agrarian country like Bangladesh, it is vital to map the saline affected area and keep track of changes. It would be very convenient if the conventional time consuming method of detection soil salinity could be replaced with the application of remote sensing indices. So this study aimed to evaluate the applicability of Landsat 5 TM images, both level 1 and 2 for detecting saline affected areas of Coastal Bangladesh. Seventeen indices were used and compared with the field salinity data collected from SRDI. The R-2 values reveal no significant correlation between the aforementioned indices and soil data. So this study concluded that Landsat TM images cannot be used to detect soil salinity in Coastal Bangladesh.

TI  - Spatial analysis of aerosol optical depth obtained by air quality modelling and SEVIRI satellite observations over Portugal
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to explore the aerosol optical depth (AOD) data provided by different sources, namely satellite observations, air quality modelling and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations, in order to improve characterisation of aerosol spatial distribution and to assess the contribution of the dust events on AOD over Portugal. Thus, the spatial and temporal variations of the AOD data were analysed for May 2011 taking into account the occurrence of mineral dust events.Satellite data obtained by Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) instrument and air quality modelling results from the Comprehensive Air Quality Model (CAMx) over Portugal were explored. In this work, AOD values with a temporal resolution of 15 min were obtained from SEVIRI. Additionally, 3D data with 23 vertical layers for each aerosol constituent, size distribution and chemical composition were obtained from the modelling approach and used to compute the AOD at 550 nm by integrating of aerosol extinction coefficient (Qext) over the total atmospheric column.Despite the outbreaks of mineral dust occurring during this period, the overall contribution of organic carbon (OC), black carbon (BC) and sulphate (SO4) compounds to the monthly average AOD values estimated by the model is very important achieving 95% mainly located in the northern part of the studied region. The model outputs and SEVIRI data were validated with AERONET observations presenting correlation coefficients of 0.71 and 0.68 respectively. Three different modes of aerosol were classified based on Angstrom coefficient versus AOD and distinguishing between the dominance of fine and coarse aerosol fractions. The analysis implemented reveal that intercomparison of satellite observations with air quality modelling contribute to better understanding of the discrepancies presented in spatial pattern of AOD.

AB  - Using near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and resonant Auger spectroscopy (RAS) in conjunction with the core-hole clock methodology the electronic structure, molecular ordering and orientation and charge transfer dynamics in the femtosecond time scale of 2,7-di-tert-pentyl[1] benzothieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene (di(Me)(2)Pr-BTBT), 2,7-di-iso-propyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene (diiPr-BTBT) and 2,7-di-tert butyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene (ditBu-BTBT) films were investigated. Total electron yield (TEY) and fluorescence yield (FY) NEXAFS spectra were recorded with the aim of determining the preferred molecular orientation of the oligomers at the surface and in the bulk. Angular dependent sulfur is NEXAFS spectra for diiPr-BTBT and ditBu-BTBT films deposited onto FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) point to well-organized films with a preferred edge-on geometry, while for the di(Me)(2)Pr-BTBT film little variation is seen, indicating that the film matches its herringbone crystal packing. Films prepared on ITO (indium tin oxide) and silicon were also investigated by TEY and FY NEXAFS. Greater film ordering is observed in the bulk. The electron charge transfer time following sulfur K-edge main resonance was calculated. The ditBu-BTBT films showed the lowest charge transfer time as well as greater molecular organization, pointing to an increased coupling, as compared to the other oligomers.

AB  - In this paper, we will study the recent poetic mass phenomenon that emerged in social networks; "poetry 2.0". Although it resisted to the democratization demanded by the public, the poetic discourse spurred by social networks has finally succumbed. Since in liquid societies everything is prone to be converted into a consumption item, there are several questions that assail us and we will try to answer them: what is the relationship between poetry-internet-market? Are we facing a case of best-selling poetry? What has been the necessary impulse for the birth of "poetry 2.0"? What place does this poetic manifestation occupy in the literary field and in the collective worldview?

AB  - Forests cover one third of Europe's land and significantly contribute to the regional economy. Moreover, they play an essential role in climate regulation. Traditional inventory-based forest data update is often much lower than required. Remote Sensing is a valuable source for forest monitoring, as it provides periodic data on vegetation status. In this context, EU Horizon-2020 MySustainableForest project (MSF, Grant Agreement no 776045) aims at developing remote sensingderived geo-information services for integrated forest management through a web service platform.An unsupervised method to obtain a forest mask over European forests using optical Sentinel-2 data was implemented. K-means algorithm was used for segmenting the images in clusters, which were subsequently assigned to a forest class depending on its overlap with the forest classes of ancillary land cover data. The resulting classification was refined applying a filter and a vegetation mask. The algorithm was tested over 16 sites representing Europe's main biogeographic regions. A confusion matrix was built using points selected via photointerpretation. Validation metrics were computed from the confusion matrix.The results showed that it is possible to develop an automatic forest mask for Europe, (overall accuracy above 90%). Accuracies varied depending on forest characteristics. Best results were achieved in Boreal and Continental forests. Although the algorithm was tuned to consider the diversity of European forests, there is scope for improving the adaptability of MSF Forest Mask, mainly in the southern Mediterranean region, where the mixed effect of tree-grass formations hindered a better forest discrimination. These results may be of interest to forest and land managers and climate modellers.

AB  - Forests cover 36.5% of Spanish land. Natural and man-induced disturbances are causing important changes in species distribution. As Spanish National Forest Inventory is updated every 10 years, a more recurrent periodic data source providing information on species distribution is needed in order to predict changes in forest area and composition. Remote Sensing meets this demand, as it provides periodic and spatially continuous data on forest status. In this context, MySustainableForest (MSF) H2020 project aims at providing remote sensing-based geo-information services through a web service platform.One of MSF products is a classification of main forest types, whose preliminary development was tested over a 950 km(2) area located in Northern Spain. A Random Forest model was trained with data delineated with the help of local forest data. The output was validated using stratified k-fold cross-validation. Validation metrics were computed from the confusion matrix for each class separately and for the total set of classes.Although overall metrics were high (OA = 95%; DC = 85.1%), they varied significantly for different classes (e.g., Fagus sylvatica was classified with higher accuracy than Pinus nigra, which was mainly confused with other Pinus species), showing that species with higher seasonal variations were easier to identify. Random Forest feature importance ranking showed that bands in the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) wavelengths were essential to discriminate forest species, since they explained more than 40% of the variations alone and 82% in combination with Red wavelength.

AB  - Time series of satellite images allows better monitoring and detecting the dynamics of urban growth. The objective of this research is to detect the urban area between the city of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo in the period of 2014-2015 using MODIS digital time series. We used the product MOD13Q1 referring to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 16-day composite data, with spatial resolution of 250 meters. The high variety of elements imposes a great difficulty in mapping urban areas. Therefore, we calculated the nearest neighbor using the Euclidian distance for each time signature. The different image group of the urban targets were into a single image considering the minimum value of each pixel within the set. Therefore, a limit value separated the urban areas from the rest. This methodology allowed the detection of urban areas considering their diversity. The algorithm is written in C ++ language.

T2  - CONTEXTO-REVISTA DO PROGRAMA DE POS-GRADUACAO EM LETRAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The literature of testimony can be classified in two large categories: the mediated and the non-mediated testimony. This article analyses the first category as seen in Art Spiegelman's Maus: a survival's tale (1987) because the comic book comprises an interview from Art Spiegelman to his father Vladek Spiegelman, a Holocaust survivor. Our hypothesis is that Art Spiegelman creates a palimpsest testimony due to its constant transition between mediated and non-mediated testimony. Thus, from the reading of observations from Seligmann-Silva (2002), Alos (2008), Salgueiro (2012), among others, we conclude that Spiegelman innovates the format of the literature of testimony by consolidating the importance of its presence in contemporary literature.

TI  - FOSTERING AWARENESS OF SELF IN THE EDUCATION OF SOCIAL WORK STUDENTS BY MEANS OF CRITICAL REFLECTIVITY
T2  - SOCIAL WORK-MAATSKAPLIKE WERK
M3  - Article
AB  - Fostering awareness of self in the education of social work students has focused primarily on a micro-conceptualisation of the self, which implies that the attention was, and still is, mainly on the intrapsychic processes generated by theory and field practicum. But the development of the professional self should also encompass a macro-conceptualisation, where students have to ask themselves how they contribute to the maintenance of societal structures and how these structures influence them in the forming of their own assumptions and belief systems about the self and the world. Three categories of critical-reflectivity questions can be asked about a parable on death and dying, thereby sensitising students to the self as a product of, as well as a co-creator of, society in the grieving process. These questions furthermore resonate within an African-centred worldview in the understanding of the self.

AB  - More than 1,100 ESA Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired over Japan since November 2014 have been processed by means of the SqueeSART algorithm, creating a national InSAR database all over the country. This interferometric dataset allowed the generation of an unprecedented synoptic view of the areas affected by displacement phenomena. Special attention was paid to the estimation of vertical and horizontal (east-west) displacement data, by properly combining InSAR data obtained from both ascending and descending satellite tracks. This SAR data processing all over Japan allowed the generation of an easy-to-use geodetic dataset, largely complementary to the data available via GPS-GNSS receivers. A first preliminary analysis of the results made it possible the detection (or just the confirmation) of a number of deformation phenomena associated to different natural or anthropogenic causes: from secular creeping of seismic faults, to subsidence induced by fluid extraction, from slow landslides to inflation of volcanic areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is based upon results from a doctoral research and expands the analyzing Protected Areas (AP) of the Island of Santa Catarina, in the city of Florianopolis. They have a diversity of landscapes, allowing for a vast array of habitats, but they also have the fragmentation rather than the connection among AP as a limitation, besides having issues related to management. The methodological procedures have been based on the mapping and characterization of the island's AP, with emphasis to the Conservation Units (CU). Maps of land coverage and use have been generated by using LANDSAT satellite images of the years 1986, 1995 e 2010. The analysis of the elements have identified the fragmentation of the habitats, where one can still find environmental corridors and possibilities of connection. As the final result of the research it has been possible to: diagnose the AP; understand that the urban area growth has been insulating the AP; and conclude that the AP have been discussed within territorial and urban planning of the city, but that there has not been integration between environmental management agencies at different levels.

TI  - Identification of Dust Sources in a Saharan Dust Hot-Spot and Their Implementation in a Dust-Emission Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although mineral dust plays a key role in the Earth's climate system and in climate and weather prediction, models still have difficulties in predicting the amount and distribution of mineral dust in the atmosphere. One reason for this is the limited understanding of the distribution of dust sources and their behavior with respect to their spatiotemporal variability in activity. For a better estimation of the atmospheric dust load, this paper presents an approach to localize dust sources and thereby estimate the sediment supply for a study area centered on the Air Massif in Niger with a north-south extent of 16 degrees-22 degrees N and an east-west extent of 4 degrees-12 degrees E. This approach uses optical Sentinel-2 data at visible and near infrared wavelengths together with HydroSHEDS flow accumulation data to localize ephemeral riverbeds. Visible channels from Sentinel-2 data are used to detect sand sheets and dunes. The identified sediment supply map was compared to the dust source activation frequency derived from the analysis of Desert-Dust-RGB imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation series of satellites. This comparison reveals the strong connection between dust activity, prevailing meteorology and sediment supply. In a second step, the sediment supply information was implemented in a dust-emission model. The simulated emission flux shows how much the model results benefit from the updated sediment supply information in localizing the main dust sources and in retrieving the seasonality of dust activity from these sources. The described approach to characterize dust sources can be implemented in other regional model studies, or even globally, and can thereby help to get a more accurate picture of dust source distribution and a more realistic estimation of the atmospheric dust load.

TI  - Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) from influenza in adult patients in Chile: the experience of a sentinel hospital
T2  - REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To 1) describe clinical characteristics of adult patients in Chile with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) associated with influenza viruses, and 2) analyze virus subtypes identified in specimens collected from those patients, hospital resources used in clinical management, clinical evolution, and risk factors associated with a fatal outcome, using observational data from the SARI surveillance network (SARInet).Methods. Adults hospitalized from 1 July 2011 to 31 December 2015 with influenza-associated SARI at a SARI sentinel surveillance hospital in Santiago were identified and the presence of influenza in all cases confirmed by reverse transcription polymerise chain reaction (RT-PCR), using respiratory samples.Results. A total of 221 patients (mean age: 74.1 years) were hospitalized with influenza-associated SARI during the study period. Of this study cohort, 91.4% had risk factors for complications and 34.3% had been vaccinated during the most recent campaign. Pneumonia was the most frequent clinical manifestation, occurring in 57.0% of the cohort; other manifestations included influenza-like illness, exacerbated chronic bronchitis, decompensated heart failure, and asthmatic crisis. Cases occurred year-round, with an epidemic peak during autumn-winter. Both influenza A (H1N1pdm09 and H3N2) and B virus co-circulated. Critical care beds were required for 26.7% of the cohort, and 19.5% needed ventilatory assistance. Multivariate analysis identified four significant factors associated with in-hospital mortality: 1) being bedridden (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 22.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.0-164); 2) admission to critical care unit (aOR: 8.9; CI: 1.44-55); 3) Pa0(2)/Fi0(2),ratio < 250 (aOR: 5.8; CI: 1.02-33); and 4) increased serum creatinine concentration (> 1 mg/dL) (aOR: 5.47; CI:1.20-24). Seasonal influenza vaccine was identified as a significant protective factor (aOR: 0.14; CI: 0.021-0.90).Conclusions. Influenza-associated SARI affected mainly elderly patients with underlying conditions. Most patients evolved to respiratory failure and more than one-quarter required critical care beds. Clinical presentation was variable. Death was associated with host characteristics and disease-associated conditions, and vaccine was protective. Virus type did not influence outcome.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze Land Surface Temperature (LST) on pasture areas with different production systems and management based on survey with farmers and remote sensing data for four development cycles (20132017). The study was carried out on western Sao Paulo state, Brazil, which is known as its traditional pastureland areas. We analyzed different type of production system such as extensive, semi-extensive and intensive pasture. The band 10 from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) was used to retrieve the LST, and to verify the inter-seasonal productivity variation in function of management and temperature we calculated Net Primary Production - NPP. By the survey and visual analysis, we could classify the pasture areas as degraded and non-degraded area. For this classification, only pasture in degradation or maintenance phase was identified. Degraded pasture in the first or second cycle was recovered after proper management. However, the inverse effect was also verified, areas in maintenance became degraded. It occurred not only because of the management practices but also because of extreme meteorological conditions. For those considered degraded pasture we verified an average temperature of 27 degrees C - 29 degrees C, and areas with the proper management the average temperature where 24 degrees C - 26 degrees C. On farms which were verified lost of productivity in function of degradation the temperature raised around 2 degrees C. For this study, the use of remote sensing data to retrieve LST data shows to be an additional tool for monitoring pasture areas in function of management and productivity.

AB  - In this work we developed a system to automate the processes of data reduction and analysis of galaxy clusters observed by Chandra X-ray satellite. This automation enables generation of temperature and gas density profiles from raw data of multiple observations, making data reduction and analysis easier and faster. The automation script uses a standard reducing data process from Chandra, extracts spectrum from data, and simultaneously fits the spectra of multiple observations while performing the deprojection process. We show some outputs of the reduction and analysis to demonstrate how the automation works.

TI  - Arctic kelp forests: Diversity, resilience and future
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Review
AB  - The Arctic is one of the most rapidly changing places on Earth and it is a sentinel region for understanding the range and magnitude of planetary changes, and their impacts on ecosystems. However, our understanding of arctic coastal ecosystems remains limited, and the impacts of ongoing and future climate change on them are largely unexplored. Kelp forests are the dominant habitat along many rocky Arctic coastlines, providing structure and food for economically and ecologically important species. Here we synthesize existing information on the distribution and diversity of arctic kelp forests and assess how ongoing changes in environmental conditions could impact the extent, productivity, and resilience of these important ecosystems. We identify regions where the range and growth of arctic kelp are likely to undergo rapid short-term increase due to reduced sea ice cover, increased light, and warming. However, we also describe areas where kelps could be negatively impacted by rising freshwater input and coastal erosion due to receding sea ice and melting permafrost. In some regions, arctic kelp forests have undergone sudden regime shifts due to altered ecological interactions or changing environmental conditions. Key knowledge gaps for arctic kelp forests include measures of extent and diversity of kelp communities (especially northern Canada and northeastern Russia), the faunal communities supported by many of these habitats, and the role of arctic kelp forests in structuring nearby pelagic and benthic food webs. Filling in these gaps and strategically prioritizing research in areas of rapid environmental change will enable more effective management of these important habitats, and better predictions of future changes in the coastal ecosystems they support and the services that they provide.

AB  - In the management of patients with early stage cervical cancer, minimally invasive approach is considered to be the golden standard now days, and it is routinely performed.Cervical cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in women worldwide and is unfortunately diagnosed in advanced stages of the disease [1]. The goal of the LACC study, conducted by MD Anderson Cancer Center, an examination of the Surveillance, Epidemiology & End Result (SEER) database from the USA, was to investigate whether disease-free survival (DFS) among patients who underwent minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic or robotic) was non-inferior compared to standard-of-care open radical hysterectomy. The secondary outcome measures were to study the patterns of recurrence, costs, quality of life, pelvic floor distress inventory, overall survival, feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy, intra-operative, peri-operative, post-operative and long-term treatment related morbidity.Minimal invasive surgery for any gynaecological pathology has become increasingly popular in recent years, and has been easily adopted across Europe. Many studies and systematic reviews, demonstrated the advantages of this approach: less complications, shorter hospital stay, lower transfusion rates, faster post operative recovery. [2-3]Recently, results from studies of two groups, came as a surprise, and also as a concern, because of the suggestion that there might be lower overall survival rates and higher recurrence rates for minimally invasive approach to radical hysterectomy, compared to open surgery. One study from the MD Anderson Cancer Centre examining the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) database and the other study, early data from the Laparoscopic Approach to Cervical Cancer (LACC) study.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present survey addresses the comprehensive description of geographic locations, transport ways, size, and vertical aerosol distribution during four large dust events which occurred in the Northwest China. Based on the data from 35 ground-based air quality monitoring stations and the satellite data, emission flows for dust events within the period of 2014 to 2017 have been estimated. The data show that maximum peak daily average PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations exceeded 380 and 150 mu g/m(3), respectively, and the PM2.5/PM10 ratio was ranging within 0.12-0.66. Both satellite data and simulation data of the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) coincide with location and extension of a dust cloud. The Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) found dust at 0 to 10km altitude which remained at this level during the most part of its trajectory. The vertical aerosol distribution at a wave of 532nm total attenuated backscatter coefficient range of 0.0025-0.003km(-1) x sr(-1). Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Terra) Collection 6 Level-3 aerosol products data show that aerosol optical depth (AOD) at pollution epicenters exceeds 1. A comprehensive data survey thus demonstrated that the main sources of high aerosol pollutions in the territory were deserted areas of North and Northwest China as well as the most part of the Republic of Mongolia, where one of the largest deserts, Gobi, extends.

T2  - Marine Biological Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite data to study the chlorophyll a dynamics, in contrast to contact methods, allows carrying out large scale research with high frequency of measurements. Such observations were carried out in the Black Sea offshore and inshore areas from 1998 to 2015. They made it possible to estimate the annual and interannual chlorophyll a dynamics in the surface layer and to reveal the periodicity, intensity, and duration of mass development of algae. In the western and eastern cyclonic gyres as well as in the shelf zone off the Crimean and Caucasus coasts, annual chlorophyll dynamics had the same pattern as that repeating year after year. From August-September to April-May of the next year the variation of chlorophyll in most cases corresponded to normal distribution and had a form of a bell-shaped curve with maximum observed in December-January. During autumn period, the chlorophyll concentration gradually increased with water cooling and seasonal pycnoclyne weakening. In winter the chlorophyll concentration decreased due to increase of mixed layer depth. Spring phytoplankton intensive development was observed every year when convective mixing weakened and stability of water column increased.

TI  - Visual interpretation of stereoscopic NDVI satellite images to map rainfall<bold>-</bold>induced landslides
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide inventory maps are commonly prepared through the visual interpretation of stereoscopic aerial photographs and field checks. Stereoscopic satellite images can also be interpreted visually to recognize and map landslides. When interpreting stereoscopic imagery, shadows can conceal the photographic elements typical of landslides, hampering the recognition and mapping of the landslides. To mitigate the problem, we propose a method that exploits normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images and digital stereoscopy for the 3D visual recognition and mapping of landslides in shadowed areas. We tested the method in the 25km(2) Pogliaschina catchment, northern Italy, where intense rainfall caused abundant landslides on 25 October 2011. Using a PLANAR (R) StereoMirror digital stereoscope, we prepared an event landslide inventory map (E-LIM) through the visual interpretation of a pair of NDVI images obtained from a WorldView-2 stereoscopic multispectral bundle. We compared the event inventory with two independent E-LIMs for the same area and landslide event. The 3D vision of the NDVI stereoscopic image pair maximized the use of the radiometric (color and tone) and the terrain (elevation, slope, relief, and convexity) information captured by the stereoscopic multispectral images, allowing for the recognition of more landslides and more landslide areas than the other E-LIMs in the shadowed areas. Our results confirm that use of NDVI images facilitates the visual recognition and mapping of landslides in terrain affected by shadows. We expect that the proposed method can help trained interpreters to map landslides more accurately in areas affected by shadows.

CL  - Bandung Inst Technol, Bandung, INDONESIA
AB  - The occurrence of precipitation in basin topography area at Bandung can be generated from repeatedly formed convective clouds in one diurnal cycle, which also is detected as multiple rain peaks during a day. In satellite observations, the formation of a new convective cell after dissipation stage of the predecessor cell around or in the same location indicates a regeneration process. The daily convective activities were analyzed during February-May 2017 to understand the regeneration of precipitating convective clouds in Bandung area. The rainfall events were obtained from cumulative distribution function (CDF) at the highest percentages of daily precipitation. This study proposed regeneration index (RegI) as initial identification for convective cloud regeneration from daily rainfall data with multiple peaks. The cases that obtained through the RegI were then verified by satellite data. Both cases at 27 February and 1 May 2017 show that the regeneration of convective cloud was detected in the study area. The precipitating convective clouds initiate in the north Bandung while regenerate and propagate southward. These cases suggest that the highest percentages of daily rainfall in basin topography area can be generated by multiple convective clouds.

Remote sensing offers the better alternative for oil palm age measurement over the conventional approach to solving the problem in the lack of information in the spatial distribution of empty fruit bunch resources. Forest Canopy Density model was employed to estimate the age of oil palm trees that used to count the amount of empty fruit bunch production in the research area. Time series remote sensing data analysis was performed to detailing the class of stands age. Based on oil palm trees age, empty fruit bunch production was estimated with the result Cikasungka area has the biggest potential production with 1.98 KT/year following by Cimulang with 1.75 KT/year and Candali with 1.72 KT/year.

TI  - Subsidence Zonation Through Satellite Interferometry in Coastal Plain Environments of NE Italy: A Possible Tool for Geological and Geomorphological Mapping in Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main aim of this paper is to test the use of multi-temporal differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) techniques as a tool for geological and geomorphological surveys in urban areas, where anthropogenic features often completely obliterate landforms and surficial deposits. In the last two decades, multi-temporal DInSAR techniques have been extensively applied to many topics of Geosciences, especially in geohazard analysis and risks assessment, but few attempts have been made in using differential subsidence for geological and geomorphological mapping. With this aim, interferometric data of an urbanized sector of the Venetian-Friulian Plain were considered. The data derive by permanent scatterers InSAR processing of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by ERS 1/2, ENVISAT, COSMO SKY-Med and Sentinel-1 missions from 1992 to 2017. The obtained velocity maps identify, with high accuracy, the border of a fluvial incised valley formed after the last glacial maximum (LGM) and filled by unconsolidated Holocene deposits. These consist of lagoon and fluvial sediments that are affected by a much higher subsidence than the surrounding LGM deposits forming the external plain. Displacement time-series of localized sectors inside the post-LGM incision allowed the causes of vertical movements to be explored, which consist of the consolidation of recent deposits, due to the loading of new structures and infrastructures, and the exploitation of the shallow phreatic aquifer.

TI  - Energy Dependence of Delayed-Neutron Data
T2  - 5TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON NUCLEAR DATA EVALUATION FOR REACTOR APPLICATIONS (WONDER-2018)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 5th International Workshop on Nuclear Data Evaluation for Reactor Applications (WONDER)
CL  - Aix en Provence, FRANCE
AB  - Delayed neutron data is essential in inherent reactor safety and in reactor control. The different sources and results of delayed neutron data in international databases will be discussed. In addition to direct measurement, these data can be obtained by calculations based on fission yields (FY) and radioactive decay data (RDD). Unfortunately, FY are only given at three energies in the European library JEFF. This works proposes to use GEF-FY energy dependence to extrapolate JEFF-FY at other energies. The preliminary results highlight that GEF energy dependence is not always suitable to reproduce experimental values and that more measurements are needed at high energies.

TI  - Conceptual Metaphor as a Means of Terrorist Suggestion (on the Material of the Islamic State Video Messages)
T2  - VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV-SERIYA LINGVISTIKA-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Manipulative verbal influence is an immanent feature of modern international communication. Successful realization of the suggestive aspect allows the speaker to exert influence on the recipient's worldview and ingrain certain ideological attitudes in their mind. This situation is characteristic of various types of discourse: political, advertising and media. However, the most dangerous for political stability and safety is utilization of persuasive linguistic devices by extremist groups and terrorist organizations. Thus, research in this field has become extremely relevant. The article presents linguistic analysis of such manifestations of destructive manipulation in the Islamic State (IS) speech, found in their official video messages. The analysis was carried out on the material of the official IS video messages, obtained through the selective sampling method on the video hosting website YouTube. Within the framework of the research we distinguish, classify and subject to a thorough linguistic analysis of conceptual metaphors which are used by the terrorists. The data obtained enables us to make a conclusion regarding the key role of conceptual metaphor in realization of the IS speaker's communicative intention, which presupposes attracting the recipient's attention to their activities and creating a radicalized ideological attitude in the minds of the audience. Furthermore, we prove that the metaphor is deliberately used by the terrorists to successfully fulfill their pragmatic intention, which involves manipulating the recipient. The provisions developed as part of the study and the results of the analysis can be further applied in modelling the mechanisms to confront and counteract terrorist suggestion in cyberspace and mass media.

T2  - REVISTA DE PESQUISA-CUIDADO E FUNDAMENTAL ONLINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The study's purpose has been to classify the familiar social risk of long-term drug users and hospitalized due to physical trauma. Methods: It is a descriptive-exploratory study that was carried out in a toxicological assistance center from Parana State and through 30 sentinel events - hospitalized individuals diagnosed with physical trauma associated with poisoning by drugs abuse, over the period from April to September 2014. Data collection instruments were a semi-structured interview and the Coelho-Savassi's Family Risk Scale, where it was answered by a family key-informant. The scores were analyzed descriptively. Results: The Family Risk Scale score have indicated that 19 families were under social risk, where 9 of them were under maximum risk, and have also shown families with socio-demographic percentage matching the lower classes of the population. Conclusion: The following categories influenced the family risk rates: drugs of abuse use period; unemployment; and low social bond of sentinel events.

TI  - Improvement in breast magnetic resonance imaging after a sentinel procedure for breast cancer with superparamagnetic tracers
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - The superparamagnetic iron oxide tracer Sienna +(R) was introduced as an alternative to the radioisotope 99Tc Nanocoll to preoperatively mark sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer. As previously reported, this tracer causes susceptibility artifacts on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), potentially hampering the diagnostic performance of follow-up breast MRI. This short report illustrates the temporal development of these artifacts in a patient who was followed up at 6, 12, and 18 months after administration of Sienna +(R) with MRI systems of different magnetic field strengths (1.5 T and 3.0 T) and using an MRI protocol with sequences optimized for artifact reduction. Although the artifacts were severe and predominant at the higher magnetic strength in the early postoperative period, they diminished over time and the image quality could be further improved by adapting the sequences. These findings indicate the possible use of MRI even after administration of a superparamagnetic tracer for post-treatment monitoring in breast cancer.

TI  - Worldview commitment and narrative foreclosure among older Dutch adults: Assessing the importance of grand narratives
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION SPIRITUALITY & AGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grand narratives offered by religion and other worldviews provide a background against which people can narrate their personal life stories. Therefore, the extent of commitment older adults experience toward their worldview is expected to influence the narrative openness of their life story. Regression analyses based on a survey study among 356 older Dutch adults demonstrate that reconsideration of the commitment toward their worldview is associated with "narrative foreclosure": the premature sentiment that their life story is actually over. Moreover, the association we found between age and narrative foreclosure toward the future emphasizes the lack of vital cultural narratives of aging.

AB  - The survey was conducted in 2016 among 356 older Dutch adults. It contains the following questionnaires: the general self-efficacy scale (GSE), the narrative foreclosure scale (NF), the EQ-5D-5L scale (health-related quality of life), the ICECAP-O scale (the ICEpop (Investigating Choice Experiments for the Preferences of Older People) CAPability measure for Older people), the Interpretation Of Death (IOD) scale, the Attitudes toward Medical Interventions in the Timing Of Death (AMITOD) scale, the Utrecht-Management of Identity Commitments Scale (U-MICS) [applied to the domain of world-view] and background variables. The aim of this research was: a) To investigate the relationship between religion of older Dutch adults, their interpretation of death and their attitude towards end-of-life decisions and b) to investigate the relationship between experienced narrative foreclosure of older Dutch adults and their commitment towards their worldview, general self-efficacy, well-being and socio-demographic background variables. The sample consists of Dutch adults of 75 years and older (9 respondents who were still 74 when filling in the survey but who would turn 75 in the year the survey was taken were also included in the dataset).

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE SoutheastCon Conference
CL  - Huntsville, AL
AB  - Object classification using remote sensing data is a proponent for applications across varied domains such as public safety, environmental science, and agriculture. As remote sensing has evolved towards more complex and drone mountable sensors that are able to capture hyperspectral data including more than 100 spectral bands, equivalently techniques required to process and classify the data have grown more computationally complex as well. The need for extensive computational and memory requirements for data analysis limits the real-time applicability of hyperspectral data collected using limited-resource and portable platforms such as drones in surveillance and swarm robotic applications. As a consequence, the objective of this study is to explore methods to implement Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in a parsimonious manner by using dimensionality reduction, different network architectures, and regularization techniques with respect to its practical applicability in the context of swarm robotics intelligence. The results indicate our proposed spatial-spectral information fusion ANN architecture comprised of only a depth of a few layers, but with many neurons per layer outperformed the models that did not use dimensionality reduction or used too many deep layers to achieve hyperspectral image classification.

TI  - Straylight physical model and simulator for a rapid and flexible evaluation of impacts on the products derived from the EPS-SG/3MI instrument
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The 3MI instrument is a multi-directional spectro-polarimeter to fly on-board the Metop-SG platform to be launched in 2022 as part of EUMETSAT's EPS-SG system space segment. As for most of radiometers devoted to Earth Observing from space, the radiometric budget is a system budget which includes many contributors, from the raw detector signal-to-noise to the artefact introduced by the ground correction in level-1 processing. The straylight happening in the optics is one of these contributors which could sometimes become dominant in the system budget. In this context, it is required to constrain the instrumental design as well as the ground characterization and its correction by processing. This is supported by maintaining accurate understanding of the straylight and its behaviour from early on in the project in order to check its radiometric level and quantify the potential impact on the products. This paper will present the analysis done to understand and model the physical behaviour of 3MI's straylight (in-field and out-of-field of view contributions). Based on initial inputs from the instrument builders and assuming some simplification, a physical straylight model was derived. This model allows an easy implementation in a simulator able to add this straylight contribution to any type of images, particularly on very realistic scenes. Our physical model shows advantageous complementarity to the builder's simulations in the sense that it allows a better quantification on a wide variety of realistic images while specifications usually assume theoretical targets such as a knife-edge transition. Such a capability is needed for 3MI system activities, in particular to cope with any deviation to the performance requirements. This paper presents examples of 3MI straylight-impacted images simulated at EUMETSAT using as input 1/ a simulation of the straylight provided by the instrument builder (ESA and Leonardo), and 2/ a realistic test data set based on PARASOL and MODIS acquisitions from the A-train observatory coupled with radiative transfer simulations (generated by ICARE/LOA). This simulator will be used during the development of the 3MI instrument and its ground characterization in order to monitor the impact on products.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - The systematic availability of data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission, allows redundancy of pairs considered during interferometric processing. In the present work the effect of DInSAR pairs' selection on the interferometric estimates, especially for the case of relatively fast moving landslides, is investigated. Interferometric findings over a well-monitored site are validated by in-situ geodetic measurements. It was documented that significant underestimation of motion occurs for DInSAR solutions utilizing pairs covering larger temporal spans, while displacement patterns are generally maintained. The above fact is attributed mainly to the magnitude of cumulated motion at temporally long interferograms, exceeding the physical limit of SAR interferometric techniques, with pronounced underestimation issues introduced. The need for an a priori knowledge of the expected motion rates for the optimum selection of interferometric combinations for measuring ground displacements is underlined.

TI  - Theoretical impact of workplace-based primary prevention of lumbar disc surgery in a French region: A pilot study
T2  - WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT & REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lumbar disc-related disorders are a main cause of work-related osteo-articular morbidity. Lumbar disc surgery (LDS) has been chosen as sentinel event for the epidemiological surveillance of these disorders since LDS can be identified in the medical databases from public and private hospitals.OBJECTIVE: To assess the theoretical impact of workplace-based primary interventions designed to reduce exposure to personal and/or work-related risk factors for LDS.METHODS: Cases of LDS were assessed using hospital discharge records for persons aged 20-64 in 2007-8 in the French Pays de la Loire region. We estimated the number of work-related cases of LDS (WR-LDS) in high-risk industry sectors. Three theoretical scenarios of workplace-based primary prevention have been simulated: a mono-component work-centered intervention reducing the incidence of WR-LDS by 10%, and two multicomponent global interventions reducing the incidence of all cases of LDS by 5% and 10% by targeting personal and occupational risk factors.RESULTS: Four high-risk sectors were identified, amounting to 277 [216-352] cases, of which 98 [37-175] were WR-LDS: construction and information & communication for men; wholesale & retail trade and accommodation & food service activities for women. AFE was limited for each industry sector, 30%, 50%, 33% and 55%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Prevention scenarios combining actions on personal and occupational risk factors would be the most effective, compared to prevention focused only on occupational risk factors. Implementing actions of promotion of health at work would be necessary in addition of actions on occupational risks.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present text deals with some of the ways used to argue in favor of the existence of God. It seems, however, that an appeal to the arrangement of the world in order to evidence the truth of theism faces a number of limitations. The central hypothesis of theistic worldview, however, is consistent with the assumption of science itself, an intelligible universe being what one would expect from a reality created by someone intelligent with purpose. The approach of focusing on the cognoscibility of the world, although not eliminating the doubt about the existence of God, seems to be a more promising proposal, in the context of the dialogue between science and theology, than the proposal that focuses on gaps in human knowledge, in order to fit God in these gaps, since the previous one, contrary to this, can't be eroded by the progress of scientific knowledge.

T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY CANADA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This guideline reviews the clinical evaluation and management of squamous cell cancer (SCC) of the vulva with respect to diagnosis, primary surgical, radiation, or chemotherapy management and need for adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Other vulvar cancer pathologic diagnoses are not included in the guideline.Intended Users: The first part of this document which includes recommendations 1 through 3 is for general gynaecologists, obstetricians, family doctors, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, residents, and health care providers with a focus on the presentation, diagnosis, and updated information about surgical procedures performed by subspecialists. The surgical management and treatment of advanced vulvar cancer are intended for gynaecologic oncologists, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists who treat these complex patients. This guideline is intended to provide information for interested parties who may follow these patients once treatment is complete.Target Population: Adult women (18 years and older) with SCC of the vulva. Excluded from these guidelines are women with preinvasive disease.Options: Women diagnosed with SCC of the vulva should be referred to a gynaecologic oncologist for initial evaluation, consideration for primary surgery and inguinal lymph node assessment, and potentially adjuvant radiation and/or chemotherapy. All cases of vulvar cancer should have access to discussion at a multidisciplinary cancer case conference. Women who would otherwise require radical surgery such as abdominalperineal resection or exenterative procedures may be considered for primary treatment with radiation and/or chemotherapy.Evidence: For this guideline, relevant studies were searched in PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane Systematic Reviews using the following terms, either alone or in combination, with the search limited to English language materials: vulva, vulvar cancer, inguinofemoral lymph node dissection, sentinel nodes, systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, neoadjuvant, adjuvant, primary, exenteration, survival, follow up. The initial search was performed in September 2016 with a final literature search in May 2017. Relevant evidence was selected for inclusion in the following order: meta-analyses, systematic reviews, guidelines, randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, observational studies, nonsystematic reviews, case series, and reports. Additional significant articles were identified through cross-referencing the identified reviews. The total number of studies identified was 286, and 78 studies were included in this review.Validation Methods: The content and recommendations were drafted and agreed upon by the principal authors. The Executive and Board of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology of Canada reviewed the content and submitted comments for consideration, and the Board of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada approved the final draft for publication. The quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology framework (Table 1). The interpretation of strong and weak recommendations is described in Table 2. The Summary of Findings is available upon request.Benefits, harms, and/or costs: These guidelines are to encourage physicians in the appropriate use of sentinel inguinal lymph node assessment for SCC of the vulva. The committee also promotes the centralization of treatment of vulvar cancer in specialized treatment centres.Guideline update: Evidence will be reviewed 5 years after publication to decide whether all or part of the guideline should be updated. However, if important new evidence is published prior to the 5-year cycle, the review process may be accelerated for a more rapid update of some recommendations.Sponsors: This guideline was developed with resources funded by the Society of Gynecologic Oncology of Canada and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

AB  - Depictions of birds are overrepresented in the Dolenjska Hallstatt culture, and appear on over a quarter of artefacts depicting animals. A wide variety of artefacts with birds have been found primarily in graves, and crosscut gender, status, and age. However, poor preservation of zooarchaeological remains has made reconstructions of lived human-bird interactions difficult. This study uses ecological and ethological data, combined with local imagery, to provide insight into prehistoric human-bird interfaces in this area, and the cultural conceptions surrounding these interactions. Birds would have been a constant presence in the lives of Dolenjska Hallstatt people; however, human relationships with them were based more on observation than direct interaction. Birds were ubiquitous in imagery, and it is proposed that this stemmed from Dolenjska Hallstatt conceptions of birds as important observers of human actions, ritual mediators, and possibly guides or guardians. Their differences from humans and other animals distinguished them - they were set apart, and depictions highlighted non-normative behaviours. Birds in the Dolenjska Hallstatt worldview were more than animals, ascribed extraordinary capabilities that made them ritually potent and richly symbolic creatures.

AB  - The size distribution of cities within countries was investigated for several years, leading to the famous Zipf's law. The question arises if there are similarities between city size distributions across countries and the distribution of a specific urban class: slums. We investigate the size distribution of morphological slums classified by using remote sensing data in three Asian and three South American cities using three different distribution functions (Generalized Pareto Distribution, Lognormal Distribution, and Double Pareto Lognormal Distribution) which have been used in the context of inter urban size distributions before. We applied different goodness of fit tests showing that the Double Pareto Lognormal is the best function for both investigated global regions. We find that intra-urban size distributions of slums can be described with similar distribution functions as city size distributions across countries.

AB  - In a recent work it was shown that the size distribution of slums, derived from remote sensing data, seems to be similar. Furthermore, the results seem to be independent of city, country and continent. However, the dependence on the definition of slums, i.e. the distance between two slums at which they are regarded independent of each other, has not been investigated so far. The present work analyzes the influence of the separating distance on the slum size distributions for six cities (three in South America and three in Southeast Asia) showing that the mean of the slum sizes is close to 10(4) m(2) and nearly independent from the separation. However, in future works, not only the distance but the type of land use between slums should be considered in identifying slums from remote sensing data.

TI  - The State of the World's Mangrove Forests: Past, Present, and Future
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES, VOL 44
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Intertidal mangrove forests are a dynamic ecosystem experiencing rapid changes in extent and habitat quality over geological history, today and into the future. Climate and sea level have drastically altered mangrove distribution since their appearance in the geological record similar to 75 million years ago (Mya), through to the Holocene. In contrast, contemporary mangrove dynamics are driven primarily by anthropogenic threats, including pollution, overextraction, and conversion to aquaculture and agriculture. Deforestation rates have declined in the past decade, but the future ofmangroves is uncertain; new deforestation frontiers are opening, particularly in Southeast Asia and West Africa, despite international conservation policies and ambitious global targets for rehabilitation. In addition, geological and climatic processes such as sea-level rise that were important over geological history will continue to influence globalmangrove distribution in the future. Recommendations are given to reframe mangrove conservation, with a view to improving the state of mangroves in the future.

T2  - JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) plays an important role in freshwater lake ecosystems. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, several SAV species serve as bioindicators for the trophic state of freshwater lakes. Variations in water temperature, light availability and nutrient concentration affect SAV growth and species composition. To monitor the trophic state as required by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), SAV needs to be monitored regularly. This study analyses the development of macrophyte patches at Lake Starnberg, Germany, by exploring four Sentinel-2A acquired within the main growing season in August and September 2015. Two different methods of littoral bottom coverage assessment are compared, i.e. a semi-empirical method using depth-invariant indices and a physically based, bio-optical method using WASI-2D (Water Colour Simulator). For a precise Sentinel-2 imaging by date and hour, satellite measurements were supported by lake bottom spectra delivered by in situ data-based reflectance models. Both methods identified vegetated and non-vegetated patches in shallow water areas. Furthermore, tall- and meadow-growing SAV growth classes could be differentiated. Both methods revealed similar results when focusing on the identification of sediment and SAV patches (R-2 from 0.56 to 0.81), but not for a differentiation on SAV class growth level (R-2 <0.42).

AB  - Goal 16 of the Sustainable Development Goals promotes "just, peaceful and inclusive societies". This presupposes fair and equal judgements of justice. However, judgements can only be objective if they are based on correct information. Satellite data may assist in this regard, especially in regard to territorial conflicts, as is the case for wide areas such as on the Africa continent. In addition, the International Court of Justice has also accepted satellite data in other cases, for example to prove the installation of weapons, to monitor the equitable implementation of its judgments or to prove the location of settlements of local populations. More recently, satellite data have also become known in other fields, such as the detection or proof of the violation of human rights.

TI  - A Retrospective Cohort Study on Patients with Lentigo Maligna Melanoma
T2  - DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: More epidemiological data about lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) are required to define follow-up guidelines. The study focused on recurrence, progression, and overall survival of LMM managed with primary wide local excision.Methods: In a 23-year retrospective study (1994 to 2016), a cohort of patients with LMM was evaluated by collecting data about the tumor location, the Breslow depth, the presence of ulceration, and patients' age and sex. Local recurrences, locoregional and distant metastases, and disease-free and overall survival were additionally assessed.Results: Overall, 150 cases (84 male, 66 female, mean age 71.3 +/- 11.3 years) of single, localized, primary LMM with a mean follow-up of 6.6 +/- 4.4 years were included. A total of 33 (22.2%) patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) during surgical excision. However, positive SLNB was detected in none of them. The multivariable Cox analysis indicated that age of diagnosis and male gender significantly influenced the overall survival, while a shorter disease-free survival could be correlated with a greater Breslow thickness. The metastatic potential turned out to be low, entailing 7 deaths in the context of the LMM.Conclusion: Male gender, age over 70 at diagnosis, and a Breslow thickness greater than 0.75 mm were associated with a statistically significant decrease in overall disease-free survival in the current study. The results of the study confirm the favorable outcome of LMM. However, diagnosed patients should undertake regular follow-ups. The intensity of follow-up in these patients can be individualized based on the probability of recurrence/metastasis and overall survival. Furthermore, the study showed that SLNB might not be a necessary staging procedure in patients with LMM. (C) 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Microzonal Geomorphological Landscape Differentiation and the Degree of Seriality of Topogeosystems
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An analysis is made of the landscape-forming role of relief, its influence on the formation of the landscape structure of the territory in its dynamic interpretation, i. e. the structure of the radical and variable states of topogeosystems. We examine and compare the concepts of the geomorphological (altitudinal levels, layered structure of relief, and slope microzonality) and factoral-dynamic (factoral seriality, radical, semiradical and serial facies) approaches to investigating geosystems of on the territory of a tableland. The property of geosystems seriality is considered from the factoral-dynamic perspective where the factoral seriality is determined by the nature of influence of local factors on the topogeosystem (excessive moisture, rock outcrops, etc.), while the dynamic properties are connected with the strength of factoral influence determining the degree of deviation of a particular topogeosystem from a radical geosystem. The relative altitude in this context is considered as an indicator of the degree of deviation of the characteristics of a particular topogeosystem from a radical geosystem, i. e. as the indicator of the degree and type of factoral seriality. Using the Olkha Plateau (area of Southern Cisbaikalia) as an example we carried out a comparative investigation into the microzonal geomorphological structure of landscapes and the seriality of geosystems resulting from the modifying influence of various factors. The map for the areas of groups of facies obtained by the method of geosystem mapping with the use of Earth remote sensing data was compared with data of comprehensive route investigations and with the schematic map of the microzonal structure of landscapes calculated in terms of a digital terrain model using data on the relative altitude of the location and the steepness of slopes. The linkage as identified between the microzonal landscape differentiation and the topogeosystems seriality is ambiguous. This is explained by the existence of a large number of local factors shielding a direct influence of the relief on geosystems, which leads to an increase in landscape diversity.

AB  - The subject of study were low resolution SAR imagery, provided by Sentinel 1A and 1B, which can be obtained using open sources. Due to the great interest of products, an analysis of the interpretation possibilities of imaging acquired in interferometric wide swath mode and extra wide swath mode were made. Before exploring the possibilities, the proposed methods have been tested to improve the quality of radar images. Depending on the analyst's needs as well as the polarization channel used, adaptive filters such as Frost, Lee-Sigma, and in some cases Gamma-Map are recommended. However, the use of classification and pseudocolor allows dividing the area of interest into basic fields, such as the urbanized area, water or vegetation. Satisfactory results were also obtained by integrating different polarization. The impact of incidence angle of radar beam on photographing the object was also shown.

AB  - This study presents new results for geological mapping in arid and semi-arid regions using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data. ASTER multispectral thermal-infrared (TIR) data have been processed for mapping soil desertification and salinization at the Taklimakan Desert and its surrounding areas, west China. The mineralogical indices such as Desertification Index (DI) and Salinity Index (SI) were proposed to estimate and monitor the silicate and soluble salt minerals which related with desertification and salinization in the arid and semi-arid environments. These mineralogical indices were verified by field observation and measurement data. It is concluded that the proposed methods have great potential for desertification and salinization mapping in arid and semi arid regions. Thus, it can provide an effective technology for the long-term monitoring and assessment of the eco-environment change in the dry lands on local, regional and global scales.

TI  - Cloud Detection for FY Meteorology Satellite Based on Ensemble Thresholds and Random Forests Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is the first step for the practical processing of meteorology satellite images, and also determines the accuracy of subsequent applications. For Chinese FY serial satellite, the National Meteorological Satellite Center (NSMC) officially provides the cloud detection products. In practical applications, there still are some misdetection regions. Therefore, this paper proposes a cloud detection method trying to improve NSMC's products based on ensemble threshold and random forest. The binarization is firstly performed using ten threshold methods of the first infrared band and visible channel of the image, and the binarized images are obtained by the voting strategy. Secondly, the binarized images of the two channels are combined to form an ensemble threshold image. Then the middle part of the ensemble threshold image and the upper and lower margins of NSMC's cloud detection result are used as the sample collection source data for the random forest. Training samples rely only on source image data at one moment, and then the trained random forest model is applied to images of other times to obtain the final cloud detection results. This method performs well on FY-2G images and can effectively detect incorrect areas of the cloud detection products of the NSMC. The accuracy of the algorithm is evaluated by manually labeled ground truth using different methods and objective evaluation indices including Probability of Detection (POD), False Alarm Rate (FAR), Critical Success Index (CSI) and the average and standard deviation of all indices. The accuracy results show that the proposed method performs better than the other methods with less incorrect detection regions. Though the proposed approach is simple enough, it is a useful attempt to improve the cloud detection result, and there is plenty of room for further improvement.

AB  - Surface soil moisture (SM) plays a decisive function during the grassland degradation and restoration process. In this paper, a surface soil moisture retrieval model in desert steppe area with improved spatial resolution is established using diurnal temperature range (DTR) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The model integrates land surface temperature (LST) at daytime and nighttime respectively derived from Landsat8 and MODIS images to improve the spatial resolution of soil moisture from 1km to 30m. The results are validated by in situ measurements from Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) in study region, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 1.3919. Compared with the MODIS-DTR, the Landsat-MODIS DTR improves the accuracy and the spatial resolution of soil moisture retrieval.

AB  - Passive radiometry at L-band has been widely accepted as one of the most promising techniques for monitoring soil moisture content (SMC). However, with vegetation cover, the scatter and attenuation of microwave signals by vegetation make the discrimination of SMC related signal complicated. To improve SMC estimate, this study proposed the combined use of L-band brightness temperature (T-B) and optical remote sensing data to take into account the effect of vegetation. The normalized difference infrared index (NDII) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were used as proxy for including the effect of vegetation water content and structure. Considering viewing angle effects, T-B data were normalized to three different angles (7 degrees, 21.5 degrees, and 38.5 degrees). The model based on the combination of NDII and horizontally polarized TB normalized to 7 degrees produced the best result (R-2 = 0.678, RMSE = 0.026 m(3)/m(3)). It suggests that involving NDII into the model could significantly improve pasture covered SMC estimation accuracy.

TI  - Heavy Rainfall-induced Displacement of More than 2.5 m in the Kushiro Marsh in 2016, Detected by ALOS-2 SAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kushiro Marsh in eastern Hokkaido is the largest wetland in Japan. Monitoring changes in environmental conditions is important to support preservation of the wetland. In the summer of 2016, Hokkaido was affected by several typhoons and suffered record-breaking heavy rainfall. similar to 50 ALOS-2 SAR interferograms were constructed covering the Kushiro Marsh over the period 2014 to 2018, including the summer of 2016. A time series of vertical displacements of the wetland detected by the interferograms corresponded to water level changes in rivers of the wetland. This implies that the SAR data successfully detected height changes of the water surface in the wetland. Between August 6, 2016 and September 5, 2016, an area of the wetland (similar to 1 km) to the southeast of Akanuma shifted similar to 2.7 m horizontally in the downstream direction, which coincided with a large and rapid increase in the water level caused by the heavy rains. This large displacement remained after the water level fell. Prior to this large horizontal shift, an uplift of similar to 10 cm was identified in almost the same region. This uplift might have been caused by groundwater leaking from the basement of the Akanuma pond, and implies that the peat layer, which had a thickness of several meters had floated slightly, like a floating island, possibly causing the large horizontal shift.

It radiates scanning beams with different radiation directions in the azimuth due to polarization. Each scanning beam has a different radiation direction depending on the frequency and covers an elongated area in elevation. Each user in the service area selects the optimum frequency band, and the polarization is determined by the position of the user. If a 3 dB gain reduction is allowed, half of the frequency band can be used, similar to the conventional multiple-spot beam antenna.

TI  - COMPLEMENTARY OCCURRENCE OF FAULT CREEP AND AN MW 6.5 EARTHQUAKE ALONG THE PHILIPPINE FAULT ON LEYTE ISLAND REVEALED BY ALOS AND ALOS-2 SAR INTERFEROMETRY

AB  - It has been inferred that the Philippine fault on Leyte Island has been creeping. On 6 July 2017, an Mw 6.5 earthquake struck northern Leyte, suggesting that not all parts along the fault have been creeping. We conducted InSAR time-series analyses using ALOS/PALSAR data (2006-2011) to estimate the spatial variation of the fault creep rate, and fault slip modeling of the 2017 earthquake using the displacements obtained from ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 interferometry. We found that the section ruptured by the 2017 earthquake had been locked (lack of fault creep) while the neighboring sections, in northernmost and central areas of the island, have been creeping with rates of up to 30 mm/year. We speculate from the creep analysis that the size of the 2017 earthquake would be the maximum-class earthquake along the Philippine fault in the northern half of Leyte. Considering the similarity in size and location, we infer that the 1947 earthquake also ruptured the same locked portion as the 2017 earthquake. Our findings demonstrate the usefulness of InSAR time-series analysis to identify future earthquake-prone sections along active faults.

TI  - A systematic study of earthquake detectability using Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide-Swath data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 mission comprises two synthetic aperture radar satellites, each with a 12-d orbital repeat, orbiting 6 d apart within a narrow tube. The mission design promises the ability to respond quickly to earthquakes with InSAR, and to facilitate production of interferograms with good interferometric correlation globally. We report on our efforts to study global seismicity using Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide-Swath data between April 2015 and December 2016. We select 35 potentially detectable terrestrial earthquakes in the range 5.5 <= M-w <= 7.8 on the basis of their locations, depths and magnitudes, and process the first post-event interferogram with the shortest possible time span for each using the ISCE software. We evaluate each interferogram for earthquake deformation signals by visual inspection. We can identify deformation signals attributable to earthquakes in 18 of these interferograms (51 per cent); a further six interferograms (17 per cent) have ambiguous interferometric phase affected by tropospheric noise. 11 events (31 per cent) could not be identified from their interferograms. The majority of these failed detections were due to interferogram decorrelation, particularly apparent for earthquakes that occurred between 15 degrees N and 15 degrees S, where climate conditions promote dense vegetation. The majority of the ambiguous interferograms are affected by tropospheric noise, suggesting that techniques to mitigate such noise could improve detection performance. The largest event we do not detect with Sentinel-1 data is a M(w)7.0 earthquake that occurred in Vanuatu in April 2016; we also fail to detect the 2016 M(w)6.2 Kurayoshi earthquake in one out of two possible 24-d interferograms. We propose these as upper and lower estimates on the magnitude of completeness for earthquakes studied with Sentinel-1 data; to lower the magnitude of completeness we suggest that more frequent (e.g. 6-d) recurrence may be necessary in low latitude areas.

TI  - Detection rates and biases of fire observations from MODIS and agency reports in the conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With growing concern about the impacts of fires on ecosystems and economies, satellite products are increasingly being used to understand fire regimes. Concurrently, where available, agency records of fires have also been used to assess fire regimes. Yet, it remains unclear if these independent datasets measure the same fires, which raises concerns about the interpretation and benchmarking of models derived from these products. Here, we present a novel product intercomparison of the MODIS burned area and active fire products across the conterminous United States using nearly 250,000 agency reported wildfires as reference data to model consistencies and inconsistencies between all three datasets. We compared agency reported wildfires from the Fire Program Analysis fire occurrence database to the MODIS products to identify which fires were detected vs. omitted by MODIS products relative to agency fire records, and by agency fire records relative to MODIS. We created generalized linear models as a function of fire attributes (e.g. size) and environmental variables (e.g. cloud cover) to predict MODIS detection of agency wildfires, and anthropogenic variables (e.g. agriculture) to predict agency detection of MODIS fires. We modeled fire detection probability separately for MODIS burned area and active fire products, and for the eastern and western U.S. Overall, we found that MODIS product detection rates ranged from 3.5% to 23.4% of all documented agency wildfires > 1 ha, and that likelihood of detection increased with fire size. Agency detection rates ranged from 23.5% to 48% of MODIS burned area and active fires. Under ideal conditions, the MODIS active fire product had a 50% probability of detecting a wildfire that grew to at least 10 ha (eastern U.S.) 78 ha (western U.S.), while the burned area product had a 50% probability of detecting a wildfire that grew to at least 169 ha (eastern U.S.) 234 ha (western U.S.). Cloud cover and leaf area index were significant predictors of MODIS fire detection, while state boundaries were significant predictors of agency fire detection. This analysis presents an important assessment of the fire attributes and ground conditions that influence MODIS fire detection relative to extensive and increasingly used ground-based wildfire records. The large discrepancy in records of fire occurrence between MODIS and agency fire datasets highlights the need for this type of analysis into the types of fires likely to be included in each database.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In breast cancer surgery, establishing a diagnosis other than lymph node metastasis of breast cancer, when performing a sentinel node biopsy in individuals with breast cancer, is rare. Here, we report a case of incidental discovery of follicular lymphoma by sentinel lymph node biopsy for Paget's disease associated with invasive breast cancer. A 60-year-old female initially presented with erosion on her left nipple and was clinically diagnosed with stage IA human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer and Paget's disease. Accordingly, skin-sparing mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and immediate breast reconstruction were performed. Although an intraoperative pathological examination of frozen sections of lymph nodes presented no evidence of metastasis, it revealed large follicles. Based on immunohistochemistry of the additional lymph nodes, she was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. Therefore, we initiated chemotherapy for follicular lymphoma followed by trastuzumab. At present, 6 years after the operation for breast cancer, the patient is doing well.

TI  - Where do they speak from? Positions about the new IMF contractual proposal for ordering sovereign debt restructurings
T2  - DIREITO E PRAXIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sovereign Debt Restructuring (SDR) debate is at the center of the global economic political agenda. In 2014, the IMF issued a new contractual proposal - as an integral part of a set of reforms-to organize these processes but remained outside of the discussions that promoted the creation of an SDR statutory mechanism at the UN, something which marked the existing divisions in the SDR field. Unlike specialized scholars that analyze the limits and potentialities of the IMF contractual proposal in abstracto, this article does it by means of a "game of positions in dispute". This new way of approaching the SDR debate, which starts by making explicit the assumption and interests from where the agents in this field speak, helps to explain why there are not only diverse but directly opposite opinions about the same social fact (the IMF new proposal). It is argued that this proposal improves the existing models of contractual clauses, but it leaves a margin of uncertainty about the correct organization of future restructuring processes: the depth and implications of this uncertainty in the sovereign debt market acquire particularly different meanings according to the worldview of each of the addressed positions.

T2  - GEOFOCUS-REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE LA INFORMACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In Argentina, the forest plantations reach 1.2 million hectares. It is considered if the image automatic classification (CA) of the sensors MSI (MultiSpectral Imager) from Sentinel-2 (S2) and OLI (Operational Land Imager) from Landsat-8 (L8) can be accurate and reliable to identify two of the most common types of plantations in the department of Concordia ( Entre Rios, Argentina), those of Eucalyptus and those of Pinus, also considering the areas already harvested. It was analyzed which combination of CA and sensor is better, and which are spatial and/or spectral characteristics of S2 and L8 that explain these differences. The study area was the department of Concordia (Entre Rios, Argentina). Three CA methods were compared: supervised parametric (minimum Euclidean distance), supervised nonparametric (kNN) and unsupervised (Hybrid IsoData). The kNN, with an Overall Accuracy of 91.4 % for S2 is the most accurate method, mainly because it is less sensitive to the internal variability of the plots and because it is able to discriminate better two very similar categories spectrally. It is concluded that the CA is a tool with a high degree of accuracy and reliability that makes it useful to be complementary to photointerpretation. The spectral and spatial resolution of MSI does not provide a relevant improvement in the CA.

TI  - Variability in the virulence of specific <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> clinical isolates alters the capacity of human dendritic cells to signal for T cells
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Once in the pulmonary alveoli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) enters into contact with alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). DCs represent the link between the innate and adaptive immune system owing to their capacity to be both a sentinel and an orchestrator of the antigen-specific immune responses against Mtb. The effect that the virulence of Mtb has on the interaction between the bacilli and human DCs has not been fully explored.OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of Mtb virulence on human monocyte-derived DCs.METHODS We exposed human monocyte-derived DCs to Mtb clinical strains (isolated from an epidemiological Mtb diversity study in Mexico) bearing different degrees of virulence and evaluated the capacity of DCs to internalise the bacilli, control intracellular growth, engage cell death pathways, express markers for activation and antigen presentation, and expand to stimulate autologous CD4(+) T cells proliferation.FINDINGS In the case of the hypervirulent Mtb strain (Phenotype 1, strain 9005186, lineage 3), we report that DCs internalise and neutralise intracellular growth of the bacilli, undergo low rates of apoptosis, and contribute poorly to T-cell expansion, as compared to the H37Rv reference strain. In the case of the hypovirulent Mtb strain (Phenotype 4, strain 9985449, lineage 4), although DCs internalise and preclude proliferation of the bacilli, the DCs also display a high level of apoptosis, massive levels of apoptosis that prevent them from maintaining autologous CD4(+) T cells in a co-culture system, as compared to H37Rv.MAIN CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that variability in virulence among Mtb clinical strains affects the capacity of DCs to respond to pathogenic challenge and mount an immune response against it, highlighting important parallels to studies previously done in mouse models.

AB  - The monitoring and management of urban vegetation is an important issue nowadays due to the multiple benefits of vegetation for people well-being and for maintaining the balance of ecosystem. In that context, the following study explore to what extent remote sensing imagery could be used to detect and to characterize urban vegetation. Two types of imagery were tested which are low-resolution satellite (i.e. Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 OLI) and high resolution airborne (i.e. Rikola hyperspectral sensor), the study assessed the detectability of vegetation species over Kaunas city (Lithuania) for different seasonal acquisitions. Satellite imagery showed accurate detection of 3 coarse classes of vegetation with overall accuracies (O.A.) superior to 90%, and airborne hyperspectral imagery showed decent detection of 13 fine classes of vegetation with O.A. of up to 73%.

AB  - We show that heavy fuel leaking out of an old ship wreck 10 km off the Bulgarian Black Sea coast can be identified on spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. Sentinel-1A SAR-C and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 imagery is used to demonstrate that the leakage started more than three years ago, in summer 2015, hence it has been going on for a much longer time than stated by local experts. The resulting oil spills can have lengths exceeding 9 km, and they may be (partly) displaced due to strong subsurface currents.

AB  - We inferred spatial densities of mesoscale and submesoscale eddies in the Western Mediterranean from Sentinel-1 SAR-C imagery. Highest normalized eddy densities, i.e. average numbers of eddy manifestations per SAR image acquired under favorable wind conditions, were found in autumn in several parts of the Western Mediterranean, when the biological enrichment of surface waters is high enough, the regional mean wind field is variable and when regional mean SST gradients are strong enough. Our results also imply that the observation period of 3 years is not sufficiently long for definite conclusions.

AB  - In this paper, the InVEST model was applied to simulate the quantity of water supply of the source area of the Yellow River, China based on land use data of 1990, 2000 and 2010 extracted from the Landsat TM imageries. The CA-Markov model was then used to simulate the land cover in 2020, and the water supply in 2020 was predicted based on land cover of 2020. The results suggested that the primary land cover type of the source area of the Yellow River was grassland from 1990 to 2000, and the land cover changed mainly from higher ecological level to lower one at a rapid speed in the early stage. But from 2000 to 2010, the decline of vegetation area slowed greatly, which indicated a change from degradation to recovery. The rank of water supply capacities per unit area of different land cover types were shrub, construction land, high coverage grassland, middle coverage grassland, bare land, forest land, low coverage grassland, cultivated land, and wetland. The distribution of the water supply capacity was from the high-value zone in Southeast Ruoergai and Hongyuan County to the low-value area in the Northwest of Qumalai, Chengduo and Maduo county. The supply quantity of water source in the source area of the Yellow River showed an increasing trend from 1990 to 2010, and the ecological water supply capacity of the region was predicted to increase in 2020, and showed higher increase trend in Southeast and lower trend in Northwest.

AB  - One of the most important issues of our time is the use of existing natural resource potential, especially land resources. Variety of ownership forms and ensuring their equality in modern Russia served as a condition for development of many forms of agriculture, the formation and development of new and effective forms of agriculture management for the country. Also, the motivation of citizens to a more rational use of available land resources and introduction of rational methods of environmentally safe land use has increased. These circumstances caused an urgent need for objective information on land resources, control of changes in the use of land, especially agricultural land.The use of remote sensing data is of particular interest in obtaining estimates of land use. Remote sensing today is a huge variety of methods and techniques for obtaining images of the earth's surface, it's subsoil, water bodies in all ranges of electromagnetic spectrum and radio band. Also the possibility of different options for creating images, with different degrees of visibility and detail. Today's methods of remote sensing are modern automated information systems for collecting and processing information on available land resources, which are now increasingly being introduced in agricultural areas. According to the data obtained from remote sensing, the structure and dynamics of agricultural landscapes are studied. Positive and negative aspects of agricultural impact on the land are analyzed. Tasks of state land monitoring are solved.

AB  - Use of the VHF frequency band is becoming more common on modern telecommunication and earth observation satellites due to the relatively simple and low cost antennas, wide coverage and highly reliable communication links. Utilising the VHF band requires a significant effort in terms of electric field analysis to predict electromagnetic compatibility issues. EMC issues become critical for these applications due to the very high sensitivity of VHF receivers installed on the satellite. In this frame, Electromagnetic modeling is fundamental to identify potential risks and to reduce and optimize the number of tests at satellite level. This is a challenging task due the large number of equipments emitting in this range. The scope of this paper is to describe the approach followed on Copernicus Sentinel-1 C&D satellites to predict, by EM modeling tools: 1) the electric field levels generated by, and, on-board equipment inside the satellite cavity and, 2) the associated interfering power coupled to the victim antenna. The proposed approach has been implemented by the GALILEO-EMT[1] and can be also effectively extended to other frequency ranges using the proper electromagnetic solver suitable for each frequency band.

AB  - Satellites antenna farms are becoming very critical in terms of antenna accommodation requirements, due to the high level of integration of the satellite and due to multi band operations required from customer missions. The optimal payload performances drive an early design of RF filters and antenna placement. Once the satellite integration goes in advanced phase, the antenna replacement becomes costly and impacts timing. Sometimes the decoupling level requested between two antennas is challenging and has to be predicted and verified by very accurate and reliable modeling tools [3], [ 4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] with the aim to minimize and optimize the testing at satellite level due to accessibility issues and to schedule constraints. Scope of this paper is to show an effective approach to predict antenna coupling factors applying EM simulation tools on a real industrial case where a possible EMI risk between a very large SAR array and Data Downlink antenna in X-band was studied. The GALILEO-EMT [1] suite was applied in this activity that ended with a coupling test on a representative satellite Mockup designed by Thales Alenia Space Italia team in the frame of a Low Orbit Earth Observation Satellite qualification (i.e. COSMO-SkyMed, a program managed by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and co-funded by ASI and the Italian Minister of Defence).

TI  - Mixed-effects modeling for analyzing land use change in the Brazilian Pantanal subregion of Caceres
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we discuss the use of mixed-effects modeling for analyzing land use change in the Brazilian Pantanal subregion of Caceres, Mato Grosso State, Brazil. The proposed method, easily extendable to similar case studies, consisted of two steps. First, spatio-temporal data, consisting of Landsat images of the study area from 1993, 1999, 2004, 2009, and 2015, were obtained. The data are polygons with numerical data (year and area) and categorical data (land use and soil type). Second, we analyzed the data using four linear mixed models able to incorporate both the fixed and the random effects underlying the clustered data. The proposed models allowed analyzed complex data structures, such as multilevel data, taking into account particularities of each land use type as a function of the year. The models were fitted to identify land use changes over time. In particular, the point estimate of the random slope in the case of the Pasture class, the value of the random slope is 0.043, which indicates an increase of about 21.5% in hectare over the next 5 years; The point estimate of the slope for the Forest was -0.04, which indicates a decrease of about 20.5% in hectare in next 5 years.

AB  - Monitoring Land Surface Temperature (LST) from satellite remote sensing plays a key role in climatic, environmental, hydrological and agricultural applications. A Single Band Atmospheric Correction (SBAC) tool was recently introduced and tested with Landsat 7/ETM+. SBAC provides pixel-by-pixel atmospheric correction parameters regardless of the pixel size using atmospheric profiles from National Centers of Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis products as inputs, accounting also for the pixel elevation through a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). This work deals now with the assessment of SBAC applied to Landsat 8/TIRS data since no operational LST product is still available.A new experiment was conducted in summer 2018, covering a variety of crops and surface conditions in the Barrax test site, Spain (39 degrees 03' N, 2 degrees 06' W) concurrent to L8/TIRS overpasses. Ground temperatures were measured using a set of hand-held infrared radiometers (IRTs) Apogee MI-210.Results show differences within +/- 3.5 K for all cases. Average results for SBAC show small bias (-0.8K) and standard deviation (+/- 1.3 K), yielding a RMSE of +/- 1.5 K. Finally, a comparison is established with results obtained using the NASA Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator tool (ACP) applied to the center of "Las Tiesas" site coordinates. A similar standard deviation (+/- 1.4 K) was obtained, with a larger bias, close to -1.5 K in this case, and a resulting RMSE of +/- 2.0 K. These results reinforce the potential of SBAC for the operational pixel-by-pixel atmospheric correction of full Landsat 8/TIRS images.

TI  - Osmotic Bio-Inspired Load Balancing Algorithm in Cloud Computing
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud computing is increasing rapidly as a successful paradigm presenting on-demand infrastructure, platform, and software services to clients. Load balancing is one of the important issues in cloud computing to distribute the dynamic workload equally among all the nodes to avoid the status that some nodes are overloaded while others are underloaded. Many algorithms have been suggested to perform this task. Recently, worldview is turning into a new paradigm for optimization search by applying the osmosis theory from chemistry science to form osmotic computing. Osmotic computing is aimed to achieve balance in highly distributed environments. The main goal of this paper is to propose a hybrid metaheuristics technique which combines the osmotic behavior with bio-inspired load balancing algorithms. The osmotic behavior enables the automatic deployment of virtual machines (VMs) that are migrated through cloud infrastructures. Since the hybrid artificial bee colony and ant colony optimization proved its efficiency in the dynamic environment in cloud computing, the paper then exploits the advantages of these bio-inspired algorithms to form an osmotic hybrid artificial bee and ant colony (OH_BAC) optimization load balancing algorithm. It overcomes the drawbacks of the existing bio-inspired algorithms in achieving load balancing between physical machines. The simulation results show that OH_BAC decreases energy consumption, the number of VMs migrations and the number of shutdown hosts compared to existing algorithms. In addition, it enhances the quality of services (QoSs) which is measured by service level agreement violation (SLAV) and performance degradation due to migrations (PDMs).

AB  - Crop phenology extraction using remote sensing is influenced by satellite data and retrieval method. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy for winter wheat green-up date (GUD) extraction with four VIs (NDVI, EVI, EVI2 and NDPI) and six methods (CCRmax, beta(max), RCmax, RT10, RT20 and RT50), comparing with ground-observed GUD in China. We evaluated the performance with correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and observations (BIAS). The results showed that GUDs extracted from NDPI time series presented the overall highest accuracy. Based on NDPI time series, we also found that GUDs extracted with CCRmax method had the highest consistency with ground-observed GUDs. Our finding suggested caution on the uncertainties in phenology extraction with remote sensing methods.

AB  - The huge amount of free satellite data with great spatial resolution and temporal frequency provide the scientific community with the opportunity to study and monitor the ocean surface from a new perspective. Marine pollution has always been a priority topic for the Black sea region, especially considering the busy marine traffic, circulating through the Bosporus strait, near the Bulgarian economic zone. Although significant effort is done on monitoring and preventing the deliberate and accidental oil spill discharges, these are still happening with high temporal frequency. This type of pollution has negative impact on the Black sea ecosystem thus measures are taken to minimise it. The oil spills are visible on satellite images so it is possible in near real time to identify the pollutant and to estimate the spatial distribution and the amount of the discharge.In the present work the satellite data from Sentinel-1 is processed with the software SNAP, provided by the European Space Agency, with the aim to test the functionality of the SNAP ocean-tool for oil spill detection. The tool is applied on several satellite images to compare the cases of present oil spill and clean sea. Different cases of look-alikes are observed and the functionality of the adaptive threshold algorithm, implemented in the oil spill detection tool is analysed.The study focuses on the implementation of this SNAP tool for the Black sea region, taking into consideration the specificity of this water basin. The applicability of the ocean-tool is tested in different test cases and the limitations found are discussed. The possibility to use this tool for automatic operational oil spill detection is evaluated.

AB  - During basaltic eruptions, the average rate at which lava is erupted (effusion rate) is one of the most important factors controlling the evolution, growth and extent of the flow field. This has implications both for forecasting purposes, highlighting the importance of the effusion rate as input parameter of physics-based numerical models, and to advance knowledge on the shallow feeder system by constraining the supplied mass. Satellite remote sensing provides a mean to estimate the average effusion rate by applying a direct conversion from the measured radiant heat loss by an active lava flow. This conversion relies on a set of parameters of lava (e.g. rock density, heat capacity, vesicularity, emissivity, etc.) and suffers of multiple sources of uncertainties and measurements errors, whose quantification is still an open problem. Here we constrain the volume of lava emitted at Mt Etna on 17-25 May 2016 and emplaced out of the summit craters, by using pre-eruptive and post eruptive digital elevation models (DEMs) obtained processing satellite images acquired by the Pleiades constellation, which provides images at 50 cm resolution in stereo and tri-stereo mode. The 3D processing of the tri-stereo Pleiades imagery (acquired on 24 December 2015 and 18 July 2016), performed using the free and open source MicMac photogrammetric library, provides estimations of the distribution of thickness and the bulk volume emitted. The integration of multi-platform remote sensing products represents a new potential of merging capabilities to enable a more comprehensive response to effusive crises.

AB  - Parametric and nonparametric regression methods have been proven to successfully retrieve crop canopy parameters. However, once those models are calibrated for certain crops or geographical place their applicability to other crops and places is still unclear and it is an important consideration in an operational context. The tested models are parametric with two or three bands Vegetation Indices and different fitting functions and nonparametric linear and non-linear kernel based. The studied crop canopy parameters are aboveground fresh and dry biomass, vegetation fraction, mean plant height and nitrogen concentration in biomass. For calibration of the models, in-situ data from winter rapeseed and wheat crops with bare soil pixel added and remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 is used. In this study two different scenarios are considered in order to determine the applicability of both types of models for rapeseed and wheat crop parameters retrieval: 1) When applying models to the crop and period they are calibrated for: only the models for wheat before and after winter period give very good results for all studies parameters. Gaussian Processes Regression and its Variational Heteroscedastic variant with dimensionality reduction are the best performing for most of the parameters' retrieval. Three bands Vegetation Index are the best parametric methods; 2) When applying the models to the crop and period they are not calibrated for: no model gives satisfactory results for any of the studied parameters.

AB  - Urban growth can profoundly change the urban landscape structure, ecosystem processes, and local climates. Timely and accurate information on the status and trends of urban ecosystems is critical factor for sustainable development strategies and it improves the urban residential environment and living quality. In recent years, the migration from rural area to urban is major driver for expansion of Ulaanbaatar and city was urbanized a quite rapidly in the past twenty years. The aggregation of high temperature occurs particularly in the more constructed area as much as evidenced in the city center, meanwhile the reduction and fragmentation of low temperature is even more apparent in suburban areas of city. Urban Heat Island (UHI) is the most significant issue towards urbanization and sustainable development of urban around in the world. This study analyzed the Land Surface Temperature (LST) differences on time series (1995 - 2016) of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and the relationships between LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (green spaces in the city) using statistical analysis, such as box-plotting and regression. The analysis basically focused on the relationship between LST and change of green space area influenced by human activities. The analytical methodologies used in this study could help to calculate the urban thermal environmental functions under conditions of urban expansion and explore the local climate change of this city. In addition, the satellite images data based on Landsat time series between 1995 and 2016 were analyzed for change detection mapping. Landsat series images were gathered by thermal mapper (TM), enhanced thermal mapper plus (ETM+) and operational land imager (OLI). The results show that relationships between each impact become an important determinant of changes in the urban thermal environment. Furthermore, seasonal factor significantly impacts to the strength of this relationship and it is being to the highest contribution indices values in summer.

TI  - Evaluation of land surface temperature by comparing FY-3C/VIRR with Terra/MODIS and MSG/SEVIRI data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in the physics of land surface processes on a regional and global scale, as it combines the results of all surface-atmospheric interactions and energy fluxes between the atmosphere and the ground. Due to discrepancies in retrieval methods, input parameters, and sensor characteristics, various LST products are different from each other. As one of the important LST contributors, the operational LST product from the visible and infrared radiometer (VIRR) onboard Feng Yun 3C satellite (denoted as VIRR LST1) has not been comprehensively assessed, and the detailed LST retrieval accuracy is still unknown to the public. Taking this into consideration, a new group of VIRR LST (denoted as VIRR LST2) was derived using a generalized split-window method for operational use. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the consistency between VIRR LST1 and VIRR LST2 in detail using the LSTs derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) data over the study area (from 11 degrees W to 2 degrees E and 32 degrees N to 44 degrees N). Several LST images in different seasons were used and registered in space, viewing time, and viewing geometry. After that, the LST differences in day-variation, land-cover types, and viewing zenith angles (VZAs) were also investigated. The results indicate that the differences between VIRR LST1 (or VIRR LST2) and MODIS LST were within 2.80K, and the corresponding values between VIRR LST1 (or VIRR LST2) and SEVIRI LST were within 3.30K. The VIRR LST1 was always underestimated, and VIRR LST2 was overestimated during the exuberant vegetation day. Furthermore, the mean differences between VIRR LST1 (or VIRR LST2) and MODIS LST for bare soil were larger than those for vegetation since the land surface emissivity for bare soil was often not well produced. On the other hand, the variation was not pronounced when comparing VIRR LST1 (or VIRR LST2) and SEVIRI LST, which could be caused by many more mixed pixels in the SEVIRI data set. In addition, the LST differences seemed to VZA dependent.

AB  - Accurate estimation of crop yield before harvest is critical for sustaining agricultural markets and ensuring food security. Remote sensing data have been demonstrated as a useful tool for estimating crop yields. Previous studies show that high spatial and temporal resolution vegetation index from remote sensing data fusion better explained spatial variability of yield in central Iowa. This paper extends the study area over 10 major agricultural states in the United States and further examines the added value by using Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and MODIS images from 2016 and 2017. The large area data processing with Landsat and Sentinel-2 has been enabled by using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) technology. Results show that the combination of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 provides spatial variability of yield at field scales and explains yield variability better than using single data source alone even at the state-level.

T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Three different empirical models based on Landsat, MERIS, and MODIS sensors were used to retrieve TSM concentrations and construct long-term TSM image datasets during the period from 2003 to 2011. These datasets were utilized to evaluate the suitability of Landsat, MERIS, and MODIS for identifying spatial distribution patterns of TSM concentration based on a self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE). 12 spatial distribution patterns of TSM in the PRE were identified from long-term TSM data of each sensor based on a 4 x 3 SOM array. The expected frequency of occurrence of any given pattern and relative frequency of occurrence of each pattern were calculated and analyzed. The factors that influence the variability of TSM and the spatial distribution patterns of TSM were explained by the contribution of human activities, precipitation, and characteristics of satellite sensors. Our results showed that similar spatial distribution patterns of TSM were extracted from three different TSM image datasets. Each pattern presented a strip distribution from northeast to southwest, and the values of TSM decreased regularly from northwest to southeast. However, patterns identified from Landsat and MODIS TSM images presented some anomalous patterns, which were inconsistent with local circumstances and previous studies. High (low) level spatial distribution patterns of TSM in the SOM array were associated with a variety of high (low) values of TSM concentration in the PRE. Frequency analyses of each pattern demonstrated that notable differences of TSM concentration existed in the PRE from 2003 to 2011. These findings can assist us to better understand the dynamics of TSM concentration and the performance of different empirical models established by Landsat, MERIS, and MODIS for identifying spatial distribution patterns of TSM concentration using the SOM algorithm.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution (HR) remote sensing (RS) imaging opens the door to very accurate geometrical analysis for objects. However, it is difficult to simultaneous use massive HR RS images in practical applications, because these HR images are often collected in different multimodal conditions (multisource, multiarea, multitemporal, multiresolution, and multiangular) and learning method trained for one situation is difficult to use for others. The key problem is how to simultaneously tackle three main problems: spectral drift, spatial deformation, and band inconsistency. To deal with these problems, we propose an unsupervised tensorized principal component alignment framework in this paper. In this framework, local spatial-spectral patch data are used as basic units in order to achieve simultaneously multidimensional alignment. This framework seeks a domain-invariant tensor feature space by learning multilinear mapping functions which align the source tensor subspace with the target tensor subspace on different dimensions. In addition, an approach based on the Mahalanobis distance for dimensionality estimation of tensor subspace is proposed to determine best sizes of the aligned tensor subspace for reducing computational complexity. HR images from CF-1, CF-2, DEIMOS-2, WorldView-2, and WorldView-3 satellites are used to evaluate the performance. The experimental results show the following two points: first, the proposed alignment framework for multimodal HR images not only can align the different multimodal data more accurately than existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, but also has a fast and simple procedure for large-scale data situation which is caused by HR imaging. Second, the proposed tensor dimensionality estimation method is an efficient technology for seeking the intrinsic dimensions of high-order data.

TI  - Drought loss assessment combining remote sensing and a crop growth model for maize in Yunnan Province, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe drought occurs every 2-3years in Southwest China, especially in Yunnan Province. The sown area of maize in 2010 was 1.35 million ha, representing one of the most important crops with the largest cultivation area among all crops in Yunnan Province. Agricultural drought is a complicated process under the combined impact of many natural and human factors, including precipitation, crop growth, soil properties, and irrigation. In this study, a drought loss assessment (DLA) approach integrating remote sensing and a denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model were proposed to estimate maize loss in Yunnan Province in 2010. A fishnet with a grid size of 5km x5km was used to divide the entire province into 15,562 units. Basic data for every unit, including the maize area, fertilization, irrigation, precipitation, temperature, soil properties, and background nitrogen content, were collected for the construction of a database. Remote sensing data were used to monitor crop growth in different periods. Daily maize growth and drought stress in all units were simulated based on metrological and management information using the DNDC model. Scenarios involving full irrigation or no irrigation were used for the comparison of maize yields and assessment of drought loss. The results showed that the proposed framework considering both drought development and crop phenology was an effective approach for the analysis of drought impact on crop yield. In 2010, the maize losses caused by drought were 3.2 million tons.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF LANDSCAPE PATTERN IN RESPONSE TO ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN XIAOXING'ANLING, HEILONGJIANG PROVINCE, CHINA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands play an important role in conserving water sources, regulating climate, and protecting biodiversity and have extremely high ecological value. However, global natural wetlands are rapidly degrading. Therefore, protecting wetlands is of strategic importance for ensuring ecological and environmental security. Based on the Landsat remote sensing images from 1975 to 2015 and the monthly meteorological data during the same periods, this study analyzed the landscape pattern change and explored the relationship with climate change and wetland change in Xiaoxing'anling, using the methods of landscape ecology and mathematical statistics. The results showed that the degree of landscape fragmentation was unused land < water area < forest land < urban land < cultivated land < wetland and the number of patches had increasing trend. The wetlands were mainly converted into cultivated land and the wetland areas have significantly degraded in the past 40 years in Xiaoxing'anling. The change of landscape diversity had a close correlation with annual precipitation and average summer precipitation. This study provides a theoretical basis for regional wetland protection.

TI  - RESEARCH ON TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATION OF HEAT ISLAND EFFECT IN XI'AN, CHINA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper takes Xi'an, which is a western city in China, experiencing the rapid urbanization, as the research object. It uses 2000 Landsat7 ETM+, 2010 Landsat5 TM and 2016 Landsat8 OLI images as data sources to inverse and normalize surface temperature. Thermal field intensity index (HFI) and urban heat island proportion index (UHPI) were introduced to quantitatively assess the temporal and spatial variation of heat island in Xi'an. Research results demonstrate: (1) From 2000 to 2016, the average temperature in urban areas increased from 32.34 degrees C in 2006 to 42.45 degrees C in 2016, with an increase of 10.11 degrees C in 16 years. (2) From 2000 to 2016, the urban heat island area continuously increased, from 40.59 km(2) in 2000 to 81.52 km(2) in 2016, with an increase of about 100.87%. UHPI increased from 0.036 in 2000 to 0.078 in 2016, which indicates the scientific rationality of the index to a certain extent. (3) According to the distribution law, the heat island scope and urban expansion reflect strong time-space consistency. In the 16 years, the distribution pattern of thermal environment changed from "central urban area distribution mode" to "built-up area distribution mode". (4) From the perspective of the distribution in administrative region, heat island effect was mainly distributed in the old areas such as Lianhu District and Xincheng District in 2000. Due to urban expansion, the phenomenon of "hollow heat island" appeared in 2010. In 2016, heat island effect was distributed in all six areas.

TI  - UAV and satellite remote sensing images based aboveground biomass inversion in the meadows of Lake Shengjin
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The aboveground biomass of wetland vegetation, as an essential indicator of the wetland ecosystem health, is of great significance for the overwintering reproduction, global carbon cycle and ecological purification of rare waterfowl. It is one of the research hotspots in ecology and remote sensing interpretation. The advantage of satellite remote sensing data lies in its wide coverage, but its spatial resolution is low. UAV remote sensing data have high spatial resolution but small acquisition range. At the same time, because of the influence of wetland area, observation system and external environment, it is more complicated and difficult to retrieve the aboveground biomass from remote sensing images. This research studies a kind of inversion method of aboveground biomass based on UAV and GF-1 data. Firstly, UAV visible images of four sample areas and the ground measured sample data are used to establish linear, power function, polynomial, and logarithmic regression model of biomass, visible light band, and a variety of visible light vegetation index. The accuracy of this method was evaluated by the coefficient of determination ( R-2 ) , mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error ( RMSE). The optimal model was selected for biomass inversion of UAV images. Then the biomass data inverted from the visible light band and the GF-1 WFV normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image are used to establish a regression model to obtain the aboveground biomass distribution map of the vegetation in Lake Shengjin meadows. The results show that the polynomial equation was determined using the red band has higher simulation accuracy for biomass inversion, R-2 = 0.86, MAE= 111.33 g/m(2), RMSE = 145.42 g/m(2) ,and the inversion results obtained by the red band biomass inversion method is highly consistent with the actual biomass distribution. The polynomial model, constructed by GF-1 WFV and biomass inversed by UAV, is the optimal model, and R-2 reached 0.91. This study uses UAV and GF-1 data to conduct biomass inversion research. It integrates the advantages of each data and can obtain richer and more accurate information. It could improve inversion accuracy and provide data and technical support for wetland monitoring and wetland restoration management. Thus this work has important research significance and application value.

TI  - Accuracy evaluation of different land use or land cover data in grassland of northern China
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland is one of the most widely distributed vegetation types in the world. A precise definition of the grassland boundary is essential for grassland resources research and management. We assessed the boundary accuracy of grassland in northern China, where was characterized by the most concentrated distribution of grassland in China. Based on the grassland sampling point data obtained from field survey, seven kinds of land use/cover data were examined, including the 30-m global-land cover data (GlobeLand30), 1 1000000 grassland resource map (GLT80s), remote sensing monitoring data of land use status in China (LUCC2010), multi-source integrated Chinese land cover map (MICLCover), GlobCover land cover map (Globcover2009), global land use data (GLC2000), and MODIS land cover data (MCD12Q1). The results showed that GLT80s had the largest area of grassland in northern China and was the most consistent with the other six land use/cover data. GLT80s also had the highest accuracy through sampling point verification, with a value of 88.32%. Globcover2009 had the lowest accuracy, with a value of 29.31%. The accuracy of MCD12Q1 and GLC2000 was 83.74% and 83.45%, respectively. The values of other three land use/cover data ranged from 73.42% to 78.97%. Results of statistical analysis for different provinces showed that MCD12Q1 in Qinghai had the highest accuracy (94.23%), and the accuracy of GLC2000 and GlobeLand30 was also above 90% respectively. However, GLT80s always had the highest accuracy in other provinces, including Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and Gansu. The main reason for the difference of grassland distribution between GLT80s and other data was that the temperate desert grassland in GLT80s was generally classified as bare ground in other data, which occupied 22.59%-42.87% of the total inconsistent distribution area. Therefore, we suggested that MCD12Q1 should be given preference in Qinghai for assessing the grassland resources and function, while GLT80s should be selected in other provinces, but special attention should be paid to the accuracy of its division in temperate desert grassland.

TI  - A Wind Speed Retrieval Model for Sentinel-1A EW Mode Cross-Polarization Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In contrast to co-polarization (VV or HH) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, cross-polarization (CP for VH or HV) SAR images can be used to retrieve sea surface wind speeds larger than 20 m/s without knowing the wind directions. In this paper, a new wind speed retrieval model is proposed for European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1A (S-1A) Extra-Wide swath (EW) mode VH-polarized images. Nineteen S-1A images under tropical cyclone condition observed in the 2016 hurricane season and the matching data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer are collected and divided into two datasets. The relationships between normalized radar cross-section (NRCS), sea surface wind speed, wind direction and radar incidence angle are analyzed for each sub-band, and an empirical retrieval model is presented. To correct the large biases at the center and at the boundaries of each sub-band, a corrected model with an incidence angle factor is proposed. The new model is validated by comparing the wind speeds retrieved from S-1A images with the wind speeds measured by SMAP. The results suggest that the proposed model can be used to retrieve wind speeds up to 35 m/s for sub-bands 1 to 4 and 25 m/s for sub-band 5.

AB  - The air pollution caused by the immense wildfire that occurred in Northeast Patagonia, Argentina in the summer 2016-2017 is presented in this work through the assessment of ground-based data, satellite measurements and modeled concentrations of NO, NO2, CO, PM2.5, PM10 and AOD. The data was obtained from a monitoring station placed in Bahia Blanca city; the OMI (Aura), MOPITT and MODIS (Terra) satellite sensors, and the APIFLAME-WRF-CHIMERE modeling system was used to estimate the chemical processes and atmospheric transport of pollutants emitted. A concentration higher than usual was found for December 20th and 21st 2016 and January 1st 2017 for every species, at Bahia Blanca's station. Satellite daily data was acquired for a specific day and modeled results were also exhibited for a qualitative assessment. The models obtained satisfactory results, according to the satellite survey. Finally, it was possible to assess air pollution from a wildfire by means of the combination of these different data sources.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyses the suitability of remote sensing data from different sources (Landsat 7 ETM+, MODIS and Meteosat) in evaluating the effect of fuel conditions on fire severity, using a megafire (11891ha) that occurred in a Mediterranean pine forest ecosystem (NW Spain) between 19 and 22August 2012. Fire severity was measured via the delta Normalized Burn Ratio index. Fuel conditions were evaluated through biophysical variables of: (i) the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index and mean actual evapotranspiration, as proxies of potential live fuel amount; and (ii) Land Surface Temperature and water deficit, as proxies of fuel moisture content. Relationships between fuel conditions and fire severity were evaluated using Random Forest models. Biophysical variables explained 40% of the variance. The Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index was the most important predictor, being positively associated with fire severity. Evapotranspiration also positively influenced severity, although its importance was conditioned by the data source. Live fuel amount, rather than fuel moisture content, primarily affected fire severity. Nevertheless, an increase in water deficit and land surface temperature was generally associated with greater fire severity. This study highlights that fuel conditions largely determine fire severity, providing useful information for defining pre-fire actions aimed at reducing fire effects.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are an operational tool for monitoring and assessment of oil spills. At the same time, satellite imagery has been used almost entirely to detect oil presence/absence, yet its ability to discriminate oil emulsions within a detected oil slick has not been fully exploited. Additionally, one of the challenges in the past has been the ability to deliver strategic information derived from satellite remote sensing in a timely fashion to responders in the field. This study presents UAS and satellite methods for the rapid classification of oil types and thicknesses, from which information about thick oil and oil emulsions (i.e., "actionable" oil) can be delivered in an operational timeframe to responders in the field. Experiments carried out at the OHMSETT test facility in New Jersey demonstrate that under specific viewing conditions satellites can record a signal variance between oil thicknesses and emulsions and non-emulsified oil. Furthermore, multispectral satellite data acquired by RADARSAT-2 and WorldView-2 were combined with data from a UAS field campaign to generate an oil/emulsion thickness classification based on a multispectral classification algorithm. Herein we present the classification methods to generate oil thickness products from UAS, validated by sea-truth observations, and quasi-synoptic multispectral satellite images acquired by WorldView-2. We tested the ability to deliver these products with minimum latency to responding vessels. During field operations in the Gulf of Mexico, we utilized the UAS multispectral system to identify areas of shoreline impacted by the oil spill. This proof-of-concept test using multispectral UAS data to detect emulsions and deliver a derived information product to a vessel in near-real-time sheds light on how UAS assets could be used in the near future for oil spill tactical response operations.

TI  - Current controversies in early-stage melanoma Questions on incidence, screening, and histologic regression
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In the first article in this continuing medical education series we review controversies and uncertainties relating to the epidemiology and initial diagnosis of localized cutaneous melanoma (ie, stage 0, I, or II). Many of these issues are unsettled because of conflicting evidence. Melanoma incidence appears to be increasing, yet its basis has not been fully explained. Despite the advantages of early detection, the US Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend skin screening for the general population. Occasionally, biopsy specimens of melanoma will show histologic regression, but the prognostic importance of this phenomenon is uncertain. Some practitioners recommend obtaining a sentinel lymph node biopsy specimen for thin melanomas showing regression, although this histologic finding is not part of the staging system for thin melanomas. Our goal is to provide the clinician who cares for patients with (or at risk for) melanoma with up-to-date contextual knowledge to appreciate the multiple sides of each controversy so that they will be better informed to discuss these issues with their patients and their families.

TI  - Dynamics of the four major central Himalayan glaciers: spatio-temporal trends, influencing factors and glacier health
T2  - HIMALAYAN GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surface ice velocities (SIVs) are important for many aspects in glaciology such as mass balance, debris distribution, lake dynamics and early recognition of possible hazards, justifying the need for their regular monitoring. The present study assesses the SIVs of the four glaciers (CG1-CG4) located in the central Himalaya (CH), India, which have also been previously monitored in the field for several other parameters (such as mass balance, thickness etc.). A wellknown sub-pixel image correlation technique (COSI-Corr) was applied on the repeat Landsat TM (1993/94), ETM+ (2000/01) and OLI images (2015/16) to obtain the surface displacements. Results show highly variable average SIVs among the studied glaciers, ranging from 10.63 +/- 5.81 m y(-1) to 35.38 +/- 5.81 m y(-1) during 1993/94, followed by a heterogeneous but significant total slowdown of >42% during 1993/94-2015/16. Between 1993/94 and 2000/01, the average SIV of four glaciers has declined (by 18.54%) from 22.25 +/- 5.81 m y(-1) to 17.45 +/- 3.06 m y(-1) which further reduced (by 28.86%) to 13.04 +/- 1.65 m y(-1) during 2015/16. Spatial SIV patterns exhibit that, initially (in 1993/94), three (CG1, CG2 and CG3) out of the four selected glaciers were of Type-1 (entirely active) and only CG4 was of Type-2 (active in only the upper reaches). However, owing to a subsequent strong degenerative phase, the CG4 converted to Type-3 (entirely stagnant) during 1993/94-2015/16. Inter-comparison with the other Himalayan regions reveals that the average SIVs in the selected CH-glaciers were slightly but consistently lower than those of the western and eastern Himalaya. Analysis confirms that the glacier movement and degree of slowdown are largely determined by the mass balance, size, orientation and debris cover. Considering the prerequisites for glacial lake development (gentle inclination, slow-moving debris-covered areas, negative mass balance), these glaciers have substantial potential for the same. Regular monitoring of the glacier dynamics is thereby recommended in the region for tenable assessment of climatic change impacts and possible hazards.

AB  - Remote Sensing applications can benefit from a relatively fine spatial resolution multispectral (MS) images and a high revisit frequency ensured by the twin satellites Sentinel-2. Unfortunately, only four out of thirteen bands are provided at the highest resolution of 10 meters, and the others at 20 or 60 meters. For instance the Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands, provided at 20 meters, are very useful to detect active fires. Aiming to a more detailed Active Fire Detection (AFD) maps, we propose a super-resolution data fusion method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to move towards the 10-m spatial resolution the SWIR bands. The proposed CNN-based solution is compared to alternative methods in terms of some accuracy metrics. Moreover we have tested the super-resolved bands from an application point of view by monitoring active fire through classic indices. Advantages and limits of our proposed approach are validated on specific geographical area (the mount Vesuvius, close to Naples) that was damaged by widespread fires during the summer of 2017.

AB  - Thanks to their temporal-spatial coverage and free access, Sentinel-2 images are very interesting for the community. However, a relatively coarse spatial resolution, compared to that of state-of-the-art commercial products, motivates the study of super-resolution techniques to mitigate such a limitation. Specifically, thirtheen bands are sensed simultaneously but at different spatial resolutions: 10, 20, and 60 meters depending on the spectral location. Here, building upon our previous convolutional neural network (CNN) based method [1], we propose an improved CNN solution to super-resolve the 20-m resolution bands benefiting spatial details conveyed by the accompanying 10-m spectral bands.

AB  - In this work, we explore the potential of using Sentinel-1 (S1) dual-polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to obtain semantic maps that may complement those provided by the Level-2A (L2A) product of Sentinel-2 (S2). Specifically, we consider the use of the Interferometric Wide swath mode (IW) Sentinel-1(S1) data collected along ascending/descending orbit, for wetlands and rice growing monitoring over the Natural Park of Albufera, Valencia. For this purpose, supervised Deep Learning (DL) approaches have been proposed to classify the pixels of the interested area. The advantages and disadvantages of different input stacks have been analysed, and the results have been assessed in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, and Recall. The results demonstrate that dual polarimetric Sentinel-1 SAR data can be effectively integrated in land cover maps produced by Sentinel-2 multispectral data. This approach is particularly helpful for rapid vegetation dynamics in tropical weather countries.

CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Permanent Grasslands (PG) are heterogeneous environments with high spatial and temporal dynamics, subject to increasing environmental challenges. This study aims to identify requirements, key constraining factors and solutions for robust and complete detection of Mowing Events. Remote sensing is a powerful tool to monitor and investigate Near-Real-Time and seasonally PG cover. Here, pros and cons of Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-1 (Si) time series exploitation for Mowing Events (MowEve) detection are analysed. A deep-based approach is proposed to obtain consistent and homogeneous biophysical parameter times series for MowEve detection. Recurrent Neural Networks are proposed as regression strategy allowing the synergistic integration of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar data to reconstruct dense NDVI times series. Experimental results corroborates the interest of deriving consistent and homogeneous series of biophysical parameters for subsequent MowEve detection.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Analysis of Landscape Dynamics of the Selenga Middle Mountains (A Case Study of the Ubur-Dzokoi Hollow)
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the landscapes and vegetation cover of the Ubur-Dzokoi hollow of the Selenga middle mountains. It was found that according to the physical-geographical zoning, the study area is a hummocky terrain of dry steppe landscape. The geosystems of the hollow include steppe and forest-steppe communities. Barchan relief formation is due to human activities and the dynamics of the wind regime. An analysis of key morphometric parameters of hollow relief is carried out based on the SRTM digital elevation model. As a result of the automated classification of Landsat TM multispectral images with a further identification of landscape types, multitemporal (for the years 1990, 2000 and 2010) landscape maps are created. These maps are validated by field landscape and geo-botanical investigations. The algorithm of the ISODATA unsupervised classification method was used, which allows the outlines with non-contrast structure of spectral brightness to be identified. The maps show clear changes in vegetation cover, indicating a decrease in the forest area, a gradual replacement of sedge-forb steppe communities with free-standing trees as well as an increase of sand deposits on unused arable and fallow lands. The spatial structure of vegetation on aeolian landforms was studied. It was concluded that their main component is psammophyte vegetation. We have made 25 geobotanical descriptions. The floristic composition of the coenocomplex includes 52 species of higher vascular plants. The ecological structure of the florocoenocomplex was identified on the basis of analyzing groups of plants in relation to the factor of soil moisture content. The method of ordination was used to determine the ecological differentiation of vegetation. To identify the spatial and structural organization of vegetation used geobotanical profiles and geobotanical descriptions of the sites, and satellite imagery. A large-scale (1:10 000) vegetation map for aeolian landforms was compiled. A correlation of the species in environmental groups showed a predominance of xerophytes (48%).

AB  - In this article, we investigate several structured deep learning models for crop type classification on multi-spectral time series. In particular, our aim is to assess the respective importance of spatial and temporal structures in such data. With this objective, we consider several designs of convolutional, recurrent, and hybrid neural networks, and assess their performance on a large dataset of freely available Sentinel-2 imagery. We find that the best-performing approaches are hybrid configurations for which most of the parameters (up to 90%) are allocated to modeling the temporal structure of the data. Our results thus constitute a set of guidelines for the design of bespoke deep learning models for crop type classification.

TI  - SETTLER RESPONSIBILITY Respatialising Dissent in "America" Beyond Continental Borders
T2  - SHIMA-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH INTO ISLAND CULTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Settler responsibility is a worldview grounded in profound relationships, exchanges, and solidarities between Indigenous and non-native communities. When put into practice, settler responsibility requires constant collaboration, articulation, and radical care to support a rich re-envisioning of peace and justice. Through a critique of white settler colonial discourse, I demonstrate that shared histories of US imperialism link Caribbean and Pacific Islands. Building upon ku'ualoha ho 'omanawanuf s notion of kuleana consciousness, I argue that decolonial awareness in local spaces is a necessary step towards creating better worlds. Applying the Hawaiian concept of kuleana, my qualitative and archival findings from Bieke (Vieques), Guahan (Guam), and Hawaii calls settlers to deepen our approaches and ethical responsibilities to the Indigenous peoples whose lands we occupy. Bringing to the fore that Indigenous movements for demilitarisation respatialise dissent in "America" beyond continental borders, I seek to raise white settler consciousness about our own ignorance of these islands, histories, and peoples.

TI  - Surgical staging in endometrial cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In several malignancies, it has been demonstrated that the lymph nodal status is the most important pathologic factor affecting prognosis and giving the indication to further adjuvant treatment. The surgical assessment of the lymph nodal status in endometrial cancer is debated since 30years. Recently, the sentinel lymph node mapping is rapidly gaining clinical acceptance in endometrial cancer. The adoption of Indocyanine Green as asafe and user friendly tracer for sentinel lymph node mapping increased the speedto which this procedureis getting applied in clinical practice. As a consequence of this rapid growth, several fundamental questions have been raised and are still debatable. In this manuscript, we discuss the importance of a known pathological lymph nodal status, the technique of the sentinel lymph node mapping with the reported false negative rates and detection rates according to the different tracers adopted, and the clinical scenarios in which a sentinel lymph node mapping could be employed.

TI  - Identification of patients at risk of metastasis using a prognostic 31-gene expression profile in subpopulations of melanoma patients with favorable outcomes by standard criteria
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A substantial number of patients who relapse and die from cutaneous melanoma (CM) are categorized as being at low risk by traditional staging factors. The 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) test independently stratifies metastatic risk of patients with CM as low (Class 1, with 1A indicating lowest risk) or high (Class 2, with 2B indicating highest risk).Objective: To assess risk prediction by the 31-GEP test within 3 low-risk (according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer) populations of patients with CM: those who are sentinel lymph node (SLN) negative, those with stage I to IIA tumors, and those with thin (<= 1 mm [T1]) tumors.Methods: A total of 3 previous validation studies provided a nonoverlapping cohort of 690 patients with 31-GEP results, staging information, and survival outcomes. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were performed.Results: The results included the identification of 70% of SLN-negative patients who experienced metastasis as Class 2, the discovery of reduced recurrence-free survival for patients with thin tumors and Class 2B biology compared with that of those with Class 1A biology (P<.0001); and determination of the 31-GEP test as an independent predictor of risk compared with traditional staging factors in patients with stage I to IIA tumors.Limitations: Diagnoses spanned multiple versions of pathologic staging criteria.Conclusions: The 31-GEP test identifies high-risk patients who are likely to experience recurrence or die of melanoma within low-risk groups of subpopulations of patients with CM who have SLN-negative disease, stage I to IIA tumors, and thin tumors.

AB  - Tracking spatiotemporal changes in subnational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is key for the successful implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). To address the current performance of subnational CO2 emissions modeling and identify potential sources of errors and uncertainties, this study spatially compares two downscaled gridded CO2 datasets, modeled using nighttime lights satellite (NTL) data at a spatial resolution of 1km (ODIAC), to the corresponding temporally-explicit gridded population datasets parameterized using a set of geospatial covariates not including NTL data with the same resolution for the years 2000, 2005, and 2010. We do so for three countries in Southeast Asia: Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, where emissions are likely to dramatically increase over time, and the NTL might not work well as a proxy for CO2 emissions like it does in developed countries. Results highlight the discrepancies in spatial patterns between estimated CO2 emissions based on NTL data versus population distributions. The spatial differences between these data products should loosely serve as a proxy for the errors and uncertainties associated with the NTL-based downscaling. This study informs future emission modeling in practical ways to better represent subnational emissions especially with the use of advanced geospatial modeling outputs.

TI  - Operator Suspicion and Human-Machine Team Performance Under Mission Scenarios of Unmanned Ground Vehicle Operation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergent cyber-attack threats against cyber-physical systems can create potentially catastrophic impacts. The operators must intervene at the right moment when suspected attacks occur, without over-reliance on systems to detect the cyber-attacks. However, military operators are normally trained to trust, rather than suspect systems. We applied suspicion theory to explore how operators detect and respond to cyber-attacks against an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) system in the operational context of a human-machine team (HMT). We investigated the relationships between the operator suspicion and HMT performance by conducting human-in-the-loop experiments on eight mission scenarios with 32 air-force officers. The experiment yielded a significant, negative relationship between operator suspicion and HMT performance (quantified both in terms of the desirability of decision response and the time to respond). Notably, operator suspicion increased with the combined effects of cyber-attacks and a sentinel alert but not with the alert alone. This finding was particularly meaningful for "false-negative" scenarios, in which no sentinel alert was sent despite cyber-attacks having occurred. Although the operators did not receive an alert, the operators grew more suspicious, seeking more information; it took longer for the operators to respond, and their decision responses were highly divergent (17.2% came with less-desirable responses, and 21.9% were considered instances of over-reliance). In contrast, in "false-positive" scenarios, 95.3% of the operator responses were highly desirable. This experiment has implications for the role of a sentinel alert in engineering trustworthy HMT systems so that the operators can quickly transition through state-suspicion to the most desirable decision.

TI  - THE ARTISTIC EMBODIMENT OF THE IMAGE OF ENGLAND IN THE "LETTERS TO ANOTHER ROOM" BY RAVIL BUKHARAYEV
T2  - REVISTA GENERO & DIREITO
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of the writer's self-identification, especially of such a multifaceted one as Ravil Bukharayev, is closely connected with one of the topical problems of modern literary criticism and cultural studies - the problem of the Other. Ravil Raisovich Bukharayev (1951 - 2012) - a Tatar poet, writer, philosopher who wrote in Russian, lived for more than 20 years in England. In his work he demonstrates a new cultural situation, the ability to seamlessly apprehend the universal art culture, literature and worldview ideas from ancient times to the present day at the same time preserving his national and religious identity. The poetry by R. R. Bukharayev has repeatedly become the object of scientific research while the philosophical prose by R. R. Bukharayev is still waiting for his researcher. This article represents the experience of a scientific study of the artistic world of RR Bukharayev's prose based on the example of his novel Letters to Another Room [1]. The results of our study suggest the following conclusions: The novel by R. R. Bukharayev "Letters to Another Room" presents the perception of England through the Other's vision of it. R. R. Bukharayev representing himself as the Other in relation to the English tradition upends the preconceived idea of the English ''gentleman" as the only bearer of the English literary and cultural tradition. Irony and self-irony help the narrator to isolate himself from Englishness of the created text: 1)The image of England in the novel by R. R. Bukharayev is ambiguous: on the one hand, the narrator found a real House with a wonderful garden, a place of rest and creativity in it, on the other - the author is far from idealizing English society. He seeks maximum objectivity in the artistic presentation of the image of England in his novel. 2)A distinctive feature of R. R. Bukharayev's narrative is an integration of Russian and English realities in the text, which is manifested in comparisons of English everyday realities with memories of Russian life. In the minds of the author the images and associations connected with English and Russian literature and culture organically coexist.

TI  - A Dark Target Method for Himawari-8/AHI Aerosol Retrieval: Application and Validation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Himawari-8 (H8), as a geostationary satellite, observing the full disk image of the earth per 10 min, is a very powerful tool to investigate atmospheric aerosol temporal variations. The advanced himawari imager (AHI) onboard H8 has several spectral bands similar with those of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is thus possible to be retrieved from AHI data using the dark target (DT) method of MODIS. Based on a statistics study of infrared bands of these two satellite instruments, we found that the difference of shortwave infrared hands between AHI (2.3 mu m) and MODIS (2.12 mu m) in DT area can be ignored for our purpose. Meanwhile, for AHI sensor, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from 0.86 mu m (instead of traditional 1.24 mu m) and 2.3 mu m can also be a good indicator of surface spectral reflectance. Therefore, first, a new NDVI of AHI sensor is proposed in this paper to improve the estimation of surface reflectance based on DT retrieval method. Then, AOD over DT area was retrieved using a lookup table strategy and tested based on AHI observation over China region from August 2015 to July 2016. All retrieved results are validated against ground-based measurements of the aerosol robotic network and the sun-sky radiometer observation network. The coincident AOD results between AHI retrieval- and ground-based network measurements show good agreements with R-2 of 0.81. The intercomparison between AHI and MODIS DT AOD products also shows a good agreement with R-2 of 0.92.

AB  - To date, the potential of multitemporal interferometric SAR (InSAR) data in land-cover mapping has not been fully explored despite suitable time series increasingly acquired from SAR sensors. Here, we suggest to use an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) based land-cover classifier to address this problem. Spatial context is preserved by using grey-level spatial dependencies and morphological profiles. Further, a 4-LSTM-based model was trained to capture the temporal dynamics of InSAR coherence. Altogether 39 Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence pairs acquired over Donana in Spain were used to evaluate the method performance. Achieved more than 90% overall accuracy indicates the strong potential of developed InSAR recurrent approach in improving differentiation between various land cover classes.

AB  - Human's unwise and ineffective exploitation behavior has caused losses of the vital natural resources, soil and water, which will definitely leave the future of the next generation in jeopardy. As a result of human intervention and natural causes most lakes in Ethiopia are shrinking in size while others are showing increase in volume. The intensive exploitation, beyond its regeneration rate, of the Lake Haramaya for water supply and agricultural purposes by the community within and outside its catchment boundary has led to its extinction. Although, some studies have been conducted on land use/land cover dynamics, the focus given to quantification of temporal variability lake surface area and the impact of weather variability on the lake water was inadequate. Hence, this study was conducted with the prime objective of mapping/quantifying the temporal lake surface area fluctuation using time series remote sensing images and investigating the impact of weather/climate variability on the lake. After acquiring Landsat images of the years 1985, 1995, 2003, 2010 and 2016 over the dry Haramaya Lake basin (path/row 166/54), the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used for enhancing and extracting the open water surface of the lake. All of the enhanced images display a trend of decreasing lake surface water area with an average shrinkage of 23.6% between the year 1985 and up to its disappearance. After 2000 the lake surface area shrinkage was at its maximum which has a direct relation with the occurrence of dry weather as a result of relatively higher temperature and low rainfall between the years 2000 to 2003.

TI  - Circular and Flexible Infill Concepts: Integration of the Residential User Perspective
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Circular building has gained considerable attention in the Netherlands during the past decade. It is rooted in concepts such as circular economy (CE) and Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C (R)), accentuating the closing and coupling of material loops to establish effective and efficient resource flows. Moreover, those concepts adhere to a systemic, holistic worldview, incorporating multiple flows and values. Although social aspects, such as health, wellbeing, and social inclusiveness, are generally part of circular building principles, specific benefits for end-users are not. This paper explores the synergistic potential of circular and flexible (Circ-Flex) criteria from the perspective of enhanced control and convenience for residents. The hypothesis is that without integrating the user domain, replicability of circular building concepts on a larger residential scale cannot be done in a truly sustainable manner. The paper is structured around two objectives: (1) further identifying the relationship between flexible and circular building; and (2) exploring the impact of circular, flexible building concepts and practices for the users of multi-family housing, specifically regarding interior partitioning. The research follows a mixed-mode methodology comprising of literature review, case study, expert consultations and a quick-scan assessment. Eleven Circ-Flex criteria are explored, grouped in three categories: flexibility capacity, circularity capacity, and user capacity. These criteria are applied to two partitioning variants, whilst exploring the performance regarding material circulation and user benefits.

TI  - About the Chekhov's Background of the "Poems by Yuri Zhivago" by Boris Pasternak
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the reception of Anton Chekhov's short stories "Holy Night", "Student" and "Bishop" in Boris Pasternak's cycle "Poems of Yuri Zhivago". The testimonies of contemporaries about Pasternak's attention to them is an important, but not yet sufficient, basis for asserting an interconnection. The article attempts to read Yuri Zhivago's cycle on the background of three Chekhov's stories united by the Easter story and the chronotope. In the first part of the article, the concept of the "terrible gap" (Pasternak), the existence of the earth without Christ, is examined in the stories by Chekhov and the poems by Pasternak. Here the similarities of particular moments are noted: the feeling of emptiness experienced by nature, the touch that returns faith in possibility to overcome death. Next, Pasternak's poem "Holy week" is considered in comparison with Chekhov's story "Holy Night". It is shown that their common motifs - night gloom, stars, anxiety, sleep and the awakening of the earth, bell ringing, tears - are caused not so much by the unity of realities as by Pasternak's deliberate address to Chekhov. The poem "The Garden of Gethsemane" is compared with the story "Student" on the basis of the general subject of the image - Jesus' last night on earth, and is shown that the impact on Chekhov's story in Pasternak's poem turns out to be more significant than the original Gospel. It is possible to speak about the influence of Nicholas image in the "Holy Night"'s characters on Yuri Zhivago and his uncle Nikolai Vedenyapin but with a somewhat lesser degree of confidence. A lot of particular coincidences between the poems in Yuri Zhivago's cycle and Chekhov's stories testify to the proximity of Chekhov's and Pasternak's worldview, in particular, the system of historiosophical views, in which the Gospel is the starting point of human existence, and immortality is seen as the ultimate goal.

AB  - Several scientific studies with different concept on the mapping of pegmatites have been done in Muiane and Naipa (Mozambique) region. However, none of the studies compare different satellite data and different remote sensing classification algorithms. This study aims to compare the land cover/use classification maps and their accuracies considered sentinel-2, aster, and Landsat OLI imagery. The algorithms employed to evaluate the pegmatites location at Naipa and muiane in alto ligonha pegmatite district were minimum distance (MinD), spectral angle mapper (SAM), and maximum likelihood (ML). The identified features of landscape characteristics selected includes 8 class (kaolinite; montmorillonite; water; built up; bare soil; grasslands; shrubs; isolated bush). The results showed that SAM and MinD algorithms are appropriate for mineralogical mapping validated with ground truth data and geological maps. A kappa index of 0.85 and an overall accuracy (OA) of 80% was obtained for SAM algorithm, and a kappa of 0,80 and OA of 90% for the MinD algorithm. The classification of the images using SAM and mind showed better results for the clays (kaolinite, montmorillonite) visible in both classifications, has also been tested unsupervised classifications or criteria determined by the geologist using an input training dataset in the case of supervised classifications.

TI  - DETERMINATION OF WATER-YIELD RELATIONSHIP OF COMICE PEAR (PYRUS COMMUNIS L.) VARIETY IRRIGATED BY THE IRRIGATION AUTOMATION SYSTEM (IAS) BASED ON PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC CONTROLLER (PLC)
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The aims of this study are to determine water yield relationships of Cornice Pear (Pyrus cornmunis L.) variety irrigated by irrigation automation system (1AS) based on Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Irrigation treatments consisted of five different irrigation levels as 120% (112o), 100% (boo), 80% (180), 60% (16o) and 40% (140) of the pan evaporation and were carried out in 3 replications according to the design of random blocks. Irrigations were applied to parcels by IAS based PLC when the total amount of water evaporated from Class A Pan was equal to or greater than 35 mm. Soil moisture was measured by sensor (MAS-1) running with dielectric constant of soil in layers of 30 cm at depth of 90 cm of soil profile. Total evaporation of 1104 mm was measured from the Class A Pan by the IAS during the irrigation season. The IAS irrigated Cornice pear variety 27 times during irrigation season. The irrigation interval ranged from 3 to 12 days. The amount of water given to the irrigation treatments of 112o, boo, lso, 16o and 140 in each irrigation were 40-62, 33-52, 26-42, 20-31 and 13-21 mm, respectively. The amounts of evapotranspiration (ET) in irrigation treatments were found to be 1287, 1046, 869, 669 and 527 mm, respectively. Under these conditions, the mean fruit yields from irrigation treatments were 15.3, 12.5, 12.6, 11.3 and 9.8 ton per hectare, respectively. Relationships between fruit yield (ton ha-') and net irrigation water (Inw, mm) and evapotranspiration (ET, mm) were found as Fy = 0.00621nw + 7.0091 (R2 = 0.91**) and Fy = 0.0065ET + 6.552 (R2 = 0.92**), respectively. The yield response factor (ky) was 0.60. As the amount of the applied irrigation water decreased, pear yield also decreased but IWUE and WUE increased. However, there was no statistically difference among the yields of the irrigation treatments. Irrigation scheduling based on a 0.4 and 0.6 crop-pan coefficients and their treatments are recommended to the pear producers experiencing water shortage. Under abundant water conditions, 112o, boo and 180 crop-pan coefficients and treatments are also suggested. The pear producers should not consider that the shoot length of Comice Pear take as irrigation timing criteria. In addition, the result of study also showed that IAS could be used to control drip irrigation system, Class A Pan, irrigation scheduling, and to calculated ET and to measure soil moisture.

TI  - Evaluating the Roles of Wind- and Buoyancy Flux-Induced Mixing on Phytoplankton Dynamics in the Northern and Central South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations from two Bio-Argo floats deployed in the northern and central South China Sea (SCS) show distinct seasonal patterns of vertical chlorophyll distribution. There is a permanent subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) located between 60 and 80 m throughout the year and a weak seasonality of surface chlorophyll in the central SCS. In the northern SCS, the SCM shoals to the upper mixed layer in winter and surface phytoplankton shows a clear winter bloom pattern. The mechanism driving the spatial and seasonal differences in phytoplankton dynamics in the euphotic zone remains unclear. Here a coupled physical-biological model is developed and applied to the northern and central SCS. With model and satellite data, we show that the contrasting patterns in chlorophyll are induced by the spatial variability in winter mixing dynamics. In the northern SCS, the buoyancy flux-induced mixing plays a dominant role in controlling the seasonal variability of vertical nutrient transport and phytoplankton production, which leads to the peak of surface chlorophyll and the significant shoaling of the SCM in winter. In the central SCS, the intensity of the buoyancy flux is reduced and both buoyancy flux- and wind-induced mixing control the winter mixing dynamics. However, the combination of these two mixing processes is weaker than in the northern SCS and the vertical nutrient transport is limited to the layer above the SCM, resulting in the reduced seasonality of surface chlorophyll and the relatively stable SCM all year round in the central SCS.

AB  - In order to explore the distribution and change of NPP at urban scale, and in view of the high spatial heterogeneity of cities, this paper improves the CASA model, estimates the NPP in the central urban area of Xuzhou in March 2018 based on MODIS and Landsat 8 remote sensing data, analyses the spatial distribution characteristics of NPP in the study area and compares the NPP estimates under different models. The results show that: 1) the NPP values of the eastern, southern parts of the study area are higher, while the NPP values of the western part of the central region are lower, and the NPP values of the outward ports of the central region tend to increase gradually; 2) without considering the construction land, the NPP values of cultivated land in the study area are the highest, followed by grassland, forest land and water body, and the NPP values of unused land are the lowest: 3) Compared with CASA model, the improved CASA model is better. It highlights the changes in the distribution of construction land, and reflects the impact of construction land on the results of NPP estimation at the urban scale. In addition, under this model, NPP estimation based on Landsat 8 remote sensing data is more advantageous in urban scale, and the estimation results are more accurate.

AB  - Active surveillance, which aims at detecting and controlling infectious diseases at an early stage, is essential to prevent the spread of infections, protect people's health, and promote social good. One difficult problem in active surveillance is how to intelligently sample a small group of nodes as sentinels from a large number of individuals for detecting the outbreaks of infectious diseases as early as possible. To sample sentinels, the existing methods depending on the global information about a social network are infeasible for mapping out social connections is time-consuming and inaccurate. Instead, some existing studies utilize local information about individuals' connected neighbors to heuristically select sentinels. However, few of them take into account the temporal structure of social connections, which is believed to have a direct effect on the spread of infectious diseases. In this paper, we propose two temporal-network surveillance strategies for selecting sentinels based on the friendship paradox theory, a sociological theory describing a phenomenon in social networks that most people have fewer friends than their friends have. By simulating our strategies with three existing strategies based on the susceptible-infected (SI) model, the results show that our proposed 1st AN and 2nd RN strategies can detect the outbreak of infectious diseases earlier than the other strategies on the synthetic temporal network and two real-world temporal social networks, respectively.

TI  - Detecting Spatiotemporal Changes in Vegetation with the BFAST Model in the Qilian Mountain Region during 2000-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qilian Mountain ecosystems play an irreplaceable role in maintaining ecological security in western China. Vegetation, as an important part of the ecosystem, has undergone considerable changes in recent decades in this area, but few studies have focused on the process of vegetation change. A long normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series dataset based on remote sensing is an effective tool to investigate large-scale vegetation change dynamics. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI dataset has provided very detailed regional to global information on the state of vegetation since 2000. The aim of this study was to explore the spatial-temporal characteristics of abrupt vegetation changes and detect their potential drivers in the Qilian Mountain area using MODIS NDVI data with 1 km resolution from 2000 to 2017. The Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm was adopted to detect vegetation breakpoint change times and magnitudes from satellite observations. Our results indicated that approximately 80.1% of vegetation areas experienced at least one abrupt change from 2000 to 2017, andmost of these areaswere distributed in the southern and northern parts of the study area, especially the area surrounding Qinghai Lake. The abrupt browning changes were much more widespread than the abrupt greening changes for most years of the study period. Environmental factors and anthropogenic activities mainly drove the abrupt vegetation changes. Long-term overgrazing is likely the main cause of the abrupt browning changes. In addition, our results indicate that national ecological protection policies have achieved positive effects in the study area.

T2  - SENSORS, SYSTEMS, AND NEXTGENERATION SATELLITES XXIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next- Generation Satellites XXIII
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - On-orbit characterization of the response versus scan-angle (RVS) is one of the most challenging aspects of the reflective solar band (RSB) calibration for the MODIS instruments onboard the Terra and Aqua spacecraft. The degradation of the solar diffuser, together with the lack of onboard calibrators (OBCs) to cover additional scan angles, other than the one for the lunar observations, has resulted in the use of Earth view responses from the pseudo-invariant desert sites to track the on-orbit RVS changes. This approach has been implemented in Collection 6 (C6) and C6.1 for bands 1-4, 8 and 9 of both instruments and also band 10 of Terra MODIS. As the missions continue to operate over a decade beyond their designed life and the instrument optics continue to degrade, it is expected that the OBC based RVS currently applied to other bands, specifically the high-gain ocean bands, will be inadequate to maintain the long-term calibration stability. An interband calibration approach is formulated and implemented in this paper. The proposed approach relies on the use of a spectrally matching stable reference band to evaluate the long-term calibration stability of the high-gain ocean bands that typically saturate while viewing the selected calibration deserts. Results from this approach indicate a noticeable drift for Terra MODIS bands 11 and 12 whereas the Aqua bands continue to show excellent temporal stability. These results are consistent with the corrections derived by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) and are expected to have minimum impacts on the downstream science products.

AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential climate variable that plays a significant role in regulating climate and its variability; therefore, assessing the quality of satellite-derived information is important. Remote sensing can provide sea surface data in high spatial and temporal resolution and with large spatial coverage. This allows new discoveries and applications in oceanography and marine ecology and investigation of sensitive regions as the Mediterranean Sea. However, a validation of satellite data with in-situ seawater temperature (SWT) measurements is needed to capture environmental variability at small spatial scales and in near-shore environments, particularly in regions where SWT records are absent. The aim of this work is to compare remote-sensing SST values with in-situ SWT recorded with data loggers around the island of Cyprus (Eastern Mediterranean). More precisely, we aimed to evaluate the ability of Global 1-km Sea Surface Temperature (G1SST) dataset to detect overall variability and intra-seasonal variability of SWT. In-situ SWT data were collected from -4m and -25m depths at four locations over different time-periods (between 2013 and 2016). A daily, global blended Level 4 SST data set of ultra-high resolution (1km) derived from the Global High-Resolution SST Pilot Project (GHRSST-PP) was used for the validation. The satellite image database provided by NASA Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PODAAC) web servers was in network common data form (NetCDF) format. A comparison between daily mean SST and daily mean SWT for all sites and seasons pooled together yield a very high correlation and biases. The stronger correlations with almost a perfect data fit obtained from nearshore shallow sample locations, while the weaker correlations derived from deep-water areas. Moreover, satellite-derived data presents a tendency to over-estimate SWT variability in all seasons while strong correlations (r > 0.80) are presented in all sample locations on cold seasons. In the other hand, during the hot seasons, weaker correlations are presented mostly on deep-water locations. In overall statistics analysis and taking into account the high correlation coefficients, G1SST data proved to be a reliable proxy of SWT and mostly for studies requiring temperature reconstruction in areas where in-situ SWT observations are not available or a time series is required to identify seasonality in the record.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology for burned area mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery, which tries to minimize-and conditionally eliminate-user interaction. The methodology employs an object-based image analysis approach, using the Mean-Shift segmentation algorithm. A small portion of representative image object is automatically selected to form the training set, by means of the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm. Subsequently, a pre-fire and a post-fire image are used for calculating a number of well-known burned area indices and their difference is employed for labeling a portion of the selected training patterns (the most unambiguous ones) through a set of empirical rules. The user can subsequently classify any remaining training patterns or accept the automated classification, which is performed through the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The latter considers the subset with the most informative object-level features, which are obtained by means of a supervised feature selection algorithm.

TI  - A NOVEL COMPOSITE KERNEL APPROACH FOR MULTISENSOR REMOTE SENSING DATA FUSION

AB  - The increased availability of active and passive data captured over the same scene of interest makes it desirable to jointly utilize multisensor data to perform accurate classification. This paper proposes a novel fusion approach to integrate hyperspectral and LiDAR-derived digital surface model for land-cover classification. In this context, we propose a novel multisensor composite kernel technique based on extreme learning machines (named as multisensor composite kernels (MCKs)), which is capable of combining different methods in the feature fusion level in an effective way. In the proposed approach, we use extinction profiles to extract spatial and elevation features of hyperspectral and LiDAR data. Then, hyperspectral Stein's unbiased risk estimator (HySURE) is applied to identify the subspace (informative features) of spectral, spatial, and elevation features. Finally, MCK is applied to the extracted spectral, spatial, and elevation features to produce the final classification map. Results obtained by the proposed approach reveal the fact that this approach can effectively fuse and classify hyperspectral and LiDAR images and improve the classification accuracy of each data source significantly. In addition, the proposed method is fully automatic.

AB  - Buildings are one of the main objects in urban remote sensing and photogrammetric computer vision applications using satellite data. In this paper a superpixel-based approach is presented to refine 3D building models from stereo satellite imagery. First, for each epoch in time, a multispectral very high resolution (VHR) satellite image is segmented using an efficient superpixel, called edge-based simple linear iterative clustering (ESLIC). The ESLIC algorithm segments the image utilizing the spectral and spatial information, as well as the statistical measures from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), simultaneously. Then the resulting superpixels are imposed on the corresponding 3D model of the scenes taken from each epoch. Since ESLIC has high capability of preserving edges in the image, normalized digital surface models (nDSMs) can be modified by averaging height values inside superpixels. These new normalized models for epoch 1 and epoch 2, are then used to detect the 3D change of each building in the scene.

T2  - RECENT PATENTS ON NANOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Docetaxel is a notably efficient anticancer drug administered for several types of malignancies including ovarian cancer. However, various side effects caused either by the nonspecific distribution of the active ingredient or by high contents of Tween 80 and ethanol in the currently marketed formulations, could even deprive the patients of the treatment.Objectives: In the current study, a novel targeted delivery system composed of Ecoflex (R) polymeric nanoparticles loaded with docetaxel and equipped with HER-2 specific aptamer molecules was evaluated regarding blood and tissue toxicity, and biodistribution.Method: The tumor-bearing nude mice, achieved by subcutaneous injection of SKOV-3 cells, were divided into four groups treated with normal saline, Taxotere (R), targeted docetaxel nanoparticles, and non-targeted docetaxel nanoparticles. Few patents were alos cied in the article.Results: According to the results of hematologic evaluations, almost all hematologic parameters were in normal range with no significant difference among the four groups. Histopathological studies revealed that treatment with targeted nanoparticles caused a remarkable reduction in mitosis in tumor sections and overall reduced organ toxicity compared with Taxotere (R). The only exception was spleen in which more damage was caused by the nanoparticles. The results of the biodistribution study were also in accordance with pathological assessments, with significantly lower drug concentration in non-tumor tissues, except for spleen, when targeted nanoparticles were used compared with Taxotere (R).Conclusion: These results could evidence the efficiency of the targeted delivery system in concentrating the drug cargo mostly in its site of action leading to the elimination of its adverse effects caused by exposure of other tissues to the cytotoxic agent.

AB  - Crop growth and condition monitoring is important for estimating crop production and supporting agricultural management. We used several remotely sensed datasets for mapping phenometrics and assessing maize condition. For the derivation of phenometrics, MODIS data were integrated with Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 to create synthetic time series in order to fill the missing values in original data. For crop condition monitoring, indicators were derived based on vegetation index time series and Land Surface Temperature (LST). The synthetic data could estimate the start and the end of the season with 3-12 days deviation. Vegetation indices were sensitive to crop condition during growing seasons with unfavorable hydroclimatic conditions. LST was a useful indicator of drought-induced crop stress with prediction rates over 80%. The developed approach can be further used to assess crop condition on field level in areas vulnerable to extreme events such as droughts.

T2  - Harvard Dataverse
M3  - Data study
C8  - 1
AB  - This data contains areas annually planted to dry (boro) reason rice in Bangladesh from 2014-2018. Dry (boro) season rice is typically transplanted from December to mid-February and harvested between mid-April to June. The data was created using a new method to map paddy rice using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the Landsat archive at 30 m resolution for approximately 90,000 sq. km on an annual basis between 2014 and 2018. Please see the related publication for more details. The pixel values range from 0 to 11111 with the following representation: 0: no rice 1: boro rice only in 2014 10: boro rice only in 2015 11: boro rice in both 2015 and 2016 100: boro rice only in 2016 101: boro rice in 2016 and 2014 111: boro rice in 2016, 2015 and 2014 1000: boro rice only in 2017 1001-1111: boro rice occurrence between year 2014 to 2017 10000: boro rice only in 2018 10000-1111: boro rice occurrence between year 2014 to 2018 Please note that the pixel value 11111 represents boro rice in all years (stable area of Boro rice). To find the total area under boro rice in any particular year, users should first find pixels representing the year of interest and along with the value 11111. For example, boro rice in 2018 is all pixels with value 10000 and those that are stable with a value of 11111. The users will need GIS software (e.g. QGIS, ArcGIS, ENVI) or GIS libraries (e.g. raster package in R) to visualize and analyze the data.

TI  - Geospatial modelling of the inundation levels in the Sundarbans mangrove forests due to the impact of sea level rise and identification of affected species and regions
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - This research reveals the magnitude of mangrove area loss and future impacts on mangrove species composition and distribution due to rise in Mean Sea Level (MSL). In this study, a geospatial model of potentially inundated areas was developed using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data to assess the potential impacts of sea level rise (SLR) on the spatial distribution of mangrove species and estimate the potential inundation and subsequent mangrove area loss. The mangrove areas of 2646 ha, 9599 ha and 74,720 ha are projected to be inundated and subsequently lost by the end of the twenty first century for the low, medium and high SLR scenarios respectively under the net subsidence rate -2.4 mm/year relative to the baseline year 2000. All the major five mangrove species of the Bangladesh Sundarbans will be affected and this can potentially contribute to a change in the present species composition and biodiversity of the forest. Results suggest that, under the extreme scenario, inundation and subsequent loss of different mangrove species will be substantial and this can bring a massive change in the species composition and their spatial distribution in the Bangladesh Sundarbans.

AB  - Coal fire is a serious threat in major coal producing countries across the globe and poses significant constraints in mining operations, often leading to environmental degradation. The applications of thermal and shortwave infrared remote sensing play a substantial role in systematically detecting and monitoring the coal fire. Over the last few decades, researchers have extensively examined the importance of spectral radiance for retrieving reliable pixel-integrated temperature threshold to delineate coal fire from its background. However, such an assumption does not necessarily consider the local information, thereby leading to difficulty in isolating the actual coal fire affected pixels. Therefore, we propose to utilise the channel specific reflectance to retrieve the thermally anomalous pixels in coal fire related applications using Landsat 8 OLI data. This paper explores the practicability of incorporating the active fire detection technique using channel specific reflectances based on both fixed and contextual thresholds in the Jharia coalfield, India.

TI  - Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy Management of the Axilla in Primary Breast Carcinoma
T2  - ACTA CYTOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Context: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is frequently used to stage the axilla preoperatively in patients with primary breast carcinoma. In the light of the ACOSOG-Z0011 and AMAROS trials that specified sentinel lymph node biopsy as an inclusion criterion, the role of FNAB in axillary staging is changing. Objective: This article will review the diagnostic accuracy of FNAB in staging of the axilla in patients with primary breast carcinoma. The efficacy of axillary FNAB compared with core-needle biopsy will be evaluated. The evolving approach to staging of the axilla, in the light of ACOSOG-Z0011 and AMAROS trials, will be discussed. Data Sources: Data were sourced from published peer-reviewed articles in PubMed (US National Library of Medicine) and published guidelines including the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Breast Cancer and those from the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), Union for International Cancer (UICC), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the American Society of Breast Surgeons. Conclusions: FNAB of the axilla is almost 100% specific with a sensitivity between 40 and 90%. A positive FNAB reduces the need for a second axillary procedure by up to 20% with reduced morbidity and cost. The recent ACOSOG-Z0011 and AMAROS trials have reduced the use of FNAB axilla in American protocols, but it remains the standard of care in Europe.

TI  - CROP TYPE MAPPING USING MULTI-DATE IMAGERY FROM THE SENTINEL-2 SATELLITES
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE BULGARE DES SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of a crop type mapping exercise conducted in two study areas in Bulgaria and based on data from the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites. A multi-date maximum likelihood classification approach was used in which nine spectral bands from three cloud-free images, well distributed across the growing season, were used. Validation was performed using field data collected as part of the study and data from the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) dataset. Depending on the validation dataset and the study area, an overall accuracy of 74-95% was achieved after the crop type maps were post-processed by mode filtering. Further increase in accuracy may be obtained if parcel boundaries, as defined in the IACS dataset, are used to aggregate the per-pixel classification to a parcel level.

TI  - Towards a Knowledge-Based Recommender System for Linking Electronic Patient Records With Continuing Medical Education Information at the Point of Care
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the limits of human memory, clinicians have trouble recalling therapeutic recommendations, even when the clinician previously judged that the information relevant for the care of a specific patient. To tackle this problem, we present a knowledge-based recommender system prototype that links the electronic patient records to clinical information, previously delivered to the target physician and judged to be potentially beneficial. We developed this prototype within the context of RxTx, a Canadian continuing medical education program. We apply a constraint-based recommendation strategy as follows: (1) clinical experts (taggers) map a set of therapeutic recommendations (called Highlights) to a requirement statement built from the standard clinical codes and supplementary demographic information, when applicable; (2) a matching system identifies patient-Highlights recommendation pairs through requirement satisfaction; and (3) given a patient record being examined, the recommended Highlights can be retrieved online at the point of care. We tested this prototype using electronic medical records from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network and 87 therapeutic Highlights from the RxTx collection, evaluating the system's performance against a gold standard consisting of a two-expert consolidated patient-Highlight matching set for 150 patient records. The requirements-based recommendation system exhibits very high precision (mode: 1.0, 89% of the time; average precision: 0.95) and moderate recall (mode 1.0, 48.7% of the time; average recall: 0.61). The near-perfect precision minimizes the possibility of generating alert fatigue in physicians using the system. We note that more than half of the false negative results from the information being available in the text of the electronic medical records, but unavailable as a clinical code. The near-perfect precision over the tested patient set suggests that the system has the potential to deliver high-quality recommendations of clinical information at the point of care while being easily integrated within a continuing medical education program and the clinician's workflow.

AB  - In Re-Understanding Automation and Control in the era of digital automation of societal systems, we need to understand the inter-connected relations between knowledge, culture, technology and society. This in turn demands the exploration of social and cultural architectures, which facilitate them. Whilst computational model of data systems is built upon the bottom-up architecture, it is the top-down architecture of social and cultural contexts that synchronises the processing and outcomes of data systems, may they relate to organisational systems, heath and welfare systems, or institutional systems. It is this notion of the inter-dependence of the bottom-up and top-down architectures that makes us act beyond the linear gaze worldview of automation and control of production systems, and explore the multiplicity of interconnections between and across societal systems. In these horizons, we see the inter-connectedness between the unit and the whole, between the horizontal and vertical, and a symbiosis of hand and brain- an augmentation of the human and the machine. The ideas of inter-connectedness, augmentation and symbiosis lie at the core of holonic horizons. These horizons allow us to transcend the limit of the calculation and control model of automation, and enable the design of human-centred systems that valorise differences whilst utilising the richness and diversity of human-machine collaborations. When we envision these interactions and collaborations as a systems developmental process, we begin to visualise systems design from an interdependent perspective, which goes beyond the linear gaze of "utility". The paper explores the ways holonic architectures engage us in the design process. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Changes in NDVI and human population in protected areas on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the Tibetan Plateau's role in environmental change has gained increasing scientific attention in light of warming and changes in land management. We examine changes in greenness over the Tibetan Plateau using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Study (GIMMS(3)g) to identify significant changes over the entire plateau, six ecoregions, and protected areas based on a multiyear time series of July imagery from 1982 to 2015. We also test whether there have been changes in human populations in protected areas. There has been relatively little change in mean NDVI over the Tibetan Plateau or ecoregions, however, there were significant changes at the pixel level. There are sixty-nine protected areas on the Tibetan Plateau; sixty-two protected areas had no significant change in mean NDVI and seven protected areas experienced a significant increase in NDVI. There has been an increase in population within protected areas from 2000 to 2015; however, mean populations significantly increased in two protected areas and significantly decreased in four protected areas. Results suggest a slow greening of the Tibetan Plateau, ecoregions, and protected areas, with a more rapid greening in northern Tibet at the pixel level. Most protected areas are experiencing minor changes in NDVI independent of human population.

TI  - METAPHOR AS THE BASIS OF THE IMAGERY OF PHRASEOLOGICAL UNITS, CONTAINING THE NAMES OF HOUSEHOLD ITEMS, IN THE ENGLISH AND GERMAN LANGUAGES
T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the comparative analysis of the semantic processes forming metaphorical meanings of phraseological units (PUs), containing the names of household items in English and German. The relevance of the research is determined by the insufficient knowledge of the problem of the really functioning images of the consciousness of representatives of English and German ethnic groups. The study allows to identify similarities and differences between the two phraseological systems, helps to better understand the mechanisms of the language development, and the relationship of the language with thinking. The vast majority of PUs in their basis contains an image, the metaphorical rethinking of which creates the meaning of the PU (the image and the pre-image). In the process of the metaphorization some semantic features of the denotate are actualized and others are reduced. The choice of this or that image - the motive of the metaphor - is connected not only with the intention of the subject, but also with his worldview and with the system of stereotypical images and standards belonging to his world picture.

AB  - Remote sensing techniques and data have been used in the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI) since its beginnings in the 1970s. Over the decades, the image data used has changed from first analogue black and white aerial images to digitised RGB true-colour images, and then to the digital colour infrared (CIR) sensor data in use today. In addition to applying aerial stereo-image-based interpretation on different sampling grids, area-wide data sets were developed and produced within the framework of the NFI4. In addition to aerial images, satellite images are also increasingly being used.

AB  - A review of recent advances in the field of rheology of multicomponent silicate melts and multiphase silicate melt and multiphase silicate melt and analogue material suspensions is presented. is presented here. The advances include the development of new experimental devices and field and remote sensing methods for measuring the rheological properties of natural melts and magmas as well as new modelling strategies. These promising approaches combine laboratory experiments, theoretical models, numerical simulations and remote sensing data derived from ground, airborne and satellite-based tools. Each of these sub-disciplines has evolved rapidly in recent years and the growing range of complementary data appears now to provide an opportunity for the development of multi-disciplinary research. Ultimately, these multidisciplinary initiatives seek to provide near-real-time forecasting of hazardous volcanic processes such as lava flow field evolution. The results and approaches described here focus on multiphase (i.e. melts, bubbles, crystals) rheology of natural systems and are pertinent to the effusive emplacement of lavas, dykes and sills, as well as, to the eruption dynamics attending explosive eruptions.

TI  - Mapping of mineral resources and lithological units: a review of remote sensing techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Review
AB  - The remote sensing (RS) techniques have become a guiding and promising tool for mineral exploration and mapping of lithological units. The RS for mineral exploration begins with Landsat multi-spectral data in which the iron oxide and clay minerals associated with hydrothermal alteration zones were delineated using techniques like BR and PCA. Later, the advanced image processing techniques like spectral angle mapping, spectral feature fitting, Crosta technique and MNF transformation were successfully implemented to delineate clay, sulphate and iron oxide minerals using the shortwave infrared bands of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER) data. The thermal bands of ASTER allowed mapping of carbonate and quartz mineralogy based on their silica content. The quantitative mapping of minerals started with the advent of hyperspectral RS data like Hyperion. The recent advances in satellite sensor technology get paralleled by the development of new and innovative approaches in RS data processing and integration. The studies have opened up new methods for mineral evaluation using sustainable and eco-friendly exploitation of natural resources. This paper provides a review of RS data products and techniques widely used for geological applications.

TI  - Effects of atmospheric circulation on water temperature along the southern Baltic Sea coast
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationships between atmospheric circulation patterns and water surface temperature along the coast of the southern Baltic Sea were studied. Seasonal water temperature values for Swinoujscie, Miedzyzdroje, Kolobrzeg, Wladyslawowo, Hel and Gdynia stations measured during the period of 1951-2010 were used. The methods of correlation and regression were applied to determine the relationships between water temperature and the number of days of atmospheric circulation patterns.It was demonstrated that the strongest relationships occur in winter, chiefly on account of intense atmospheric circulation activity and weaker effects of solar radiation. The relationships with western circulation are slightly stronger than that associated with the eastern circulation. During the remaining seasons, those dependencies are clearly weaker. Asynchronous relationships between water temperature and atmospheric circulation are less pronounced than the synchronous ones. Despite being weaker, the asynchronous relations are still statistically significant, mainly in the spring season and as such, they may have a prognostic significance.

TI  - Urban green spaces supply in rapidly urbanizing countries: The case of Sebeta Town, Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green space has gradually become an integral part of urban development strategies due to its important role in providing space for multiple ecosystem services for human well-being. Even though urban green spaces have multiple benefits, they are under strong pressure particularly in rapidly developing cities of sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we analyzed urban green space changes and their drivers in Sebeta town of Ethiopia from 2003 to 2016 by using three time series Landsat images of 2003, 2010 and 2016, land inventory, interview, focus group discussion, and field observation for data collection and a combination of techniques, including pixel based image classification, qualitative descriptive and GIS-based processing for data analyses. The findings of the study show that area of green space has decreased by 51.8% at the rate of 3.9% annual loss between the year 2003-2016 while the built-up area increased by 562.1% at the rate of 43.2% annual growth. Specifically, the study shows that about 1410.7 ha of green space were converted to built-up areas during the study period. The drivers for the change were physical expansion of the built-up area, population growth, high land value, laxity in the enforcement of planning regulations, corruption, lack of coordination between institutions, and limited awareness of the community about the benefits of green spaces. The study suggests strengthening of plan implementation capacity, public participation in urban planning and strengthening of the development control and urban green spaces management system as an important strategy to increases the supply of green spaces in urban centers.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVATION ADVANCEMENTS IN A CHANGING WORLD
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Due to the concomitance of several factors related to progressive climate changes and to increased water management for anthropogenic usage, drastic fall in level of Bracciano Lake was reported in the summer of 2017. By November 2017, the water level decreased 0,198 meters below the hydrometric zero established at 163.04 meters s.l.m. Such alarming rate has not been detected in the last seventeen years. The consistent change in water level causes modifications in its environment, on the edge of the coasts and specifically, brings about an increase in the rate of eutrophication (trophic enrichment phenomenon).The determination of the volume of water contained in the lake basin was estimated with GIS tools modeling, by analysing the bathymetry of the water body and applying the supervised classification of Sentinel-2 images; this allowed to identify the reservoir and consequently to reconstruct the course of the coastline. Once defined the hydrometric reduction in the water body for the observed period, the Vollenweider model, that calculates the trophic state of a lake, was used to quantify nutrients concentration and relative increase of eutrophication status as a consequence of the anthropic activities practiced in the belonging basin.The quantification of the water level changes of Bracciano Lake, before and after the hydrometric crisis, occurred in 2017, related to the estimate of the level of eutrophication, allows us to define the degree of vulnerability of the lake ecosystem. The proposed methodology represents an efficient monitoring tool for assessing the vulnerability of water bodies influenced by eutrophication.

T2  - OCEAN SENSING AND MONITORING XI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Ocean Sensing and Monitoring XI
CL  - Baltimore, MD
AB  - Sea Surface Temperature (SST) products at NOAA are produced from multiple polar-orbiting and geostationary sensors using the Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) enterprise system. Data of several high-resolution (similar to 1 km) sensors onboard US and EUMETSAT polar-orbiting platforms are processed, including two VIIRSs (onboard NPP and N20), three AVHRR FRAC (onboard Metop-A, -B, and -C), and two MODISs (onboard Terra and Aqua). L1b data of each platform/sensor are processed independently, and two SST products generated: swath (L2P) and 0.02 degrees mapped equal-grid L3U. All L2P and L3U are consistently reported in 10-min granules in a Group for High-Resolution SST (GHRSST) Data Specification Version 2 (GDS2) format, and assimilated in several gridded gap-free L4 analyses, which reconcile data from individual platforms, sensors and overpasses, and fill in cloud obscured regions by optimal interpolation. The L4 feature resolution is degraded, compared to input L2P/3U, with no measure provided of this degradation or identification which grids contain clear-sky observations versus those created by estimation (modeling). There is currently no global SST product based on real observations from all available platforms/sensors, without modeled data. As a result, users either have to rely on L4 products (without knowing what data come from real observations versus those modeled, and how much the satellite data have been smoothed), or deal with huge and ever growing data volumes from multiple L2P/3U data files, and learn how to fuse/aggregate those, themselves. In response to multiple users' requests, NOAA started developing a new multi-sensor, high-resolution, sensor-agnostic gridded L3 SST product, with no modeled data added, which maximally preserves the original sensors' resolution. In creating such collated and super-collated (L3C/S) products, several issues must be addressed, including minimizing the effect of residual cloud leakages, which are always present in the L2P/3U data, on the L3C/S product, while maximally preserving the feature-resolution present in the original satellite imagery. This aspect of data fusion is the focus of this study.

AB  - In the long journey of the human mind attempting to decode the workings of reality, one trusted companion has to be abandoned: the materialistic and reductionistic scientific worldview. What new notion should fill the void? Slowly a novel worldview is emerging, supported by different theoretical traditions. Most intriguingly, at the nexus of these formal approaches a new ontology of reality is becoming most apparent. Two novel mantras are spreading through humanity's collective mind: "Information is physical" and "Information represents the ultimate nature of reality." These surprisingly simple assertions have many deep consequences. Information theory is the wellspring of our contemporary digital world. Computation is, in essence, information processing. Then, information can be harnessed for mechanical work. Moreover, some of the pioneers of modern theoretical physics have, for a long time, suspected that information plays a fundamental role in nature. One striking consequence of this paradigm is that reality is inherently finite. Infinities can only be found in the abstract thought systems of the human mind. Essentially, there is a limit to how many bits of information can be stored in any region of space. The amalgamation of information theory, black hole thermodynamics, and string theory is hinting at a radical ontology: The universe is a hologram. In other words, our three-dimensional reality is an illusion created by the information content encoded on a two-dimensional area. Indeed, space and time appear to be emergent properties arising from pure quantum entanglement. Then, in very recent developments, string theory and theoretical computer science are conspiring to spearhead this novel probe into the heart of reality. The recalcitrant theory of quantum mechanics is reborn in a more approachable quantum-computational framework. In this novel information-theoretic context, the universe easily can be interpreted as a vast simulation.Level of mathematical formality: intermediate.

AB  - Finally, the human mind faces its own nature. By extending the information-theoretic paradigm, the informational nature of consciousness is uncovered. This gives rise to the very first formal description of consciousness. In attempts to bridge the chasm between the objective and subjective, scientists and philosophers have opened up to the unspeakable. The nature of consciousness, as has been suggested by ancient Eastern and shamanic traditions, is necessarily universal and primal. The notion of spirituality is creeping back into science. Moving towards a more empirical analysis, the enigma of intelligence is discussed, arising in decentralized systems and even in inanimate structures. Then, the surprising therapeutic effects of psychedelics is discovered, next to a myriad of transcendental planes of being, accessible to pure consciousness. Moreover, peer-reviewed studies are appearing in the physics literature describing mind-matter interactions in double-slit quantum experiments-a long suspected connection by many pioneers of quantum mechanics. As the cracks in the current edifice of science continually grow, the new information-theoretic paradigm is embraced. Beginning with an information ontology, a radical participatory ontology is hinted at. In essence, the human mind is witnessing themost radical paradigm shift in its own history. The well-served and previously glorious materialistic and reductionistic scientific worldview is yielding to a novel scientific conception of subjective consciousness and objective reality-and their unexpected intimate kinship.Level of mathematical formality: low.

AB  - Surface displacements are of particular interest for characterizing the dynamics of Antarctic ice shelves. Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) is a common technique from which high-resolution velocity maps can be inferred at high accuracy. However, though vertical displacement may be useful in some contexts, the main component of interest is the horizontal velocity when analyzing ice fluxes. Since SAR sensors are side-looking, it is the vector sum of both the vertical and horizontal components along the line of sight (LOS) that can be measured, creating some ambiguity in separating the two elements. Impacted by ocean tides and inverse barometer effect (IBE), ice shelves are subject to a vertical bias to be removed. Here, we present an empirical technique using Sentinel-1 radar satellite and regional models to estimate and remove the corresponding bias and show preliminary results on the Roi Baudouin Ice Shelf (RBIS) in Dronning Maud Land (Antarctica).

TI  - Evaluation of Five Methods to Measure Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in Apple and Citrus
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FRUIT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a common remote sensing calculation used to assess green biomass in addition to nutrient, pest, and water stress. The approach used in NDVI has potential for a broader use of remote sensing of plant physiological status. The purpose of the study was to evaluate techniques to that utilize combined near-infrared (NIR) and visible detection by low cost web cameras in comparison with a dedicated NDVI sensor and direct measurement of red-green-blue (RGB) and NIR bands to calculate NDVI and identify water stress. Established techniques as well as new techniques for NDVI computation from cameras were evaluated and compared to soil plant analysis development (SPAD) chlorophyll meter values to assess the accuracy of NDVI for predicting plant stress in apple and citrus. NDVI is a useful tool when evaluating long-term crop changes such as pest damage, chronic water shortage, and nutrient deficiencies that affect chlorophyll but NDVI is not useful for acute stresses such as an irrigation pump failure or plugged irrigation lines that have an effect within days.

TI  - Quantifying and understanding land cover changes by large and small oil palm expansion regimes in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - With rapid increases in global food demand and production, oil palm expansion constitutes a major emerging challenge for forest conservation in Amazonia and other tropical forest regions. This threat is evident in the Peruvian Amazon, where local and national incentives for oil palm cultivation along with growing large-scale investments translate into accelerated oil palm expansion. Environmental sustainability of oil palm cultivation in the Peruvian Amazon is contingent on policy incentives for expansion onto already-cleared lands instead of biodiverse, high carbon primary rainforests. Previous research indicates that while industrial plantations use less land area than local smallholders, companies have a higher tendency to expand into primary rainforests. However, the motivations behind these differing expansion scenarios remain unclear. In this study we combine data from optical and radar satellite sensors with training information, field discussions, and review of public documents to examine the policy incentives and spatial patterns associated with oil palm expansion by small-holders and industries in one of Peru's most rapidly changing Amazonian landscapes: the Ucayali region of the city of Pucallpa. Based on our satellite-based land cover change analysis, we found that between 2010 and 2016, smallholders utilized 21,070 ha more land area for oil palm than industries but industrial expansion occurred predominantly in old growth forests (70%) in contrast to degraded lands for smallholders (56%). Our analysis of national policies related to oil palm expansion reveal policy loopholes associated with Peru's "best land use" classification system that allow for standing forests to undergo large-scale agricultural development with little government oversight. We conclude that both sectors will need careful, real-time monitoring and government engagement to reduce old-growth forest loss and develop successful strategies for mitigating future environmental impacts of oil palm expansion.

AB  - Trentino is an Italian alpine region (about 6200 Km(2)) with a forest coverage exceeding 60% of its whole surface. In the past, forest landscape has changed dramatically, especially in periods of forest over-exploitation. Previous studies in some Trentino sub-regions (Val di Fassa, Paneveggio) have identified these changes and the current trend of forest growth at the expenses of open areas, such as pastures and grasslands, due to the abandonment of rural areas. This phenomenon leads to the rapid Alpine landscape change and profoundly affects the ecological features of mountain ecosystems. To be able to monitor and to take future actions about this trend it is fundamental to know in detail the historical situation of the progressive changes on the land use that occurred over Trentino.The work aims to comprehensively reconstruct the forest cover of whole Trentino at high resolution (5m x 5m pixels) using a series of maps spanning a long period, consisting in historical maps, aerial images, remote sensed information and historical archives. The datasets were archived, processed and analyzed using the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) GIS GRASS and QGIS. Historical maps include Atlas Tyrolensis (dated 1770), Theresianischer Kataster (dated 1859) and Italian Kingdom Forest Map (IKFM) of 1936. The aerial imagery dataset includes aerial images taken in 1954, which have been orthorectified during this research, and orthophotos available for years 1973, 1994, 2000, 2006, 2010 and 2016. Remote sensed information includes Landsat and recent Lidar data, while historical archives consist mostly in Forest Management Plans available since around 1950. The versatility of the wide variety of modules supplied from the FOSS GRASS and QGIS enabled to perform a diverse set of analysis and pre-processing (e.g.:orthorectification) on a heterogeneous dataset of input images. We will focus on the different strategies and methodologies implemented in the FOSS GIS used to process the various types of geographic data, challenges for the future of the research and the fundamental role of the FOSS systems in this process.Quantifying forest change in the time-span of our dataset can be used to perform further analysis on ecosystem services, such as protection from soil erosion, and on modification of biome diversity and to create future change scenarios.

AB  - Secondary forests (SFs) are one of the major carbon sink in the Neotropics due to the rapid carbon assimilating in their aboveground biomass (AGB). However, the accurate contribution of the SFs to the carbon cycle is a great challenge because of the uncertainty in AGB estimates. In this context, the main objective of this work is to explore polarimetric Alos/Palsar-2 data from to model AGB in the SFs of the Central Amazon, Amazonas State. Forest inventory was conducted in 2014 with the measured of 23 field plots. Multiple linear regression analysis was perfouned to select the best model by corrected AIC(W) and validated by leave-one-out bootstrapping method. The best fitted model has six parameters and explained 65% of the aboveground biomass variability. The prediction error was calculated to be RMSEP = 8.8 +/- 2.98 Mg.ha(-1) (8.75%). The main polarimetric attributes in the model were those direct related to multiple scattering mechanisms as the Shannon Entropy and the volumetric mechanism of Bhattacharya decomposition; and those related to increase in double-bounce as the co-polarization ratio (VV/HH) resulted of soil-trunk interactions. Such models are intended to improve accuracy for mapping SFs AGB in often cloudy environments as in the Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Retrieving Secondary Forest Aboveground Biomass from Polarimetric ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 Data in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests (SF) are important carbon sinks, removing CO2 from the atmosphere through the photosynthesis process and storing photosynthates in their aboveground live biomass (AGB). This process occurring at large-scales partially counteracts C emissions from land-use change, playing, hence, an important role in the global carbon cycle. The absorption rates of carbon in these forests depend on forest physiology, controlled by environmental and climatic conditions, as well as on the past land use, which is rarely considered for retrieving AGB from remotely sensed data. In this context, the main goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of polarimetric (quad-pol) ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data for estimating AGB in a SF area. Land-use was assessed through Landsat time-series to extract the SF age, period of active land-use (PALU), and frequency of clear cuts (FC) to randomly select the SF plots. A chronosequence of 42 SF plots ranging 3-28 years (20 ha) near the Tapajos National Forest in Para state was surveyed to quantifying AGB growth. The quad-pol data was explored by testing two regression methods, including non-linear (NL) and multiple linear regression models (MLR). We also evaluated the influence of the past land-use in the retrieving AGB through correlation analysis. The results showed that the biophysical variables were positively correlated with the volumetric scattering, meaning that SF areas presented greater volumetric scattering contribution with increasing forest age. Mean diameter, mean tree height, basal area, species density, and AGB were significant and had the highest Pearson coefficients with the Cloude decomposition (3), which in turn, refers to the volumetric contribution backscattering from cross-polarization (HV) ( = 0.57-0.66, p-value < 0.001). On the other hand, the historical use (PALU and FC) showed the highest correlation with angular decompositions, being the Touzi target phase angle the highest correlation (phi s) ( = 0.37 and = 0.38, respectively). The combination of multiple prediction variables with MLR improved the AGB estimation by 70% comparing to the NL model (R-2 adj. = 0.51; RMSE = 38.7 Mg ha(-1)) bias = 2.1 +/- 37.9 Mg ha(-1) by incorporate the angular decompositions, related to historical use, and the contribution volumetric scattering, related to forest structure, in the model. The MLR uses six variables, whose selected polarimetric attributes were strongly related with different structural parameters such as the mean forest diameter, basal area, and the mean forest tree height, and not with the AGB as was expected. The uncertainty was estimated to be 18.6% considered all methodological steps of the MLR model. This approach helped us to better understand the relationship between parameters derived from SAR data and the forest structure and its relation to the growth of the secondary forest after deforestation events.

AB  - We present a method for localization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) which is meant to replace an onboard GPS system in the event of a noisy or unreliable GPS signal. Our method requires only a downward-facing monocular RGB camera on the UAV, and pre-existing satellite imagery of the flight location to which the UAV imagery is compared and aligned. To overcome differences in the image capturing conditions between the satellite and UAV, such as seasonal and perspective changes, we propose the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) representations trained on readily available satellite data. To increase localization accuracy, we also develop an optimization which jointly minimizes the error between adjacent UAV frames as well as the satellite map. We demonstrate how our method improves on recent systems from literature by achieving greater performance in flight environments with very few landmarks. For a GPS-denied flight at 0.2km altitude, over a flight distance of 0.85km, we achieve average localization error of less than 8 meters. We make our source code and datasets available to encourage further work on this emerging topic(2).

AB  - In this study, a function to estimate tsunami inundation depth using pre- and post-event high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (TerraSAR-X) data was derived and the performance was evaluated. After the tsunami disaster, it is important to identify an extensive impact caused by a tsunami disaster. Tsunami inundation depth is an important index to expect building damage because it has a strong correlation with the amount of building damage. However, it was diffcult to estimate the tsunami inundation depth from satellite image. This study aims at developing a method to estimate tsunami inundation depth by integrating remote sensing technology and tsunami engineering. The method for estimating tsunami inundation depth consists of two steps, 1) Change detection of pre- and post-event TerraSAR-X data that captured affected areas due to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, 2) Estimation of tsunami inundation depth. The new function showed good performance with the corrrelation coefficient of R = 0.68.

AB  - The term 'well-being', a central concept in psychology and education, relates to various aspects of the way one feels and acts, and has been gradually recognized as an important feature in educational systems in recent years. It includes the sense of self-efficacy, internal motivation for action, autonomy, creativity, positive worldview, social involvement and leadership, and is closely related to the definition of happiness. This paper focuses on the unique contribution of anart workshop in high-school, which is created in a way that allows students to experience processes designed for enhancing their well-being-in its wider sense. The paper relates to several theoretical dimensions that serve as a basis for the development of this art workshop, including links between art and education and humanistic pedagogic theories. It focuses on ways of fostering creative thinking and creativity but also emotional intelligence and dialogue in multicultural contexts, especially among adolescents. It addresses the ways this art workshop aims to promote 'meaningful learning', i.e., a learning process that allows students to enrich their knowledge and develop their professional skills while encountering their internal world. The rationale is that such an encounter has a significant impact on their well-being, and thus, taken together, the paper describes how the art workshop allows meaningful learning and consequently contributes to the students' well-being. The author is a teacher in an art workshop and is currently researching the narratives of graduates concerning the impact of their studies in the workshop on their well-being and their development as adolescents..

AB  - I argue that physicalism should be characterized as the thesis that all behaviour is law-governed. This characterization captures crucial desiderata for a formulation of physicalism, including its broad import and worldview defining features. It also has more local virtues, such as avoiding Hempel 's dilemma. A particularly important implication, I argue, is that this thesis makes the question of the mind's physicality turn on what the mind can do-rather than what experience is (qualitatively or subjectively) like.

AB  - The article presents the author's field observations made in 2013-2018 in three tundras of Chukotka, Yamal and the Kola Peninsula among the Chukchi, Nenets, Saami and Komi-Izhemtsy. The nomadic technologies of reindeer herders provide mobility in the extreme environment of the Arctic in their multidimensional complexity, from the space-time design of nomads' campscaravans to multi-functionality of material things. The nomadic tradition covers a whole array of concepts (or principles), including fused space-time, which, on the one hand, are ultimately practical, and on the other, they deserve a theoretical projection. Unlike the sedentary worldview, where space and time are separated, in nomadic mentality they are inseparable. As the time moves (migrates) across the space, with each month having its own spatial marks, so the space does not exist out of the time. If space and time in sedentary mentality are perceived as objective dimensions of human life, the nomadic fused space-time is subjective and does not move without human participation. Nomadic values favor motion over stasis, action over idleness, and maneuver over waiting. Arctic nomadology contributes to the theory of movement/mobility, which may provide an impact in the humanities comparable to that of the theory of relativity in classic physics.

AB  - Since soil moisture influences the differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar phase, it would be advantageous to be able to use InSAR to estimate the moisture. Unfortunately, it hasn't yet been demonstrated how to accomplish this in a precise and robust manner. Two major problems exist: firstly the relationship between moisture and phase variations is not yet well understood for a variety of ground covers. Secondly, various terms contribute to the interferometric phase and the soil moisture one is mostly one of the smallest, meaning that it is difficult to separate it from the other contributions and provide a reliable estimation. To address the second problem we use triplet of interferograms, canceling out all phase terms other than soil moisture. Closure phases, the triplet's product, depend on soil moisture variations with a non-linear ambiguous relationship. We show that its inversion is feasible once the ambiguity is solved. We use ALOS-2 and UAVSAR data to estimate soil moisture using a simple physical model.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Spanish Central Range hosts some of the southernmost Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech) populations, which relict character is under scientific debate. There is a lack of detailed and updated cartography of European beech dominated stands in this area. In this work the current location and distribution of European beech dominated stands in the Spanish Central Range was mapped based on intra-annual series of Landsat OLI and ETM+ images acquired in 2015 and field verification over 108,000 ha. The distinctive early opening of the European beech leaves, which occurs in this area by mid-May, was captured by an ETM+ image acquired May 11th 2015. Surface reflectance and vegetation indices derived from four images distributed over the year were classified with a support vector machine algorithm. The spectro-phenological behaviour during period June 2013 - December 2017 of European beech and five other vegetation types present in the area was characterized to get insights of the landscape spectral response, and the most distinct traits of each vegetation type were identified. Comparison with previous cartographic records and current dendrometric measurements enabled characterization of the established or expansive condition of individual stands. In recent times European beech has increased its distribution by 12.5 % in area, gaining land to heather bushes, Quercus pyrenaica Willd. forests, and pine plantations. Landsat intra-annual time series has shown to be a valuable source of data to get insights of the distribution of phenologically distinct species.

TI  - Remote sensing or the Spanish forests in the 21st century: a review of advances, needs, and opportunities
T2  - FOREST SYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - Forest ecosystems provide a host of services and societal benefits, including carbon storage, habitat for fauna, recreation, and provision of wood or non-wood products. In a context of complex demands on forest resources, identifying priorities for biodiversity and carbon budgets require accurate tools with sufficient temporal frequency. Moreover, understanding long term forest dynamics is necessary for sustainable planning and management. Remote sensing (RS) is a powerful means for analysis, synthesis, and report, providing insights and contributing to inform decisions upon forest ecosystems. In this communication we review current applications of RS techniques in Spanish forests, examining possible trends, needs, and opportunities offered by RS in a forestry context. Currently, wall-to-wall optical and LiDAR data are extensively used for a wide range of applications-many times in combination-whilst radar or hyperspectral data are rarely used in the analysis of Spanish forests. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) carrying visible and infrared sensors are gaining ground in acquisition of data locally and at small scale, particularly for health assessments. Forest fire identification and characterization are prevalent applications at the landscape scale, whereas structural assessments are the most widespread analyses carried out at limited extents. Unparalleled opportunities are offered by the availability of diverse RS data like those provided by the European Copernicus programme and recent satellite LiDAR launches, processing capacity, and synergies with other ancillary sources to produce information of our forests. Overall, we live in times of unprecedented opportunities for monitoring forest ecosystems with a growing support from RS technologies.

AB  - The article was prepared for the purpose of scientific substantiation of the need for further development of information technologies in the field of notary activities. To achieve this target, the authors, developing the content of the article, methodologically rely on the materialistic, positivistic worldview, applying a number of general scientific, special scientific and special methods. At the present stage of modernization of the economy and law of Russia, mainly the notary can serve as a guarantor of the stability of civil turnover, and it is the notary that can offer the most effective, including electronic, mechanisms for protecting property rights and the legitimate interests of citizens and legal entities. The authors consider electronic notary document's turnover in direct interaction with the electronic public services of state authorities and administration. The introduction and expansion of juridical on-line services is considered by the authors as a priority for the provision of notary services. Changes in Russian civil legislation are being studied, including the innovations of 2018, in comparison with the legislation on the notary of foreign countries.

AB  - Remote Sensing is the acquisition of information about its physical properties without direct contact with an object. This information is obtained through sensors. These sensors do not come into contact with objects. There are two different systems for remote sensing. These are Active and Passive Sensor Systems. Passive Sensor Systems measure the energy of the rays reflected from the objects by the rays sent by the sun. On the other hand, Active Sensor Systems measure the energy reflected from the objects by transmitting their rays to the object. Passive Sensor Systems can be shown as an example of optical sensor systems. The Landsat-8 satellite works with an optical sensor system. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems are examples of active sensor systems. SAR systems have a wide range of usage in all weather conditions and they are a radar system that displays the earth in high resolution. Radarsat-2 satellite has SAR sensor systems. The aim of this study is to compare each of the vegetation indices by using Landsat-8 and Radarsat-2 satellite images with two different types of sensors. In this study, Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were investigated. For the calculation of the RVI index, the back-scattering coefficient of the four different bands (HH, HV, VH, VV) of the multi-time full-polarimetric Radarsat-2 FQ satellite image dated 8 April 2015 was used. In the calculation of NDVI index, Band 5 (Near Infrared) and Band 4 (Red) of the Landsat-8 satellite image of May 25, 2015 were used. Dicle University agricultural areas were chosen as the study area. 100 different GPS points belonging to this agricultural area were determined and RVI and NDVI values of these points were calculated. A good correlation was observed between RVI and NDVI indices with the aid of statistically approach.

AB  - Traditional classification method based on machine learning algorithm has been widely adopted in very high resolution remote sensing image classification, yet the problem that could not effectively convey a higher level of abstract feature still need to be improved. This paper, relying on the convolution neural network algorithm, has conducted on the high-resolution remote sensing image classification method. Firstly, structure of convolution neural networks was analyzed. The prediction model of convolution neural networks was discussed, and the core of structure was the alternation of the convolution layer and the down sampling layer. Then, the training model of convolution neural networks was researched. By using weights sharing and local connection, convolution neural network, that image could directly entered into, avoids to a certain extent caused by image displacement, dimension change and so on. On this basis, basing on different phase GF-1 remote sensing data and MATLAB development environment under Windows10 operating system, then combining with object-oriented classification technology in image segmentation, this paper built the high resolution remote sensing image classification model based on convolution neural network. Finally, the parameters of the model were tested and analyzed repeatedly, and more accurate model parameters were obtained in this paper. Results show that the mode can effectively improve the classification accuracy, and provide technical support for improving remote sensing image interpretation and formulating sustainable development strategy.

T2  - COMUNICACION Y MEDIOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ethnic groups brought to Cuba by slavery carried their traditions. In the barracks of the island the Yoruba religion germinated, but this culture did not remain static, quickly there was a syncretism of the African and Catholic pantheon. Cinema in Cuba has seen religion as a fertile subject. But the influence exerted by foreign productions has led to two fundamental aspects: the copying of globalized canons and the search for a national aesthetic. The present text notes that in the audiovisual language, the Afrocuban rites are conceived as a resource for the construction of a cultural physiognomy where make a dialogue the contemporary trends and the roots of Cuba. Based on the review of the main bibliography of the area and audiovisual documents, a descriptive study with a qualitative approach establishes relevant conclusions regarding the analyzed historical process. So it is understood that in the audiovisual, the treatment of the religion of African origins has mutated: while some have approached with prejudices and stigmas, others have stereotyped it and some have chosen to explain, without mysticism, the Yoruba worldview. From every perspective, Cuban filmography contains signs of the Afrocuban culture, being a mirror of the Cuban imaginary. This magical-religious system is the basis of Cuban customs and culture.

AB  - Oak decline phenomenon has recently led to considerable dieback within Zagros forests, western Iran. In the present study, Landsat imagery (2005 to 2016) and synoptic station data were used to study the forest dieback in Dorood, Lorestan province. Sixteen vegetation indices were calculated and values in each year were obtained. The correlations between the index and climatic parameters of rainfall, temperature and relative humidity were investigated. Results showed that the correlation of some indices with rainfall and the correlation of other indices with temperature were more than 70%. Optimized soil adjusted vegetation index had 80% correlation with annual rainfall and the modification of normalized difference water index was correlated with average annual temperature by 75%. Using the numerical value changes of the indices, a map of forest cover change was prepared in four classes; healthy, weak, moderate and severe dieback and the process of its change were compared with the trend of variations in regard with rainfall values in the study period. 'there was a close relationship between changes in the area of forest cover dieback and rainfall and temperature values.

T2  - METEOROLOGY HYDROLOGY AND WATER MANAGEMENT-RESEARCH AND OPERATIONAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface water table level is a crucial factor for the existence of wetland habitats, and valuable from the point of view of environmental protection. In particular, surface water table in a hydrological year play an important role, affecting the seasonal changes in conditions of the development of species inhabiting a given patch of vegetation. The occurrence of floods often determines the possibility of survival of a given plant community.Information on the seasonal variability of surface waters, and above all the range of seasonal floods, is very important from the point of view of planning protection activities in National Parks in order to preserve wetland habitats. Nowadays, remote sensing data is an important source of spatial information, particularly those characterized by low cost data acquisition and processing. One such source is imagery collected from satellites, along with products freely distributed by the European Space Agency. Satellites of the Sentinel constellation provide multi-spectral optical remote sensing images recorded at visible and infrared wavelengths. Due to the short satellite revisit time of the Sentinel, the images from this satellite constitute a potential source of information for the monitoring of moisture on wetlands with a high temporal resolution.In this study, the authors aim to demonstrate the possibilities associated with the use of satellite images to monitor the range of a free surface water table in the pilot area located within the basin of the Lasica Channel, located in the Kampinos National Park (Poland). The accuracy of the results of the remote sensing transformations will be assessed using high resolution RGB images obtained with the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and control points measurements. The maps of free water table has been acquired as an result of ensemble regressors (Random Forest, Extra Trees, Bagging). Regressors has been learned and applied for two sessions. Promising results were obtained indicating the possibility of using the proposed method on a similar scale.

AB  - Using the aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the MODIS satellite instruments, the hazes over Eurasia in July 2016 were analyzed. Total area of the haze blanketing was estimated to be approximately 20 million km(2), including the Siberian smoke haze (SSH) with a maximum area of 16 million km(2), spreaded over European territory of Russia, Kazakhstan and many European countries. The evolution of AOD in SSH has been analyzed. The total mass of smoke at different stages of the SSH evolution was ranged from 1.6 to 3.7 million tons. When using the aerosol index data from the OMI UV measurements, the essential changes in the qualitative composition of smoke aerosol transported away from the fire places at a distance of 1000-2000 km were detected. The average aerosol radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere and at the stage of maximum development of the SSH was estimated to be 38 W/m(2).

AB  - Land degradation by salinity is one of the main environmental hazards threatening soil sustainability especially in arid and semi-arid regions of the world characterized by low precipitation and high evaporation. Geo-statistical approaches and remote sensing (RS) techniques have provided fast, accurate and economic prediction and mapping of soil salinity within the last two decades. Obtaining multi-temporal data via satellite images in different spatial domains with various scales is one of the key developments of monitoring spatial variability of soil salinity. In addition, geo-statistical methods have the capability of producing prediction surfaces from limited sample data.This study, aims to map spatial distribution of soil salinity in the selected pilot area which is located in the western part of Urmia Lake Basin, Iran, by applying geo-statistical methods. A kriging based map and three different co-kriging based maps were produced using electrical conductivity (EC) measurements as primary variable and three different soil salinity index values as secondary variable. Three soil salinity indices were created by using Sentinel-2A image that were acquired in the same date of field measurements to generate 3 various soil salinity prediction maps. Salinity maps obtained from geo-statistical methods were compared and validated to understand the performance of these approaches for soil salinity prediction. The results of this study demonstrated that co-kriging can provide promising estimation of spatial variability of soil salinity especially when there is relevant and abundant set of secondary data derived from satellite images.

M3  - Article
AB  - A.S. Pushkin was not only a brilliant poet, dramatist and novelist, but, possessing the gift of "prophecy and wisdom", was still an outstanding historian and social philosopher, who throughout his life tried to find and show the whole of Russia worthy of its historical path That is why, turning to his legacy, which is not yet fully appreciated in all its diversity and completeness, the authors of the article aim to clarify what is the peculiarity of the great Russian poet's judgments about Russia, its place in the world historical process, its fate and purpose. The scientific novelty of the research is determined by the departure from superficial schematism and ideological dictatorship and the desire to take into account the whole range of statements and judgments of Pushkin about the Russian people and Russia, his uncompromising disputes with his contemporaries in the face of ideologists of the Decembrist movement, as well as the ancestors of Westernism and Slavophilism. The principle of dialogism permeates the whole article, allowing us to present the position of the poet and his opponents on the most burning philosophical, ideological and socio-political issues that have worried Russian society for many decades. As a result, it is established that Pushkin has his own original point of view on the historical past of Russia and the prospects for its development, which differs from the views of both Westerners and Slavophiles. The genius ability of the great Russian poet for a synthetic understanding of real historical process leads him to the idea that in the historical perspective, Russia should rely on both the Orthodox traditions of national culture and various innovations made by other peoples.

AB  - The article reveals the methodical specifics of developing worldview competencies that are intermediate between existential skills - soft skills, and professional skills - hard skills, in the contemporary competency-based model of a specialist. A complex innovative teaching methodology that includes faceto-face lectures, practical sessions, and electronic technologies is considered through the example of the "Politology" discipline. A tool for developing the intellectual and personal resource of students is shown. The purpose of the work is to search an effective pedagogical model of developing worldview competencies in the context of mastering the course of "Politology" in the non-humanitarian university environment. These competencies include political self-identification, activation of civic position, and formation of patriotism. The research objective is to identify the most interesting, meaningful and effective pedagogical methods through testing and interviewing full-time students. Empirical methods of observation, comparison, measurement, theoretical methods of induction and deduction, abstraction, generalization, systematization and interpretation of facts, as well as a mental experiment am used in the article. The study confirmed the hypothesis that the humanities cannot and should not be transferred into electronic distance learning format in the context of digitalization process, since the development of soft skills and associated worldview competencies occurs mostly in interpersonal interaction in face-to-face team work environment.

TI  - Maximizing Sentinel Lymph Node Detection: Aortic Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Endometrial Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Study Objective: To determine the importance of a dual (cervical and fundal) indocyanine green (ICG) injection and thorough dissection for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs).Design: Description and step-by-step demonstration of the surgical procedure using video (Canadian Task Force classification III).Setting: Hospital Universitario Donostia, San Sebastian, Spain.Patients: A 60-year-old woman with a diagnosis of IAG1 endometrial adenocarcinoma (EC).Interventions: The patient received a cervical and transcervical fundal ICG injection for para-aortic and pelvic SLN detection in the setting of a research protocol, followed by a total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with a frozen section of the uterus as a standard approach [1]. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for the research protocol of this study.Measurements and Main Results: Dual ICG injection [2] adds the benefit of a cervical injection (that best evaluates the pelvic region [3]) to the fundal injection, with better spread to the lumboaortic pathway [4] so as not to lose the aortic drainage and aortic SLN, whose relevance is still discussed due to its low incidence of metastasis [5]. This search does not add to the associated morbidity but is associated with increased operative time. For pelvic SLN dissection, patience and good training are key; the surgeon must always be on the lookout for uncommon pathways if no SLN is detected in the classical areas. The final histological classification was upgraded to a grade IIIC2 (ie, micrometastasis in the aortic and pelvic-right pararectal space) EC, 3 cm G1 with no lymphovascular invasion.Conclusion: Dual ICG injection allows comprehensive mapping not only of pelvic SLNs, but also of para-aortic SLNs, in EC, maximizing the identification of all possible affected areas. Nonetheless, the relevance of its added benefit requires further evaluation. (C) 2018 AAGL. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to Global warming, the Antarctic sea ice extent is increasing to a greater range. Analyses of 37 years (1979-2015) of Antarctic sea ice extents is derived from passive microwave satellite data for the Southern Hemisphere and for each of five sectors: the Weddell Sea, the Indian Ocean, the western Pacific Ocean, the Ross Sea, and the Bellingshausen/Amundsen seas. There is an overall positive yearly trend of 24.9 +/- 4.4 10(3) km(2) yr(-1) (r = 5.7 and 2.1 +/- 0.4%decade(-1)) in sea ice extent for the total Antarctic. The smallest seasonal slope is observed for winter at 19.6 +/- 4.3 10(3) km(2) yr(-1) (r= 4.5 and 1.1 +/- 0.2% decade(-1)) and the highest seasonal slope is for autumn at 29.5 +/- 7.4 10(3) km(2) yr(-1) (r= 4.0 and 2.7 +/- 0.7 % decade(-1)). Regional sea-ice variability in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen sector of Antarctica during 1979-2015 revealed the significant decline of the sea-ice extent at an average annual rate of -3.8 +/--2.0 10(3) km(2) yr(-1) (r=-1.9 and -2.5 +/- 1.4 % decade(-1)). The sea-ice decline trend in this sector has a substantial seasonal variability peak in summer of -11.6 +/- 2.0 10(3) km(2) yr(-1), -6.8 +/- 2.8 10(3) km(2) yr(-1) for Autumn, and -0.9 +/- 3.7 10(3) km(2) yr(-1) for spring. In contrast, during winter it shows the increasing positive trend of 4.3 +/- 3.4 10(3) km(2) yr(-1). When the westerly wind increases in the Amundsen sea, it warms the Circumpolar Deepwater and this water flows into the continental shelf. This oceanic forcing leads to decrease in sea ice. When the northerly wind flows across the Bellingshausen sea, it warms the air in the Antarctic Peninsula region which increases the Sea Surface Temperature and thus reduces the Sea ice in the Bellingshausen Sea. The mixed pattern of observed increasing and decreasing sea-ice coverage in the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Sea region is explained in this article.

AB  - Changes in the microclimate of the urban environment often occur as a result of changes in urban development, artificial changes in the relief, and the cutting down of forest plantations. Due to changes in the urban environment there is a change in the microclimate of the city, which entails a direct change in the land surface temperature. Changes in the urban environment can be detected using space images of different spatial resolution in the visible and far infrared range. Landsat data is currently the most accessible, complete, and open for studying these changes. Thermal imaging is widely used for monitoring urban sites. To increase the spatial resolution, synthesis of Landsat-8 images with higher spatial resolution images of Planet Scope is used, which allows increasing the spatial resolution of surface temperature maps produced from Landsat-8 images from 30 meters to 3 meters. The paper presents the results of an assessment of the land surface temperature in the city of Krasnoyarsk for a two-year period from September 2016 to September 2018 based on the analysis of Landsat-8 and Planet Scope satellite images.

AB  - The linkages between land and poverty are many, with agricultural production serving as the primary junction. Key to agricultural production, and often omitted from statistical data collection efforts for cost and complication, is soil health and quality. Data on soil that can be linked with agricultural and household survey data are most commonly available from (i) geospatial data informed from a combination of remotely sensed imagery, ground data from sentinel sites, and other geospatial data sources, and (ii) household surveys on agriculture themselves, which occasionally include minimal questions on the subjective assessment of soil quality and/or type. Subjective questions on soil quality, however, offer little insights into specific soil constraints and suffer from problems of reliability. Geospatial data offers wider geographic coverage of soil data, while also providing quantitative data on specific soil properties. However, the use of geospatial soil data comes with potentially severe constraints in terms of resolution. Can sensors for soil quality address these critical data gaps? We illustrate the results from methodological studies conducted in Ethiopia and Uganda, first comparing the status quo (subjective soil assessment) with lab-based spectral soil analysis and subsequently presenting findings comparing lab-based analysis to the use of prototype tools for in-field spectrometry.

TI  - The Salinity Structure of the Amazon River Plume Drives Spatiotemporal Variation of Oceanic Primary Productivity
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon river is a major source of terrestrially derived organic carbon to the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Field, satellite and a vertically generalized production model data were used to estimate empirical surface salinity and fit an inverse logit function to investigate the limiting effect of salinity on the productivity in the Amazon river plume. Satellite data included Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, and Aquarius missions. Previous empirical surface salinity models have relied on a very narrow range of salinity values and satellite data to estimate the spatial extent of the river plume. The empirical surface salinity model presented here extended the range of salinity values and captures all the main surface mesoscale features, particularly those related to the main path of the low-salinity water. We also show that it is possible to gain new insights on the spatiotemporal variability of the Amazon river plume by improving the empirical surface salinity and expanding its sampling period with the aid of remote sensing data. The variability of primary productivity is dominated by the subannual (6 month) and annual (12 month) frequency bands. Low-salinity river water influences surface primary productivity continuously during the year through mechanisms associated with the western tropical Atlantic circulation and vertical mixing.

AB  - Water bodies are among most sensitive ecological environments. In order to ensure good water quality and establish framework for their protection European Parliament was adopted the Water Framework Directive (WFD) (Directive 2000/60/EC). The biological, hydro morphological and physic chemical quality parameters which are relevant for assessment of ecological status of water body are defined in Annex V of WFD. Traditionally, quality of surface water bodies are monitored by in situ measurements resulting in low spatial and temporal resolution of historical data.Remote sensing has great potential for monitoring and identification of water bodies over large scale regions in a more effective and efficient manner. In order to provide reliable monitoring of water quality, surface reflection derived by multispectral sensors need to be integrated with in situ measurements. Relationship between remote sensing and in situ data is usually modeled by using empirical, machine learning or deep learning algorithms.In this study, a 4-year (2013-2016) result of in situ monitoring of surface water bodies in Serbia are used for calibration and validation of algorithm for water quality monitoring based on Landsat 8 satellite image. The Turbidity, Suspending Sediments, Total Phosphorus and Total Nitrogen (physic chemical parameters) in region of Vojvodina, Republic of Serbia are monitored. The Neuron Networks and Supported Vector Machine are used to analyzing correlation between in situ measurements and Landsat 8 atmospherically corrected satellite images. Feature more, capabilities of Landsat 8 are compared with Sentinel 2 images (2-years, 2015-2016). In situ data are provided by Agency for environment protection of Serbia.

AB  - Pan sharpening technique is a widely used image processing technique which combines the data available from various sensors and exploits its varied capabilities. In this study, the efficiency of four diverse pan sharpening methods namely High Pass filter, Modified Intensity Hue Saturation, Ehlers fusion and Hyperspectral Colour Sharpening was evaluated. The pan sharpening approaches are applied to Landsat 8 imagery of an urban area. The spatial and spectral quality of the fused images is assessed using different indices like Bias, RMSE, Correlation Coefficient and ERGAS. The fused images obtained have improved spatial resolution and visual appearance compared to the original MS image. The fused images have a spatial resolution comparable to that of the PAN image. According to visual analysis, Modified IHS method yielded a fused image with better visual interpretability. The statistical analysis shows that the high pass filter is the most suitable pan sharpening method for this dataset. On testing for Bias, RMSE, ERGAS and CC, the high pass filter method performed best followed by Modified Intensity Hue saturation, Ehlers fusion and Hyperspectral Colour Sharpening while Ehlers fusion showed a higher correlation, compared to Modified IHS.

AB  - Today, geospatial technology becomes indispensable because of the technological advancement in automated data acquisition and the rapid growth of data, information and communication in 24 x 7 has been generating voluminous spatio-temporal data of earth surface. Voluminous spatio-temporal data is required to extract the features as several unrelated and redundant features, which may degrade the performance and fallout in extensive computation course of vegetation monitoring. The aim of this research is to select significant, efficient and effective selected features in monitoring of vegetation for Rajasthan state with standard feature extraction method of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), correlation and Spatial auto-correlation. In this paper, it applied these feature extractions on hydro-meteorological rainfall data, vegetation drought index as Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) data and vegetation indices as Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) data to reduce the features related to vegetation monitoring.

TI  - Using multi-seasonal Landsat imagery for rapid identification of abandoned land in areas affected by urban sprawl
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies have shown that spatial information on abandoned land could play an important role in urban land management, as land abandonment was proven capable of revealing future trajectories of change. However, mapping land abandonment with traditional methods (e.g., field work, digitization of aerial images) can be time consuming, expensive, and require considerable man-power. In this context, Landsat imagery proves to be a reliable source of data. To our knowledge, the potential of Landsat imagery for mapping abandoned land has not been tested in heterogeneous and highly fragmented urban settings. The aim of our paper is to propose a resource-efficient (i.e., in terms of time and manpower) method for the assessment of land abandonment in areas affected by urban sprawl, by using seasonal time series of Landsat data. Bucharest, Romania was chosen as case study area. Landsat scenes from the year 2013 are grouped based on vegetation phonology into four PGSs (periods of the growing season). NDVI values corresponding to land abandonment are analyzed with Classification and Regression Trees. A total of 23 models-representing combinations of PGSs-are tested in order to determine what period of the vegetation growing season fits best for mapping abandoned land, and for the purpose of deriving such a map for Bucharest. Finally, results are validated against independent data and a resource estimation for the entire mapping process is performed. Results show that abandoned land can be mapped with Landsat imagery with accuracies above 80%. Higher accuracies are obtained when scenes encompassing the beginning of the vegetation growing season are included in the models. We also observed that accuracy tends to decrease from models which include PGSs representing the beginning of the vegetation growing season towards those representing the end. Estimation showed that mapping land abandonment with Landsat data could reduce time and workforce resources by almost half compared with aerial imagery and field work. As our method is rapid, easy to implement, and based on freely available data, it can be used by local authorities that cannot allocate significant resources for land change monitoring. Furthermore, the approach could provide objective information to municipalities where official statistics on land abandonment are unreliable or of low quality.

AB  - The article discusses the social and worldview background for the formation of the phenomenon of the social state in the Western European civilization of the 18th-19th centuries. Its formation was connected with reconsideration of idea of "the public benefit outside which there were a poverty and a social inequality. This tendency to ignore poverty and social inequality was maintained by faith in the omnipotence of a rationally organized state. The latter for two centuries solved the problem of poverty with measures of isolation, moral condemnation and disciplinary violence. Gradually together with destruction of former rationalism and a mechanistic picture of the world, development of national education systems there is a suspicion to "reasonably arrange" public system and the state crowning it. New idea of the state is developed. Now it includes in the sphere of the responsibility besides the political rights of the person and citizen his social rights. The leading role in this process in the second half of the 19th the first third of the 20th century belongs to the socialist thought which had considerable impact on domestic policy of many countries of Europe and USA. Therefore the first stage of formation of the social state can be characterized as socialist.

AB  - Satellite-based solar resource data are valued for their spatial extensiveness and long temporal record. Validation of such data, including accurate assessment of their uncertainties against reference datasets, is essential to give users confidence in and maximum benefit from the data. More broadly, the international Earth observation from space community estimates many geophysical parameters from satellite data, such as, to name just a few, precipitation, sea surface temperature and atmospheric aerosol amount, and validates them. In particular, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), an international body that coordinates the use of civilian non-meteorological Earth observing satellites, has made considerable progress in developing standard validation protocols for numerous satellite-derived parameters. These protocols recommend good practices to support the benchmarking and validation of satellite datasets. This paper describes the benefits and development approach of a validation protocol for satellite solar resource data that is being developed under the auspices of the CEOS Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV) Land Product Validation (LPV) subgroup. The protocol development has the support of International Energy Agency (IEA) / Photovoltaic Power Systems (PVPS) / Task 16 Solar resource for high penetration and large scale applications and will build on the work of Task 16 and previous IEA Tasks for solar resource assessment.

TI  - Ettore Sernicoli: an Italian policeman against "anarchic terrorism" (1880-99)
T2  - STORICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The essay addresses police officers' culture and their construction of a complex "object" situated between criminality and politics. In particular, it focuses on the system of control, prevention and subsequent repression implemented against anarchist subversive activities in the late 19th century. In order to illustrate this intricate path, the essay analyzes the career of one of those officers, Ettore Sernicoli. Sernicoli initially took part in surveillance of the internationalist anarchic movement, then dedicated himself to a theoretical reflection on anarchism in two published essays. His twin role as repressor and scholar allows an exploration of the mutual influence between the explanation of anarchism and its repression. At such crossroads, the investigator's worldview enables us in particular to analyze that distinctive continuity between hermeneutics and representations of subversion and criminality, which characterised the transnational campaign against the internationalist anarchic movement in the troubled final decades of the 19th century in Europe.

AB  - This work investigates the use of convolutional neural networks for classifying ship targets from images acquired by the Multi-Spectral Instrument sensor on board Sentinel-2 satellites. An automatic procedure, requiring a minimum amount of supervision, is applied to extract labeled target images which are used for training. The data set consists of top of the atmosphere reflectance images in three visible channels and one near-infrared band. The performance of the classifier is evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve statistics. The results show good classification performance with area under the curve greater than 0.95. Future work will be focused on investigating the impact of image atmospheric corrections and on comparing with other methods.

T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images are richer than ever before. For example, new Landsat-8 images with their 11 bands carry much more information than older generations of satellites. These differences in spectral representation imply a major difficulty for assessing long-term land surface changes. The easiest solution is to reduce the information of the most recent product, for example by only keeping a subset of the Landsat-8 bands that matches old imagery. To avoid such loss of information, we propose a new method based on multiband spatial pattern matching. We are focusing on increasing the spectral resolution of archive satellite images to the same level of spectral resolution and coverage as modern imagery. Our method uses analogous scenes taken from modem satellites, which have conceptually the same role as the training images used in multiple-point geostatistics simulation. The spectral characteristics of the training image are then transferred to a target archive image, where new synthetic spectral bands are generated. A spatial pattern matching procedure is used to control this transfer, resulting in preservation of spatial and spectral coherence in the results. We illustrate the methodology on Landsat 8 and Corona imagery. The proposed method was benchmarked against other state-of-the-art colorization techniques, and it shows globally better results.

AB  - In the frame of the ESA Sentinel-5 mission, as part of the Copernicus program, Airbus is the prime contractor for the S5 Instrument. As part of the S5 instrument, which is using the METOP SG satellite as a platform, Leonardo is developing the Short-Wave Infrared Spectrometer (SWIR-SS), comprising two parallel channels covering the wavelength ranges of 1589o1676 nm (SWIR 1) and 2304 divided by 2386 nm (SWIR 3).Major objective of the S5 is the monitoring of the Earth atmosphere by taking measurements of trace gases and aerosols impacting air quality and climate, with a swath width of ca. 2670 Km providing daily coverage of Earth atmosphere at an unprecedented resolution of 7x7 Km2 at nadir.Main characteristic of the SWIR-SS compared to other spectrometers is the high spectral position one orbit stability less than 1um and high spectral pixel resolution of 0.1nm. High stability and optical quality requires accurate optical elements mounting design and high resolution is reached by using new developments regarding Immersed Grating (grating immersed on a prism) and the implementation of a cutting edge 3D Slit Homogenizer system, positioned on the object plane of the spectrometer, to mitigate radiometric errors arising from scene heterogeneity.In order to demonstrate the system performance the optical design has been validated by means of flight representative optical assemblies. These breadboards are representing all relevant optical elements of the system.This paper presents the tests, which have been performed on the flight representative optical elements and the test results.As the Optical Element Mounting, the Slit Homogenizer and the Immersed Grating are major elements to fulfil mission requirements the development approach is described. Special emphasis for Lens mounting is put on the stability and WFE, for the Slit Homogenizer is put on the requirements regarding the slit width variation and the quality of the entrance edge while the major design driver for the Immersed grating is the optical quality.This paper presents the development approach of these two major optical elements and the validation test results.

TI  - CHURCH AND CHRISTIANS BETWEEN PROPHECY AND CONFORMISM
T2  - BOGOSLOVSKA SMOTRA-EPHEMERIDES THEOLOGICAE ZAGRABIENSES
M3  - Article
AB  - It is without doubt that the influence of prophets on the religion in Israel is evident in the fact that they enlarged the reach and influence of religion beyond the boundaries of cult and ritual. Although feast-days and cult were an unavoidable part of the identity of the chosen people, prophets tried to keep the link between cult and history. From the perspective of faith they rose up against injustice and, thus, provided a manifestly ethical component to the religion of Israel. In accordance with that, the author discusses at length the prophetic (and conformist) relation of the Church towards other domains, such as politics, economics, social, and worldview issues. The issue is raised about the extent to which we were prophetic or conformist when we needed to talk about corruption, political pragmatism, bribe, and injustices in the society. However, it is obvious that the topic of prophecy and conformism is "imposed" today through the gradual loss of trust in the Church and its authenticity, i.e., it emerged from a certain crisis in the Church caused, among other things, by unfortunate events such as financial manipulations and sexual abuse. This raises an additional issue that has not been discussed extensively until now: How prophetic or conformist are we in our pastoral activity, in our dealings with sacraments and sacramentals, in relation to problems and scandals in the Church and whether we managed to find a balance between institutionalism and charisma in the Church? It is not enough for the Church and Christians to the "the conscience of society". The key issues is: Do the Church and Christians have some sort of vision of the future, where are we going or should be going, and are we capable of leading the world prophetically and to be a step ahead of its pragmatisms?

TI  - High Prevalence of <i>Bartonella</i> sp. in Dogs from Hamadan, Iran
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bartonellae are emerging vector-borne pathogens infecting various domestic and wild mammals. Blood samples were collected from 66 dogs at two locations near Hamedan, Iran. Twenty dogs were rescued stray dogs and 46 dogs were from a breeding colony, with many of them infested with fleas, ticks, or lice. Serology was performed using an indirect immunofluorescent antibody test for Bartonella henselae, Bartonella clarridgeiae, and Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii. Seroprevalence was 74.2% (range: 65.2-95%). Bartonella DNA amplification and sequencing identified B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii type III in seven dogs, including five rescued dogs. Two dogs were infected with Bartonella rochalimae and three dogs with Candidatus B. merieuxii, including two of the stray dogs coinfected with Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii. Rescued stray dogs were 10 times (odds ratio (OR) = 10.13, 95% CI: 1.24-82.7; P = 0.03) more likely to be seropositive and eight times (OR = 8.82, 95% CI: 2.68-29.11; P = 0.0004) more likely to be flea-infested than breeding dogs, confirming that arthropod infestation is a major risk factor for these infections.

AB  - The radar satellite TerraSAR-X monitors the Earth's surface in a near-polar orbit. To provide the maritime community with up-to-date information on the presence and location of icebergs, the high-resolution radar images provided by the satellite are processed automatically by an image processing chain. A cell-averaging constant false alarm rate detector is used for iceberg detection, which has proven its usefulness for terrestrial object detection already. However, data transmission and processing require an impractical amount of time for real-time operation. In the present work, an FPGA-based hardware prototype of the detection algorithm is proposed, which accelerates image processing by a factor of ten compared to a software implementation and shows potential for further speed-up in the future.

TI  - Intra-annual reflectance composites from Sentinel-2 and Landsat for national-scale crop and land cover mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many applications that target dynamic land surface processes require a temporal observation frequency that is not easily satisfied using data from a single optical sensor. Sentinel-2 and Landsat provide observations of similar nature and offer the opportunity to combine both data sources to increase time-series temporal frequency at high spatial resolution. Multi-sensor image compositing is one way for performing pixel-level data integration and has many advantages for processing frameworks, especially if analyses over larger areas are targeted. Our compositing approach is optimized for narrow temporal-intervals and allows the derivation of time-series of consistent reflectance composites that capture field level phenologies. We processed more than a year's worth of imagery acquired by Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI as available from the NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel dataset. We used all data acquired over Germany and integrated observations into composites for three defined temporal intervals (10-day, monthly and seasonal). Our processing approach includes generation of proxy values for OLI in the MSI red edge bands and temporal gap filling on the 10-day time-series. We then derive a national scale crop type and land cover map and compare our results to spatially explicit agricultural reference data available for three federal states and to the results of a recent agricultural census for the entire country. The resulting map successfully captures the crop type distribution across Germany at 30 m resolution and achieves 81% overall accuracy for 12 classes in three states for which reference data was available. The mapping performance for most classes was highest for the 10-day composites and many classes are discriminated with class specific accuracies > 80%. For several crops, such as cereals, maize and rapeseed our mapped acreages compare very well with the official census data with average differences between mapped and census area of 11%, 2% and 3%, respectively. Other classes (grapevine and forest classes) perform slightly less well, likely, because the available reference data does not fully capture the variability of these classes across Germany. The inclusion of the red edge bands slightly improved overall accuracies in all cases and improved class specific accuracies for most crop classes. Similarly, our gap filling procedure led to improved mapping accuracies when compared to nongap-filled 10-day features. Overall, our results demonstrate the valuable potential of approaches that utilize data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat which allows for detailed assessments of agricultural and other land-uses over large areas.

AB  - Throughout the years, a wide range of satellite mission enabled the creation of a huge amount of Earth Observation (EO) data carrying complex information, whose exploitation is left behind due to the lack of handling capabilities. Computational resources are hardly keeping up with content analysis and information retrieval. In order to increase the search speed through data warehouses for knowledge discovery, new indexing methods are required to handle both the size and the informational complexity of EO data. Feature extraction algorithms are able to describe the image content, yet, they require a very complex database. In this paper, we propose a methodology that combines feature extraction, hashing methods and optimized indexing to convert the images characteristics into hash codes in an effort to speed up the search process. For our experiments, we run our procedure on a data-set composed of several Sentinel-2 acquisitions

For our case study, we consider two prominent land cover classes in the Gauteng province, namely natural vegetation and settlement using an 8 year MODIS dataset. We use the framework to compare two feature extraction techniques, namely PCA and FFT. For the case study we considered in this paper, the PCA technique produced a reduced feature space which was 15% more separable than the feature space produced by the FFT method.

TI  - Integrating geological and airborne geophysical data to review the cartography of Rio Itangua Batholith, Aracuai Orogen, Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Rio Itangua Batholith (RIB) is a plutonic body located in the Northern border of Guanhaes block, one of the various basement blocks reworked within the Aracuai orogen, Eastern Brazil. Although its existence is known since the beginning of the 20th century, its tectonic history remains poorly understood. The RIB was mapped at 1:100,000 scale in the 1990s, before geophysical and satellite data became available. This work aims to re-evaluate the cartography of the RIB, as an initial step towards understanding its genesis and evolution. In order to do so, field and petrographic data, together with airborne gamma-ray spectrometry and magnetometry data, were integrated, resulting in a geologic map that shows different features from the previous maps produced in the area, such as the batholith division into two different petrographic and geophysical units; the presence of a mafic dike intruding the batholith rocks and the reduction in size of the batholith area. The magnetometric and gamma-spectrometric data proved to be important tools for geological mapping, and the substantial data obtained in the analysis of this tiny area points to the importance of re-evaluating older geological maps, taking geophysical data into account.

AB  - Supervised classification of satellite images is performed based on utilization of reference training data. Therefore, the availability and quality of reference data highly influences the results and the course of the entire classification process.In the Sentinel-2 Global Land Cover (S2GLC) project Sentinel-2 images are classified using Random Forest (RF) algorithm powered by training points selected from existing low resolution land cover databases. This approach allows to perform the classification process in a highly automatic manner without much intervention of an operator. An alternative method for creating training dataset has been developed in order to ensure the implementation of the S2GLC classification in case of limited access to the required land cover databases or their low quality.The proposed method is a semi-automatic process initiated by an operator, who by a visual interpretation, indicates only several starting samples for the classes of interest. Afterwards, utilizing this limited set of initial training samples, hundreds or thousands of training samples with similar spectral characteristics are automatically selected from the image. Such a set of data, can be further used as an alternative source of training data for land cover classification on much greater scale.Comparing to the traditional approach, in which all samples or training areas are manually indicated, the developed method is very effective and also allows for processing data more rapidly. The semi-automatic training can be used as an alternative or supplement the training dataset applied in the S2GLC classification approach.

AB  - Post-processing is the last and often optional stage of land cover (LC) classification from satellite images. In the traditional approach, it is usually applied to remove the effect of "salt and pepper" from the classified image and also to standardize the image details according to the defined minimum mapping unit (MMU). The proposed post-processing method presented in this paper, has been used in the Sentinel-2 Global Land Cover (S2GLC) project. Its main goal is to remove or minimize typical classification errors that can appear in the classification output. Therefore, a set of functions that are able to improve the result of LC classifications has been developed. These include relatively simply defined rules that operate based on predefined threshold values of selected spectral channels, spectral indexes or auxiliary data. Additionally, logical relations between certain LC classes have been implemented. The proposed post-processing has been applied to the classification results of the S2GLC project and helped to improve LC classification in all test sites representing different parts of the globe.

AB  - Accurate estimation of forest effective leaf area index (LAIe) is of great significance for regional carbon sequestration studies, forest management and monitoring. In this study, an advanced method was developed to predict LAIe based on Li-Strahler geometric-optical model, airborne LiDAR and Landsat 7 ETM+ data. More specifically, based on the Li-Strahler geometric-optical model, a reliable method was developed to solve the mixed pixel problem, and further to realize the prediction of regional LAIe from airborne LiDAR and multispectral data. First, based on the airborne LiDAR-derived canopy height product, the LAIe was estimated over airborne LiDAR coverage. Second, the sunlit background component was calculated based on the simplified relationship with canopy gap, and LAIe. Then, the reflectance of sunlit background was calculated based on the linear decomposition model. Finally, the forest LAIe was estimated by using Li-Strahler geometric-optical model over the study area. Results showed that the retrieval method proposed in this study could be used effectively in the inversion of regional LAIe, with the significant coefficient of determination (R-2) was 0.81 and root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.23, as compared with field measurements.

AB  - This paper presents a fast algorithm for radar image generation. In this approach, the three-dimensional (3-D) complex scattering function of a complex man-made target is first predicted by a high-frequency EM technique, and then projected onto the two dimensional (2-D) image projection plane (IPP). A fast point-spread operation using 2-D window function is finally made in the frequency domain to obtain a radar image. The developed algorithm is applicable to the online prediction of templates as well as to establish a plentiful training data base for machine learning based automatic target recognition. As an example, a ship recognition approach based on 2-D hot scattering point image is presented by using the proposed algorithm. Experimental results for simulated and TerraSAR-X images demonstrate the usefulness and practicability of the proposed algorithms.

TI  - Advanced Merkel cell carcinoma of the lower extremity treated with surgery and isolated pelvic and limb perfusion using Melphalan: A case of unexpected long-term survival
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, neuroendocrine skin tumor, with high frequency of locoregional recurrence, metastases, and poor prognosis. Locoregional MCC recurrence in the extremities can pose considerable treatment challenges. We report a case of long-term survival in a female patient with recurrent MCC of the leg, treated with surgery and locoregional chemotherapy.PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 73-year-old female with cirrhosis and hepatitis C, developed cutaneous MCC in the left inferior limb. This patient initially received surgical treatment, with subsequent negative sentinel lymph-node biopsy in another center, one-month prior recovery in our department, and arrived with 4 new limb nodules, cranially to the previously treated area, without distant metastases or inguinal lymph node recurrence. This patient was not eligible for immunotherapy due to active hepatitis upon treatment with NS5B inhibitors, or eligible for systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy due to severe neutropenia and was, therefore, subjected to surgical resection combined with Isolated Pelvic and Limb Perfusion (IPLP) with Melphalan. Histological evaluation confirmed MCC diagnosis and during the following 4 months, she developed further locoregional recurrences with homolateral inguinal lymph node involvement and was subjected to two additional rounds of surgery plus IPLP.DISCUSSION: All procedures were tolerated, systemic toxicities were temporary and subsequent clinical and radiological follow-up, following the last combined treatment, indicated that this patient was still alive and disease-free, at 56 months.CONCLUSION: In this case, surgery combined with locoregional Melphalan chemotherapy was an effective and repeatable treatment for recurrent MMC and resulted in unexpected long-term survival.

AB  - Relevance of the topic of myth in ritual practices of the Circassian (Adyg) is in their conceptually new perception in modern culture. Mythology and personification of Pantheon deities and protectors covers the semantic and translational levels in cooperation with the representation and structure of ritual activities. The paper deals with the reconstruction and reinterpretation in the ancient Circassian (Adyg) mythological system followed by identification of similar rituals, issues of plot borrowing, as well as disclosure of symbols in the interaction with the archetypal mythological structure and musical insonation in ritual via instrumental tunes or songs in honour of deity. The musical instrument in the rite was an Adyg pipe called Kamil that has a sacred power of divine origin and a border between the human ancestor and deities. Currently reinterpretation of archetypal mythological structures, plots, characters and images lead to a new worldview in mythology. It gives them the second life as a phenomenon of contemporary culture from the viewpoint of archaic mythological representation of images and symbols. Common feature of archaic cultural levels is a single system of transmission, awareness about sacred ritual and sounds to achieve necessary benefits for the existence and development of the mankind in the world.

AB  - In addition to the many beneficial effects that the solar radiation (SR) has on human beings, the ultraviolet (UV) band can produce several adverse effects to skin and eyes. Both acute and long-term effects are due to UV overexposure and the damage, as well as the risk, increase with the duration of exposure. To reduce the incidence of those risks, outdoor workers should take careful behaviors, reducing the tissues exposition to sun. Nowadays, there are many easy-to-use apps and tools to estimate outdoor exposition with UV-index. However, the use of a such simple measurement is not sufficient for a correct estimation of the UV dose to skin and eyes; in fact the UV erythemal dose is measured only with scientific instruments and the acquired data have to be post-processed. The paper presents a prototype of a personal and wearable smart device for estimating in real time the UV erythemal exposure of outdoor workers. The device is equipped with several sensors able to detect the body posture assumed by worker and to communicate with a Smartphone's app which provides geographical coordinates, the sun position and UV irradiation level from satellite data. Hence, with the help of an algorithm, the software can calculate an estimation of the UV dose.

AB  - Politics and religion have always been closely connected, as both depend on the manner in which man sees himself and the world around him. But one of the main features of democracy, the political system more widely accepted in the world today, is its secularization. Democracy no longer allows thrones, and religion has been reduced to one of the many possibilities individuals have when choosing how they want to live their lives. But every political system implies a different religion and vice versa. Democracy is not, in fact, the time of the end of religion, but a total reconfiguration of religious experience that could become considered the most authentic of all.This paper investigates the interdependence between politics and religion from the worldview that man has of himself in the context of democracy assuming the challenge posed to religious freedom from the political horizon as the task of the path of peace.

T2  - BALTIC FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Countrywide up-to-date tree cover maps provide valuable information for planning and management purposes to investigate location of the resources and to identify afforestation and deforestation patterns. Landsat programme offers freely available satellite data with time span more than three decades and it can serve as bases for tree cover map calculation using satellite image classification; however, practical use of classification methods is limited due to lack of user-friendly solutions and complex interpretation of the results. The objective of this study is to evaluate user-friendly hybrid classification scheme for tree cover mapping in Latvia and to explore the nature of the spectral classes and consistency of the results when methodology is applied to images of different dates. Tree cover in this context means the area covered by crown of the tree, which may or may not be considered as forest according to local provisions. Tree cover is estimated using unsupervised fuzzy c-means methods with the stability check to ensure the presence of the same spectral classes in independent tests. Spectral classes are classified into two categories: tree cover and other by employing k-nearest neighbours. Such approach does not require high quality sample data and does not include user defined internal parameters of the algorithms (however, they can be specified if needed). The best overall accuracy achieved for year 2014 was 94.2% with producer's accuracy 98.7% (tree cover), 90.5% (other land cover), user's accuracy 90.0% (tree cover), 98.8% (other land cover) and kappa 0.89. Consistency studies showed high impact (within 10% of overall accuracy) of unique conditions during the image acquisition. Some of the spectral classes represent borderline case between relatively dense tree cover and other land cover types like sparse young stands. Those cases are the main threat to the consistency between the results of different dates and seasons.

T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring land use/land cover (LULC) changes is important in making effective decisions in landscape planning and management. Quantifying the changing pattern of land helps us to understand how ecological impacts reveal and affect ecosystem services. The changes in landscapes can be assessed in different qualitative and quantitative ways. One of the aims of this study is to classify land cover using object-based image analysis and quantify the changes of landscape patterns by applying landscape metrics in the Efeler district, an urban settlement of Aydin province, during the 25 years from 1986 to 2011. In this context, a combination of satellite imagery, geographic information systems (GIS), and landscape metrics was used. A Spot-1 image dated 1986 and a Worldview Ortoready pan-sharpened satellite image dated 2011 were respectively processed for LULC classification. Six classes of land use including agriculture, bare soil, built environment, forest, main road, and river were identified. According to the overall accuracy assessment of the 2 classified images, the accuracy values were computed as 85.6% (for the LULC map dated 1986) and 89.8% (for the LULC map dated 2011). Change-detection results showed that during the whole study period there was a remarkable increase in the built environment and the main road, while bare soil decreased dramatically. It is also interesting that although urban expansion increased, the total area of agricultural land remained almost the same. The location of the agricultural land changed notably, but the percentage of this area was unchanged. Within the boundary of urban settlement, agricultural areas, and especially olive orchards, were fragmented due to the developmental strategies of Aydin. Within the scope of change-detection analysis, degradation of olive orchards was highlighted. Heterogeneous structure and fragmented patterns of land cover were analyzed using several metrics at different levels.

AB  - The results of researches presented in article were obtained within implementation of the scientific and technical program for program-targeted financing of applied scientific research on space activities for 2018-2020 by the Aerospace Committee of the Ministry of Defense and Aerospace Industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Considering the high production significance of soil resources for Kazakhstan as the main means of production, soil fertility assessment, methods of rational use of land resources is estimated as a priority scientific direction. The article shows the application of the remote sensing (RS) data and GIS-technologies for the assessment of the soil fertility of the main soils types in Northern Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is the ninth biggest country in the world, the production resource of arable lands takes more than 18.3 million hectares. Operational assessment of such data is possible only with use of RS methods. Kazakhstan, having own space system of ERS, has the powerful tool for effective management of land resources, operative and reliable monitoring of agricultural production and economic activity. It is established that the pre-sowing content of basic nutrients on the main soil types have the considerable impact on development of cultural plants biomass which is registered by satellites through vegetation indices. On the basis of empirical dependencies using the universal equation by reporting year the particular dependence of significance of some soil nutrients with derivates of vegetation indices according to the RS data is revealed. Results of space monitoring and also the confirmed ground-truth observations noted high anthropogenic influence on the leading soil-forming processes, high coefficient of familiarity of agricultural grounds and the developing processes of soil cover degradation in Northern Kazakhstan.

AB  - Healthcare professionals have limited formal end-of-life care training despite the large proportion of hospital deaths. A retrospective review of 201 acute hospital deaths revealed 166 (82.6%) had documentation to suggest the patient was dying but this was performed late with a median time between documentation and death of 0.84 days. Furthermore, 132 (66%) patients received an intervention in the final 48 h of life. This highlights the need to improve the recognition and management of dying patients in acute hospitals.

TI  - A Comprehensive Analysis on Abundance, Distribution, and Bionomics of Potential Malaria Vectors in Mannar District of Sri Lanka.
T2  - Malaria research and treatment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: A detailed knowledge of the distribution of the malaria vectors in Mannar district of Sri Lanka has not been studied after 1927. Past records indicated the presence of only seven species of anophelines, namely, An. culicifacies, An. subpictus, An. barbirostris, An. peditaeniatus, An. nigerrimus, An. Jamesii, and An. maculatus. There have been many changes in terms of distribution of Anopheles in the district over time.METHODS: Entomological surveillance was conducted on a monthly basis, comprising indoor hand collection, window trap collection, cattle-baited net collection, cattle-baited hut collection, and larval survey from June 2010 to June 2012 in 12 study areas under three entomological sentinel sites. The relationship between seven abiotic variables of the breeding habitats was measured. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to determine the associations between climatic variables and anopheline densities.RESULTS: A total of 74,181 mosquitoes belonging to 14 Anopheles species were recorded. An. subpictus was the most predominant species from all techniques representing 92% (n=68,268) of the total anopheline collection. However, Anopheles culicifacies was not recorded from any site during the study period. Larval surveys identified 12 breeding habitat categories including waste water collections, lagoon water collections, and drains which were not recorded as breeding habitats by previous studies. The mean dissolved oxygen level of waste water collections was 3.45±0.15mg/l. The mean salinity and conductivity of lagoon water collections were 21105±1344mg/l and 34734±1974 mus/cm, respectively.CONCLUSION: The present study provides the updated knowledge on anopheline distribution and vector bionomics. Therefore, documentation of the current knowledge would be useful for learners and health authorities to design appropriate vector control measures in the prevention of reintroduction of malaria.

TI  - Role of lymphoscintigraphy and gamma probe guided intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy on minimally invasive surgical procedure in skin cancers
T2  - CUKUROVA MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: In this study, we aimed to determine the role of lymphoscintigraphy in patient management of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy.Materials and Methods: 25 skin cancer patients (16 malignant melanoma, 9 epidermoid carcinoma) were included in the study. Tc-99m Nanocolloid intradermal injection was applied to all patients on the day of operation. The projections of the sentinel lymph nodes on the skin were marked during preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. Patients were taken into operation after the marking. The lymph nodes with projections on the skin were detected by intraoperative gamma probe and excised. After removing all the sentinel nodes for histopathological examination, care was taken to reduce the residual radioactivity count in the bed, where sentinel lymph nodes were removed, to less than 10% of the activity of the most active activity of the resected node.Results: A total of 86 SLNs and 54 non-SLNs were surgically removed and all nodes were sent to the Department of Pathology for histopathological examination. Four patients had metastases in sentinel lymph nodes. These patients were reoperated under elective conditions for extensive surgery.Conclusion: Lymphatic mapping method with lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative gamma probe have a high specificity and sensitivity ratio and minimize the morbidity. This method was thought to be a routine procedure in malignant skin tumors because of its determination of micrometastases, eliminating possible metastasis pathways, staging and guiding adjuvant therapy.

TI  - "Ecological Efficiency" as a Value Criterion of the Sustainable Development Strategy
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The current legal frameworks of the Russian Federation, which intermediate socio-natural relations, may contradict the course set towards sustainable development due to their dependence on the formerly dominant technocratic view of the world leading to various systemic destructions. Not always do the quantitative indicators contribute to finding the best way of environmental-economic development. In this connection, the issue of a high-quality assessment of the effectiveness of strategies, plans, and other regulatory and legal documents in achieving sustainable development goals is analyzed. This paper considers the "ecological efficiency" assessment of the legislation as a value criterion measuring the relevance of the planning and strategic documents to the essence of sustainable development. The paper aims to expose the essence of the "ecological efficiency" concept and its role in the harmonization mechanism for socio-natural relationships. The dialectical method, which determines interconnections between the values existing earlier and the character of socio-natural development on the one hand, and the emerging environmental ethics-based comprehensive worldview and sustainable development on the other, was used as the primary research instrument. Research results showed the existing potential for the use of "ecological efficiency" as a value criterion to assess the relevance of state plans and strategies to the declared sustainable development goals. "Ecological efficiency" helps to resolve the current contradictions in social development management thus contributing to the formation of the sustainable development legislation relevant to the level of public consciousness and behavior.

TI  - Salinization information extraction model based on VI-SI feature space combinations in the Yellow River Delta based on Landsat 8 OLI image
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The interference of soil salt content, vegetation, and other factors greatly constrain soil salinization monitoring via remote sensing techniques. However, traditional monitoring methods often ignore the vegetation information. In this study, the vegetation indices-salinity indices (VI-SI) feature space was utilized to improve the inversion accuracy of soil salinity, while considering the bare soil and vegetation information. By fully considering the surface vegetation landscape in the Yellow River Delta, twelve VI-SI feature spaces were constructed, and three categories of soil salinization monitoring index were established; then, the inversion accuracies among all the indices were compared. The experiment results showed that remote sensing monitoring index based on MSAVI-SI1 with SDI2 had the highest inversion accuracy (R-2 = 0.876), while that based on the ENDVI-SI4 feature space with SDI1 had the lowest (R-2 = 0.719). The reason lied in the fact that MSAVI fully considers the bare soil line and thus effectively eliminates the background influence of soil and vegetation canopy. Therefore, the remote sensing monitoring index derived from MSAVI-SI1 can greatly improve the dynamic and periodical monitoring of soil salinity in the Yellow River Delta.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE 11th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)

AB  - The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing system has become one of the most important tools for the acquisition of modern remote sensing data. The map generated by UAV remote sensing images is expected to be widely used in resource monitoring, post-disaster reconstruction and so on. Tile cache is an important way to speed up real-time loading of tile map. In order to accelerate the tile loading of UAV map, we take advantage of data locality principle and user behavior to build Hilbert coding index for each level in the tile pyramid. Then, we propose a neighborhood prefetching cache strategy, which is analyzed from the two dimensions of width and depth on the basis of Hilbert coding index. Compared with a simple strategy taking single tile as cache granularity, this caching strategy improves cache hit ratio and reduces average response time of tiles significantly. Meanwhile, Redis as the cache database, which not only supports the persistence of memory data, but also has the advantages of high development efficiency and strong scalability.

TI  - Remote sensing monitoring of green-up dates in the Xilingol grasslands of northern China and their correlations with meteorological factors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The grassland vegetation green-up date helps to initiate the start of grassland grazing and is an important scientific issue in grassland phenology research. This study examined green-up in the Xilingol grasslands of northern China. A double logistic function was used to reconstruct a time series of Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre Vegetation (SPOT Vegetation) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from 1999 to 2012. The dynamic threshold method was used to monitor the green-up date via remote sensing. The study found that green-up dates occurred between early April and mid-May in most areas. Sample plots indicated that 68% of ground monitoring results were consistent with the remotely sensed green-up date. The root mean square error of the green-up date measured via remote sensing was 8.7days. The results are summarized as follows. (1) The green-up date of temperate desert grassland usually occurred around the first half of April but could be quite variable (standard deviation=28.65days). The green-up date of temperate grassland usually occurred in mid- to late April, and was somewhat variable (standard deviation=18.45days). The green-up date of temperate meadow grassland usually occurred in late April or early May with little variability (standard deviation=12.97days). (2) Linear trend analyses showed that only 13.9% of the pixels exhibited significant changes over the 14-year time series. However, the linear trend increased from the southeast to the northwest, with 57% of pixels demonstrating earlier green-up. Across the region, the linear trend exhibited an average rate of change of - 1.5days 10year(-1). In addition, we discuss correlations between green-up dates and meteorological factors at eight meteorological stations and analyse partial correlation coefficients between green-up dates and meteorological factors. The correlations measured at seven meteorological stations were statistically significant (p<0.05). The average correlative value of deterministic factors was 0.54. The partial correlation coefficients between green-up date and temperature prior to seedling establishment were negative at five stations, but this relationship was significant at only three stations. Partial correlation coefficients between green-up date and precipitation prior to seedling establishment were negative at all eight stations, of which five relationships were significant.

TI  - A fuzzy semantic spatial partitioning model of regions and applications in understanding remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The division of the internal structure and external space of geographical entities is the premise of the analysis of topological relations and directional relations. Currently, most division methods are crisp, which does not conform to human cognitive habits. Occasionally, users want to integrate their meaning by vague natural language when they understand spatial scenarios; however, natural language suffers from uncertainty due to the effects of individual characteristics and the context of environmental factors. To handle uncertainties in spatial conceptions of regional features, the semantic spatial partitioning model for regions based on computing with words is proposed. The structure of a region is divided into several parts using fuzzy logic according to people's cognitive habits, and then, a detailed direction model of regions is proposed. The proposed method is applied to understand a remote sensing dataset, and the results show that the proposed method can enrich the understanding of images while conforming to human cognitive habits.

AB  - Lake ice phenology are considered as a sensitive indicator of global warming. In Tibetan Plateau (TP), differences exist in identifying lake ice phenology using remote sensing data because of the limited ground observation and difference in the sources of remote sensing and the available algorithms. In this study, four methods based on different remote sensed data (MODIS reflectance data, snow product, land surface temperature data, and microwave data) were used to identify the lake ice phenology of 18 lakes in the TP from 2002 to 2015. Lake ice duration was longer from the south to the north, and the highest consistency is occurred in monitoring the completely ice-covering duration. Temperature plays a greater role among several climatic-environmental elements. The lake ice period was shortened in the northeastern part of the TP, and extended in the middle and northern part.

AB  - The Gaofen-3 satellite is a polarimetric SAR working in C band with high SAR imaging resolution. Moreover, it is also the first C band remote sensing satellite designed up to 8 years life. The active phased antenna of the SAR is capable of scanning in two principal planes. The antenna array is composed of four panels and 24 modules totally. The reliability design and evaluations of corresponding tests about satellite are introduced in this paper. By using main malfunction analysis, the reliability evaluation pattern and method are proposed. Through reliability validation, the ground experiment results are obtained. The orbiting reliability life is also obtained according to the reliability evaluation of the space-borne phased array antenna. In addition, the proposed method provides a significant guideline for reliability design of AESA.

AB  - The Arctic region and the Antarctic region, as the two-polar regions of the earth, are sensitive to the global change to be the research focus. However, the existing earth observing system satellite data in the two-polar regions of the earth is not enough. The Moon is the unique natural satellite of the earth, which has advantages of global-scale coverage and long observation time. Therefore, the moon-based platform turns out to be a potential platform to comprehensively and continuously observe the Earth on a global scale, especially for the contrastive study of the Earth two-polar regions. Moreover, comparing to the limited life of the current satellites, the longevity of the moon is helpful to collect long-term time series data, which makes it possible to research long-term earth science phenomena in the two-polar regions. This paper comparatively analyzes the angular coverage performance of the two-polar regions of the earth observed from the moon-based platform. The observation angles of long-period 40 years through the geometry model of the moon-based platform from different sensor locations on the moon are calculated. The sensors are set on four potential sites on the moon--- the North Pole, the South Pole, the Sinus Iridum area and the Mare Nectaris area. When the two-polar regions of the earth are observed from four different locations on the moon, the different observation angular characteristics are obtained. This is helpful for the site selection of the moon-based platform.

AB  - Meander bends are rarely symmetric in the streamwise direction. Instead, they tend to show a preferred skewing, with the apex either pointing upstream (upstream-skewed) or downstream (downstream-skewed). There are theoretical reasons for both planform morphologies, and both can be seen in the field. Here we focus on skewing in cutoffs versus skewing in the main channel bends, and consider reaches that generally display neck cutoffs rather than chute cutoffs. In order to avoid the effects of human interference, we have selected five natural reaches, from various places around the world, which are in remote locations with negligible engineering works. We use Landsat images and Google Earth Pro to extract planform data for our study reaches. In total, 936 channel bends and 144 cutoffs have been evaluated. The percentage upstream skewed (PUS) among bends and cutoffs is estimated as 50.8% and 84.4%, respectively. The results indicate that while upstream-and downstream-skewed bends are found with nearly equal frequency in freely meandering channels, single-bend cutoff loops are strongly biased toward upstream-skewing.

TI  - Fast and Accurate Super-Resolution of FY-2 Infrared Cloud Images via Multi-Scale Fusion Network
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an effective method to improve the spatial resolution of FengYun-2 (FY-2) infrared cloud images via deep convolutional neural networks. The proposed model consists of four parts: shallow feature representation block, stacked multi-scale fusion blocks, global feature fusion block, and feature reconstruction block. The multi-scale fusion block combines dilated convolution, local feature fusion and local residual learning to extract multi-scale local features from the original low-resolution image directly. Then these local features are all merged by the global feature fusion block to reconstruct the residual representations in high-resolution space. For training and testing, we have specially built a dataset of infrared cloud images. We evaluated the proposed method both on simulated and real data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves improved reconstruction accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the concise structure of the proposed model enables it to be applicable in practice.

AB  - A revised RTM-based algorithm was developed coupled with the classification of land cover types. The study area was near Cedar Island National Wildlife Reserve, North Carolina, USA. A cloud-covered Sentinel-2A image of 1000 (rows) x 1000 (columns) acquired on 2 February 2017 was studied. The area was classified into three land cover types of vegetation, bare soil, and water. The assumption that the linear relationship of the TOA reflectance of any two visible bands was independent of the terrain types in the RTM-based algorithm was not valid. Thus, the impact of the land cover types on the algorithm was analyzed. The cloud-removal algorithm should be separately developed based on each land cover type removing the clouds in each land cover type accordingly. This assessment was evidenced by the spatial correlation coefficients of the cloud-covered image and the cloud-free reference image, of the cloud-removed image using the revised RTM-based algorithm and the reference image, and of the cloud-removed image using the original RTM-based algorithm and the reference image. The revised algorithm was not only effective in the removal of thin clouds land cover type-by-cover type but also outperformed the original RTM-based algorithm.

The first technique utilizes the Gabor wavelet at multiple orientations and scales, where maximum magnitude over all orientation in each scale is taken to create features of two multitemporal satellite images. The second technique applies canonical correlation analysis (CCA) on the combination of original multispectral bands and extracted local neighborhood information from all the bands. Next, the difference feature vectors obtained from individual techniques are fused to generate the final feature vectors. Furthermore, to get the binary change map, fuzzy c-means clustering is applied on final extracted features. In this feature fusion, the local neighborhood information from Gabor wavelet kernel is combined with joint change information from group of pixels extracted by CCA to produce more discriminant features. Experiments conducted on optical satellite images, which are collected by two sensors of Landsat satellite, and it shows the better performance of the proposed technique compared to earlier stated techniques.

TI  - Histopathological and tumor characteristics associated with false negative axillary ultrasonography results in breast cancer
T2  - MEDICAL ULTRASONOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: As the false-negative rates of axillary ultrasonography (AUS) (21%-48%) are not optimal, the demand for axillary surgery remains even if AUS is negative. The aim of this study is to determine the histopathological and tumor characteristics associated with false-negative AUS results. Materials and methods: Patients with normal AUS were divided into two groups as true-negative and false-negative according to the histopathology results of axillary lymph nodes. Two groups were compared in terms of age, histological grade of the primary tumor, histological size of the primary tumor, histological type, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and ultrasonography BI-RATS classification of the primary tumor. The number of metastatic lymph nodes, size of the largest metastatic lymph node and the number of micrometastatic lymph nodes were also noted in the false-negative group. Results: There were 152 patients with normal preoperative AUS in the study group. The false-negative AUS rate was 20.4%. The incidence of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and the mean tumor size was significantly-greater in the false-negative group. Micrometastasis was present in 3 patients (3/31, 9.6%), the mean of the largest metastatic lymph nodes was 12.5 mm, the mean total number of malignant lymph nodes was 1.9 in the false-negative group. In 25/31 (80.6%) of the patients, there were less than or equal to 2 metastatic lymph nodes. The presence of WI was higher in the false-negative group. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the other parameters. Conclusion: Before stating that the axilla is normal on ultrasonography, a careful evaluation should be made in patients with a mass >2 cm in size and/or ILC diagnosis.

TI  - USING REMOTE SENSING IN DETECTING SUGAR BEET FIELDS TREATED WITH DIFFERENT DOSES OF PHOSPHORUS
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, the use of remote sensing technology in agricultural applications is increasing rapidly. It allows determining the amount of the fertilizer required in an agricultural field and detecting fertilizer requirements, which are among the most significant factors affecting plant development, and its terrestrial components. Depending on the amount and type of the fertilizer used, the spectral signatures of plant leaves can be evaluated by remote sensing data. In the present study, it was aimed to determine the impact of the difference in the phosphorus amount used in the sugar beet plant on the reflectance of the plant. In this context, 3 different areas were identified in the study field. Sugar beet was planted in these areas by applying different doses ranging from 0 kg P ha(-1), 150 kg P ha(-1) to 300 kg P ha(-1). Spectroradiometer measurements were carried out simultaneously with Landsat 8 satellite transition (satellite image dated 17.09.2017) for obtaining the spectral signatures of the sugar beet treated with different doses of phosphorus when the plants were grown to 5 months old. The Matched Filtering (MF) algorithm was used as a spectral classification in which spectroradiometer measurements of the sugar beet were used as a reference endmember in order to detect different phosphorus groups. Furthermore, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was applied to the satellite image to compare the MF result. According to the results of MF and the NDVI which are coherent with each other, it was concluded that sugar beets in three different dosing areas were correctly identified in different classes.

TI  - Investigating Surface Water Pollution by Integrated Remotely Sensed and Field Spectral Measurement Data: A Case Study
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality assessment using remote sensing and its terrestrial components is carried out in short time for larger areas. Another issue that is as important regarding water availability is access to quality water. It is important to investigate the availability of the analysis of remotely sensed data instead of environmental and chemical analysis that determines water quality and usability. To examine the detection of water qualities without taking water samples in situ, spectral library data was used in the Hafik Region. In this context we used spectral measurement data of water samples previously taken from Imranli, where the Kizilirmak River originates, and used for spectral classification of water quality. Matched filtering was used for integrating spectral data and CHRIS Proba image as the spectral classification method. To conduct an accuracy analysis, chemical oxygen demand measurement was carried out at 10 points determined as 1st and 2nd water quality in the study area on the river and lakes according to the Ministry of the Environment and Urbanization. The overall accuracy of the classification was calculated as 70%. The results of this study have shown the importance of spectral classification of satellite imagery in evaluating water quality and monitoring water resources.

AB  - In-season crop yield estimation has various applications such as the farmer taking corrective measures to increase the yield, optimizing the supply-demand chain of fertilizers, pesticides and agricultural commodities, price prediction and determining the risk levels in agriculture insurance. Crop yield estimation models based on remote sensed satellite data and weather data have been widely adopted as do not require specific information about the crop and farming practices and hence are scalable across crops, growing locations and conditions. In this paper, we present a case study of weather and soil data based yield estimation modeling for paddy crop at different spatial resolution (SR) levels, namely, at the district (coarser SR) and taluk (finer SR) levels in India. We provide a detailed analysis of accuracy of the yield estimation models across varied sets of features and different machine learning (ML) techniques. Further, we perform dis-aggregation of district yield data by applying the machine learning models trained using district level data to predict yields at taluk level. Taluk level yield prediction by dis-aggregation of district level data has average error of 6% and maximum error of 25%.

AB  - Spatial Information about Soil moisture over agricultural crops are required for efficient irrigation which in turn helps in saving water and increases crop yield. Soil moisture also useful in prediction of flooded and drought regions. However field measurement of soil moisture is not a practical approach. The main objective of the study is to track soil moisture variation all along the maize growth period in a Semi-Arid region. There are only few studies carried out on soil moisture variation considering whole maize growing period. During the crop growing period soil moisture field investigation are conducted in synchronization with Satellite pass. Sentinel-1a Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) satellite, Interferometric wide swath dual polarized data with 5.405 GHz frequency and central incidence angle of 23 degrees with repeat period of 12 days was used in this study. All in all during growth period 6 satellite pass scenes are acquired and processed by standard procedure using Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software. An attempt was made to redeem surface soil moisture for the whole maize growing crop cycle using water cloud model. The whole period of maize crop was divided into 3 parts like seedling, growing and harvesting period and soil moisture is retrieved for each period. The estimated soil moisture was validated with 30 field measured soil moisture samplings. The correlation coefficient of retrieved and actual soil moisture of seedling, growing and harvesting periods are 0.77, 0.72 and 0.6 respectively. The output of this study will be helpful in formulating strategies for irrigation water management.

AB  - Although the English language - the modern lingua franca - is officially considered to be an international language of business, science, tourism, aviation, new media technologies and other social spheres, in recent years more and more people in the world, especially the younger generation, are focusing their particular attention on studying Mandarin Chinese.Mandarin, being the language of government and education in China and Taiwan, is based on the Beijing dialect, but not completely associated with it. It is known as a standard language that everyone can understand and communicate with. Mandarin Chinese is spoken by over 800 million people around the world, and it is one of the six official languages at the United Nations.In Russian Federation in 2019 Mandarin Chinese has officially become one of the state exams in foreign languages which school leavers may choose to take when finishing their secondary school education. Thus, in modern Russia more and more young people become interested in Mandarin Chinese L2 acquisition for their different reasons or motives.In our research we pay a particular attention to the analysis of the young individuals' motivation of studying Mandarin based on the example of Russian university students who have already been learning this language for a few years. Our working hypothesis is that students' motivation to acquire Mandarin Chinese is not only based on China's fast-growing economy and business perspectives for foreigners in this country. But it can also be explained by young people's worldview and by mental changes which are taking place in their consciousness today. As one student said: "I am ready to completely change my life, to go to China, live and study there for a while, and then return back to Russia to teach Chinese" [1]. Our second working hypothesis suggests that Mandarin Chinese L2 acquisition affects university students' consciousness because (as a Soviet psychologist Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky once mentioned) "consciousness of the individual is not a static or fixed one, but the consciousness of an evolving, spiritually growing person who is committing an effort and work on his development and spiritual liberation" [2]. Therefore, studying Mandarin Chinese transforms students' mind in a more "oriental" way, by easternizing their mentality.In order to better understand the true motives which make young people study this language and their specific interest in China, we developed and conducted a special survey, interviewed university students of three higher education institutions (Moscow State Pedagogical University; RUDN university (Moscow) and South Ural State Humanitarian Pedagogical University (Chelyabinsk)) and did a qualitative and quantitative data analysis. In the end, a group of motives of studying Mandarin Chinese among Russian university students was identified and presented in the research. Based on the data analyzed we also managed to build a model of young people's consciousness perception of Mandarin Chinese language as well as traditional and modern Chinese culture.

TI  - Reflectance-based Model for Soybean Mapping in United States at Common Land Unit Scale with Landsat 8
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to validate the feasibility of a reflectance-based model for soybean crop area classification in advance of the county scale statistics from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). This classification method is named Reflectance-based North American Model (RNAM). It operates through the analysis of the main physically driven characteristics of farm fields and their specific radiometric profile obtained from Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat 8. The state area of Illinois/US was selected because it is the largest soybean producer and accounted for nearly 35 percent of the total soybeans production in US. Farm fields within a set of 32 counties were analyzed for six crop years between 2013 to 2018. Results obtained from RNAM were compared to official estimates of USDA at county level. Coefficients R-2 ranged between 0.92 and 0.96, indicating good agreement of the estimates. Results from RNAM were also validated with the geospatial reference map Cropland Data Layer (CDL) of soybeans from USDA. The overall map accuracy found was 93.86% with Kappa Index of Agreement of 0.795. Thus, RNAM was considered able to provide timely thematic soybean maps, in late September, in advance of the county scale statistics from USDA.

AB  - We consider the change in the modern world, in which information culture becomes the most important factor in the formation of a personality. As a priority, the problem of a person security in the information space and the related issues of the prospects for its further development are indicated. The authors point to the fundamental ambivalence of information and communication interaction and its results. It is argued that the transformation of the modern world leads to a change in the basic meaningful worldview elements, what can lead to a change in the most important social practices. It is emphasized that the personal information security concept has a wider meaning in modern times, because it includes the problem of identity, the formation of new needs, the suppression of traditional values and the search for new patterns of behavior. The paper notes that the dynamic of interaction between worldview paradigms and communication processes in the Internet space leads to the creation of a new network culture, but at the same time, adaptive capabilities of a person still remain at a low level.

AB  - Recent satellites of the European Data Relay System (EDRS) are established with free-space optical ( FSO) terminals. Operational FSO links in space are commercially available. Links between ALPHASAT or EDRS-A as GEO terminals and Sentinel LEO terminals are established with TRL 9. However laser links from the satellites through the atmosphere have a low Technical Readiness Level.Starting 2015 an Airborne Optical Communication (AOC) Demonstrator was developed by Hensoldt, which provides Air-to-Space unidirectional communication capabilities over approximately 40000 km distance (Geo orbit) at a data rate of 1.8 Gbit/s at a wavelength of 1064 nm with a laser power of approx. 15 W. The demonstrator was flown on an Airbus A310 aircraft. Successful links with user data streams from Tenerife to the GEO Alphasaat proved the function of AOC.

TI  - Economic losses caused by tree species proportions and site type errors in forest management planning
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate economic losses, which are caused by forest inventory errors of tree species proportions and site types. Our study data consisted of ground truth data and four sets of erroneous tree species proportions. They reflect the accuracy of tree species proportions in four remote sensing data sets, namely 1) airborne laser scanning (ALS) with 2D aerial image, 2) 2D aerial image, 3) 3D and 2D aerial image data together and 4) satellite data. Furthermore, our study data consisted of one simulated site type data set. We used the erroneous tree species proportions to optimise the timing of forest harvests and compared that to the true optimum obtained with ground truth data. According to the results, the mean losses of Net Present Value (NPV) because of erroneous tree species proportions at an interest rate of 3% varied from 124.4 (sic) ha(-1) to 167.7 (sic) ha(-1). The smallest losses were observed using tree species proportions predicted using ALS data and largest using satellite data. In those stands, respectively, in which tree species proportion errors actually caused economic losses, they were 468 (sic) ha(-1) on average with tree species proportions based on ALS data. In turn, site type errors caused only small losses. Based on this study, accurate tree species identification seems to be very important with respect to operational forest inventory.

M3  - Data study
AB  - Excessive sodium intake is a global risk factor for hypertension. Sodium effects on blood pressure vary from person to person; hence, high-risk group targeting based on personal genetic information can play a complementary role to ongoing population preventive approaches to reduce sodium consumption. To identify genetic factors that modulate sodium effects on blood pressure, we conducted a population-based genome-wide interaction analysis in 8,768 Japanese subjects, which was greater than 3 times larger than a similar previous study. We tested 7,135,436 polymorphisms in the discovery cohort, and loci that met suggestive significance were further examined in an independent replication cohort. We found that an interaction between a novel 3'-BCL11B gene desert locus and daily sodium consumption was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure in both discovery and replication cohorts under the recessive model. Further statistical analysis of rs8022678, the sentinel variant of the 3'-BCL11B gene desert locus, showed that differences in mean systolic blood pressure between high and low sodium consumption subgroups were 5.9 mm Hg (P = 8.8 * 10-12) in rs8022678 A carriers and -0.3 mm Hg (P = 0.27) in rs8022678 A non-carriers, suggesting that the rs8022678 genotype can classify persons into sodium-sensitive (A carriers) and sodium-insensitive (A non-carriers) subgroups. Our results implied that rs8022678 A carriers may receive a greater benefit from sodium-lowering interventions than non-carriers.

AB  - Recent geospatial technologies offer an infinite number of opportunities in the domain of land management and governance. This is due principally to the fact that new satellites allow the collection and monitoring of important information about soil, crops, weather, and climate. In this context, this chapter presents a review of studies conducted in three semi-arid plains in Morocco during the last two decades on the combined use of geospatial technologies, modelling tools, meteorological, and ground data to manage irrigated lands in semi-arid zones. The three studied regions are located in three different sites well distributed over the country. This chapter presents a simple and clear summary of what has been performed using geospatial technologies by Moroccan researchers to improve agricultural management in irrigated areas in Morocco. Such work could help policymakers in developing efficient land governance policies by taking into account the latest scientific results.

AB  - Due to the increasing amount of remotely sensed data, methods for its automatic interpretation become more and more important. Corresponding supervised learning techniques, however, strongly depend on the availability of training data, i.e. data where measurements and labels are provided simultaneously. The creation of reference data for large data sets is very challenging and approaches addressing this task often introduce a significant amount of label noise. While other works focused on the influence of label noise on the training process, this paper studies the impact on the evaluation and shows that the corresponding effects are even more adverse.

AB  - The Pearl River Estuary is a complex case-II waters, the adjacent coastal waters of Hong Kong consist of many diverse aquatic species as well as under adverse threat due to high pollution and sediment loads from the neighboring areas. Frequent algal blooms often referred as red tide, occur in various parts of Hong Kong's coastal areas. It is always challenging to measure Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) with accuracy in presence of high concentration of suspended solids (SS) and therefore difficult to detect algal blooms accurately in spatial domains. Land adjacency, shallow water, and small spatial area of bloom are also some factors limiting bloom detection in this region. However, Sentinel-2 MSI with red edge bands and with 10-20 m spatial resolution provides a new opportunity to monitor these sensitive and complex waters. This study presents a new evaluation of using red edge algorithm and C2RCC for estimating Chl-a; and red band algorithm and C2RCC for estimating SS using Sentinel-2 MSI data over the Pearl River Estuary and the coastal waters of Hong Kong. C2RCC-Nets method outperformed with coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.71 (RMSE 2.1 mu g/l) and R-2 = 0.73 (RMSE 2.4 mg/l) for estimating Chl-a and SS respectively. Thin slicks of red tide are detected in highly turbid Pearl River Estuary using MSI data. Results show that Sentinel-2 data can be used to estimate Chl-a and SS with high accuracy and thin red tide slick and red tide blooms can also be detected in presence of high concentration of SS.

TI  - Detection of old scattered windthrow using low cost resources. The case of Storm Xynthia in the Vosges Mountains, 28 February 2010
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Unlike the contiguous windthrows, the scattered windthrows occurring as a result of wind gusts of lower speed (100-140 km/h) than in the first case (>140 km/h) are much more difficult to detect due to their much smaller areas and due to their very large number (several hundred in the wooded Vosges Mountains). The objective of this research is to present a rapid procedure for the detection of the scattered windthrows based on low cost, Landsat type images, knowing that certain sensors cannot be accessed without significant investments. Our application is based on the study of effects caused by the Storm Xynthia in the Vosges Mountains in the North-East of France, on 28 February 2010. Thus, based on two sets of Landsat satellite images, we used the "dark object" approach and the Disturbance Index, as well as the image classification before and after the storm, resulting in a map of changes. Following the detection process, 257 scattered polygons were detected, totalling 229 ha. For validation purposes, high-resolution images and orthophotoplans taken before and after storm were used. The error matrix was calculated, achieving an overall accuracy of 86%, which confirmed the quality of our analysis and supported this procedure for detecting scattered windthrow based on low cost resources.

TI  - The incidence and associations of acute kidney injury in trauma patients admitted to critical care: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: As more patients are surviving the initial effects of traumatic injury clinicians are faced with managing the systemic complications of severe tissue injury. Of these, acute kidney injury (AKI) may be a sentinel complication contributing to adverse outcomes.OBJECTIVE: To establish the incidence of AKI in patients admitted to critical care after major trauma, to explore any risk factors and to evaluate the association of AKI with outcomes.DATA SOURCES: Systematic search of MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica database and Cochrane library from January 2004 to April 2018.STUDY SELECTION: Studies of adult major trauma patients admitted to critical care that applied consensus AKI criteria (risk injury failure loss end stage [RIFLE], AKI network, or kidney disease improving global outcomes) and reported clinical outcomeswere assessed (PROSPERO Registration: CRD42017056781). Of the 35 full-text articles selected from the screening, 17 (48.6%) studies were included.DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We followed the PRISMA guidelines and study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa score. The pooled incidence of AKI and relative risk of death were estimated using random-effects models.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of AKI was the primary outcome. The secondary outcome was study-defined mortality. RESULTS: We included 17 articles describing AKI outcomes in 24,267 trauma patients. The pooled incidence of AKI was 20.4%(95% confidence interval [CI], 16.5-24.9). Twelve studies reported the breakdown of stages of AKI with 55.7% of patients classified as RIFLE-R or stage 1, 30.3% as RIFLE-I or stage 2, and 14.0% as RIFLE-F or stage 3. The pooled relative risk of death with AKI compared was 3.6 (95% CI, 2.4-5.3). In addition, there was a concordant increase in odds of death among six studies that adjusted for multiple variables (adjusted odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.9-3.8; p = < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Acute kidney injury is common after major trauma and associated with increased mortality. Future research is warranted to reduce the potential for harm associated with this subtype of AKI. (J Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2019; 86: 141-147. Copyright (c) 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

TI  - Potential of Landsat spectral indices in regard to the detection of forest health changes due to drought effects
T2  - Journal of Forest Science (Prague)
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of climatic variability that has been increasing in last decades a higher drought risk seriously influences the forest vitality from regional to global scale. Despite there are of many studies that describe the spectral response of forest stands to the water stress, there is still a lack of information concerning the full understanding of forest reaction to the water deficiency over a longer time period. We hypothesize that the various severity and/or frequency of drought periods will result in different spectral responses of forest stands. The forest response was detected using two spectral vegetation indices (normalized difference moisture index - NDMI, wetness) which are widely used for the detection of forest health changes. These indices were calculated on the basis of Landsat (TM, ETM+ and OLI) imagery which includes 105 scenes from the 2005-2016 period. The area of our interest includes 300 forest stands (dominated with Norway spruce) in the Czech Republic, Moravia. These stands were identified as damaged by drought that occurred during the 2012-2017 period. To document the climatic water deficiency, two climatic indices were calculated (AWBPE, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index). Despite high correlation of both spectral indices, the NDMI has high sensitivity to the drought events. However, both indices significantly decreased in reaction to the drought events. In case of the 2012 drought event the decrease was one year delayed, probably due to the lower severity of drought effect. The both groups of spectral and climatic indices bring valuable information in regard to the description and understanding of drought effect on the spruce forest stands.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to assess the accuracy of various Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) from different open sources data. All the GDEMs were evaluated using GNSS Ground Control Point (GCP) and leveling height from mean sea level (Hmsl) at 45 benchmarks around Sabah and Sarawak. The overall vertical accuracy shows the TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM-X 90m) DEM consistent well with the Mean Sea Level height with Root mean Square Error (RMSE) of Shutter Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), TanDEM-X 90m, ALOS World 3D - 30m (AW3D30) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is +/- 4.721m,+/- 3.140m, +/- 4.207 and +/- 9.412m, respectively. However, the vertical accuracy for AW3D30 is found better than TanDEM-X 90m with RMSE of +/- 3.831m, followed by TanDEM-X 90m DEM, SRTM and ASTER when the evaluation is made with orthometric height derived from GNSS GCPs. In overall, TanDEM-X and AW3D30 can be considered the best GDEM for scientific studies in East of Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak).
