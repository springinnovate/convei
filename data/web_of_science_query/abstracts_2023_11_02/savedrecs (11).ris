TI  - Archetypal classification of vegetation dynamics of a humid subtropical forest region from North-East Argentina
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the aim of studying the primary productivity dynamics of subtropical forests with different degrees of intervention or change due to human intervention, we classify the ecosystems of an area in northeastern Argentina, corresponding to a humid subtropical region, according to their temporal variability. A 22-year time series, ranging from 2000 to 2022, of MODIS EVI was assembled into a spatiotemporal cube, and pixels were classified by an archetypal analysis applied to the frequency components of a Fourier power spectrum. Then the most representative pixels of this classification (archetypoids) were selected. A wavelet decomposition was performed on these archetypoids to identify temporal changes in the frequency composition of the time series, and an ARIMA model to identify changes in the noise pattern of the series. Finally, a distributed-lag model with meteorological variables, was applied to these time series to relate the dynamics of the archetypes to the local climate. A stepwise procedure using Gaussian processes for error and autocorrelation and multiple regressions to determine any univariate relationship between meteorological variables and EVI. The meteorological variables considered were temperature, rainfall, and potential evapotranspiration (PET). The procedure started with a null model with white noise, then Gaussian processes were gradually added to model the errors, and then the explanatory variables, which were filtered moving average time series of the meteorological variables. The interaction between the explanatory variables was assumed to be the minimum EVI of the predicted values of each variable according to Lieibig's law of minimum. The procedure was applied as the BIC decreased to find the optimal model. In this study area, three different archetypes were sufficient to describe most of the variability in the time series matrix. Archetype 1 was characterized by woody plantations of exotic species such as pines, yerba mate and tea, archetype 2 by native forests, and archetype 3 represented a mosaic of forests and agriculture/pasture. The analysis of climate and archetypes indicated that archetype 2 had the highest mean EVI values (i.e., primary productivity), followed by archetype 1 and lastly archetype 3. Also, it showed that all three archetypes responded to the same combination of climate variables (temperature and PET), with varying degrees of sensitivity to each variable. Archetype 2 was the least sensitive to changes in these variables, archetype 1 was more sensitive to PET, and archetype 3 was more sensitive to temperature, while also exhibiting the least response time.

TI  - P-Swin: Parallel Swin transformer multi-scale semantic segmentation network for land cover classification
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - With the recent development of remote sensing technology and deep learning, semantic segmentation methods have been increasingly used in land cover classification. However, this method is faced with the challenge of incomplete recognition caused by big differences in scale of ground objects. Owing to multi-head self-attention, the Swin Transformer Network (Swin) has a large receptive field at its shallow level, which is conducive to the identification of large-scale objects. However, Swin does not fully mine the context information of features, so it is easy to cause incomplete recognition. Based on Swin, we propose a parallel window-based Transformer Network, Parallel Swin Transformer Network (P-Swin). The core of P-Swin is a Parallel Swin Transformer Block (PST Block), which includes Window-based Self Attention Interaction (WSAI) and Feed Forward Network (FFN). WSAI can not only calculate the relationship within windows, but also establish the relationship between windows. Therefore, it improves the ability of network to obtain feature context information. P-Swin outperformed Swin and reached the highest level, with 76.42% mIoU for the test set in the ISPRS Potsdam 2D dataset (Swin: 75.95%), 65.13% mIoU for the test set in the Gaofen Image Dataset (Swin: 63.41%), and 64.61% mIoU for the test set in the WHDLD Dataset (Swin: 63.01%)

TI  - The effect of post-wildfire management practices on vegetation recovery: Insights from the Sapadere fire, Antalya, Turkiye
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-wildfire management actions mainly targeting the removal of salvage logs and burned trees is a common but controversial practice. Although it aims to regain some of the natural and economic value of a forest, it also requires disturbing burned areas, which may have some negative consequences affecting, for instance, the carbon cycle, soil erosion, and vegetation cover. Observations from different geographic settings contribute to this scientific debate, and yet, the spatiotemporal evolution of the post-fire road network developed as part of fire management practices and its influence on vegetation recovery has been rarely examined. Specifically, we still lack observations from Turkiye, though wildfires are a common event. This research examined the evolution of the vegetation cover in relation to post-fire road constructions and the resultant debris materials in areas affected by the 2017 Sapadere fire in Antalya, Turkiye. We used multi-sensor, multi-temporal optical satellite data and monitored the variation in both vegetation cover and road network from the pre-to post-fire periods between 2014 and 2021. Our results showed that fire management practices almost doubled the road network in the post-fire period, from 487 km to 900 km. Overall, 7% of the burned area was affected by these practices. As a result, vegetation cover in those areas shows only similar to 50% recovery, whereas undisturbed areas exhibit similar to 100% recovery 5 years after the event. Notably, such spatiotemporal analysis carried out for different burned areas would provide a better insight into the most suitable post-fire management practices. Our findings, in particular, show that the current practices need to be revisited as they cause a delay in vegetation recovery.

TI  - Risk assessment and management of vulnerable areas to flash flood hazards in arid regions using remote sensing and GIS-based knowledge-driven techniques
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation from space has allowed characterizing, detecting, and managing natural hazards in spatiotemporal scale. Flash flood is the most frequent natural disaster that causes destruction to human lives, the economy, and infrastructure. Thus, developing a flash flood hazard zone (FFHZ) map is significant for comprehensive flash flood risk assessment and management to minimize its harmful effects, particularly in residential areas, because of climate change. Therefore, in this article, ten parameters derived from satellite images, including lithology, slope, topographic wetness index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), Stream Transport Index (STI), Terrain Roughness Index (TRI), drainage density (Dd), distance to river, radar intensity map, and rainfall distribution map, were fused to predict the flood-vulnerable areas through GIS-based overlay analysis after normalization and assigning weight by applying Analytical Hierarchy Analysis (AHP). The findings allowed for the identification of the most vulnerable areas and provided an explanation for the flood's effects on New Qena City (NQC). The output FFHZs of the Wadi Qena Basin (WQB) were divided into six hazard zones, i.e., extreme hazard (6.86%), very strong (15.04%), strong (18.74%), moderate (22.58%), low (22.80%), and very low (13.98%) susceptibility. Furthermore, approximately 35% of the under-construction NQC is subject to the extreme to very serious hazards, as opposed to the extension area to NQC east of the Qena-Safaga Road. Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) change detection coherence (CCD) and spatiotemporal analysis of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data revealed steady changes in vegetation and infrastructure from 1984 to present. Based on GIS analyses about 10, and 14% of the NQC can be inundated if the flood extends 500, and 1000 m around the flood canal, respectively. Thus, several strategies were advised to safeguard the development projects, particularly the residential sections of the under construction NQC, including erecting four dams with a total capacity of 300 million m(3), reinforce the dam at Wadi Shahadein, constructing concrete chevron bunds along the flood zone, and extending the depths of the flooding canal.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY VIOLENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeIntimate partner violence (IPV) victim advocates are exposed daily to the traumas of their clients, including the potential exposure to an intimate partner homicide (IPH). While research has examined the effects of daily secondary exposure to IPV on victim advocates, little is known about the specific effect of IPH. This study examined how the IPH of a client affected advocates' perception of and approach to their work.MethodsNine advocates were recruited from the northeastern U.S. and interviewed about their experience of the IPH of a client. Advocate interviews were analyzed using The Listening Guide Analysis which systematically isolates and listens to the different, and often contradictory, voices that a participant uses.ResultsExposure to IPH changed participants' perception of their role, how they defined client, and how they interacted with future clients. At a macro-level, the IPH of a client motivated advocates to advance changes in agency protocol, multisector responses, and state policy based on what they had learned from the IPH. Opportunities to translate shifts in their worldview into tangible changes to protocol and policy were critical to advocate adjustment after the IPH.ConclusionsIn order to support advocates after IPH, organizations should acknowledge the potentially transformative effect of IPH and create opportunities for meaning making to assist in advocate adjustment. It is imperative for advocacy organizations to support their employees to prevent advocate burnout and the loss of experienced staff, and to continue to provide effective services to vulnerable members of their communities after IPH.

TI  - Temporal patterns and causal drivers of aboveground plant biomass in a coastal wetland: Insights from time-series analyses
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes play a crucial role in coastal biogeochemical cycles and provide unique ecosystem services. Salt marsh biomass, which can strongly influence such services, varies over time in response to hydrologic conditions and other environmental drivers. We used gap-filled monthly observations of Spartina alterniflora aboveground biomass derived from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite imagery from 1984-2018 to analyze temporal patterns in biomass in comparison to air temperature, precipitation, river discharge, nutrient input, sea level, and drought index for a southeastern US salt marsh. Wavelet analysis and ensemble empirical mode decomposition identified month to multi-year periodicities in both plant biomass and environmental drivers. Wavelet coherence detected cross-correlations between annual biomass cycles and precipitation, temperature, river discharge, nutrient concentrations (NOx and PO43-) and sea level. At longer periods we detected coherence between biomass and all variables except precipitation. Through empirical dynamic modeling we showed that temperature, river discharge, drought, sea level, and river nutrient concentrations were causally connected to salt marsh biomass and exceeded the confounding effect of seasonality. This study demonstrated the insights into biomass dynamics and causal connections that can be gained through the analysis of long-term data.

TI  - Localizing and prioritizing roof greening opportunities for urban heat island mitigation: insights from the city of Krefeld, Germany
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextClimate change may increase the frequency, intensity, and occurrence of urban heat islands (UHI) in cities worldwide, often with harmful impacts on citizens. Strategic planning and implementation of multifunctional green roofs promises to help mitigating UHI effects, but cities often lack up-to-date scientific understanding of best-suited locations.ObjectivesThe aim of this paper is to develop and apply a socio-ecological approach to explore and prioritize present and prospective opportunity spaces for roof greening based on remote sensing data to mitigate UHI effects.MethodsThe city of Krefeld, Germany, serves as a case study. The research design consists of three steps, applied to the conditions of 2019 and a 2030 scenario: (i) Examining residents' vulnerability to heat, (ii) Assessing existing green roofs and potentials for greening, and (iii) Prioritizing opportunity spaces for roof greening to reduce UHI effects.ResultsFindings showed that the area of high vulnerability due to combined high heat exposures and densities of sensitive residents in Krefeld accounts for almost 300 hectares in 2019 and may triple until 2030. More than 90% of evaluated horizontal roofs have no vegetation cover. Highest priority for roof greening is attributed to 59 ha and 113 ha of roofs in 2019 and 2030, respectively.ConclusionsThe findings can inform strategic roof greening efforts for climate adaptation, e.g. for the extension of cadasters, and facilitate communication to increase understandings, public and policy support, and implementation.

TI  - Epidemiological and clinical characterization of a population-based cohort of cutaneous malignant melanoma patients in the South Region of Portugal
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - An historical population-based cohort study was conducted aiming to estimate the incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma in the South Region of Portugal between Jan 2016 and June 2017; to clinically characterize the diagnosed individuals; to describe instituted treatment; and to estimate survival outcomes. Data were extracted from a cancer registry (ROR-Sul) covering 4,800,000 inhabitants (46% of the Portuguese population) and included a total of 789 individuals meeting eligibility criteria. The crude incidence rate (18 months) of melanoma was 13.36/100,000 inhabitants and the Age-Standardized Incidence Rate per 100,000 World population was 9.65/100,000 inhabitants. The most common histological subtypes identified were superficial extension, followed by malignant melanoma and nodular melanoma. Most cases were diagnosed in stage I (50.39%), equally distributed by sex and with a median age of 65 years. During the study period, 174 recurrence events were recorded (23.45%) and recurrence-free survival rate was significantly lower in more advanced stages. Patients had a two-fold risk of recurrence/death when in presence of ulcerated tumors [adjusted hazard ratio (adj HR)=2.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40-3.70]. Overall survival rate at 3-years was 80.54% (95% CI 77.58-83.15), higher than previous national reports, and considerably higher for individuals diagnosed at earlier stages (p<0.001). We have also identified differential survival outcomes in stages II-III explained by the uptake of sentinel lymph node biopsy. The epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of malignant melanoma patients studied are consistent with international literature. The incidence and rates observed suggests additional public health campaigns are needed to modify behaviours of the Portuguese population and thus reduce their risk.

TI  - Field-scale dynamics of planting dates in the US Corn Belt from 2000 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop planting dates are a dynamic feature of agricultural systems that respond to short-and long-term climate signals, crop and cultivar selection, and technology changes. Planting date records are essential for yield gap analyses, accurate crop modeling, and tracking farmer adaptations to weather and climate change. Although planting dates have high variation at local scales due to heterogeneity in farm resources and decision-making, available long-term data on planting dates are largely restricted to aggregated regional statistics or, at best, satellite-derived datasets with limited spatiotemporal extent and at resolutions unable to distinguish individual fields. Here, we generated retrospective annual field-scale (30 m) planting date maps for both maize and soy-beans spanning 2000-2020 across a 12-state region in the United States Corn Belt based on Landsat satellite data and a large ground sample of over 28,000 maize and soybean fields. Using training data from 2015 to 2020 for model selection, we found that planting date predictions improved with harmonic regression of Landsat data and additional annual weather covariates. The preferred random forest model approximately doubled performance compared to a null model based on state median planting dates, capturing 47% of field-level variation for maize (mean absolute error, MAE = 7.4 days) and 44% for soybeans (MAE = 7.5 days) against held-out ground truth test data for 2008-2014. We also evaluated the full 2000-2020 dataset with state agricultural statistics, finding strong agreement with median planting dates for maize (R-2 = 0.76, MAE = 4.4 days) and slightly lower agreement for soybeans (R-2 = 0.65, MAE = 5.4 days) when aggregated to the state level. We then used this new dataset to analyze environmental determinants of planting dates at a finer-scale than previously possible, con-trolling for unobserved variation at the sub-state district level. We found that during 2000-2020, each standard deviation increase in early-season rainfall delayed planting by similar to 2.5 days, and fields with higher soil productivity ratings tended to be planted earlier. We did not find meaningful trends over the last two decades in planting dates for maize or soybeans, in contrast to trends towards earlier planting dates late last century and predicted for this period in climate adaptation studies. We hypothesize increases in early season rainfall or persisting early -season frost risks may have inhibited these shifts towards earlier planting. Remotely sensed planting dates will be a useful tool for yield gap analyses, crop simulation modeling, and ongoing assessment of climate adaptation.

T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) promises breakthroughs in space operations, from mission design planning to satellite data processing and navigation systems. Advances in AI and space transportation have enabled AI technologies in spacecraft tracking control and synchronization. This study assesses and evaluates three alternative spacecraft tracking control and synchronization (TCS) approaches, including non-AI TCS methods, AI TCS methods, and combined TCS methods. The study proposes a hybrid model, including a new model for defining weight coefficients and interval type-2 fuzzy sets based combined compromised solution (IT2FSs-CoCoSo) to solve the spacecraft TCS problem. A new methodology is used to calculate the weight coefficients of criteria, while IT2FSs-CoCoSo is applied to rank the prioritization of TCS methods. A comparative analysis is conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed hybrid model. We present a case study to illustrate the applicability and exhibit the efficacy of the proposed method for prioritizing the alternative TCS approaches based on ten different sub-criteria, grouped under three main aspects, including complexity aspects, operational aspects, and efficiency aspects. AI and non-AI methods combined are the most advantageous alternative, whereas non-AI methods are the least advantageous, according to the findings of this study. (c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - The efficacy of <i>Steinernema feltiae</i> in the control of <i>Cydia pomonella</i> in organic apple and pear orchards of Patagonia Argentina and its impact on local populations of entomopathogenic nematodes
T2  - BIOCONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the efficacy of the commercial product, Steinernema feltiae (NEMAPOM, e-nema GmbH, Germany), in controlling diapausing Cydia pomonella (Linneaus) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) (codling moth; CM) larvae in commercial organic orchards of pome fruits and in harvest bins in Rio Negro Valley, Argentina, subject to the attack of this pest. The infectivity of S. feltiae at different temperatures in the laboratory and the persistence in the field of this commercial product and of local entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) strains after application were determined. The field assay was carried out in winter, with an application dose of 1.5 billion infective juveniles (IJs) ha(-1) on a total surface of 0.5 ha. Mortality by S. feltiae in CM larvae was greater than 85% at two of the four test sites. Laboratory assays at 4 degrees C demonstrated its infectivity at this temperature, similar to field conditions at the times of release. In harvest bins, S. feltiae produced 10.58% and 60.37% mortality in sentinel traps at 100 and 200 IJs ml(-1), respectively. A local EPN, identified as Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, was detected in soil samples pre- and post-application (180 days) at all sites. S. feltiae failed to establish itself in the field and was found 24 h after application at only two sites in 20% and 80% of the samples taken (plots treated). Treatment with S. feltiae seems not to affect the occurrence of H. bacteriophora. S. feltiae was effective in controlling CM, given the environmental conditions of low temperatures and humidity in this fruit-growing region.

TI  - Urban expansion and transportation interaction: Evidence from Akure, southwestern Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The unprecedented increase in population and urbanization dynamics, particularly without the requisite road infrastructure on the African continent, necessitates a more contextual understanding of the interaction between urban expansion and transportation in its cities. The study used Landsat and Google Earth, two readily available data in a resource-constrained context, and population data from 1999 to 2018 to estimate the interactions among roads stock, urban size and corresponding population changes in Akure, a mid-sized capital city in Nigeria, with substantial federal road connectivity. The results suggest strong positive relationships among all the variables of interest. At a = 10%, an increase in road stock causes a significant (p = 0.064) increase in population. The study reveals a heavier road density as the city expanded, slightly reduced from the core, with an increased stock of roads toward the periphery. These findings could significantly inform how cities evolve and can guide urban and transportation planners on complementary road infrastructure for growing cities. The study recommends that, irrespective of the political dispensation, the government could increase connective and motorable road stock toward the periphery each fiscal year, with promises of sustainability and resilience in the urban system despite the ever-increasing population.

However, water-insoluble modifiers are usually deposited at the bottom of the medium, therefore cannot be used for in situ modification of BC. Herein, a novel strategy for in situ modification of insoluble modifiers after suspension by a suspending agent was proposed. The BC-producing strain Kosakonia oryzendophytica FY-07, not Gluconacetobacter xylinus, was selected to prepare BC products with antibacterial activity because of its tolerance to natural antibacterial products. The experimental results showed that xanthan gum as a suspending agent can uniformly and stably disperse water-insoluble plant extracts magnolol in the culture medium to prepare the in situ modified BC products. Characterization of the properties showed that the in situ modified BC products have reduced crystallinity, significantly increased swelling ratio and strong inhibition on Gram-positive bacteria and fungi and weak inhibition on Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, the in situ modified BC products had no toxicity to cells. This study provided a feasible strategy for in situ modification of BC using water-insoluble modifiers to extend BC functionality and has significant implications for the biopolymer industry.

TI  - Risk factors of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer with 1-2 sentinel lymph node macrometastases underwent total mastectomy: a case-control study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe randomized trials which include ACOSOG Z0011 and IBCSG 23-01 had found that the survival rates were not different in patients with cT1/2N0 and 1-2 sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive, macro/micrometastases who underwent breast-conserving therapy, and micrometastases who underwent total mastectomy (TM), when axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was omitted. However, for patients with cT1/2N0 and 1-2 SLN macrometastases who underwent TM; there was still insufficient evidence from clinical studies to support whether ALND can be exempted. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors of non-sentinel lymph node (nSLN) metastasis in breast cancer patients with 1-2 SLN macrometastases undergoing TM.MethodsThe clinicopathological data of 1491 breast cancer patients who underwent TM and SLNB from January 2017 to February 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze the risk factors for nSLN metastasis.ResultsA total of 273 patients with 1-2 SLN macrometastases who underwent TM were enrolled. Postoperative pathological data showed that 35.2% patients had nSLN metastasis. The results of multivariate analysis indicated that tumor size (TS) (P = 0.002; OR: 1.051; 95% CI: 1.019-1.084) and ratio of SLN macrometastases (P = 0.0001; OR: 12.597: 95% CI: 4.302-36.890) were the independent risk factors for nSLN metastasis in breast cancer patients with 1-2 SLN macrometastases that underwent TM. The ROC curve analysis suggested that when TS <= 22 mm and ratio of SLN macrometastases <= 0.33, the incidence of nSLN metastasis could be reduced to 17.1%.ConclusionsThe breast cancer patients with cT1/2N0 stage, undergoing TM and 1-2 SLN macrometastases, when the TS <= 22 mm and macrometastatic SLN does not exceed 1/3 of the total number of detected SLN, the incidence of nSLN metastasis is significantly reduced, but whether ALND can be exempted needs further exploration.

TI  - Simultaneous integrated boost within the lymphatic drainage system in breast cancer: A single center study on toxicity and oncologic outcome
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purposeIn breast cancer patients, the increasing de-escalation of axillary surgery and the improving resolution of diagnostic imaging results in a more frequent detection of residual, radiographically suspect lymph nodes (sLN) after surgery. If resection of the remaining suspect lymph nodes is not feasible, a simultaneous boost to the lymph node metastases (LN-SIB) can be applied. However, literature lacks data regarding the outcome and safety of this technique. Materials and methodsWe included 48 patients with breast cancer and sLN in this retrospective study. All patients received a LN-SIB. The median dose to the breast or chest wall and the lymph node system was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. The median dose of the LN-SIB was 58.8 Gy / 2.1 Gy (56-63 Gy / 2-2.25 Gy). The brachial plexus was contoured in every case and the dose within the plexus PRV (+0.3-0.5mm) was limited to an EQD2 of 59 Gy. All patients received structured radiooncological and gynecological follow-up by clinically experienced physicians. Radiooncological follow-ups were at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and subsequent annually after irradiation. ResultsThe median follow-up time was 557 days and ranged from 41 to 3373 days. Overall, 28 patients developed I degrees, 18 patients II degrees and 2 patients III degrees acute toxicity. There were no severe late side effects (>= III degrees) observed during the follow-up period. The most frequent chronic side effect was fatigue. One patient (2.1 %) developed pain and mild paresthesia in the ipsilateral arm after radiotherapy. After a follow-up of 557 days (41 to 3373 days), in 8 patients a recurrence was observed (16.7%). In 4 patients the recurrence involved the regional lymph node system. Hence, local control in the lymph node drainage system after a median follow-up of 557 days was 91.6 %. ConclusionIf surgical re-dissection of residual lymph nodes is not feasible or refused by the patient, LN-SIB-irradiation can be considered as a potential treatment option. However, patients need to be informed about a higher risk of regional recurrence compared to surgery and an additional risk of acute and late toxicity compared to adjuvant radiotherapy without regional dose escalation.

AB  - Insect outbreaks affect forest structure and function and represent a major category of forest disturbance globally. However, the resulting impacts on evapotranspiration (ET), and especially hydrological partitioning between the abi-otic (evaporation) and biotic (transpiration) components of total ET, are not well constrained. As a result, we combined remote sensing, eddy covariance, and hydrological modeling approaches to determine the effects of bark beetle out-break on ET and its partitioning at multiple scales throughout the Southern Rocky Mountain Ecoregion (SRME), USA.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake shrinkage and water scarcity are frequent problems in arid and semiarid regions; monitoring the variations of surface water using remote sensing images is useful for disaster prevention and water resource management. Here, we proposed models using Sentinel-2 images based on the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) to quantify the monthly surface water dynamics in the middle farming-pastoral ecotone of the Northern China (MFPENC) region, which was facing severe water security challenges from 2016 to 2021, at a 10-m resolution. The results show that the proposed models perform very well, with average values over 99.9% derived for four classification metrics; LightGBM is time-efficient and robust in different scenarios for surface water dynamic monitoring. The maps produced by these models could capture the details of surface water accurately in the MFPENC region; the surface water area of the M-FPENC region showed a clear seasonal pattern, showing the largest average extent in June (856.9 km2) and the smallest average extent in November (486.6 km2); the annual average maximum water area was 1030.9 km2, of which 630.9 km2 was seasonal and 400 km2 was permanent. The proposed product can provide decision support for local water resources planning.

TI  - Effectiveness of the spectral area index created by three algorithms for tree species recognition
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Key messageTree species identification analysis of the two images (Luoyang and Hohhot of China) shows that the polygonal area indices extracted by the specific band-constrained polygon relative area (algorithm 3, obtained accuracy was similar to 13% higher than that of other algorithms in WorldView-3 and similar to 2% higher in WorldView-2) can effectively improve the classification accuracy of tree species compared to those with a constant polygon relative area constraint (algorithm 2) and without area constraint (algorithm 1) (equal accuracy was obtained by algorithms 1 and 2 in each data). ContextSolving the problem of tree species identification by remote sensing technology is an international issue. Exploring the improvement of tree species recognition accuracy through multiple methods is currently widely attempted. A previous study has indicated that mining the differential information of various tree species in images using area differences of the polygons formed by tree species spectral curves and creating the polygon area index can improve tree species recognition accuracy. However, this study only created two such indices. Thus, a general model was developed to extract more potential polygon area indices and help tree species classification. However, the improvement of this model using a constant and a specific band to constrain the relative area of polygons still needs to be fully studied. AimsTo obtain new algorithms for extracting polygon area indices that can mine the differential information of tree species and determine the index that is the most effective for tree species classification. MethodsBy unconstraining the area of polygons and constraining the relative area of polygons with constant and specific bands, three formulations of polygon area indices were created. Polygon area indices were extracted from WorldView-3 and WorldView-2 imagery based on three algorithms and combined with textures and spectral bands to form three feature sets. Random forest was used to classify images and rank the importance of features in the feature sets, and the effectiveness of the polygon area indices extracted by each algorithm in tree species recognition was analysed in accordance with their performance in the classifications. ResultsThe proportion of polygon area index in the optimal feature sets ranged from 36.4 to 63.1%. The polygon area indices extracted with constant constrained polygon relative area and those without area constraint have minimal effect on tree species classification accuracy. Meanwhile, the polygon area indices extracted by the algorithm of specific band-constrained polygon relative area could remarkably improve tree species recognition accuracy (compared with spectral bands, WorldView-3 and WorldView-2 improved by 9.69% and 4.19%, respectively). ConclusionThe experiments confirmed that polygon area indices are beneficial for tree species classification, and polygon area indices extracted by specific band-constrained polygon relative area play an important role in tree species identification.

TI  - Detecting local climate zone change and its effects on PM10 distribution using fuzzy machine learning in Tehran, Iran
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land use and land cover (LULC) change and climate affect a wide range of environmental health and human wellbeing issues, such as air pollution and soil erosion. However, it is chal-lenging to quantify the effects of LULC change on Particulate Matter (PM) at a metropolitan scale. In this study, LULC maps of Tehran metropolitan region were prepared for the years 2013, 2017 and 2021 using Landsat 8 images. PM10 maps were extracted from an integrated approach of the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification scheme and Landsat images using Random Forest algo-rithm and fuzzy algorithm on the desired dates. The results show extensive changes of PM dis-tributions in the Tehran metropolitan region. The most change occurred in the north of the city and the least change did in the city center. The most growth was LCZ 4 which had grown about 57 times in 8 years. The highest level of PM10 was found in the west and southwest regions while the lowest level was in the north of the city. Also, the analysis of highest average PM10 was in LCZ 10 and the lowest in LCZ G. The analysis of the PM10 average in LCZs and the comparison of PM10 time-series maps showed that the LCZs changes which occurred during the study period have reduced the concentration of air pollution in the Tehran metropolitan region.

TI  - Employing the agricultural classification and estimation service (ACES) for mapping smallholder rice farms in Bhutan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Creating annual crop type maps for enabling improved food security decision making has remained a challenge in Bhutan. This is in part due to the level of effort required for data collection, technical model development, and reliability of an on-the-ground application. Through focusing on advancing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in Bhutan, an effort to co-develop a geospatial application known as the Agricultural Classification and Estimation Service (ACES) was created. This paper focuses on the co-development of an Earth observation informed climate smart crop type framework which incorporates both modeling and training sample collection. The ACES web application and subsequent ACES modeling software package enables stakeholders to more readily use Earth observation into their decision making process. Additionally, this paper offers a transparent and replicable approach for addressing and combating remote sensing limitations due to topography and cloud cover, a common problem in Bhutan. Lastly, this approach resulted in a Random Forest "LTE 555" model, from a set of 3,600 possible models, with an overall test Accuracy of 85% and F-1 Score of .88 for 2020. The model was independently validated resulting in an independent accuracy of 83% and F-1 Score of .45 for 2020. The insight into the model perturbation via hyperparameter tuning and input features is key for future practitioners.

TI  - Performance of the flood models in different topographies
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change leads to more severe floods, which needs to be modeled properly. This study uses two hydraulic models including Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) and LISFLOOD-FP to simu-late floods in two basins (Kashkan and Missouri) with different topographies (mountain and plain terrain). The impacts of different parameters like input resolutions, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), roughness coefficient, and modeling techniques on flood simulation are examined. Results indicate that the performance of the models varies based on topography, input resolutions, and modeling approach. Indeed, the 2D modeling of both models in different topography types leads to better results compared to 1D/2D modeling. In Kashkan basin, HEC-RAS and LISFLOOD-FP models simulate floodplain flow with accuracies of 74% and 70%, respectively, and the ac-curacies of the models in Missouri basin are 80% and 84%, respectively. Although both models, particularly HEC-RAS with ALOS 30 m, can provide reasonable results, with an accuracy of 74% for Kashkan and 63% for Missouri basin, LISFLOOD-FP can perform better (about 4% higher accuracy) than HEC-RAS with a higher resolution of DEM (3DEP) in Missouri basin with significantly lower computational costs. In addition, the performance of the two models significantly decreases using ASTER DEM in plain topography. Results confirm that HEC-RAS out-performs LISFLOOD-FP in coarser resolution DEMs, while LISFLOOD-FP performs better in plain topography, which requires higher resolution DEMs. Despite the low sensitivity of the two models to roughness coefficients, the variability of the LISFLOOD-FP simulations is smaller than HEC-RAS. This work uses the best setting and factors to simulate floodplain zones, which is valuable for flood risk and hazard assessment to reduce and manage damages and losses.

TI  - MASCOT's in situ analysis of asteroid Ryugu in the context of regolith samples and remote sensing data returned by Hayabusa2
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hayabusa2 mission provided a unique data set of asteroid Ryugu that covers a wide range of spatial scale from the orbiter remote sensing instruments to the returned samples. The MASCOT lander that was delivered onto the surface of Ryugu aimed to provide context for these data sets by producing in situ data collected by a camera (MasCam), a radiometer (MARA), a magnetometer (MasMag) and a spectrometer (MicrOmega). In this work, we evaluate the success of MASCOT as an integrated lander to bridge the gap between orbiter and returned sample analysis. We find that MASCOT's measurements and derivatives thereof, including the rock morphology, colour in the visible wavelengths, possible meteorite analogue, density, and porosity of the rock at the landing site are in good agreement with those of the orbiter and the returned samples. However, it also provides information on the spatial scale (sub-millimetres to centimetres) at which some physical properties such as the thermal inertia and reflectance undergo scale-dependent changes. Some of the in situ observations such as the presence of clast/inclusions in rocks and the absence of fine particles at the landing site was uniquely identified by MASCOT. Thus, we conclude that the delivery of an in situ instrument like MASCOT provides a valuable data set that complements and provides context for remote sensing and returned sample analyses.

TI  - A practical method for angular normalization on land surface temperature using space between thermal radiance and fraction of vegetation cover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data displays strong directional anisotropy. This characteristic makes the LST at different angles incomparable and limits its application. Multi-angle data are usually required to model or retrieve the angular anisotropy, but most of the TIR images are observed from one single angle. This study investigates the relationship between fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) and thermal radiance, and proposes a practical method for angular normalization of LST using an FVC-radiance space LST angular normalization (called the FRAN method) to perform LST angular normalization for two-component (leaf and soil) vegetated canopy using only single-angle, single-temporal TIR data. In this method, the single-angle data are used to construct the space and build a linear relationship between FVC and radiance. Nadir radiance and LST are obtained by using FVC data at nadir. The validity and accuracy of the FRAN method are tested by using simulated dataset. Results show that 60%-70% of the angular effect of LST can be corrected, and the maximum LST correction reaches 2.0 K. The LST biased error distribution changes to unbiased distribution after angular normalization. The method sensitivity to the vertex of FVC-radiance space and the parameter in FVC calculation is analyzed. The FRAN method is applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and obtains the maximum correction of LST as 1.2 K. Viewing zenith angle and land cover affect the corrected LST. The FRAN method has the potential for practical angular normalization of LST with single-angle data.

TI  - LiDAR GEDI derived tree canopy height heterogeneity reveals patterns of biodiversity in forest ecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The "Height Variation Hypothesis" is an indirect approach used to estimate forest biodiversity through remote sensing data, stating that greater tree height heterogeneity (HH) measured by CHM LiDAR data indicates higher forest structure complexity and tree species diversity. This approach has traditionally been analyzed using only airborne LiDAR data, which limits its application to the availability of the dedicated flight campaigns. In this study we analyzed the relationship between tree species diversity and HH, calculated with four different heterogeneity indices using two freely available CHMs derived from the new space-borne GEDI LiDAR data. The first, with a spatial resolution of 30 m, was produced through a regression tree machine learning algorithm integrating GEDI LiDAR data and Landsat optical information. The second, with a spatial resolution of 10 m, was created using Sentinel-2 images and a deep learning convolutional neural network. We tested this approach separately in 30 forest plots situated in the northern Italian Alps, in 100 plots in the forested area of Traunstein (Germany) and successively in all the 130 plots through a cross-validation analysis. Forest density information was also included as influencing factor in a multiple regression analysis. Our results show that the GEDI CHMs can be used to assess biodiversity patterns in forest ecosystems through the estimation of the HH that is correlated to the tree species diversity. However, the results also indicate that this method is influenced by different factors including the GEDI CHMs dataset of choice and their related spatial resolution, the heterogeneity indices used to calculate the HH and the forest density. Our finding suggest that GEDI LIDAR data can be a valuable tool in the estimation of forest tree heterogeneity and related tree species diversity in forest ecosystems, which can aid in global biodiversity estimation.

TI  - Monitoring and modeling of a landslide in Kahroud, Iran, by InSAR measurements and slope stability analysis
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work demonstrates the potential of synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) based on interferometric point target analysis (IPTA) approach for landslide-induced deformation measurement. Twenty-eight Sentinel-1A images acquired between October 14, 2014, and October 27, 2016, are employed in order to measure the surface deformation associated with Kahroud landslide, northern Iran. Due to the lack of geodetic measurements and thanks to capability of processing small baseline highly coherent interferograms in the study area, the conventional small baseline subset (SBAS) time series analysis is exploited for investigation of the IPTA performance. The cross-comparison indicates some unwrapping errors in the IPTA results and removal of a large number of point target candidates due to the remained nuisance terms in the phase measurements, the deviation of the deformation behavior from a simple linear model employed by IPTA and the temporal gap in the available dataset. Two different sliding mechanisms, however, are revealed based on the SBAS time series analysis results. In the second part of the research, the slope stability analysis to characterize the slope dynamics is finally performed based on the deformation field extracted from two ascending and descending single interferograms. Accordingly, the soil shear strength parameters as well as a 3D model of the sliding surface are estimated followed by the calculation of the soil mass involved by the Kahroud landslide.

TI  - Study of winter haze pollution events in Jinan (China)
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive study of the formation process of winter haze pollution in Jinan, China, was conducted using ground and satellite observation data from January 2 to January 13, 2022. According to the variations in the pollutant concentrations, three haze pollution events occurred in the Jinan area during this period. Compared to haze pollution event 1, event 2 lasted longer and exhibited a cumulative growth state with hourly PM2.5 values peaking at 250 mu g/m3. This was primarily caused by a mixture of local and nearby pollutants emitted in Jinan. Haze pollution event 3 was shorter and showed a similar trend to event 2, but the event dissipated rapidly after it was generated. Moreover, unfavorable weather factors, such as lower wind speeds, a stable inversion layer, and higher relative humidity, contributed to pollution accumulation and haze event formations. In addition, important photochemical processes also influenced haze pollution formation. The results of this study revealed the haze pollution formation process in Jinan. These results are helpful for promoting the study of regional climate changes and provide a reference for the government to prevent and control haze pollution in eastern China.

TI  - Using NDVI-NSSI feature space for simultaneous estimation of fractional cover of non-photosynthetic vegetation and photosynthetic vegetation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The NDVI-NSSI feature space, which is constructed by the NPV soil separation index (NSSI) calculated from the two near-infrared bands and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), is often represented as a triangle. It can be combined with the pixel decomposition method to achieve simultaneous estimation of the fractional cover of non-photosynthetic vegetation, photosynthetic vegetation, and bare soil (fNPV, fPV, and fBS, respectively). However, NDVI saturation in dense vegetation and the deleterious effects of shading due to topography are inevitable. To overcome this difficulty, we compare and analyze the NDVI-NSSI and enhanced vegetation index-NSSI (EVI-NSSI) triangular spaces and their differences when applying on the Sentinel-2A/B images. The results show that EVI-NSSI index combination still forms a triangle-like feature, with the triangle transformed from obtuse to acute, and it can be better used for pixel three-decomposition when PV cover is high. NDVI-NSSI underestimates (overestimates) fPV when PV cover is low (high). The NDVI-NSSI and EVI-NSSI produce significantly different estimates of fPV and fBS but similar estimates of fNPV and can be combined for estimation of a wider range of NPV cover in different seasons, including sparse or dense green vegetation scenarios.

TI  - Use of remote sensing data to predict soil organic carbon in some agricultural soils of Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying and monitoring of SOC (soil organic carbon) content in an agriculture soil is essential for understanding the ecological environment, influencing the climate change and implementing the best agriculture management. Present study tried to derive some machine learning-based models for predicting SOC content by employing remote sensing data in some agriculture soils enriched by calcareous materials, in central part of Iran. Soil samples were taken from 336 points at arable and permanent agriculture soils. Soil features such as SOC, sand, silt, clay, bulk density and calcium carbonate equivalent contents were measured at each point. After that, machine learning models including artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector regression (SVR) and genetic expression programming (GEP) were employed to estimate SOC content. The input vari-ables were spectral indices extracted from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3 and MODIS images (Scenario I), integrating of the spectral indices extracted from Landsat-8-MODIS and Sentinel-2-Sentinel-3 images (Scenario II) and the spectral indices extracted from the fusing Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images (Scenario IIII). The results of present study showed that the SVR model was the best performance (MAE = 0.0056%, RMSE = 0.620% and R2 = 0.627 at test data sets) for all sampled data by using the extracted remote sensing information at scenario II. Moreover, SVR model yielded the better result in the arable and permanent agriculture soils by using the ex-tracted remote sensing information at scenario II (MAE = 0.0042%, RMSE = 0.672% and R2 = 0.574) and scenario III (MAE = 0.0032%, RMSE = 0.342% and R2 = 0.381), respec-tively. It was concluded that the combining of remote sensing data extracted from different types of satellites in a various method could improve the accuracy of SOC prediction.

M3  - Article
AB  - Digital soil maps at proper scales can support sustainable land-use planning over large areas; however, applying this approach in erosion studies is still limited. Therefore, in this work, we adopted remote sensing-based mapping and fuzzy logic techniques to develop wind erosion risk maps with a spatial resolution of 30 m. These procedures were then conducted in a newly-reclaimed area in Matruh Governorate, the Egyptian western desert. Sixty surface soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected and analyzed for soil erodibility-related properties (sand, silt, clay, organic matter, and CaCO3). The relationships of these properties with the reflectance data of Landsat 8 multispectral bands were explored. Then, the spatial predictions were performed using the stepwise multiple linear regression models. The results showed that band reflectance in the shortwave infrared spectrum had higher correlations with soil properties than in the visible and near-infrared regions. The regression models achieved reliable precision and acceptable prediction abilities for all soil properties, except for the silt content. For validation datasets (30 % of the total data), the best-fitted models had coeffect of determination (R2) and residual prediction deviation of 0.61-0.92 and 1.42-2.67, respectively. The fuzzy memberships revealed various contributions of the five drivers (climate erosivity, soil erodibility, soil crust, vegetation, and terrain roughness) to potential soil loss. The success rate curves indicated the different performances of the applied fuzzy overlay operators (AND, OR, Sum, Product, and Gamma 0.9). The best-predictive model with an overall success rate of 85.7 % was obtained by overlaying the five fuzzified layers under the fuzzy algebraic Sum operator. This model delineated five hazard classes over the study area, including severe (79.5 %), high (12.6 %), moderate (5.7 %), slight (1.8 %), and very slight (0.4 %). The developed approach would improve the insight into large-scale monitoring of wind erosion status in desert ecosystems.

TI  - Regional data sets of high-resolution (1 and 6 km) irrigation estimates from space
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation water use represents the primary source of freshwater consumption by humans. The amount of water withdrawals for agricultural purposes is expected to further increase in the upcoming years to face the rising world population and higher living standards. Hence, effective plans for enacting a rational management of agricultural water use are urgent, but they are limited by knowledge gaps about irrigation. Detailed information on irrigation dynamics (i.e., extents, timing, and amounts) is generally lacking worldwide, but satellite observations can be used to fill this gap.This paper describes the first regional-scale and high-resolution (1 and 6 km) irrigation water data sets obtained from satellite observations. The products are developed over three major river basins characterized by varying irrigation extents and methodologies, as well as by different climatic conditions. The data sets are an outcome of the European Space Agency (ESA) Irrigation+ project. The irrigation amounts have been estimated through the SM-based (soil-moisture-based) inversion approach over the Ebro river basin (northeastern Spain), the Po valley (northern Italy), and the Murray-Darling basin (southeastern Australia). The satellite-derived irrigation products referring to the case studies in Europe have a spatial resolution of 1 km, and they are retrieved by exploiting Sentinel-1 soil moisture data obtained through the RT1 (first-order Radiative Transfer) model. A spatial sampling of 6 km is instead used for the Australian pilot area, since in this case the soil moisture information comes from CYGNSS (Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System) observations. All the irrigation products are delivered with a weekly temporal aggregation. The 1 km data sets over the two European regions cover a period ranging from January 2016 to July 2020, while the irrigation estimates over the Murray-Darling basin are available for the time span April 2017-July 2020. The retrieved irrigation amounts have been compared with benchmark rates collected over selected agricultural districts. Results highlight satisfactory performances over the major part of the pilot sites falling within the two regions characterized by a semiarid climate, namely, the Ebro and the Murray-Darling basins, quantified by median values of RMSE, Pearson correlation r, and bias equal to 12.4 mm/14 d, 0.66, and -4.62 mm/14 d, respectively, for the Ebro basin and to 10.54 mm/month, 0.77, and -3.07 mm/month, respectively, for the Murray-Darling basin. The assessment of the performances over the Po valley is affected by the limited availability of in situ reference data for irrigation. The developed products are made available to the scientific community for use and further validation at (Dari et al., 2022a).

TI  - Snowmelt characterization from optical and synthetic-aperture radar observations in the La Joie Basin, British Columbia
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowmelt runoff serves both human needs and ecosystem services and is an important parameter in operational forecasting systems. Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture-radar (SAR) observations can estimate the timing of melt within a snowpack; however, these estimates have not been applied on large spatial scales. Here we present a workflow to combine Sentinel-1 SAR and optical data from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 to estimate the onset and duration of snowmelt in the La Joie Basin, a 985 km(2) watershed in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia. A backscatter threshold is used to infer the point at which snowpack saturation occurs and the snowpack begins to produce runoff. Multispectral imagery is used to estimate snow-free dates across the basin to define the end of the snowmelt period. SAR estimates of snowmelt onset form consistent trends in terms of elevation and aspect on the watershed scale and reflect snowmelt records from continuous snow water equivalence observations. SAR estimates of snowpack saturation are most effective on moderate to low slopes (< 30 degrees) in open areas. The accuracy of snowmelt duration is reduced due to persistent cloud cover in optical imagery. Despite these challenges, snowmelt duration agrees with trends in snow depths observed in the La Joie Basin. This approach has high potential for adaptability to other alpine regions and can provide estimates of snowmelt timing in ungauged basins.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to identify the leaves of Acer campestre L., A. negundo L. and A. saccharinum L. The experiment was carried out under controlled laboratory conditions in 2021. A Cubert UHD-185 camera was used for hyperspectral imaging (HSI). The content of photosyn-thetic pigments was determined by the spectrophotometric method. HSI and determination of pigments were carried out during the growing season of maples with intervals between experi-ments of 7-10 days. The time interval in the vegetation of maples was determined, in which the identification of their species by the random forest (RF) method occurs most accurately. Based on the strength of the correlation with photosynthetic pigments, factor loadings of principal component analysis (PCA), results of the t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA), a group of vegetation indices (VIs) was selected, the values of which are associated with the species char-acteristics of maples. It has been established that VIs CRI1, Carter4, Datt3, DPI, EVI, Gitelson2, GMI1, Green_NDVI, MTVI, PRI, REP_Li, TCARI, TVI are significant for the identification of A. campestre, A. negundo and A. saccharinum. The OOB estimate of error rate does not exceed 7% when classified by the RF method using selected VIs. When training on the data of Jul 02, the testing error in the time interval from Jul 09 to Aug 24 did not exceed 20%.

TI  - Retrospective monitoring of slope failure event of tailings dam using InSAR time-series observations
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been effectively used to monitor surface deformation in a mining area with millimeter-level accuracy. On March 27, 2022, a tailings dam failure occurred in Shanxi Province, China, causing significant damage to surrounding houses, woodland, and roads below the tailings pond. We obtained the surface deformation map of the tailings dam before the catastrophic failure using the InSAR time-series method with a full resolution of Sentinel-1 A. This paper employed a GPU-assisted InSAR processing method for 91 Sentinel-1 images in Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode acquired from January 8, 2019, to March 17, 2022. The InSAR results show that during the 25 months preceding the tailings dam failure, Dam-II experienced an average cumulative LOS deformation of nearly 80 mm, while Dam-I experienced a significant deformation of more than 140 mm in the LOS direction. The analysis combining the deformation and rainfall results shows that rainfall significantly affects tailings pond deformation. In general, the deformation evolution has a high correlation with the rainfall annually, but the maximum deformation rate occurs with a delay of about one month compared to the peak rainfall. InSAR technology can significantly improve the monitoring capability of tailings dam failure and other landslide disasters, but it is limited by the observation frequency of the satellite. Thus, improving the temporal resolution of SAR data may assist in predicting tailings dam failure times more accurately.

TI  - Environmental impacts of increasing numbers of artificial space objects
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - For much of their existence, the environmental benefits of artificial satellites, particularly through provision of remotely sensed data, seem likely to have greatly exceeded their environmental costs. With dramatic current and projected growth in the number of Earth-observation and other satellites in low Earth orbit, this trade-off now needs to be considered more carefully. Here we highlight the range of environmental impacts of satellite technology, taking a life-cycle approach to evaluate impacts from manufacture, through launch, to burn-up during de-orbiting. These include the use of renewable and nonrenewable resources (including those associated with the transmission, long-term storage, and distribution of data), atmospheric consequences of rocket launches and satellite de-orbiting, and impacts of a changing nighttime sky on humans and other organisms. Initial estimations of the scale of some impacts are sufficient to underscore the need for more detailed investigations and to identify potential means by which impacts can be reduced and mitigated.

TI  - Changes in NO2 and O3 levels due to the pandemic lockdown in the industrial cities of Tehran and Arak, Iran using Sentinel 5P images, Google Earth Engine (GEE) and statistical analysis
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution has very damaging effects on human health. In recent years the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has created a worldwide economic disaster. Although the consequences of the COVID-19 lockdowns have had severe effects on economic and social conditions, these lockdowns also have also left beneficial effects on improving air quality and the environment. This research investigated the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on NO2 and O3 pollutants changes in the industrial and polluted cities of Arak and Tehran in Iran. Based on this, the changes in NO2 and O3 levels during the 2020 lockdown and the same period in 2019 were investigated in these two cities. For this purpose, the Sentinel-5P data of these two pollutants were used during the lockdown period from November 19 to December 05, 2020, and at the same time before the pandemic from November 19 to December 05, 2019. For better results, the effect of climatic factors such as rain and wind in reducing pollution was removed. The obtained results indicate a decrease in NO2 and O3 levels by 3.5% and 6.8% respectively in Tehran and 20.97% and 5.67% in Arak during the lockdown of 2020 compared to the same time in 2019. This decrease can be caused by the reduction in transportation and socio-economic and industrial activities following the lockdown measures. This issue can be a solid point to take a step toward controlling and reducing pollution in non-epidemic conditions by implementing similar standards and policies in the future.

TI  - Uncertainty in aerosol-cloud radiative forcing is driven by clean conditions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosols and their impact on cloud properties remain the largest uncertainty in the human forcing of the climate system. By increasing the concentration of cloud droplets (N-d), aerosols reduce droplet size and increase the reflectivity of clouds (a negative radiative forcing). Central to this climate impact is the susceptibility of cloud droplet number to aerosol (beta), the diversity of which explains much of the variation in the radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions (RFaci) in global climate models. This has made measuring beta a key target for developing observational constraints of the aerosol forcing.While the aerosol burden of the clean, pre-industrial atmosphere has been demonstrated as a key uncertainty for the aerosol forcing, here we show that the behaviour of clouds under these clean conditions is of equal importance for understanding the spread in radiative forcing estimates between models and observations. This means that the uncertainty in the aerosol impact on clouds is, counterintuitively, driven by situations with little aerosol. Discarding clean conditions produces a close agreement between different model and observational estimates of the cloud response to aerosol but does not provide a strong constraint on the RFaci. This makes constraining aerosol behaviour in clean conditions an important goal for future observational studies.

TI  - An enhanced deep learning approach to assessing inland lake water quality and its response to climate and anthropogenic factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has long been used for inland water quality monitoring. However, due to the complex correlation between water quality parameters (WQPs) and water optical properties, the interactions of WQPs, and the im-pacts of climate, using remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) to adequately estimate WQPs is still a grand challenge. Deep learning has the potential in capturing the correlation among Rrs, optically active constituents (OACs), and non-OACs, and is progressively used in remote sensing retrieval of inland water quality. In this study, the enhanced multimodal deep learning (EMDL) models were proposed for Chlorophyll-a, total phosphorous, total nitrogen, Secchi disk depth, dissolved organic carbon, and dissolved oxygen retrieval in Lake Simcoe (80 km north of Toronto, Canada). The EMDL models were developed and validated using the Rrs data derived from the harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, synchronized water quality measurements, water surface tempera-ture, and climate data (N = 1173). The performance of the EMDL models was compared to that of several other machine learning, deep learning, and empirical models. Using the developed EMDL models, the spatial distri-butions and long-term variations of the WQPs in Lake Simcoe from 2013 to 2019 were reconstructed. The im-pacts of 12 potential natural and anthropogenic factors on the water quality of the entire Lake Simcoe and its two most concerned estuaries were also quantitatively discussed. The results showed that the EMDL models produced satisfactory performance in estimation of the six WQPs, with the Slope being close to 1 (0.84-0.95), normalized mean absolute error <= 20.17%, and Bias <= 14.68%. The EMDL models had the potential to reconstruct the spatial patterns and time-series dynamics of water quality and effectively detect the gradients of spatial patterns. This study provides a novel approach to supporting the environmental management and identification of the affecting factors for the Lake Simcoe watershed.

T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Permafrost in Mongolia shows highly heterogeneous features in space and the contents of ground ice are dependent on the local geographies such as topography, ground wetness, and vegetation cover. Recent permafrost degradation would cause thawing and disappearance of ground ice, destabilizing and subsiding the ground surface. This study aimed to detect topographic deformation related to irreversibly changing ground ice over the permafrost terrain of Mongolia. To end this we used interferometric synthetic aperture RADAR (InSAR) technique, which is capable to measure vertical ground deformation on a centimeter scale. Advanced land observing satellite-based phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) images (June to September 2007 to 2010) and PALSAR-2 images (June to September 2014 to 2017) quantified near-year-round displacement of the ground surface. The overall deformation was in a range of -3 to 3 cm (subsidence and uplift, respectively) between the image interval and relatively high subsidence occurred during warm years. The areas experiencing consecutive uplift and subsidence correspond to ground underlain by ice-rich soils, indicating the dominant roles of thawing and growing ground ice for local deformation over permafrost terrain. We discuss the relation of observed ground deformation trends with regional climate and local geohydrology that influence ground ice formation.

TI  - Quantifying urban heat exposure at fine scale-modeling outdoor and indoor temperatures using citizen science and VHR remote sensing
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming and advancing urbanization lead to an increased heat exposure for city dwellers. Especially during summertime heatwaves, extreme daytime as well as high nighttime tempera-tures expose vulnerable people to potentially deadly heat risk. This applies specifically to indoor air temperatures, since people spend a lot of their time indoors. Against this background, this study relates outdoor and indoor air temperature measurements to area-wide geospatial data regarding summertime urban heat in the city of Augsburg, Germany. Air temperature data is collected from formalized as well as citizen science measurements, while remote sensing data with very-high spatial resolution (VHR) is utilized for assessment of their drivers and influencing factors. A land use regression approach is developed for city-wide modeling of outdoor and indoor air temperatures at the level of individual residential buildings. Daytime outdoor temperatures could be largely explained by vegetation parameters and imperviousness, whereas nighttime temperatures were more related to the building stock and radiation properties. For indoor tem-peratures, building density as well as building height and volume are additionally relevant. Outdoor air temperatures could be modeled with higher accuracies (mean absolute error (MAE) < 0.5 degrees C) compared to indoor temperatures (MAE < 1.5 degrees C), whereas outdoor and indoor modeling results are consistent with well-known patterns across different local climate zones (LCZ).

TI  - Retrieving 3D distributions of atmospheric particles using AtmosphericTomography with 3D Radiative Transfer - Part 1: Model description and Jacobian calculation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Our global understanding of clouds and aerosols relies on the remote sensing of their optical, microphysical, and macrophysical properties using, in part, scattered solar radiation. These retrievals assume that clouds and aerosols form plane-parallel, homogeneous layers and utilize 1D radiative transfer (RT) models, limiting the detail that can be retrieved about the 3D variability in cloud and aerosol fields and inducing biases in the retrieved properties for highly heterogeneous structures such as cumulus clouds and smoke plumes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce and validate an algorithm for retrieving the 3D optical or microphysical properties of atmospheric particles using multi-angle, multi-pixel radiances and a 3D RT model. The retrieval software, which we have made publicly available, is called Atmospheric Tomography with 3D Radiative Transfer (AT3D). It uses an iterative, local optimization technique to solve a generalized least squares problem and thereby find a best-fitting atmospheric state. The iterative retrieval uses a fast, approximate Jacobian calculation, which we have extended from Levis et al. (2020) to accommodate open and periodic horizontal boundary conditions (BCs) and an improved treatment of non-black surfaces.We validated the accuracy of the approximate Jacobian calculation for derivatives with respect to both the 3D volume extinction coefficient and the parameters controlling the open horizontal boundary conditions across media with a range of optical depths and single-scattering properties and find that it is highly accurate for a majority of cloud and aerosol fields over oceanic surfaces. Relative root mean square errors in the approximate Jacobian for a 3D volume extinction coefficient in media with cloud-like single-scattering properties increase from 2% to 12% as the maximum optical depths (MODs) of the medium increase from 0.2 to 100.0 over surfaces with Lambertian albedos < 0.2. Over surfaces with albedos of 0.7, these errors increase to 20 %. Errors in the approximate Jacobian for the optimization of open horizontal boundary conditions exceed 50 %, unless the plane-parallel media providing the boundary conditions are optically very thin (similar to 0.1).We use the theory of linear inverse RT to provide insight into the physical processes that control the cloud tomography problem and identify its limitations, supported by numerical experiments. We show that the Jacobian matrix becomes increasing ill-posed as the optical size of the medium increases and the forward-scattering peak of the phase function decreases. This suggests that tomographic retrievals of clouds will become increasingly difficult as clouds become optically thicker. Retrievals of asymptotically thick clouds will likely require other sources of information to be successful.In Loveridge et al. (2023a; hereafter Part 2), we examine how the accuracy of the retrieved 3D volume extinction coefficient varies as the optical size of the target medium increases using synthetic data. We do this to explore how the increasing error in the approximate Jacobian and the increasingly ill-posed nature of the inversion in the optically thick limit affect the retrieval. We also assess the accuracy of retrieved optical depths and compare them to retrievals using 1D radiative transfer.

TI  - Towards better exploiting object-based image analysis paradigm for local climate zones mapping
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Local Climate Zones (LCZs) have demonstrated significant promise in urban climate research. Although an LCZ consists of diverse geographic objects, most object-based LCZ mapping research encounters difficulty and seems to have no advantage due to the huge intra-class differences of objects within an LCZ. To address this problem, we propose a new object-based LCZ mapping framework based on multi-level features, which consist of infor-mation from pixel and region, bridging adjacent objects through region-level features while preserving original image features. As only using remote sensing imagery makes it hard to fully depict urban form, we modified urban morphological parameters (UMPs) to help with mapping, including sky view factor (SVF), building surface fraction (BSF), and permeable surface fraction (PSF). In addition, a refined sampling strategy is proposed for object-based LCZ mapping to avoid unrepresentative objects. Experiments were conducted in three cities (Hong Kong, Nanjing, and Nanchang), and the results showed that the accuracy of built LCZ types (OAbu) with modified UMPs and region-level features performed best, since they performed about 20% better than those without UMPs and region-level features. Furthermore, compared with patch-based methods, it is demonstrated that the object-based strategy can more appropriately depict the boundary of an LCZ. With further analysis of results at different scales and with features extracted from different region sizes, we found that built types benefit more than natural types at fine scales, and the region size of 17 x 17 is satisfied. In fact, we expect this study would directly reverse the unfavorable situation of object-based image analysis (OBIA) paradigm in LCZ mapping.

TI  - Use of Remote Sensing and Chemometrics as Tools to Estimate Parameters of Water Quality in Intermittent Lakes of the Lower Doce River
T2  - REVISTA VIRTUAL DE QUIMICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this work, chemometric prediction models were developed using remote sensing images associated with limnological parameters to evaluate the water quality of intermittent lakes of the Baixo Rio Doce (Southeast - Brazil). The lakes, popularly known as Lagoa Juparana and Lagoa Nova, are located in areas that were affected by the environmental disaster of the Fundao iron ore tailings dam (Minas Gerais). The visible and near infrared reflectance bands were extracted from images of the lakes surface, which were recorded by the Landsat-8 satellite on the dates closest to the days of field collection. After atmospheric correction of the spectral data, the models were built using Regression by Support Vectors to estimate the water quality parameters, which presented results satisfactory by the correlation coefficient of the prediction (R2pred) and by the square root of the mean squared prediction error (RMSEP), respectively: total phosphorus (0.817; 7.305 mu g L-1), turbidity (0.984; 1.467 UNT), transparency (0.705; 0.785 m), chlorophyll-a (0.850; 0.457 mu g L-1) and developed average trophic state index based on the Carlson equation (0.712; 2.617). This technique enables remote analysis of limnological parameters, which can help in environmental monitoring and equipping managers for more efficient decision-making in water resources conservation actions.

TI  - Eco-morphodynamic carbon pumping by the largest rivers in the Neotropics
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The eco-morphodynamic activity of large tropical rivers in South and Central America is analyzed to quantify the carbon flux from riparian vegetation to inland waters. We carried out a multi-temporal analysis of satellite data for all the largest rivers in the Neotropics (i.e, width > 200 m) in the period 2000-2019, at 30 m spatial resolution. We developed a quantification of a highly efficient Carbon Pump mechanism. River morphodynamics is shown to drive carbon export from the riparian zone and to promote net primary production by an integrated process through floodplain rejuvenation and colonization. This pumping mechanism alone is shown to account for 8.9 million tons/year of carbon mobilization in these tropical rivers. We identify signatures of the fluvial eco-morphological activity that provide proxies for the carbon mobilization capability associated with river activity. We discuss river migration-carbon mobilization nexus and effects on the carbon intensity of planned hydroelectric dams in the Neotropics. We recommend that future carbon-oriented water policies on these rivers include a similar analysis.

TI  - Annual biomass spatial data for southern California (2001-2021): Above- and belowground, standing dead, and litter
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Biomass estimates for shrub-dominated ecosystems in southern California have been generated at national and statewide extents. However, existing data tend to underestimate biomass in shrub vegetation types are limited to one point in time, or estimate aboveground live biomass only. In this study, we extended our previously developed estimates of aboveground live biomass (AGLBM) based on the empirical relationship of plot-based field biomass measurements to Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and multiple environmental factors to include other vegetative pools of biomass. AGLBM estimates were made by extracting plot values from elevation, solar radiation, aspect, slope, soil type, landform, climatic water deficit, evapotranspiration, and precipitation rasters and then using a random forest model to estimate per-pixel AGLBM across our southern California study area. By substituting year-specific Landsat NDVI and precipitation data, we created a stack of annual AGLBM raster layers for each year from 2001 to 2021. Using these AGLBM data as a foundation, we developed decision rules to estimate belowground, standing dead, and litter biomass pools. These rules were based on relationships between AGLBM and the biomass of the other vegetative pools derived primarily from peer-reviewed literature and an existing spatial data set. For shrub vegetation types (our primary focus), rules were based on literature estimates by the postfire regeneration strategy of each species (obligate seeder, facultative seeder, obligate resprouter). Similarly, for nonshrub vegetation types (grasslands, woodlands) we used literature and existing spatial data sets specific to each vegetation type to define rules to estimate the other pools from AGLBM. Using a Python language script that accessed Environmental Systems Research Institute raster geographic information system utilities, we applied decision rules to create raster layers for each of the non-AGLBM pools for the years 2001-2021. The resulting spatial data archive contains a zipped file for each year; each of these files contains four 32-bit tiff files for each of the four biomass pools (AGLBM, standing dead, litter, and belowground). The biomass units are grams per square meter (g/m(2)). We estimated the uncertainty of our biomass data by conducting a Monte Carlo analysis of the inputs used to generate the data. Our Monte Carlo technique used randomly generated values for each of the literature-based and spatial inputs based on their expected distribution. We conducted 200 Monte Carlo iterations, which produced percentage uncertainty values for each of the biomass pools. Results showed, using 2010 as an example, mean biomass for the study area and percentage uncertainty for each of the pools as follows: AGLBM (905.4 g/m(2), 14.4%); standing dead (644.9 g/m(2), 1.3%); litter (731.2 g/m(2), 1.2%); and belowground (776.2 g/m(2), 17.2%). Because our methods are consistently applied across each year, the data produced can be used to inform changes in biomass pools due to disturbance and subsequent recovery. As such, these data provide an important contribution to supporting the management of shrub-dominated ecosystems for monitoring trends in carbon storage and assessing the impacts of wildfire and management activities, such as fuel management and restoration. There are no copyright restrictions on the data set; please cite this paper and the data package when using these data.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Debris-covered ice is widespread in mountain regions with debris an important control on surface ice melt and glacier retreat. Quantifying debris cover extent and its evolution through time over large regions remains a challenge. This study develops two Normalized Difference Supraglacial Debris Indices for mapping debris-covered ice based on thermal and near Infrared Landsat 8 bands. They were calibrated with field data. Validation suggests that they have a high level of accuracy. They are then applied to Landsat data for 2016 to produce the first detailed glacier inventory of the Afghanistan Hindu Kush Himalaya that includes debris cover. 3408 glaciers were identified which, for those > 0.01 km(2) in area, gives an ice cover of 2,222 +/- 11 km(2) and a debris cover of 619 +/- 40 km(2). Principal components analysis was used to identify the most influential drivers of debris-covered ice extent. Lower proportions of debris cover were associated with glaciers with a higher elevation range, that were larger, longer and wider. These relations were statistically clearer when the dataset was broken down into climate and geological zones. A glaciers continue to shrink, the proportion of debris cover will become higher, making it more important to map debris cover reliably.

AB  - Meaning-in-Life might be associated with self-direction for patients with personality disorder (PD) but also with depressive symptoms or existential factors such as self-transcendence and spiritual/religious worldviews. PD patients (n = 125) and a control group (n = 69) completed the following: Meaning-in-Life Questionnaire (MLQ-Presence and MLQ-Search), General-Assessment-of-personality-disorder subscale Lack-of-Meaning-Purpose-Direction (GAPD-LMPD), Symptom-Checklist-Depression (SCL-90-Depression), Temperament-and-Character-Inventory scale Self-Transcendence (TCI-ST) and a worldview-questionnaire. PD patients showed less meaning in life, but religious and spiritual/non-religious worldviews mattered. Results emphasize that PD, beyond depressive symptoms, possesses a unique association with meaning-in-life and suggest exploring spiritual/religious worldviews as possible sources for meaning-in-life. MLQ-Presence and GAPD-LMPD seem to assess no identical constructs.

AB  - A mine waste deposit known as a tailings dam recently failed in the town of Jagersfontein, South Africa. The failure occurred amidst global concern about the safety record of these structures. Herein we use public remotely sensed data to gain insights into the construction history of the dam. The data suggest a construction sequence that is inconsistent with sound tailings management practices: asymmetric deposition, erosion gullies, large ponds and absence of beaches. These observations highlight the criticality of adhering to good construction practices and the potential of public data to monitor such adherence. Additionally, we present commercially available very high resolution satellite images to illustrate some of the immediate consequences of the failure.

TI  - Invasive breast cancer with complete infarct necrosis: Presentation of case
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and importance: Infarction occurs occasionally in benign mammary tumors but is extremely rare in breast cancer, with few cases having been reported. Presentation of case: A 53-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a mass and pain in the upper lateral region of the right breast. She underwent a needle biopsy and was histologically diagnosed as having invasive carcinoma. A ring-enhancing spherical mass was seen on contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance images. She underwent a right partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy for T2N0M0 breast cancer. Macroscopically, the tumor was a yellow mass. Histopathologically, the site contained extensively necrotic tissue with foam cell aggregation, lymphocytic infiltration, and fibrosis in the periphery. No viable tumor cells were observed. The patient was followed up without postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Clinical discussion: Ultrasound examination performed before the biopsy showed blood flow inside the tumor, but a review of the histopathological tissue after surgery revealed generally low viability of the tumor cells in the biopsy specimen, and the possibility that the tumor had a strong tendency to be necrotic from the beginning was considered. It is presumed that some immunological mechanism was working. Conclusion: We have encountered a case of breast cancer with complete infarct necrosis. Infarct necrosis may be present if a contrast-enhanced image shows ring-like contrast.

TI  - Spatial correlation between producer services agglomeration and carbon emissions in the Yangtze River Economic Belt based on point-of-interest
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agglomeration of the industry significantly impacts economic performance and environmental sustainability. In line with its strategic context of striving to achieve carbon reduction targets, China is making efforts to optimize the producer services landscape to reduce carbon emissions. Understanding the spatial correlation between industrial agglomeration and carbon emissions is particularly crucial against this background. Based on POI and remote sensing data of China's Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), the paper adopts the mean nearest neighbor analysis, kernel density analysis, and standard deviation ellipse to portray the agglomeration of producer services. Then uses Moran's I to present the spatial distribution characteristics of carbon emissions. Accordingly, the spatial heterogeneity of producer services agglomeration and carbon emissions is showed using the Geographic detector so as to provide strong support for industrial structure optimization and sustainable development. Here are some of the conclusions drawn from the study: (1) Producer services are a significant state of agglomeration in the provincial capitals and some central cities, with similar agglomeration patterns. (2) Carbon emissions exhibits significant spatial aggregation characteristics, with the spatial distribution pattern of "High west-Low east". (3) Wholesale and retail services industry is the primary risk factor that causes spatial differentiation of carbon emission intensity, "leasing and business services industry-wholesale and retail services industry" is the key interaction factor of the spatial differentiation. (4) Carbon emissions shows a downward trend followed by an upward trend as producer services agglomeration increases.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Individual Tree Crown Detection and Delineation with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
T2  - CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of ReviewCrown detection and measurement at the individual tree level provide detailed information for accurate forest management. To efficiently acquire such information, approaches to conduct individual tree detection and crown delineation (ITDCD) using remotely sensed data have been proposed. In recent years, deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), has shown potential in this field. This article provides a systematic review of the studies that used CNN for ITDCD and identifies major trends and research gaps across six perspectives: accuracy assessment methods, data types, platforms and resolutions, forest environments, CNN models, and training strategies and techniques.Recent FindingsCNN models were mostly applied to high-resolution red-green-blue (RGB) images. When compared with other state-of-the-art approaches, CNN models showed significant improvements in accuracy. One study reported an increase in detection accuracy of over 11%, while two studies reported increases in F1-score of over 16%. However, model performance varied across different forest environments and data types. Several factors including data scarcity, model selection, and training approaches affected ITDCD results.Future studies could (1) explore data fusion approaches to take advantage of the characteristics of different types of remote sensing data, (2) further improve data efficiency with customised sample approaches and synthetic samples, (3) explore the potential of smaller CNN models and compare their learning efficiency with commonly used models, and (4) evaluate impacts of pre-training and parameter tunings.

TI  - Assessing and comparing the subseasonal variations of summer soil moisture of satellite products over eastern China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the 43-station soil moisture (SM) at a depth of 0-10 cm over eastern China, the near-surface (about 0-5 cm) SM products from satellite missions including the level-2 product of Chinese FengYun 3C (FY3C), level-2 neural network product of the European Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and level-4 product of the US Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) were evaluated and compared during summers of 2015-2018. Thus, features of those products can be identified for their further application of climate study over eastern China. Large diversity is found among the satellite and field SM in terms of spatial distribution. This disagreement may cause the poor performance of the relationship between spatial coefficients of variation (CV) and mean SM. Compared with the field SM, the FY3C SM has smaller bias than the other satellite products. FY3C also performs better than SMOS in terms of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) but has the smallest correlation coefficient (R). The SMAP product is generally the best among the three products in terms of RMSE, ubRMSE and R. However, a good performance in those metrics does not guarantee the same results on various time scales. On subseasonal time scales, the R in FY3C is the smallest among the three products, and the SMAP product has the largest R, but its amplitudes of the subseasonal variations are much smaller than the field observations. This indicates that when the SMAP products are applied for the analysis on subseasonal SM-atmosphere interactions, the effects of SM may be underestimated. On 10-30 days and above 60 days, dry period tends to have large spatial CV but this phenomenon is weak in all the satellite products. On the other hand, dry area tends to have large temporal CV on the four time scales, and this relationship is the strongest in SMAP but the weakest in FY3C. Therefore, there are large uncertainties of variability among different satellite SM products on subseasonal time scales over eastern China. Besides seasonal and overall performance, more attention is called to the variations on different time scales.

TI  - Aluminum Fluoride-18 Labeled Mannosylated Dextran: Radiosynthesis and Initial Preclinical Positron Emission Tomography Studies
T2  - MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Purpose In addition to being expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, mannose receptors are also found on antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages, which are mainly involved in the inflammation process. Dextran derivatives of various sizes containing cysteine and mannose moieties have previously been labeled with Tc-99m and used for single-photon emission computed tomography imaging of sentinel lymph nodes. In this study, we radiolabeled 21.3-kDa D10CM with positron-emitting F-18 for initial positron emission tomography (PET) studies in rats.Procedures D10CM was conjugated with 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) chelator and radiolabeled with the aluminum fluoride-18 method. The whole-body distribution kinetics and stability of the intravenously administered tracer were studied in healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats by in vivo PET/CT imaging, ex vivo gamma counting, and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis.Results Al[F-18]F-NOTA-D10CM was obtained with a radiochemical purity of >99% and molar activity of 9.9 GBq/mu mol. At 60 minutes after injection, an average of 84% of the intact tracer was found in the blood, indicating excellent in vivo stability. The highest radioactivity concentration was seen in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, in which mannose receptors are highly expressed under physiological conditions. The uptake specificity was confirmed with in vivo blocking experiments.Conclusions Our results imply that Al[F-18]F-NOTA-D10CM is a suitable tracer for PET imaging. Further studies in disease models with mannose receptor CD206-positive macrophages are warranted to clarify the tracer's potential for imaging of inflammation.

TI  - Nomogram for predicting preoperative axillary lymph node status in male breast carcinoma: SEER population-based study
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been recommended as a replacement for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in male breast carcinoma (MBC) with clinical axillary lymph node-negative (ALN-negative) as in the case of female. However, the morbidity after SLNB may also have short-term or long-term complications. To avoid unnecessary surgery, building a model which is able to assess the risk of lymph node metastasis is vitally significant. Methods: A retrospective review of the clinical and pathology data were carried out for patients diagnosed with MBC between 2010 and 2018 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The cohort was divided into training and validation cohorts. A logistic regression model was used to construct the nomogram in the training cohort and then verified in the validation cohort. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, C-index, and calibration were used to evaluate the predictive ability of the nomogram. Results: Overall, 2,610 patients diagnosed with MBC were included in the study, of which 1,740 were in the training cohort and 870 were in the validation cohort. Logistic regression analysis indicated age at diagnosis, tumor location, tumor stage, pathological type, and histologic grade, were significantly related to axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM). The area under the curve (AUC) of the nomogram was 0.846 (95% CI: 0.825-0.867) and C-index was 0.848 (95% CI: 0.807-0.889), demonstrating a notable prediction performance. The calibration curve for the nomogram was plotted and the slope was close to 1. The prognostic value of the nomogram was further validated in the validation cohort, with an AUC of 0.848 (95% CI: 0.819-0.877). Conclusions: A nomogram to predict ALNM was successfully established, especially for those who were of advanced age at diagnosis, had small tumor size, displayed low malignancy, and showed clinical ALNnegative, to avoid unnecessary axillary operation. The quality of life for patients is enhanced without conceding the overall survival rate.

TI  - Relief morphology and sediment management of the Upper Jiadhal River Basin, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, North-East India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - An environmental geographical study involves the relief aspects of the geographical unit. Relief analysis of a geographical unit includes relative relief, slope gradient, steepness, and drainage characteristics. The study area selected for the study is a part of the upper Jiadhal drainage basin consisting of 370.63 sq. km of area. It is a young river system (6th order) with lots of sediment carrying capacity and intensive flood frequencies. In this study, the relief morphology of the upper Jiadhal basin is undertaken observing its unique characteristic of large sediment supply causing flood problems in lower basin areas. Open source Landsat: L5135041_041200901113_MTL, TA6RFR_A012986-20,190,901 data from Bhuvan (ISRO) was accessed by ArcGIS tools. It focused that the upper catchment is more influential by environmental problems rather than human except deforestation activities, as there is very less settlement due to no communication route to the interior catchments of the basin. The mainstream of Sido occupies forth (4th) order stream, Sika and Siri are of fifth (5th) order and Jia of sixth (6th) order stream contained to drain the lower basin. The results revel that, the landscape is prone to erosion mainly due to physical and climatic factors and prominently dominated by human intervention due to agro-forestry and could be mitigated with certain specific measures on a location basis including structural engineering measures and watershed management techniques in the degraded areas for the sustainability of the basin. The early studies in this region include the lower basin of the river system, due to inaccessibility. The area is newly demarcated to a different administrative district of Arunachal Pradesh (Lower Siang) and thus in near future more anthropogenic activities would active in the upper catchment, which may influence the environment stability. So the upper catchment management would be a prime concern for the environmentalist in near future.

TI  - Spatial analysis of landscape rehabilitation in degraded land along topographic variabilities in the Kiliso sub-watershed, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In Ethiopia, particularly in Southern Oromia and Eastern Halaba, land degradation is a common challenge for the pastoral community and farmers. As a result, the sub-watershed has closed for the past five years. However, little is known about the effects of topography on the rehabilitation of various land uses and land covers (LULCs). This study determined how the main topographic variables affect the rate of rehabilitation. Sentinel-2 images were used to quantify land use and land cover for the years 2017 and 2021. The aspect, altitude, and slope were calculated using the SRTM of 1 Arc-Second Global. The Maximum Likelihood classifier algorithm was used for supervised image classification. Changes in LULCs were analyzed using the post-classification technique. The LULC maps were overlaid with the topographic variabilities. The topographic variability's influences were clearly observed on the rehabilitation rate of area enclosure. In the slope class of 0 to 5%, agriculture is the dominant cover. The bushland was largely detected in the slope classes of 0 to 10 in 2017. Agriculture and barren land were influenced as altitude and slope increased. Forest and bushland were found to be highly restored at an altitude of 1841 to 1880, an aspect of the south, and slope classes of 0 to 5 percent.

TI  - Urban-rural interface dominates the effects of urbanization on watershed energy and water balances in Southern China
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ContextQuantifying the interactions between land disturbances and energy and water balances, particularly evapotranspiration (ET), is helpful for understanding the land-atmospheric interactions and assessing the effects of urbanization on local climate and hydrological processes at a landscape scale.ObjectivesTo investigate the mechanisms of ecohydrological response to urbanization from the perspectives of ET or energy balances in a distributed fashion at the watershed scale. To identify spatial 'hot spots', in which ET, and thus watershed hydrology, are most pronounced in response to land use change so that limited watershed landscape management resources can be applied efficiently.MethodsThis process-based research quantified spatial patterns of ET and other energy fluxes in a rapidly urbanizing rice paddy-dominated watershed, Qinhuai River Basin (QRB), using a spatially explicit land surface energy balance model (SEBAL).ResultsThe QRB experienced a rapid land use change in urban-rural interface (URI) area, resulting in a significant reduction in actual ET (- 9.4 mm yr(-1)) but a significant increase in sensible heat (3.71 W m(-2) yr(-1)) and soil heat fluxes (0.85 W m(-2) yr(-1)) during the growing season from 2001 to 2019. The change in energy partitioning at the watershed scale was dominated by URI area identified as the 'hot spots' of ecohydrological change within a heterogeneous basin.ConclusionsKnowledge gained from this study improves parameterizing distributed watershed ecohydrological models (e.g., ET processes) to guide urban planning. Effective watershed landscape management and planning that aims at mitigating the negative impacts of urbanization should focus on URI by preserving vegetation and local wetlands (e.g., rice paddies).

TI  - Relating weather radar data to migrating waterfowl abundance in the Rainwater Basin of Nebraska
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Waterfowl migrations are large-scale events that involve millions of birds moving over broad geographic extents, which make them difficult to quantify and study. Historically, wildlife managers have relied mostly on field surveys, such as visual counts from the ground or air that sample at small spatial or temporal extents, or both. Combining field surveys with remote sensing data comprehensively collected over large spatial extents at high temporal frequency may improve the study of migrating waterfowl distributions. We tested the strength of the relationship between broad-scale weather surveillance radar data and fine-scale field surveys of waterfowl abundance at wetlands within the Rainwater Basin of Nebraska, USA, from 2017-2019. Radar reflectivity of waterfowl at the peak exodus of evening flights was positively correlated with diurnal waterfowl count data, although there was unexplained variation in the relationship. The association was also very similar across various time scales ranging from daily to monthly averages of waterfowl abundance. We suggest that human-based ground surveys can calibrate and leverage more comprehensive remote sensing data to get a broad understanding of waterfowl distributions during migration. Several confounding factors, such as spatial displacement between radar and survey observation, individual variation in orientation and body size, and identification of avian species sampled by radar, remain on the path to improving radar-based waterfowl estimates.

T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Exploration of the effectiveness of multi-type features and multi-seasonal data of remote sensing images and selection of an optimal feature set from all extracted features are popular research topics in tree species classification. Eight typical image feature sets, namely, spectral band, digital surface model (DSM), texture (TEX), tassel cap transformation (TC), hue, saturation and value colour space (HSV), principal component analysis, minimum noise fraction (MNF) and spectral index (SI), were extracted in this study from images of four seasons acquired using the RedEdge-MX sensor, and maximum likelihood and random forest classifiers were used to categorise 32 typical urban tree species. Experimental results revealed the following: (1) the tree species recognition accuracy determined using the texture set (87.89%) was higher than that determined using other types of feature sets; (2) the optimal feature set containing 20 features comprised 4 DSMs, 11 TEXs, 2 TCs, 1 HSV (S), 1 SI and 1 MNF, and the classification accuracy determined using the set of features was 89.53% and (3) the classification accuracy for tree species identification determined using multi-seasonal spectral data was higher than that determined using individual seasonal data. The major contribution of this study to relevant literature is that it proves that urban greening tree species can be accurately identified using multiple features and seasonal images acquired through UAV-based sensors. The multi-feature-based approach also performs substantially well in practical applications for mapping tree species in a general urban environment considering the effects of a heterogeneous environment on tree species classification and comprehensive image processing and classification methods.

T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Obesity is a relevant risk factor in breast cancer (BC), but little is known about the effects of overweight and obesity in surgical outcomes of BC patients. The aim of this study is to analyse surgical options and associated overall survival (OS) in overweight and obese women with BC. In this study, 2143 women diagnosed between 2012 and 2016 at the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto (IPO-Porto) were included, and the clinicopathological information was retrieved from the institutional database. Patients were stratified by body mass index (BMI). Statistical analysis included Pearson's chi-squared test with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Multinomial, binary logistic regression and cox proportional-hazards model were also performed to calculate odd ratios and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for adjusted and non-adjusted models. The results revealed no statistical difference in histological type, topographic localization, tumour stage and receptor status and in the number of surgical interventions. Overweight women have increased probability to be subjected to sentinel node biopsy. Obese and overweight women are more likely to be submitted to conservative surgery and contrariwise, less likely to undergo total mastectomy. Patients submitted to conservative surgery and not submitted to total mastectomy had a favourable OS although without statistical significance. No significant differences were observed in OS when stratified by BMI. Our results revealed significant variations regarding the surgical options in overweight and obese patients, but these were not translated in OS difference. More research is recommended to better address treatment options in overweight and obese BC patients.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity of global forest aboveground carbon stocks and fluxes constrained by spaceborne lidar data and mechanistic modeling
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest carbon is a large and uncertain component of the global carbon cycle. An important source of complexity is the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation vertical structure and extent, which results from variations in climate, soils, and disturbances and influences both contemporary carbon stocks and fluxes. Recent advances in remote sensing and ecosystem modeling have the potential to significantly improve the characterization of vegetation structure and its resulting influence on carbon. Here, we used novel remote sensing observations of tree canopy height collected by two NASA spaceborne lidar missions, Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation and ICE, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite 2, together with a newly developed global Ecosystem Demography model (v3.0) to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of global forest structure and quantify the corresponding implications for forest carbon stocks and fluxes. Multiple-scale evaluations suggested favorable results relative to other estimates including field inventory, remote sensing-based products, and national statistics. However, this approach utilized several orders of magnitude more data (3.77 billion lidar samples) on vegetation structure than used previously and enabled a qualitative increase in the spatial resolution of model estimates achievable (0.25 degrees to 0.01 degrees). At this resolution, process-based models are now able to capture detailed spatial patterns of forest structure previously unattainable, including patterns of natural and anthropogenic disturbance and recovery. Through the novel integration of new remote sensing data and ecosystem modeling, this study bridges the gap between existing empirically based remote sensing approaches and process-based modeling approaches. This study more generally demonstrates the promising value of spaceborne lidar observations for advancing carbon modeling at a global scale.

TI  - Identifying deprived ?slum? neighbourhoods in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area of Ghana using census and remote sensing data
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Identifying urban deprived areas, including slums, can facilitate more targeted planning and development policies in cities to reduce socio-economic and health inequities, but methods to identify them are often ad-hoc, resource intensive, and cannot keep pace with rapidly urbanizing communities.Objectives: We apply a spatial modelling approach to identify census enumeration areas (EAs) in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA) of Ghana with a high probability of being a deprived area using publicly available census and remote sensing data. Methods: We obtained United Nations (UN) supported field mapping data that identified deprived "slum" areas in Accra's urban core, data on housing and population conditions from the most recent census, and remotely sensed data on environmental conditions in the GAMA. We first fitted a Bayesian logistic regres-sion model on the data in Accra's urban core (n=2,414 EAs) that estimated the relationship between hous-ing, population, and environmental predictors and being a deprived area according to the UN's deprived area assessment. Using these relationships, we predicted the probability of being a deprived area for each of the 4,615 urban EAs in GAMA.Results: 899 (19%) of the 4,615 urban EAs in GAMA, with an estimated 745,714 residents (22% of its urban population), had a high predicted probability (>80%) of being a deprived area. These deprived EAs were dispersed across GAMA and relatively heterogeneous in their housing and environmental conditions, but shared some common features including a higher population density, lower elevation and vegetation abundance, and less access to indoor piped water and sanitation.Conclusion: Our approach using ubiquitously available administrative and satellite data can be used to identify deprived neighbourhoods where interventions are warranted to improve living conditions, and track progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals aiming to reduce the population living in unsafe or vulnerable human settlements.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Assessing LULC changes and LST through NDVI and NDBI spatial indicators: a case of Bengaluru, India
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased urbanization and growing needs in urban areas resulted in causing extensive changes to the land use land cover (LULC) of urban areas. It was observed from many previous studies that the LULC changes in urban areas result in short and long-term repercussions, including increased land surface temperature (LST) and urban heat island. However, the established relationship between the LULC changes and LST needs a deeper understanding. This study examines and explores the relationship between the LULC changes in Bengaluru, India, and the corresponding impact on the LST. LULC classification done using Landsat images revealed that over 50% of vegetation had been lost between 2003 and 2021, while the built-up area had nearly doubled during the same period. Subsequently, the city experienced an increase in the minimum temperature from 16 degrees C in 2003 to 21 degrees C in 2021, whereas the mean LST had increased from 26 degrees C in 2003 to 29 degrees C in 2021. Spatial aggregation of the LST is examined using Moran's I spatial autocorrelation, and the results suggested moderately clustered LST values in the study area. Spatial indicators like normalized differentiated vegetative index (NDVI) and normalized differentiated built index (NDBI) are calculated and compared against the LST using scatter plots. The relationship is identified using simple linear regression (SLR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR), considering the non-spatial and spatial attributes inherently present within the data. Results from GWR suggest a more defined relationship between LULC and LST, NDVI, and NDBI than SLR. While NDVI exhibited a negative relationship with LST, NDBI displayed a positive relationship with LST. The results from this study highlight the need for planned growth of urban areas with sustained growth in vegetated areas through urban planning and design strategies, which can help contain the increase in LST in future scenarios.

TI  - Estimating the cost of HIV services for key populations provided by the LINKAGES program in Kenya and Malawi
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundData remain scarce on the costs of HIV services for key populations (KPs). The objective of this study was to bridge this gap in the literature by estimating the unit costs of HIV services delivered to KPs in the LINKAGES program in Kenya and Malawi. We estimated the mean total unit costs of seven clinical services: post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), HIV testing services (HTS), antiretroviral therapy (ART), sexually transmitted infection (STI) services, sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, and management of sexual violence (MSV). These costs take into account the costs of non-clinical services delivered alongside clinical services and the pre-service and above-service program management integral to the LINKAGES program.MethodsData were collected at all implementation levels of the LINKAGES program including 30 drop-in-centers (DICs) in Kenya and 15 in Malawi. This study was conducted from the provider's perspective. We estimated economic costs for FY 2019 and cost estimates include start-up costs. Start-up and capital costs were annualized using a discount rate of 3%. We used a combination of top-down and bottom-up costing approaches. Top-down methods were used to estimate the costs of headquarters, country offices, and implementing partners. Bottom-up micro-costing methods were used to measure the quantities and prices of inputs used to produce services in DICs. Volume-weighted mean unit costs were calculated for each clinical service. Costs are presented in 2019 United States dollars (US$).ResultsThe mean total unit costs per service ranged from US$18 (95% CI: 16, 21) for STI services to US$635 (95% CI: 484, 785) for PrEP in Kenya and from US$41 (95% CI: 37, 44) for STI services to US$1,240 (95% CI 1156, 1324) for MSV in Malawi. Clinical costs accounted for between 21 and 59% of total mean unit costs in Kenya, and between 25 and 38% in Malawi. Indirect costs-including start-up activities, the costs of KP interventions implemented alongside clinical services, and program management and data monitoring-made up the remaining costs incurred.ConclusionsA better understanding of the cost of HIV services is highly relevant for budgeting and planning purposes and for optimizing HIV services. When considering all service delivery costs of a comprehensive HIV service package for KPs, costs of services can be significantly higher than when considering direct clinical service costs alone. These estimates can inform investment cases, strategic plans and other budgeting exercises.

TI  - Characterizing spatial burn severity patterns of 2016 Chimney Tops 2 fire using multi-temporal Landsat and NEON LiDAR data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chimney Tops 2 wildfire (CT2) in 2016 at Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) was recorded as the largest fire in GSMNP history. Understanding spatial patterns of burn severity and its underlying controlling factors is essential for managing the forests affected and reducing future fire risks; however, this has not been well understood. Here, we formulated two research questions: 1) What were the most important factors characterizing the patterns of burn severity in the CT2 fire? 2) Were burn severity measures from passive and active optical remote sensing sensors providing consistent views of fire damage? To address these questions, we used multitemporal Landsat- and lidar-based burn severity measures, i.e., relativized differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) and relativized differenced Mean Tree Height (RdMTH). A random forest approach was used to identify key drivers in characterizing spatial variability of burn severity, and the partial dependence of each explanatory variable was further evaluated. We found that pre-fire vegetation structure and topography both play significant roles in characterizing heterogeneous mixed burn severity patterns in the CT2 fire. Mean tree height, elevation, and topographic position emerged as key factors in explaining burn severity variation. We observed generally consistent spatial patterns from Landsat- and lidar-based burn severity measures. However, vegetation type and structure-dependent relations between RdNBR and RdMTH caused locally inconsistent burn severity patterns, particularly in high RdNBR regions. Our study highlights the important roles of pre-fire vegetation structure and topography in understanding burn severity patterns and urges to integrate both spectral and structural changes to fully map and understand fire impacts on forest ecosystems.

TI  - Prediction of forest fire occurrence in China under climate change scenarios
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has an impact on forest fire patterns. In the context of global warming, it is important to study the possible effects of climate change on forest fires, carbon emission reductions, carbon sink effects, forest fire management, and sustainable development of forest ecosystems. This study is based on MODIS active fire data from 2001-2020 and the influence of climate, topography, vegetation, and social factors were integrated. Temperature and precipitation information from different scenarios of the BCC-CSM2-MR climate model were used as future climate data. Under climate change scenarios of a sustainable low development path and a high conventional development path, the extreme gradient boosting model predicted the spatial distribution of forest fire occurrence in China in the 2030s (2021-2040), 2050s (2041-2060), 2070s (2061-2080), and 2090s (2081-2100). Probability maps were generated and tested using ROC curves. The results show that: (1) the area under the ROC curve of training data (70%) and validation data (30%) were 0.8465 and 0.8171, respectively, indicating that the model can reasonably predict the occurrence of forest fire in the study area; (2) temperature, elevation, and precipitation were strongly correlated with fire occurrence, while land type, slope, distance from settlements and roads, and slope direction were less strongly correlated; and, (3) based on future climate change scenarios, the probability of forest fire occurrence will tend to shift from the south to the center of the country. Compared with the current climate (2001-2020), the occurrence of forest fires in 2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100 will increase significantly in Henan Province (Luoyang, Nanyang, Sanmenxia), Shaanxi Province (Shangluo, Ankang), Sichuan Province (Mianyang, Guangyuan, Ganzi), Tibet Autonomous Region (Shannan, Linzhi, Changdu), Liaoning Province (Liaoyang, Fushun, Dandong).

T2  - AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is rangeland biomass estimation and its spatial-temporal dynamics. Remote sensing has been a significant method for estimating biomass in recent years. The connection between vegetation index and field biomass will be used to assign probabilities, but in some cases, it does not provide acceptable results because of soil background and geographical and temporal variability. Design/methodology/approachIn this study, the normalized difference red-edge (NDRE) index was used to calculate the rangeland biomass in comparison to five vegetation indices. Field measurements of biomass of natural rangeland in the West of Iran were taken in 2015, 2018 and 2021, and SENTINEL-2 data were used for analysis. FindingsThe results indicated that the overall advantage of NDRE stems from the fact that it adjusts for changes in leaf water content while overcoming the detrimental effects of soil substrate heterogeneity, both of these factors have a significant impact on pasture biomass. These results suggest that an NDRE-based biomass estimation model might be useful for estimating and monitoring biomass in large rangelands with significant geographical and temporal variability. Originality/valueIdentifying the best vegetation index to establish a vegetation-based biomass regression model for rangelands in large areas with different climatic conditions, plant compositions and soil types is the overall aim of this study.

TI  - Twenty-meter annual paddy rice area map for mainland Southeast Asia using Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture-radar data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Over 90 % of the world's rice is produced in the Asia-Pacific region. Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) enables all-day and all-weather observations of rice distribution in tropical and subtropical regions. The complexity of rice cultivation patterns in tropical and subtropical regions makes it difficult to construct a representative data-relevant rice crop model, increasing the difficulty in extracting rice distributions from SAR data. To address this problem, a rice area mapping method for large regional tropical or subtropical areas based on time-series Sentinel-1 SAR data is proposed in this study. Based on the analysis of rice backscattering characteristics in mainland Southeast Asia, the combination of spatiotemporal statistical features with good generalization ability was selected and then input into the U-Net semantic segmentation model, combined with WorldCover data to reduce false alarms, finally the 20 m resolution rice area map of five countries in mainland Southeast Asia in 2019 was obtained. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 92.20 % on the validation sample set, and the good agreement was obtained when comparing our rice area map with statistical data and other rice area maps at the national and provincial levels. The maximum coefficient of determination R2 was 0.93 at the national level and 0.97 at the provincial level. These results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in rice area mapping with complex cropping patterns and the reliability of the generated rice area maps. The 20 m annual paddy rice area map for mainland Southeast Asia is available at (Sun et al., 2022b).

TI  - Using climate reanalysis and remote sensing-derived data to create the basis for predicting the occurrence of algal blooms, harmful algal blooms and toxic events in Santa Catarina, Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to form a basis for future predictive modeling efforts in support of the harmful algal blooms (HAB) surveillance program currently in force in the Brazilian State of Santa Catarina (SC). Data from monitoring toxinproducing algae were merged with both meteorological and oceanographic data and analyzed. Data from four sources were used in this study: climate reanalysis (air temperature, pressure, cloud cover, precipitation, radiation, U and V winds); remote sensing (chlorophyll concentration and sea surface temperature); Oceanic Nino Index; and HAB monitoring data (phytoplankton counts and toxin levels in shellfish samples obtained from 39 points located in shellfish farms distributed along the SC coastline). This study analyzed the period from 2007-01-01 to 2019-12-31 (7035 records in the HAB database) and used descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses to draw correlations among environmental parameters and the occurrence of algal blooms (AB), HAB and toxic events. Dinophysis spp. AB were the most registered type of event and tended to occur during the late autumn and winter months. These events were associated with high atmospheric pressure, predominance of westerly and southerly winds, low solar radiation and low sea and air temperature. An inverted pattern was observed for Pseudo-nitzschia spp. AB, which were mostly registered during the summer and early autumn months. These results give evidence that the patterns of occurrence of highly prevalent toxin-producing microalgae reported worldwide, such as the Dinophysis AB during the summer, differ along the coast of SC. Our findings also show that meteorological data, such as wind direction and speed, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation and air temperature, might all be key predictive modeling input parameters, whereas remote sensing estimates of chlorophyll, which are currently used as a proxy for the occurrence of AB, seem to be a poor predictor of HAB in this geographic area.

TI  - Remote sensing evaluation of Chinese mainland's comprehensive natural resources carrying capacity and its spatial-temporal variation characteristics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid economy development and population growth, China is facing a pressure on the high demand in natural resources. However, most of the natural resource carrying capacity (NRCC) studies considered only on a single natural element, and the data sources showed some limitations. The traditional assessment approach is difficult to provide a comprehensive level of natural resources rapidly for China. Therefore, this study aims to develop a multiple factors NRCC assessment framework by using both remote sensing (RS) satellite data and Geographic Information System (GIS) and to explain the distribution characteristics and spatial-temporal variation characteristics of NRCC from multiple perspectives. The impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors on NRCC in mainland China from 2003 to 2019 were analyzed. The results show that most of the provinces are on an upward trend in the NRCC changes and is significantly higher in the eastern part than in the western part of mainland China. The areas with rapid and significant changes are mainly distributed at the junction of Shaanxi and Shanxi. The overall coefficient of variation of the study area is 0.09, with stable changes, but the stability is worse in the unused land distribution area. The analysis of influencing factors showed that precipitation and temperature were positively correlated with NRCC. The positive correlation was stronger in the regions of bad NRCC, unused land, and grassland. The NRCC values decreased significantly with the increasing elevation. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between NRCC and human activity pressure from the provincial analysis. This study provides a relatively complete framework for regional natural resource evaluation, which is conducive to promoting sustainable development in mainland China and can effectively evaluate the results of natural resources conservation work and provide effective suggestions for the next step of restoration work.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crude economic development models create severe environmental pressures. Eco-efficiency (EE) is an important basis for evaluating ecological civilization in China. Under the national strategy of ecological priority and green development in China's Yangtze River Economic Belt, the urban agglomerations in the middle reaches of Yangtze River (UAMRYR) was considered as a case study and an evaluation index system of county EE was constructed based on multi-source remote sensing data, the EE values from 2009 to 2018 were measured by a super slack -based measure (Super-SBM) model, the spatial correlations of EE were revealed by an improved gravity model, the spatial network characteristics of EE were portrayed by social network analysis, and the nature of network effects were further explored by multiple linear regression models. Findings of the study included EE has been shown to be indeed spatially correlated.The EE of the nodes, the differences increased, the transmission pattern was relatively stable, and the association was characterized by bidirectional inequity. The spatial network of EE was characterized by small groups, whose tightness was small and increasingly loose overall, and the overall network operation efficiency is low. In terms of the spatial structure of individual network, the Degree Centrality (DC) showed the circle structure, the Closeness Centrality (CC) demonstrated 'central collapse', and the Betweenness Centrality (BC) evolved into five 'core-periphery' sub-groups from the 'circle distribution'. Regarding the structural effects, in terms of EE improvement, the UAMRYR nodes were mainly through the agglomeration effect as well as dissemination channels and spillover paths, the core nodes were self-sufficient, and the edge nodes mainly relied on, the radiation role of core nodes, the transmission role of intermediary nodes, and their own active integration and connection roles. This study provides a new perspective for un-derstanding EE and these findings are important for promoting the synergistic improvement of green develop-ment in China and other countries.

TI  - Diagnosing sentinel lymph node metastasis of T1/T2 breast cancer with conventional ultrasound combined with double contrast-enhanced ultrasound: a preliminary study
T2  - QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: In patients with T1/T2 breast cancer (BC), sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is essential for prognosis and treatment. This study investigated the value of conventional ultrasound combined with double contrast-enhanced ultrasound in diagnosing the metastasis of SLNs in patients with T1/T2 BC.Methods: This study employed a prospective design (this diagnostic study was not registered on a clinical trial platform), and the participants formed a convenience series. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 163 patients with BC who received treatment in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from July 2017 to December 2021 were included in this study. A total of 165 SLNs from 163 patients with T1/T2 BC were analyzed. All patients underwent percutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound (PCEUS) to trace SLNs before the operation. Subsequently, all patients underwent conventional ultrasound and intravenous contrast-enhanced ultrasound (ICEUS) examinations to observe the SLNs. The results of the conventional ultrasound, ICEUS, and PCEUS of the SLNs were analyzed. The associations between the risk of SLN metastasis and imaging features were evaluated via a nomogram based on the pathological results.Results: Overall, 54 metastatic SLNs and 111 nonmetastatic SLNs were evaluated. Metastatic SLNs displayed a greater cortical thickness, area ratio, eccentric fatty hilum, and hybrid blood flow on conventional ultrasound compared with nonmetastatic SLNs (P<0.001). According to PCEUS, 75.93% of metastatic SLNs showed heterogeneous enhancement (type II and III), and 73.88% of nonmetastatic SLNs showed homogeneous enhancement (type I; P<0.001). According to ICEUS, heterogeneous enhancement (type B/ C, 20.37% vs. 11.71%) and overall enhancement (55.56% vs. 23.42%) were more common in metastatic SLNs than in nonmetastatic SLNs (P<0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that the cortical thickness and enhancement type of PCEUS were independent predictors of SLN metastasis. Moreover, a nomogram combining these factors showed a high diagnostic ability for SLN metastasis (unadjusted concordance index 0.860, 95% CI: 0.730-0.990; bootstrap-corrected concordance index 0.853).Conclusions: The nomogram of cortical thickness and enhancement type of PCEUS could effectively diagnose SLN metastasis in patients with T1/T2 BC.

TI  - Near-real-time drought monitoring and assessment for vineyard production on a regional scale with standard precipitation and vegetation indices using Landsat and CHIRPS datasets
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a complicated and slow-moving natural disaster that has severe impacts on plant greenness and yields by interrupting plant photosynthetic activity. These issues mostly happen due to water shortages and elevated temperatures. Grapes are sensitive to water stress during the summer, when high evapotranspiration is combined with very low precipitation. Therefore, the main aim of this research was to identify drought-affected vineyards on a regional scale by satellite remote sensing images with a standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standard vegetation index (SVI). The time-series standard vegetation index (SVI) was developed from the time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for 2013-2021, and the time-series SPI was calculated from time-series CHIRPS rainfall using the Google Earth engine (GEE). Drought severity maps were classified based on thresholds from extremely dry to extremely wet. Validation was performed between drought indices and grape yield at the regional level using regression analysis. The results indicated that the years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2021 were characterized by drought across the region within the berry formation and veraison growth phases of table grape before harvest. The most drought-affected years were 2018 and 2021. In 2018, 4785.03 ha, and in 2021, 1825.83 ha were extremely affected by drought. Moreover, the validation results indicated that the highest variability of table grape yield with SPI (r(2) = 0.62) was observed in June. However, table grape yield with SVI had the highest variation in July (r(2) = 0.60). The multiple linear regression between the average yield (ton/ha) and drought indices (SVI and SPI) showed the highest accuracy in June (r(2) = 0.79, MSE = 0.2) and July (r(2) = 0.71, MSE = 0.3). These findings suggest that SVI and SPI can be utilized for large-scale near-real-time drought monitoring and assessment to develop a regional subsidy program to support grape growers during a drought.

TI  - Assessing the capability of Sentinel-2 time-series to estimate soil organic carbon and clay content at local scale in croplands
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing data methods is affordable for the mapping of soil properties of the plowed layer over croplands. Carried out in the framework of the ongoing STEROPES project of the European Joint H2020 Program SOIL, this work is focused on the feasibility of Sentinel-2 based approaches for the high resolution mapping of topsoil clay and organic carbon (SOC) contents at the within-farm or within-field scales, for cropland sites of contrasted climates and soil types across the Northern hemisphere. Four pixelwise temporal mosaicking methods, using a two years-Sentinel-2 time series and several spectral indices (NDVI, NBR2, BSI, S2WI), were developed and compared for i) pure bare soil condition (maxBSI), ii) driest soil condition (minS2WI), iii) average bare soil condition (Median) and iv) dry soil conditions excluding extreme reflectance values (R90). Three spectral modeling approaches, using the Sentinel-2 bands of the output temporal mosaics as covariates, were tested and compared: (i) Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) algorithm; (ii) QRF adding longitude and latitude as covariates (QRFxy); (iii) a hybrid approach, Linear Mixed Effect Model (LMEM), that includes spatial autocorrelation of the soil properties. We tested pairs of mosaic and spectral approaches on ten sites in Turkiye, Italy, Lithuania, and USA where soil samples were collected and SOC and clay content were measured in the lab. The average RPIQ of the best performances among the test sites was 2.50 both for SOC (RMSE = 0.15%) and clay (RMSE = 3.3%). Both accuracy level and uncertainty were mainly influenced by site characteristics of cloud frequency, soil types and management. Generally, the models including a spatial component (QRFxy and LMEM) were the best performing, while the best spatial mosaicking approaches mostly were Median and R90. The most frequent optimal combination of mosaicking and model type was Median or R90 and QRFxy for SOC, and R90 and LMEM for clay estimation.

TI  - Bio-optical properties of South Brazil Bight coastal waters and implications for satellite chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration retrieval
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieving chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) from remote-sensing data is especially challenging in coastal regions because of the presence of other co-dominant optically significant constituents (OSCs). In this study, we characterize bio-optical variability at a fixed coastal time series station in the South Brazil Bight (SBB), the ANTARES-Ubatuba site (Sao Paulo, Brazil) from radiometric measurements and water sample analyses, and evaluate the performance of ocean colour (OC) algorithms for Chla retrieval. In situ Chla and the spectral absorption of phytoplankton (a(ph)), detritus, and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), as well as the above-water remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) were obtained from 2004 to 2019 at a quasi-monthly sampling frequency. Chla exhibited high variability, with a standard deviation twice as large as the mean (1.0 +/- 1.83 mg m(-3)), and values ranging from 0.18 mg m(-3) up to 18.09 mg m(-3) during episodic bloom events. CDOM was the dominant OSC contributing to the absorption coefficient at 443 nm all-year round, suggesting the influence of continental sources, even though the station is located at the external limit of the inner shelf (40 m). Two optical water types were defined: one composed mainly of 'blue' waters with lower concentrations of the OSCs and another of 'green' waters with higher concentrations of OSCs. Despite the CDOM spectral dominance, the empirical OCx performed reasonably well with a positive bias for both in situ (17-25%) and satellite (25-31%) Chla retrievals. The performance was slightly better using the 3-band OC3 algorithm by selecting the best band ratio with lower influence of CDM (CDOM + detritus) absorption (R-rs (490/555)). The main sources of uncertainty were caused by higher CDM proportions and phytoplankton-specific absorption, yielding positive biases on the OC3 retrievals. The results suggest that standard satellite products of Chla can be used (with some caution) to monitor and study the dynamics of the phytoplankton biomass within the region, knowing the expected uncertainties.

TI  - Retrieving leaf area index from FY-3D MERSI-II data using a sensor-adaptive algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI), officially listed as one of essential climate variables, quantifies the structure and amount of vegetation and characterizes the interaction between vegetation and climate. The advanced MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI-II) onboard FengYun-3D (FY-3D) can provide twice-daily global observations of earth at a spatial resolution of 250 m. Therefore, it has great potential for promoting the improvement of global LAI products and boosting the development of earth system modelling. However, the existing methods are mostly sensor-specific, they can not be directly applied to MERSI-II data for LAI generation. In this paper, we proposed a sensor-adaptive approach for LAI estimation based on MERSI-II observations. This method is composed of an LAI retrieval look-up table based on radiative transfer theory, which was calibrated by a global optimizing algorithm to adapt MERSI-II characteristics, and a backup algorithm training neural networks with MERSI-II Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI. We evaluated the MERSI-II LAI retrievals by intercomparison to MODIS products over mainland China and direct validation using ground-based upscaled LAI reference maps. The assessments demonstrate that (1) the derived MERSI-II LAI products agree well with the MODIS benchmarks in both spatial and temporal respects; (2) compared to the MODIS LAI, the MERSI-II LAI retrievals with less gaps show great potential in improving spatiotemporal continuity; (3) validation versus in-situ measurements reveals acceptable accuracy of the MERSI-II LAI products with a R-2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.82; (4) the proposed parametric optimization strategy could successfully transplant MODIS LAI algorithm to MERSI-II data.

TI  - K-shell radiation and bright spot characteristics of high-energy-density Fe-Cr-Ni plasmas influenced by X-pinch load geometry
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - K-shell radiation is diagnostically advantageous for the study of high-energy-density plasmas. The current work investigates the influence of load geometry on K-shell x-rays in Z-pinch plasmas produced on the 1-MA Zebra generator. Stainless steel (Fe: 69%, Cr: 20%, Ni: 9%) X-pinch wire loads are fielded with an interwire angle of 31 degrees (small-angle) or 62.5 degrees (large-angle), respectively and studied using various x-ray diode, imaging, and spectroscopic diagnostics. The large-angle geometry produced large, individual x-ray-emitting bright spots ( > 3 keV) at the wire cross-point averaging areas >= 1 mm2, with noteworthy soft x-ray ( > 0.75 keV) bursts and radiation yields <= 14.6 kJ. The small-angle geometry produced multiple x-ray-emitting bright spots extending the pinch axis with smaller average sizes ( <= 0.5 mm2), consistent with stronger current, increased radiation yield ( >= 15.5 kJ), and notable hard x-ray ( > 9 keV) bursts, which peak with largest cumulative bright spot size. Spectroscopic analysis is performed with non-LTE collisional-radiative modeling, indicating a cold, nonthermal plasma region radiating from neutral to Ne -like ions, a hot, thermal region radiating from Fe and Cr He-and Li-like ions, and an intermediate region radiating K alpha satellites from Li-like to O-like ions. Modeling of the nonthermal and satellite features imply a fractional hot electron abundance-0.1% and-0.5% for large-and small-angle geometries, respectively. Relative intensity analysis is performed on He alpha and K alpha lines, revealing intensity ratios that deviate from the original wire composition. Optical depth estimates allude to optically thick, thermal K-shell plasmas with densities consistent with non-LTE modeling. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - PurposeThe purpose was to investigate the diagnostic performance of bimodal optical and radio-guided sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) sub-sites in the anterior oral cavity.MethodsProspective study of 50 consecutive patients with cN0 OSCC scheduled for SNB was injected with the tracer complex Tc99m:ICG:Nacocoll. A near-infrared camera was applied for optical SN detection. Endpoints were modality for intraoperative SN detection and false omission rate at follow-up.ResultsIn all patients, a SN could be detected. In 12/50 (24%) of cases, the SPECT/CT showed no focus in level 1, but intraoperatively a SN in level 1 was optically detected. In 22/50 cases (44%), an additional SN was identified only due to the optical imaging. At follow-up, the false omission rate was 0%.ConclusionOptical imaging appears to be an effective tool to allow real-time SN identification comprising level 1 unaffected by possible interference of radiation site from the injection.

T2  - Biodiversity (Ottawa)
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses the trends, patterns and determinants of biodiversity conservation in the Buxa Tiger Reserve (BTR), India. Temporal remote sensing data from 1990 to 2020 shows a loss of 27.69 km2. The results show that the total forest area has seen a significant decline from 1990 to 2020, whereas non-forest and degraded forest areas have been on the rise. The decline of forest area is observed more in fringe and lower altitude areas where accessibility is easy for humans to extract forest resources. The secondary data shows a decline in the wildlife population including the flagship species, the Bengal tiger. The decline in natural resources due to human activities in the BTR is likely to continue unless a participatory biodiversity conservation programme is established. The establishment of the Joint Forest Management Committee (JFMC), a formal local institution where local communities and forest departments (FDs) jointly share the rights and responsibility towards the use and management of the forest, seems to be effective in reducing negative forest activities. The sustainability of the BTR is possible if the local people abandon the 'tragedy of the commons' activities and work together, with government guidance for the promotion of livelihoods and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Spatial-temporal analysis of coal fire risk identification and suppression assessment with satellite time series mapping 2013-2020 in Midong coalfield, Xinjiang, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spontaneous combustion of underground coal seam leads to significant loss of coal resource while causing serious geological disasters, environmental degradation and social security problems. The Midong Coalfield in Urumqi was selected to conduct research on dynamic detection and assessment of underground coal fires from 2013 to 2020 based on time series satellite imagery of Landsat-8. The land surface temperature (LST) was retrieved using RTE. The hotspot SFSE was proposed to map the spatial-temporal distribution of coal fires. The CTIR was also established to solve how to comprehensively evaluate the intensity and spatial variations of coal fire thermal island effect. Based on Sequence Overlap Analysis the integrated dynamic interpretation of thermal anomaly intensity, area and migration of coal fire hazard has been provided. In addition, the TADC was proposed to effectively reflect the active fire centre and aggregation tendency. The results show that: The RTE inversion error is within 4.6 degrees C, verified with the surveyed LST. The overall accuracy of fire thermal anomaly extraction by HSA by field-tested exceeds 65%. A feature can be judged to be a fire pixel when its recurrence reaches 75% or more of the total number of observation frequency. The maximum and minimum extent extracted of the total fire area is 65.6x10(5) and 46.6x10(5) m(2), respectively. And the overall expansion rate is 1.29x10(5) m(2) year(-1), in 82% agreement with the measurement. The burning intensity of CTIR first increases 0.024 year(-1) averagely, but then decreases at a rate of 0.0055 year(-1). Fractures and faults in the fire-affected area play a critical role in fire induction and distribution. Frequent mining and excavation activities are confirmed to accelerate the further fire production and propagation. After suppression, the relevant fire area has shrunken by up to 60%, while the overall CTIR is reduced by more than 70%.

TI  - Partial analysis increments as diagnostic for LETKF data assimilation systems
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Local ensemble transform Kalman filters (LETKFs) allow explicit calculation of the Kalman gain, and by this the contribution of individual observations to the analysis field. Though this is a known feature, the information on the analysis contribution of individual observations (partial analysis increment) has not been used as systematic diagnostic up to now despite providing valuable information. In this study, we demonstrate three potential applications based on partial analysis increments in the regional modelling system of Deutscher Wetterdienst and propose their use for optimising LETKF data assimilation systems, in particular with respect to satellite data assimilation and localisation. While exact calculation of partial analysis increments would require saving the large, five-dimensional ensemble weight matrix in the analysis step, it is possible to compute an approximation from standard LETKF output. We calculate the Kalman gain based on ensemble analysis perturbations, which is an approximation in the case of localisation. However, this only introduces minor errors, as the localisation function changes very gradually among nearby grid points. On the other hand, the influence of observations always depends on the presence of other observations and settings for the observation error and for localisation. However, the influence of observations behaves approximately linearly, meaning that the assimilation of other observations primarily decreases the magnitude of the influence, but it does not change the overall structure of the partial analysis increments. This means that the calculation of partial analysis increments can be used as an efficient diagnostic to investigate the three-dimensional influence of observations in the assimilation system. Furthermore, the diagnostic can be used to detect whether the influence of additional experimental observations is in accordance with other observations without conducting computationally expensive single-observation experiments. Last but not least, the calculation can be used to approximate the influence an observation would have when applying different assimilation settings.

TI  - Mapping inundation extents in Poyang Lake area using Sentinel-1 data and transformer-based change detection method
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely mapping of inundation extents during flood periods is essential for disaster evaluation and development of rescue strategies. With unique advantages over the optical sensors (e.g., little effect of clouds, and observations at day and night), Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors provide an important data source for mapping inundation, particularly during flood periods. Freely available SAR images from Sentinel-1 have been increasingly used for many applications. This study applied an efficient transformer-based change detection method, bitemporal image transformer (BiT) with bitemporal Sentniel-1 images, to map inundation extents and evolution in Poyang Lake area in 2020. The transformer-based change detection method firstly adopted ResNet for high-level semantic features extraction, and applied a transformer mechanism to refine these features pixelwise, followed by employing a FCN as the prediction head for generating the results of change detection. Besides, we constructed a water change detection dataset with spatial-and-temporal generalization from bitemporal Sentinel-1 images; this dataset consists of the seasonal variation water samples of Poyang Lake for years. We compared the results from the BiT method with other convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods (STANets and SNUNet). Mapped inundation extents were evaluated with the ground truth visually derived from high spatial resolution images. The evaluation showed the BiT method generated high accurate mapped inundation extents with the F1-score of 95.5%. The BiT model has proven its superior performance in detecting increased water. Based on the results of the BiT method, the variation of inundation extents in Poyang Lake during May-November 2020 was further analyzed. It was found that the water surface coverage of Poyang Lake is the smallest in late May; it gradually increased to the maximum on 14th July, and then began to stabilize and show a significant downward trend before November. The flood distribution map shows that cultivated land has been inundated with the largest area of approximately 600 km2.

TI  - Interpretation of southern hemisphere humpback whale diet via stable isotopes; implications of tissue-specific analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Blubber and skin are commonly used tissues in stable isotope analysis for the purpose of investigating cetacean diet. Critical comparison of tissue-specific isotopic signals is, however, lacking resulting in uncertainty surrounding the representativeness and therefore utility of different tissues for accurate determination of recent foraging. This study used remotely biopsied blubber and skin tissues from southern hemisphere humpback whales for strategic comparison of delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Samples were collected between 2008-2018 as part of long-term monitoring under the Humpback Whale Sentinel Program. Blubber tissues were lipid-extracted prior to analysis, whilst mathematical lipid-correction was performed on skin samples. Isotopic values from paired blubber and skin samples from the same individuals were compared to assess whether tissues could be used interchangeably for isotope analysis and dietary interpretation. Significant differences were observed for both delta C-13 and delta N-15, flagging previously undocumented methodological considerations, and the need for method validation and standardisation in application of these approaches. This study therefore advances methodological aspects of cetacean dietary analysis. This is of elevated importance in the context of rapidly changing ocean ecosystems.

TI  - Relict landslide detection using deep-learning architectures for image segmentation in rainforest areas: a new framework
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are destructive and recurrent natural disasters on steep slopes and represent a risk to lives and properties. Knowledge of relict landslides' location is vital to understand their mechanisms, update inventory maps and improve risk assessment. However, relict landslide mapping is complex in tropical regions covered with rainforest vegetation. A new CNN framework is proposed for semi-automatic detection of relict landslides, which uses a dataset generated by a k-means clustering algorithm and has a pre-training step. The weights computed in the pre-training are used to fine-tune the CNN training process. A comparison between the proposed and the standard framework is performed using CBERS-04A WPM images. Three CNNs for semantic segmentation are used (Unet, FPN and Linknet) with two augmented datasets. A total of 42 combinations of CNNs are tested. Values of precision and recall were very similar between the combinations tested. Recall was higher than 75% for every combination, but precision values were usually smaller than 20%. False positives (FP) samples were addressed as the cause for these low precision values. Predictions of the proposed framework were more accurate and correctly detected more landslides. This work demonstrates that there are limitations for detecting relict landslides in areas covered with rainforest, mainly related to similarities between the spectral response of pastures and deforested areas with Gleichenella sp. ferns, commonly used as an indicator of landslide scars. Relict landslide detection has limitations in rainforest environments The proposed framework for CNN semantic segmentation proved to be useful for relict landslide detection Land cover features spectral characteristics, and input data technical specificities are crucial to the accuracy of CNN models No optimal combination of parameters has been identified No CNN proved to be superior

AB  - This article explores the relations between the idea of deep incarnation and scientific ideas of an informational universe, in which mass, energy, and information belong together. It is argued that the cosmic Christologies developed in the vein of Cappadocian theology (fourth century) and the Franciscan theologian Bonaventure (thirteenth century) can be interpreted as precursors of an informational worldview by consistently blending "formative" and "material" aspects of creativity. Reversely, contemporary sciences of information can enlarge the scope of the contemporary view of deep incarnation. I propose three hypotheses for showing how and why. First, mass, energy, and information have an equal causal importance for explaining reality. Second, just as transformation presupposes communication, so communication presupposes information. Third, contemporary science can elucidate seminal concerns of the idea of deep incarnation, insofar as informational structures pave the way for information capture, communication, and transformation. At the level of organismic life, new features of embodied cognition and emotion come up, important for understanding the organismic depth of the concrete incarnation in Jesus of Nazareth.

TI  - A remotely sensed weight gain model for sheep in the semi-arid Karoo shrublands of South Africa
T2  - RANGELAND JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of animal weight gain is expensive as it often involves the rounding up of animals over large areas and long distances. Such monitoring is an arduous process that causes stress related health problems and weight loss in animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of remotely sensed vegetation indices for modelling sheep weight gain in semi-arid rangelands. The temporal and spatial patterns of grazing were investigated using Sentinel-2 imagery, collar data obtained from a global position system (GPS), and data of sheep weight related to grazing hotspots. Historical animal weight data were compared statistically with nine commonly used spectral indices extracted from Sentinel-2 imagery to determine how vegetation conditions relate to sheep weight gain. Sheep appeared to adapt their grazing behaviour according to time of the year, with the average distance walked per sheep per day in line with previous studies. In contrast to distance walked, sheep at lower stocking densities used less grazing area than at higher densities. The normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) proved to best model liveweight changes. By combining remote sensing (RS) and GPS data, our understanding of sheep grazing patterns and sheep weight gain was improved. This can lead to the optimisation of production potential through precision farming. The finding has applications for studies conducted on non-reproductive sheep in semi-arid Karoo rangeland systems of South Africa. Because the model is both cost-effective and replicable, it offers a long-term monitoring template for livestock studies elsewhere.

TI  - Higher greenspace exposure is associated with a decreased risk of childhood asthma in Shanghai-A megacity in China
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Inconsistent evidence exists about whether exposure to greenspace benefits childhood asthma. Previous studies have only focused on residential or school greenspace, and no research has combined greenspace exposures at both homes and schools to determine their link with childhood asthma. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 16,605 children during 2019 in Shanghai, China. Self-reported questionnaires were used to collect information on childhood asthma and demographic, socioeconomic and behavioural factors. Envi-ronmental data including ambient temperature, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 1 mu m (PM1), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were collected from satellite data. Binomial generalized linear models with a logit link were carried out to evaluate the association between greenspace exposure and children's asthma, as well as the effect modifiers. An interquartile range increment of whole greenspace (NDVI500, NDVI250, EVI500, and EVI250) exposure was associated with a reduced odds ratio of children's asthma (0.88, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.99; 0.89, 95% CI: 0.79, 1.01; 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.99; and 0.88, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.99, respectively) after controlling potential confounders. Low temperature, low PM1, males, vaginal delivery, suburban/rural area, and without family history of allergy appeared to enhance the greenspace-asthma association. Increased greenspace exposure was associated with a lower risk of childhood asthma, and the association was modified by a range of socio-environmental factors. These findings add to the body of evidence on the benefits of biodiversity and supporting the promotion of urban greenspace to protect children's health.

TI  - Climate change is leading to rapid shifts in seasonality in the himalaya
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Climate change has significantly impacted vegetation phenology across the globe with vegetation experiencing an advance in the spring green-up phases and a delay in fall senescence. However, some studies from high latitudes and high elevations have instead shown delayed spring phenology, owing to a lack of chilling fulfillment and altered snow cover and photoperiods. Here we use the MODIS satellite-derived view-angle corrected surface reflectance data (MCD43A4) to document the four phenological phases in the high elevations of the Sikkim Himalaya and compared the phenological trends between below-treeline zones and above-treeline zones. This analysis of remotely sensed data for the study period (2001-2017) reveals considerable shifts in the phenology of the Sikkim Himalaya. Advances in the spring start of the season phase (SOS) were more pronounced than delays in the dates for maturity (MAT), senescence (EOS), and advanced dormancy (DOR). The SOS significantly advanced by 21.3 days while the MAT and EOS were delayed by 15.7 days and 6.5 days respectively over the 17-year study period. The DOR showed an advance of 8.2 days over the study period. The region below the treeline showed more pronounced shifts in phenology with respect to an advanced SOS and a delayed EOS and DOR that above treeline. The MAT, however, showed a greater delay in the zone above the treeline than below. Lastly, unlike other studies from high elevations, there is no indication that winter chilling requirements are driving the spring phenology in this region. We discuss four possible explanations for why vegetation phenology in the high elevations of the Eastern Himalaya may exhibit trends independent of chilling requirements and soil moisture due to mediation by snow cover.

TI  - Rapid mapping and spatial analysis on the distribution of photovoltaic power stations with Sentinel-1&2 images in Chinese coastal provinces
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) solar energy generation attracts considerable attention to archive carbon neutrality goals worldwide. Geospatial data describing the PV system based on satellite images are critical for PV deployment. However, it remains challenging to obtain relative data in coastal zones due to frequent cloud cover. There have also been relatively few studies on spatial analysis of PV development in terms of solar resources and the energy demands. Therefore, this study took Chinese coastal provinces as example, and proposed a random forest classification method with information on morphology, optics, and SAR to address cloud pollution. The results obtained were analyzed with geographical and socioeconomic factors to determine its development status. The results have shown that (1) by October 2022, the total PV area in Chinese coastal provinces reached 837.3 km(2), with an overall accuracy of 96.9 % and a Kappa coefficient of 0.91. Water-based PV represents 33.7 % which tended to be distributed near the shoreline. (2) Bounded by the Huai River, the PV density in the north was 9.0 km(2) per 10(4) km(2), which is more than twice that in the south. The development of water-based PV is a key reason for the high PV construction density in coastal areas. (3) PV distribution was slightly mismatched with solar resource and power demand, especially in Liaoning and Guangdong. Liaoning has relatively high potential for PV development. The study findings can play a key role in evaluation of PV power generation, development potential, and ecological environmental impacts.

TI  - The Impact of an Electromagnetic Seed Localization Device Versus Wire Localization on Breast-Conserving Surgery: A Matched-Pair Analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundFor breast-conserving surgery (BCS), several alternatives to wire localization (WL) have been developed. The newest, electromagnetic seed localization (ESL), provides three-dimensional navigation using the electrosurgical tool. This study assessed operative times, specimen volumes, margin positivity, and re-excision rates for ESL and WL.MethodsPatients who had ESL-guided breast-conserving surgery between August 2020 and August 2021 were reviewed and matched one-to-one with patients who had WL based on surgeon, procedure type, and pathology. Variables were compared between ESL and WL using Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher's exact tests.ResultsThe study matched 97 patients who underwent excisional biopsy (n = 20) or partial mastectomy with (n = 53) or without (n = 24) sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using ESL. The median operative time for ESL versus WL for lumpectomy was 66 versus 69 min with SLNB (p = 0.76) and 40 versus 34.5 min without SLNB (p = 0.17). The median specimen volume was 36 cm(3) using ESL versus 55 cm(3) using WL (p = 0.001). For the patients with measurable tumor volume, excess tissue was greater using WL versus ESL (median, 73.2 vs. 52.5 cm(3); p = 0.017). The margins were positive for 10 (10 %) of the 97 ESL patients and 18 (19 %) of the 97 WL patients (p = 0.17). In the ESL group, 6 (6 %) of the 97 patients had a subsequent re-excision compared with 13 (13 %) of the 97 WL patients (p = 0.15).ConclusionsDespite similar operative times, ESL is superior to WL, as evidenced by decreased specimen volume and excess tissue excised. Although the difference was not statistically significant, ESL resulted in fewer positive margins and re-excisions than WL. Further studies are needed to confirm that ESL is the most advantageous of the two methods.

TI  - Impact of Covid-19 lockdown regulations on PM<sub>2.</sub>5 and trace gases (NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, HCHO, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>) over Lahore, Pakistan
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic altered the human mobility and economic activities immensely, as authorities enforced unprecedented lock down regulations. In order to reduce the spread of COVID-19, a complete lockdown was observed between 24 March - 31 May 2020 in Pakistan. This paper aims at investigating the PM(2.)5, AOD and column amounts of six trace gases (NO2, SO2, CH4, HCHO, C2H2O2, and O-3) by comparing periods of reduced emissions during lockdown periods with reference periods without emission reductions over Lahore, Pakistan. HYSPLIT cluster trajectory analyses were performed, which confirmed similar meteorological flow conditions during lockdown and reference periods. This provides confidence that any change in air quality conditions would be due to changes in human activities and associated emissions. The results show about 38% reduction in ambient surface PM2.5 levels during the lockdown period. This change also positively correlated with MODISDB and AERONETAOD data with a decrease of AOD by 42% and 35%, respectively. Reductions for tropospheric columns of NO2 and SO2 were about 20% and 50%, respectively during a semi lockdown period, while no reduction in the CH4, C2H2O2, HCHO and O-3 levels occurred. During the lockdown period NO2, O-3 and CH4 were about 50%, 45% and 25% lower, respectively, but no reduction in SO2, C2H2O2 and HCHO levels were noticed compared to the reference lockdown period for Lahore. HYSPLIT cluster trajectory analysis revealed the greatest impact on Lahore air quality through local emissions and regional transport from the east (agricultural burning and industry).

TI  - Proxying economic activity with daytime satellite imagery: Filling data gaps across time and space
T2  - PNAS NEXUS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper develops a novel procedure for proxying economic activity with daytime satellite imagery across time periods and spatial units, for which reliable data on economic activity are otherwise not available. In developing this unique proxy, we apply machine-learning techniques to a historical time series of daytime satellite imagery dating back to 1984. Compared to satellite data on night light intensity, another common economic proxy, our proxy more precisely predicts economic activity at smaller regional levels and over longer time horizons. We demonstrate our measure's usefulness for the example of Germany, where East German data on economic activity are unavailable for detailed regional levels and historical time series. Our procedure is generalizable to any region in the world, and it has great potential for analyzing historical economic developments, evaluating local policy reforms, and controlling for economic activity at highly disaggregated regional levels in econometric applications.

TI  - A study of internal solitary waves in the Northern South China Sea using the Geo High-Speed Imager of the FY-4B satellite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The FY-4B satellite is the first operational satellite of China's new generation of geostationary-orbit meteorological satellites in the Fengyun-4 series. This study is the first to analyse the changes in the dynamic processes of internal solitary waves (ISWs) in the northern South China Sea using FY-4B Geo High-Speed Imager (GHI) data with a 250 m spatial resolution. By calculating the propagation direction, wave crest line length, distance between ISW packets and other characteristics of ISWs and comparing them with FY-3D and MODIS optical images, the feasibility and reliability of using the FY-4B GHI to observe ISWs are verified. This study analyses the dynamic processes of ISW propagation at a high temporal resolution of up to 1 minute and observes ISW propagation processes at different sea depths, ISW evolution dynamics, ISW interaction processes, and the change processes of ISWs as they pass islands and reefs. A comparison between these results and in situ measurements obtained in the northern South China Sea demonstrates that the FY-4B GHI has the unique advantage of continuously tracking and observing ISWs in the northern South China Sea and can provide new tracking observations for the study of ISWs in the South China Sea.

TI  - The impact of pre-adulthood urbanicity on hippocampal subfield volumes and neurocognitive abilities in young adults
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Urbanicity refers to the conditions that are particular to urban areas and is a growing environmental challenge that may affect hippocampus and neurocognition. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the average pre-adulthood urbanicity on hippocampal subfield volumes and neurocognitive abilities as well as the sensitive age windows of the urbanicity effects.Participants and methods: We included 5,390 CHIMGEN participants (3,538 females; age: 23.69 +/- 2.26 years, range: 18-30 years). Pre-adulthood urbanicity of each participant was defined as the average value of annual night-time light (NL) or built-up% from age 0-18, which were extracted from remote-sensing satellite data based on annual residential coordinates of the participants. The hippocampal subfield volumes were calculated based on structural MRI and eight neurocognitive measures were assessed. The linear regression was applied to investigate the associations of pre-adulthood NL with hippocampal subfield volumes and neurocognitive abili-ties, mediation models were used to find the underlying pathways among urbanicity, hippocampus and neuro-cognition, and distributed lag models were used to identify sensitive age windows of urbanicity effect.Results: Higher pre-adulthood NL was associated with greater volumes in the left (beta = 0.100, 95%CI: [0.075, 0.125]) and right (0.078, [0.052, 0.103]) fimbria and left subiculum body (0.045, [0.020, 0.070]) and better neurocognitive abilities in information processing speed (-0.212, [-0.240,-0.183]), working memory (0.085, [0.057, 0.114]), episodic memory (0.107, [0.080, 0.135]), and immediate (0.094, [0.065, 0.123]) and delayed (0.087, [0.058, 0.116]) visuospatial recall, and hippocampal subfield volumes and visuospatial memory showed bilateral mediations for the urbanicity effects. Urbanicity effects were greatest on the fimbria in preschool and adolescence, on visuospatial memory and information processing from childhood to adolescence and on working memory after 14 years.Conclusion: These findings improve our understanding of the impact of urbanicity on hippocampus and neuro-cognitive abilities and will benefit for designing more targeted intervention for neurocognitive improvement.

TI  - Comparison of prevention of parent-to-child HIV transmission programme & national biennial HIV sentinel surveillance data for tracking HIV epidemic in India.
T2  - The Indian journal of medical research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background & objectives: HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) among antenatal women in India has been used to track the epidemic for many years. However, reliable tracking at the local level is not possible as ANC sentinel sites are limited in number and cover a smaller sample size at each site. Prevention of parent-to-child-transmission (PPTCT) programme data has a potential advantage due to better geographical coverage, which could provide more precise HIV case estimates; therefore, we compared HSS ANC data with PPTCT programme data for HIV tracking.Methods: Out of the 499 surveillance sites, where HSS and PPTCT programme was being conducted in 2015, 210 sites (140 urban and 70 rural) were selected using a stratified random sampling method. HSS (n=72,981) and PPTCT (n=112,832) data records were linked confidentially. The socio-demographic characteristics of HSS and PPTCT attendees were compared. HIV prevalence from HSS ANC was compared with the PPTCT programme data using Chi-square test. State- and site-level correlation of HIV prevalence was also done. Concordance between HSS and PPTCT HIV positivity was estimated using kappa statistics.Results: The age distribution of HSS and PPTCT attendees was similar (range: 23 to 27 yr); however, HSS ANC participants were better educated, whereas PPTCT recorded a higher proportion of homemakers. The correlation of HIV prevalence between HSS and PPTCT was high (r=0.9) at the State level and moderate at the site level (r=0.7). The HIV positivity agreement between HSS ANC and PPTCT was good (kappa=0.633). A similar prevalence was reported across 26 States, whereas PPTCT had a significantly lower prevalence than HSS in three States where PPTCT coverage was low. Overall HIV prevalence was 0.31 per cent in HSS and 0.22 per cent in PPTCT (P<0.001).Interpretation & conclusions: High-quality PPTCT programme data can provide reliable HIV trends in India. An operational framework for PPTCT-based surveillance should be pilot-tested in a phased manner before replacing HSS with PPTCT.

TI  - Consistent, high-accuracy mapping of daily and sub-daily wildfire growth with satellite observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Fire research and management applications, such as fire behaviour analysis and emissions modelling, require consistent, highly resolved spatiotemporal information on wildfire growth progression. Aims. We developed a new fire mapping method that uses quality-assured sub-daily active fire/thermal anomaly satellite retrievals (2003-2020 MODIS and 2012-2020 VIIRS data) to develop a high-resolution wildfire growth dataset, including growth areas, perimeters, and cross-referenced fire information from agency reports. Methods. Satellite fire detections were buffered using a historical pixel-to-fire size relationship, then grouped spatiotemporally into individual fire events. Sub-daily and daily growth areas and perimeters were calculated for each fire event. After assembly, fire event characteristics including location, size, and date, were merged with agency records to create a cross-referenced dataset. Key results. Our satellite-based total fire size shows excellent agreement with agency records for MODIS (R-2 = 0.95) and VIIRS (R-2 = 0.97) in California. VIIRS-based estimates show improvement over MODIS for fires with areas less than 4047 ha (10 000 acres). To our knowledge, this is the finest resolution quality-assured fire growth dataset available. Conclusions and Implications. The novel spatiotemporal resolution and methodological consistency of our dataset can enable advances in fire behaviour and fire weather research and model development efforts, smoke modelling, and near real-time fire monitoring.

AB  - The Adams Bay site is a Native American monumental centre located in the Mississippi River Delta (MRD), a dynamic, geomorphic environment comprised of marshes, bayous, and rivers. The site itself was constructed approximately 600 to 800 years ago by Indigenous communities who are the ancestors of modern-day coastal communities. Earthen mounds at Adams Bay have disappeared over the past 70 years, and the last remaining mound at the site has almost completely eroded away over the past 10 years. This is an environment that is rapidly subsiding, eroding, and becoming inundated due to sea-level rise, and within this environment are hundreds of earthen and shell mounds. This study uses Sentinel-2 and National Agriculture Imagery Program data to document decadal changes to the landscape at Adams Bay and posits that mound-building had net positive impacts on biodiversity and vegetation in this marshy, deltaic environment. Sites like Adams Bay provide remarkable ecosystem services, enhancing the resilience of coastal ecosystems, and they must be studied and/or preserved before being lost to climatic and environmental forces. Finally, these sites are still incredibly significant to modern Indigenous communities who live in the coastal zone today, and additional resources need to be dedicated towards their conservation.

TI  - A novel three-band macroalgae detection index (TMI) for aquatic environments
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Overgrowth of algae is a serious threat for aquatic ecosystems. This threat has occurred frequently in recent decades due to increased anthropogenic activities. Thus, understanding how the aquatic environment promotes algae growth by comprehensive monitoring is essential for protecting and sustaining aquatic ecosystems. We propose a novel Three band Macroalgae Index (TMI) using the green, red and near-infrared bands of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) as a robust remote sensing indicator for detecting and monitoring algae overgrowth in aquatic ecosystems. The proposed index has been tested in different water quality conditions in different aquatic environments. These conditions always vary between different images even if the study area is the same, e.g. atmospheric aerosols, refraction of water-leaving radiance according to sun and view angles, and sun glint on the surface which is influenced by waves and currents. Also, the six study areas were selected because of their water quality differences, including open ocean and inland lakes, e.g. Great Salt Lake being hypersaline waters, Lake St. Claire regarded as moderately eutrophic and open ocean waters in English Channel. A cross-comparison among the TMI and nine existing algal bloom indices indicated the superior performance of TMI (90%-100%), with reference to similarity to the OC2-based-TSI classifications. The performance of the existing indices was inconsistent across varying environmental and water quality conditions. This might be attributed to several factors including, uncertainty of shortwave infrared band retrievals used by some indices over turbid waters, and dependence of those indices on specific geographical location and/or sensor. The TMI overcame these issues and is therefore an alternative index for algal bloom detection in different water types, as it uses the wavebands which are commonly available on many remote sensing systems.

TI  - A deep convolutional neural network for burn progression mapping using Sentinel-1 SAR time-series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires burn various natural ecosystems worldwide and can harm the environment and human life. Accordingly, real-time monitoring of this phenomenon and early decision-making warning is vital. Active remote sensing systems, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors, provide an excellent opportunity for burn mapping because they can penetrate through clouds and smoke day and night. In this study, the potential of Sentinel-1 SAR data was investigated by deploying a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework to map burn progression dynamically, in both supervised and transfer manners. Accordingly, an optimized deep architecture was designated to use SAR data features with high sensitivity to map the burned areas. The proposed method includes three main steps: 1) extraction of SAR indices, 2) training deep CNN model with a limited number of scenes and 3) assessing the transferability of the CNN for estimating burn progression for any unseen scene. Sentinel-1 SAR indices of log-ratio, radar burn difference (RBD), and difference of dual-polarization SAR vegetation index (Delta DPSVI) were obtained to be fed to the CNN. To validate the efficiency of the proposed approach, two fire events, i.e. the Derazno fire in Iran (2021) and the Rossomanno-Grottascura-Bellia fire in Italy (2017), were considered. For the scenes including training samples, the proposed method improved the overall accuracies (OAs) of classical machine learning techniques (i.e. SVM and RF) significantly (more than 4%). However, the improvement was minor when compared to a CNN using only log-ratio as the input channel (log-ratio CNN). For the scenes without training samples (unseen dates), the investigated transferred model performed substantially better (3% higher OA) compared to the other machine learning methods and the log-ratio CNN. This finding approves that the obtained SAR indices boost the transferability of the CNN model for burn progression mapping at unseen scenes.

TI  - Variational inference of ice shelf rheology with physics-informed machine learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Floating ice shelves that fringe the coast of Antarctica resist the flow of grounded ice into the ocean. One of the key factors governing the amount of flow resistance an ice shelf provides is the rigidity (related to viscosity) of the ice that constitutes it. Ice rigidity is highly heterogeneous and must be calibrated from spatially continuous surface observations assimilated into an ice-flow model. Realistic uncertainties in calibrated rigidity values are needed to quantify uncertainties in ice sheet and sea-level forecasts. Here, we present a physics-informed machine learning framework for inferring the full probability distribution of rigidity values for a given ice shelf, conditioned on ice surface velocity and thickness fields derived from remote-sensing data. We employ variational inference to jointly train neural networks and a variational Gaussian Process to reconstruct surface observations, rigidity values and uncertainties. Applying the framework to synthetic and large ice shelves in Antarctica demonstrates that rigidity is well-constrained where ice deformation is measurable within the noise level of the observations. Further reduction in uncertainties can be achieved by complementing variational inference with conventional inversion methods. Our results demonstrate a path forward for continuously updated calibrations of ice flow parameters from remote-sensing observations.

TI  - Mapping floods from remote sensing data and quantifying the effects of surface obstruction by clouds and vegetation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are one of the most devastating natural calamities affecting millions of people and causing damage all around the globe. Flood models and remote sensing imagery are often used to predict and understand flooding. An increasing number of earth observation satellites are producing data at a rate that far outpaces our ability to manually extract meaningful information from it, motivating a surge in research on automatic feature detection in satellite imagery using machine learning and deep learning algorithms to automate flood mapping so that information from large streams of data can be extracted in near-real time and used for disaster response at landscape scale. The development of such an algorithm is predicated on exposure to training datasets that are representative of the full range of diversity in the spatial and spectral signature of surface water as it is sampled by space-based instruments. To address these needs, we developed a semantically labeled dataset of high-resolution multispectral imagery (Maxar WorldView 2/3) strategically sampled to be representative of North American surface water variability along five spatiotemporal strata: latitude, topographic complexity, land use, and day of year. This dataset was utilized to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically detect inundation extents using the Deep Earth Learning, Tools, and Analysis (DELTA) framework, an open source TensorFlow/Keras interpreter for satellite imagery. Our research objective was to demonstrate the out-of-sample accuracy of our trained CNN at landscape scale. The model performed well, with 98% precision and 94% recall for the water class during validation. We then evaluated the accuracy of our satellite-derived flood maps from trained machine learning model against a hydraulic model. For this, we compared predicted inundation extents against the USGS Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) Program's flood map library at 17 different locations, where the FIM library provides flood inundation extents based on hydraulic models built for river reaches and corre-sponding to stage measurements at a nearby USGS gaging site. Compared to the hydraulic model, we estimated the underprediction of flood inundation by optical remote sensing data in our areas of interest to be 62%. We used land use data from National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and cloud masks to estimate that 79% of underprediction was due to these obstructions, with 74% belonging to vegetation, 9% to clouds, and 4% to both. A significant amount of inundation is missed when only optical remote sensing data is considered, and we suggest the use of flood models along with remote sensing data for getting the most realistic flood inundation extents.

TI  - Fine-scale accuracy assessment of the 2016 National Land Cover Dataset for stream-based wildlife habitat
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficiently and effectively identifying and assessing potential wildlife habitat and important ecological resources is essential as rapid anthropogenic land use change alters and detrimentally affects terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Accuracy assessment of remotely sensed data supports ecological planning and management decisions, and is especially important when using freely available, coarse-resolution spatial datasets, such as the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). A popular dataset designed for application at larger regional to national spatial scales, the NLCD has been used in finer scale studies outside of its intended use, often without the imperative support of field-based accuracy assessment. We ground-truthed stratified random sampling points to assess the accuracy of the 2016 NLCD at a fine spatial scale relevant to stream-based ecological research. Our results demonstrated an overall accuracy of <65%, less than the United States Geological Survey recommended accuracy of >= 85%. Results indicated that the NLCD may not be effective as a tool for stream-level studies and could provide erroneous results for fine-scale habitat assessment and planning when used as the only reference dataset. When conducting ecological research, it is important to consider the appropriate scale, resolution, and limitations of available datasets to achieve the most accurate results.

TI  - Trends in antibiotic selection pressure generated in primary care and their association with sentinel antimicrobial resistance patterns in Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives We studied trends in antibiotic prescribing by primary care and assessed the associations between generated antibiotic selection pressure (ASP) and the prevalence of sentinel drug-resistant microorganisms (SDRMs). Methods The volume of antibiotic prescribing in primary and hospital care expressed in DDD/1000 inhabitants per day and the prevalences of SDRMs in European countries where GPs act as gatekeepers were obtained from the European Centre for Disease Control ESAC-NET. Associations were tested between (i) DDD and (ii) the Antibiotic Spectrum Index (ASI) as a proxy indicator for ASP, and the prevalences of three SDRMs: MRSA, MDR Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to macrolides. Results Fourteen European countries were included. Italy, Poland and Spain had the highest prevalence of SDRMs and prescribed the highest volume of antibiotics in primary care (average 17 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day), approximately twice that of countries with the lowest volumes. Moreover, the ASIs of these high antibiotic volume countries were approximately three times higher than those of the low-volume countries. Cumulative ASI showed the strongest association with a country's prevalence of SDRMs. The cumulative ASI generated from primary care was about four to five times higher than the cumulative ASI generated by hospital care. Conclusions Prevalences of SDRMs are associated with the volume of antimicrobial prescribing and in particular broad-spectrum antibiotics in European countries where GPs act as gatekeepers. The impact of ASP generated from primary care on increasing antimicrobial resistance may be much larger than currently assumed.

TI  - Spectral determinants of biological soil crusts in the Gurbantungut Desert
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As thick crustal layers form on dryland surfaces, they affect the spectral information that is originally dominated by sand or rock. The spectral characteristics of organic matter replace the mineral elements as prominent features. In this case, the growth patterns and spectral characteristics of biological soil crusts (BSCs) can be observed. Satellite spectral data have been used for BSC spatial information extraction. However, the dynamic changes in BSCs can affect the spectra. Two aspects are involved here: moisture change and BSC growth. When these changes are superimposed with BSC succession, they lead to an increase in spectral complexity. This study explored three BSC types, including algal crust, lichen and moss, and discussed their spectra. By selecting BSC samples at different succession states and by combining coverage and simulated precipitation, the response of the spectra to BSC coverage and the spectral characteristics of BSCs under dry and wet conditions were measured and analysed. In addition, the spectral index variations caused by coverage and moisture of three types of BSCs were discussed, where the spectral indices include the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), brightness index (BI), crust index (CI), and biological soil crust index (BSCI). The results showed that the succession, moisture and growth of BSCs were the main factors affecting their spectra. BSC types can be distinguished in a particular climatic context to determine the degree of BSC succession. Precipitation in the monitoring areas needs to be considered to avoid the effects of dry and wet BSC variations on remote sensing monitoring. The coverage of different types of BSCs in mixed pixels can be determined by multiple indices. The results of this study will provide a basis for monitoring BSCs using satellite spectral information to guide regional ecological management.

TI  - Cooperative simultaneous inversion of satellite-based real-time PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone levels using an improved deep learning model with attention mechanism
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) are air pollutants that can pose severe health risks. Surface PM2.5 and O3 concentrations can be monitored from satellites, but most retrieval methods retrieve PM2.5 or O3 separately and disregard the shared information between the two air pollutants, for example due to common emission sources. Using surface observations across China spanning 2014-2021, we found a strong relationship between PM2.5 and O3 with distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. Thus, in this study, we propose a new deep learning model called the Simultaneous Ozone and PM2.5 inversion deep neural Network (SOPiNet), which allows for daily real-time monitoring and full coverage of PM2.5 and O3 simultaneously at a spatial resolution of 5 km. SOPiNet employs the multi-head attention mechanism to better capture the temporal variations in PM2.5 and O3 based on previous days' conditions. Applying SOPiNet to MODIS data over China in 2022, using 2019-2021 to construct the network, we found that simultaneous retrievals of PM2.5 and O3 improved the performance compared with retrieving them independently: the temporal R2 increased from 0.66 to 0.72 for PM2.5, and from 0.79 to 0.82 for O3. The results suggest that near-real time satellite-based air quality monitoring can be improved by simultaneous retrieval of different but related pollutants. The codes of SOPiNet and its user guide are freely available online at https://github.com/RegiusQuant/ESIDLM.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil-texture classes in Batifa, Kurdistan Region of Iraq, using machine-learning models
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Soil texture is a key physical property that has a large effect on several other soil properties that are important for managing and planning agriculture. In the Batifa region (Iraq), there is currently no digital soil map on a moderate scale available. In this regard, remotely sensed data can aid in mapping soil-texture fractions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of three different machine-learning (ML) models (random forest [RF], support vector regression [SVR], and extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost]) to spatially estimate soil-texture classes using Landsat 8 and a digital elevation model (DEM). To this end, 96 soil samples with a surface layer 0-30-cm deep were collected to estimate their soil-texture fractions using 19 variables. These comprised Landsat Spectral Bands 1-7, 10, and 11, the Normalized Difference Soil Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, Simple Soil Ratio Clay Index, Brightness Index, Grain Size Index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Sand Index, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, Landsat Bareness Index, and DEM. High coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) values were used to select the best ML model. The results of this study showed that the XGBoost model estimated the soil-texture fractions (clay: R-2 = 90%, silt: R-2 = 85%, and sand: R-2 = 91%) better than the RF (clay: R-2 = 86%, silt: R-2 = 66%, and sand: R-2 = 86%) and SVR (clay: R-2 = 72%, silt: R-2 = 56%, and sand: R-2 = 86%) models. The best estimators of soil-texture fractions were the GSI for clay, the DEM for silt, and Band 10 for sand, followed by other variables based on satellite data. In general, however, the DEM is considered a good estimator for all soil-texture fractions. These findings will help support techniques for managing soil in places where the surface soil has different textures.

TI  - Underestimated mass loss from lake-terminating glaciers in the greater Himalaya
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accounting for subaqueous melting from lake-terminating glaciers increases estimated glacier mass loss across the Himalaya by 7% over the past 20 years, according to analysis of satellite observations and bathymetric measurements.Long-term satellite-based observations have helped quantify glacier mass change and the response of the hydrosphere to glacier changes. However, subaqueous mass loss associated with lake-terminating glaciers is not accounted for in geodetic methods, leading to an underestimation of glacier mass loss. Here we use multi-temporal satellite data and an empirical area-volume relationship to estimate the volume change of glacial lakes across the greater Himalaya and quantify subaqueous mass loss due to the replacement of ice with lake water. We show that proglacial lakes have increased 47% by number, 33 +/- 2% by area and 42 +/- 14% by volume from 2000 to 2020. The expansion of glacial lakes has resulted in 2.7 +/- 0.8 Gt of subaqueous mass loss between 2000 and 2020, such that the previous estimate of total mass loss of lake-terminating glaciers in the greater Himalaya is underestimated by 6.5 +/- 2.1%. Regionally, the largest underestimation (10 +/- 4%) occurred in the central Himalaya, where glacial lake growth has been the most rapid. Our estimates reduce uncertainties in total glacier mass loss, provide important data for glacio-hydrological models and therefore also support the water recources management in this sensitive mountain region.

TI  - A weighted contextual active fire detection algorithm based on Himawari-8 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Himawari-8, a geostationary satellite, is equipped with the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) sensor, which offers significant advantages for forest fire monitoring. This study proposes a weighted contextual fire detection algorithm (AHI_WFDA) that can apply to the AHI sensor as a global fire detection algorithm. Unlike the traditional pass-by screening algorithms, the algorithm takes into account the characteristics of different bands and assigns different weights and corresponding thresholds to the test conditions based on the bands' sensitivity to fire. To validate the algorithm's performance, we tested it on fires in five target areas. We regard MODIS data as the ground truth data and it was used as the benchmark for comparison with the AHI_WFDA , the Himawari-8 official product WLF, and the traditional spatial contextual algorithm (the reproduced SEVIRI algorithm). The results show that the AHI_WFDA significantly reduces the commission error rate compared to the WLF product. While our algorithm's accuracy rate is not superior to the SEVIRI algorithm, it detects more fire incidents correctly. Compared with the MODIS active fire product, the AHI_WFDA's omission error rate is about 63%. In contrast, the relative commission error rate is about 12%, which is in line with the results of some previous studies. In addition, we conducted detailed verification of our algorithm's results with the support of the Landsat series and Sentinel-2 data. The results show that the algorithm in this paper can effectively exploit the fire detection capability of AHI sensors and provide a new idea for the subsequent algorithms.

TI  - Changes in overwintering ground of small yellow croaker<i> </i>(<i>Larimichthys</i><i> polyactis</i>) based on MaxEnt and GARP models: A case study of the southern Yellow Sea stock
T2  - JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis), a commercially essential fish commonly caught in China and South Korea, is now facing a severe decline in resources. The recruitment and surplus of L. polyactis depend selecting a suitable marine environment for overwintering. However, the international overwintering migration habit of L. polyactis limits the investigation of its overwintering environment preferences and suitable grounds. In this study, based on the distribution data of L. polyactis in the southern Yellow Sea in winter from 2010 to 2019 and ocean remote sensing data such as sea bottom temperature (SBT), sea bottom salinity, chlorophyll-a concentration and water depth (Depth), we used the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and the genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP) models to investigate the overwintering grounds of the southern Yellow Sea stock (SYS). The jackknife test was used to assess the importance of various environmental factors. For modelling the overwintering ground distribution of SYS, the area under the curve values of both models were higher than 0.9. The overwintering ground was at 32 degrees 10' N-33 degrees 48' N, 122 degrees 30' E-125 degrees 00' E. The direction of its distribution was consistent with the Yellow Sea Warm Current in the southern Yellow Sea during the winter. Compared with the suitable overwintering area during 2010-2014, the highly appropriate overwintering area for SYS to overwinter decreased significantly during 2015-2019, showing a trend of moving to the east and north, related to the increase in fishing pressure and strengthening of the Yellow Sea Warm Current in recent years. Depth was the most significant factor for SYS overwintering, followed by SBT. The overwintering ground was at a depth of 40-65 m during the two periods. Additionally, the suitability of overwintering grounds in the coastal waters of south-western South Korea has gradually increased. This study provides a scientific basis for formulating effective strategies to manage L. polyactis resources under the China-South Korea Fisheries Agreement.

TI  - Testing and design on local-biaxial flexural interactive buckling behavior of high strength steel welded box beam-columns subjected to biaxial bending
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A testing research on the local-biaxial flexural interactive buckling of high strength steel Q460C, Q550D and Q690D welded box slender section beam-columns subjected to combined compression force and biaxial bending is reported. A total of thirteen median long steel columns, of which four manufactured from Q460C steel, five from Q550D steel and four from Q690D steel, were loaded until failure under biaxial eccentric compression forces. The local-biaxial flexural interaction buckling behavior is investigated by analyzing the test results. As an addition to the test data, the finite element parameter analyses are performed. The ultimate bearing capacities obtained from the test in this study and the numerical results presented in this study or in the existent literatures are compared with the calculation results in accordance with the design methods recommended in the American Specification ANSI/AISC 360-16, Eurocodes BS EN 1993-1-1 and BS EN 1993-1-5, and the newly proposed Effective Yield Strength Method (EYSM) and Effective Section Method (ESM) to check whether the current technical provisions and the new methods are suitable to the high strength steel beam-columns examined in this paper. The experimental and numerical results show that after taking the resistance factor into account, the ANSI/AISC 360-16, EN 1993-1-1 and BS EN 1993-1-5 are very conservative for the high strength steel beam-columns with greater member slenderness ratios (lambda = 80, 90, 100) or with smaller plate width-to-thickness ra-tios (square box sections with b/t = 40, or rectangular box sections with h/t = 40 or b/t = 17); the new proposed EYSM provides an excellent prediction of the ultimate bearing capacities of the beam-columns and thus suitable for the high strength steels; but the new proposed ESM gives a very conservative estimate, over the range of steel nominal yield stress fy = 460 MPa similar to 690 MPa, plate width-to-thickness ratio b/t = 40-80, member slenderness ratio lambda = 40-100.

TI  - Multisensor Satellite Data and Field Studies for Unravelling the Structural Evolution and Gold Metallogeny of the Gerf Ophiolitic Nappe, Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The gold mineralization located in the southern Eastern Desert of Egypt mostly occurs in characteristic geologic and structural settings. The gold-bearing quartz veins and the alteration zones are confined to the ductile shear zones between the highly deformed ophiolitic blocks, sheared metavolcanics, and gabbro-diorite rocks. The present study attempts to integrate multisensor remotely sensed data, structural analysis, and field investigation in unraveling the geologic and structural controls of gold mineralization in the Gabal Gerf area. Multispectral optical sensors of Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS (L8) and Sentinel-2B (S2B) were processed to map the lithologic rock units in the study area. Image processing algorithms including false color composite (FCC), band ratio (BR), principal component analysis (PCA), minimum noise fraction (MNF), and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) were effective in producing a comprehensive geologic map of the area. The mafic index (MI) = (B13-0.9147) x (B10-1.4366) of ASTER (A) thermal bands and a combined band ratio of S2B and ASTER of (S2B3+A9)/(S2B12+A8) were dramatically successful in discriminating the ophiolitic assemblage, that are considered the favorable lithology for the gold mineralization. Three alteration zones of argillic, phyllic and propylitic were spatially recognized using the mineral indices and constrained energy minimization (CEM) approach to ASTER data. The datasets of ALSO PALSAR and Sentinel-1B were subjected to PCA and filtering to extract the lineaments and their spatial densities in the area. Furthermore, the structural analysis revealed that the area has been subjected to three main phases of deformation; (i) NE-SW convergence and sinistral transpression (D2); (ii) similar to E-W far field compressional regime (D3), and (iii) extensional tectonics and terrane exhumation (D4). The gold-bearing quartz veins in several occurrences are controlled by D2 and D3 shear zones that cut heterogeneously deformed serpentinites, sheared metavolcanic rocks and gabbro-diorite intrusions. The information extracted from remotely sensed data, structural interpretation and fieldwork were used to produce a gold mineralization potential zones map which was verified by reference and field observations. The present study demonstrates the remote sensing capabilities for the identification of alteration zones and structural controls of the gold mineralization in highly deformed ophiolitic regions.

TI  - Determining the Extent of Soil Degradation Processes Using Trend Analyses at a Regional Multispectral Scale
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to ensure the sustainability of production from agricultural lands, the degradation processes surrounding the fertile land environment must be monitored. Human-induced risk and status of soil degradation (SD) were assessed in the Northern-Eastern part of the Nile delta using trend analyses for years 2013 to 2023. SD hotspot areas were identified using time-series analysis of satellite-derived indices as a small fraction of the difference between the observed indices and the geostatistical analyses projected from the soil data. The method operated on the assumption that the negative trend of photosynthetic capacity of plants is an indicator of SD independently of climate variability. Combinations of soil, water, and vegetation's indices were integrated to achieve the goals of the study. Thirteen soil profiles were dug in the hotspots areas. The soil was affected by salinity and alkalinity risks ranging from slight to strong, while compaction and waterlogging ranged from slight to moderate. According to the GIS-model results, 30% of the soils were subject to slight degradation threats, 50% were subject to strong risks, and 20% were subject to moderate risks. The primary human-caused sources of SD are excessive irrigation, poor conservation practices, improper utilisation of heavy machines, and insufficient drainage. Electrical conductivity (EC), exchangeable soil percentage (ESP), bulk density (BD), and water table depth were the main causes of SD in the area. Generally, chemical degradation risks were low, while physical risks were very high in the area. Trend analyses of remote sensing indices (RSI) proved to be effective and accurate tools to monitor environmental dynamic changes. Principal components analyses were used to compare and prioritise among the used RSI. RSI pixel-wise residual trend indicated SD areas were related to soil data. The spatial and temporal trends of the indices in the region followed the patterns of drought, salinity, soil moisture, and the difficulties in separating the impacts of drought and submerged on SD on vegetation photosynthetic capacity. Therefore, future studies of land degradation and desertification should proceed using indices as a factor predictor of SD analysis.

TI  - Characterizing groundwater potentials in parts of the basement complex of Nigeria using GIS and remote sensing
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater prospect in parts of southwestern Nigeria was delineated by inferring the subsurface models from the responses of remote sensing and GIS data. In characterizing the area, both primary and secondary data were used. The primary data include landsat8 OLI and ASTER Digital Elevation Model, while the secondary data includes geology, soil, and topography maps of the area. Hence, thematic maps of potentials and lineament density, and land cover/use maps for the area were derived from the landsat8 OLI/TRS image. Thus, the area was characterized as follows: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high potentiality that covered 1.4 km(2) (0.59%), 72.18 km(2) (9.59%), 372.3 km(2) (49.44%), 272.12 km(2) (36.14%), and 35 km(2) (4.64%), respectively. The western part of the area is dominated by very low to low potential, while the southern part of the area is dominated by high to very high potential. Hence, low and moderate potentials occupy the highest landmass (59.03%) in the area. In conclusion, the basement complex terrain in question has a moderately low aquifer capability.

T2  - DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study focuses on estimating evapotranspiration in arid and semi-arid environments in the Northern part of Saudi Arabia near Al-Jouf. The objective of the research is to study, analyze and estimate evapotranspiration (ET) using the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) and mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC) model and compare the two models with vegetation index and land surface temperature. The image was processed in ArcGIS and MATLAB software with the toolbox LandMOD ET mapper. The area aver-age evapotranspiration is about 2.21 mm/d for the METRIC model, 2.6 mm/d for SEBAL and the average land surface temperature is 324.3 K. ET and land surface temperature are highly inverse correlated, with an R-2 = 0.8. The value of ET ranges from 0.05 to 8 mm for both SEBAL and METRIC models during 2019/07/07. Both highly elevated and agricultural area shows a high value of ET ranging from 5 to 8 mm/d. In addition, the normalized differential vegetation index, leaf area index, and emissivity were also calculated from the surface energy balance equation. The estimation of ET from the SEBAL model is better than the METRIC model based on R-2 of different vegetation indices. The importance of the work is to estimate ET and explain the impact on environmental effects for better planning in water resource development.

TI  - Overview of the Application of Remote Sensing in Effective Monitoring of Water Quality Parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This study provides an overview of the techniques, shortcomings, and strengths of remote sensing (RS) applications in the effective retrieval and monitoring of water quality parameters (WQPs) such as chlorophyll-a concentration, turbidity, total suspended solids, colored dissolved organic matter, total dissolved solids among others. To be effectively retrieved by RS, these WQPs are categorized as optically active or inactive based on their influence on the optical characteristics measured by RS sensors. RS applications offer the opportunity for decisionmakers to quantify and monitor WQPs on a spatiotemporal scale effectively. The use of RS for water quality monitoring has been explored in many studies using empirical, analytical, semi-empirical, and machine-learning algorithms. RS spectral signatures have been applied for the estimation of WQPs using two categories of RS, namely, microwave and optical sensors. Optical RS, which has been heavily applied in the estimation of WQPs, is further grouped as spaceborne and airborne sensors based on the platform they are on board. The choice of a particular sensor to be used in any RS application depends on various factors including cost, and spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions of the images. Some of the known satellite sensors used in the literature and reviewed in this paper include the Multispectral Instrument aboard Sentinel-2A/B, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Landsat Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper, and Operational Land Imager.

TI  - Exploring the largest known Bronze Age earthworks in Europe through medium resolution multispectral satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to provide new insights into Europe's largest known Bronze Age earthworks using open-access and freely distributed medium resolution satellite images. The most extensive Bronze Age fortifications in Europe, namely, the Cornes , ti-Iarcuri and Sa circumflex accent ntana - Cetatea Veche sites, were investigated through the Sentinel 2 and the newly launched Landsat 9 optical sensors. Image processing techniques were applied to both datasets, including vegetation indices, orthogonal spectral transformations, and pan-sharpening techniques. The final results revealed several known and unknown archaeological proxies by enhancing a number of linear and curved crop marks in the vicinity of the archaeological sites. Indeed, while previously implemented geophysical results confirmed some of these archaeological proxies, new findings (crop marks) were also revealed, representing archaeological structures that were unknown until now. The study's overall findings indicate that medium resolution satellite images can be used in appropriate areas with archaeological interest as a first step toward better understanding the broader context of an area. The findings addressed in this study have a direct impact on the non-invasive aspect of archaeology, as the methodology employed in this paper may be applied to various types of sites in southwestern Romania and beyond and might serve as a solid starting point for any archaeo-logical project. Finally, this is the first elaboration of Landsat 9 intended for archaeological research and our study proves that its utility for archaeological and heritage purposes.

TI  - Radiometric Terrain Flattening of Geocoded Stacks of SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have described an efficient approach to radiometrically flatten geocoded stacks of calibrated synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for terrain-related effects. We have used simulation to demonstrate that, for the Sentinel-1 mission, one static radiometric terrain-flattening factor derived from actual SAR imaging metadata per imaging geometry is sufficient for flattening interferometrically compliant stacks of SAR data. We have quantified the loss of precision due to the application of static flattening factors, and show that these are well below the stated requirements of change-detection algorithms. Finally, we have discussed the implications of applying radiometric terrain flattening to geocoded SAR data instead of the traditional approach of flattening data provided in the original SAR image geometry. The proposed approach allows for efficient and consistent generation of five different Committee of Earth-Observation Satellites (CEOS) Analysis-Ready Dataset (ARD) families-Geocoded Single-Look Complex (GSLC), Interferometric Radar (InSAR), Normalized Radar Backscatter (NRB), Polarimetric Radar (POL) and Ocean Radar Backscatter (ORB) from SAR missions in a common framework.

TI  - TRADITIONAL AND UPDATED EVALUATION OF THE RANGELAND SITE AND CONDITION IN THE SEMIARID SCRUB OF THE HIGH PLATEAU
T2  - AGROCIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In Mexico, the concepts of rangeland site and condition are not well known. For this reason, most of the rangelands of private ranches on the high plateau of San Luis Potosi and Zacatecas are undergoing a process of severe generalized deterioration. The purpose of this study was to survey and characterize multi-branched rangeland sites of three beef cattle ranches on the San Luis Potosi-Zacatecas High Plateau, as well as to assess their condition using a quantitative ecological method complemented by updated technological tools. The hypothesis proposed was that the site and condition of rangeland evaluated with the quantitative ecological method (used for grasslands and soil), complemented by updated technology, are also identifiable in multi-branched rangelands of this type of production units on the San Luis Potosi-Zacatecas High Plateau. Based on a Landsat satellite image, an unsupervised classification process was performed for the three ranches, which was then confirmed by field observations. A total of 11 sites were surveyed, three on each ranch (microphyll desert scrub, predominantly Bouteloua gracilis; microphyll desert scrub, with predominance of Sporobolus airoides; and an ecotone between microphyll desert scrub and rosetophile desert scrub) and two exclusive locations (crassicaule scrub and rosetophile desert scrub with predominance of Muhlenbergia villiflora). Rangeland condition was evaluated by measuring density and volume (volumetric biomass) of the main plant species, categorized by forage value, and the actual state of the soil surface was assessed in terms of bare soil and vegetation, litter, feces and rock cover. The data were ordered and classified with the DECORANA and TWINSPAN modules from the PC-ORD program. Site and condition evaluation under this approach was satisfactory for surveying the state of the rangelands of the three private cattle ranches studied on the San Luis Potosi-Zacatecas High Plateau.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Estimates of Changes in Stored Groundwater at Local Scales: Case Study for Two Groundwater Subbasins in California's Central Valley
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable groundwater management requires high-quality and low-latency estimates of changes in groundwater storage ( increment S-gw). However, estimates of increment S-gw produced using traditional methods, including groundwater models and well-based measurements, typically lag years behind the present because collecting the required on-the-ground data is a time consuming, expensive, and labor-intensive task. Satellite remote sensing measurements provide potential pathways to overcome these limitations by quantifying increment S-gw through closing the water balance. However, the range of spatial scales over which increment S-gw can be accurately estimated using remote sensing products remains unclear. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study quantified increment S-gw for the period of 2002 through to 2021 using the water balance method and multiple remote sensing products in two subbasins (similar to 2700 km(2)-3500 km(2)) within California's Central Valley: (1) the Kaweah-Tule Subbasin, a region where the pumping of groundwater to support agriculture has resulted in decades of decline in head levels, resulting in land subsidence, damage to infrastructure, and contamination of drinking water and (2) the Butte Subbasin, which receives considerably more rainfall and surface water and has not experienced precipitous drops in groundwater. The remote sensing datasets which we utilized included multiple sources for key hydrologic components in the study area: precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture. To assess the fidelity of the remote sensing-based model, we compared estimates of increment S-gw to alternative estimates of increment S-gw derived from independent sources of data: groundwater wells as well as a widely used groundwater flow model. The results showed strong agreement in the Kaweah-Tule Subbasin in long-term increment S-gw trends and shorter-term trends during droughts, and modest agreement in the Butte Subbasin with remote sensing datasets suggesting more seasonal variability than validation datasets. Importantly, our analysis shows that the timely availability of remote sensing data can potentially enable increment S-gw estimates at sub-annual latencies, which is timelier than estimates derived through alternate methods, and thus can support adaptive management and decision making. The models developed herein can aid in assessing aquifer dynamics, and can guide the development of sustainable groundwater management practices at spatial scales relevant for management and decision making.

TI  - Capturing Small-Scale Surface Temperature Variation across Diverse Urban Land Uses with a Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization increases the urban land surface temperature (LST), challenging society and the environment. This study measured the LST of diverse land uses (LU) in Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) using a high-resolution (8 cm) thermal infrared sensor onboard a small, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). LUs included park (PA), industrial (IA), residential low-cost (RLC), and residential high-cost (RHC) areas. LST was collected by the UAV at different times on eight nonconsecutive days. UAV-collected LST was compared with that from Landsat 8-9 and in situ measurements. RHC reported the highest mean LST, and PA showed the lowest mean LST. Dark-colored asphalt shingle roofs in RHC had the highest mean LST range at 35.67 degrees C. Lower LST was measured in shaded areas and under thick green cover, whereas areas with thin green cover occasionally reported higher LST than pavements. The micro-urban heat island (MUHI) was calculated between LUs and within land cover types (roof, pavement, green, and water). The MUHI varied from 4.83 degrees C to 15.85 degrees C between LUs and 0.2 degrees C to 23.5 degrees C within LUs for the less than 1 km(2) study area. While the UAV thermal sensor and Landsat demonstrated a similar trend of LST variation, the UAV sensor reported more intense MUHI. An average percent bias (PBIAS) of 5.1% was calculated between the UAV sensor and in situ measurements. This study helps inform the urban design process by demonstrating how land use decisions impact LST locally and provides valuable insight for studies concerned with fine-scale urban LST variability.

TI  - Opportunities and Challenges of Spaceborne Sensors in Delineating Land Surface Temperature Trends: A Review
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Understanding the land surface temperature (LST) trends is crucial for policymakers and stakeholders to develop adaptation and mitigation strategies suitable for a sustainable environment coping in the face of climate change. This article presents a systematic review of the studies related to delineating spaceborne sensor-based LST trends, including information on the instruments and constellations of satellites (missions) that provide thermal infrared (TIR) and passive microwave (PMW) observations. About 99% of the studies used TIR, where 76% were Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, onboard Terra/Aqua) observations. Opportunities, challenges, and research gaps for using the TIR and PMW observations were also explored, with instruments onboard either polar-orbiting or geostationary satellites. We identified that the calibrated dataset (e.g., processed, harmonized, and standardized) is extremely limited for each constellation, with multiple satellites and instruments, to make it fully useful for the entire mission period. A few problematic methodological concepts were identified, including using a few images in a longer time series. Using only a few images, acquired on different calendar months in different years, would not provide the true annual trends over the study period because they can be influenced by seasonal variations. To estimate the warming or cooling daytime, nighttime, or diurnal LST trends, the use of MODIS observations could be useful, even though it does not acquire images during the maximum or minimum temperature in a daily cycle. This article indicated further investigations into those research gaps and recommended directions to overcome most of these limitations.

AB  - The synoptic, thermodynamic, and dynamic characteristics of a snowfall event that occurred in the Yeongdong region on March 1-2, 2021, were investigated. Surface weather charts, ERA5 reanalysis data, rawinsonde data, GK-2A satellite data, and WISSDOM data were used for analysis. The snow depth, exceeding 10 cm, was observed at four weather stations during the analysis period. The maximum snow depth (37.4 cm) occurred at Bukgangneung. According to the analysis of the weather charts, old and dry air was trapped within relatively warm, humid air in the upper atmosphere over the East Sea and adjacent Yeongdong region. This caused unstable atmospheric conditions that led to developing convective clouds and snowfall over Bukgangneung. In particular, based on the thermodynamic and kinematic vertical analysis, we suggest that strong winds attributable to the vertical gradient of potential temperature in the low layer and the development of convective instability due to cold advection played a significant role in the occurrence of snowfall in the Yeongdong region. These results were confirmed from the vertical analysis of the rawinsonde data.

TI  - ICESat-2 for Canopy Cover Estimation at Large-Scale on a Cloud-Based Platform
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy cover is an essential biophysical parameter of ecological significance, especially for characterizing woodlands and forests. This research focused on using data from the ICESat-2/ATLAS spaceborne lidar sensor, a photon-counting altimetry system, to map the forest canopy cover over a large country extent. The study proposed a novel approach to compute categorized canopy cover using photon-counting data and available ancillary Landsat images to build the canopy cover model. In addition, this research tested a cloud-mapping platform, the Google Earth Engine (GEE), as an example of a large-scale study. The canopy cover map of the Republic of Turkiye produced from this study has an average accuracy of over 70%. Even though the results were promising, it has been determined that the issues caused by the auxiliary data negatively affect the overall success. Moreover, while GEE offered many benefits, such as user-friendliness and convenience, it had processing limits that posed challenges for large-scale studies. Using weak or strong beams' segments separately did not show a significant difference in estimating canopy cover. Briefly, this study demonstrates the potential of using photon-counting data and GEE for mapping forest canopy cover at a large scale.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Land Use and Land Cover Changes on Aflaj Systems over a 36-Year Period
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aflaj systems represent unique irrigation technologies that have been implemented in the Sultanate of Oman. This innovative system, referred to as "falaj" in the singular form, is composed of a sophisticated network of underground tunnels and open-air channels designed to access shallow subterranean water tables, thereby providing water for residential and agricultural use. The aflaj systems have played a significant role in supporting sustainable water resource management in arid and semiarid regions, making a notable contribution to the socioeconomic development of the country. The alteration of land use and land cover (LULC) in arid and semiarid regions can have significant consequences for hydrological systems, affecting the ability of local ecosystems to manage fresh surface and groundwater resources. These changes are often caused by both natural and anthropogenic factors. To investigate the impact of LULC changes on aflaj systems in the northern part of Oman, we utilized satellite imagery, aflaj data, and spatial analytical and image processing techniques within the framework of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing. In the first part of the study, we quantified the changes in LULC and their impact on aflaj systems in seven cities in Oman due to urban expansion. In the second part, we evaluated the effect of LULC on groundwater for four major aflaj between 1985 and 2021. The study area was divided into four primary LULC classifications: vegetation, bodies of water, metropolitan areas, and bare soil. The classification maps demonstrated a high overall accuracy of 90% to 95%, indicating satisfactory performance. Our results revealed a significant reduction in vegetation areas between 1985 and 2021, primarily shifting from bare soil (BS) to urban areas (UAs) and from vegetation cover (VC) to BS, due to the reduction of groundwater resources. Over the four study periods (1985-1990, 1990-2000, 2000-2013, and 2013-2021), the percentages of the total area of Falaj Al-Muyasser, Falaj Daris, Falaj Al-Maliki, and Falaj Al-Khatmeen that transformed from agricultural lands to UAs were 40%, 39%, 32%, and 8%, respectively. Our study highlights the need for appropriate land management and planning to ensure the most effective solutions are utilized to meet social and economic sustainability requirements. In conclusion, our study presents a comprehensive analysis of LULC changes and their impact on aflaj systems over a 36-year period, providing new insights into the potential effects of LULC changes on groundwater resources and offering a basis for informed decision making on land management in arid and semiarid areas.

TI  - An assessment of the current epidemiological and laboratory capacities for influenza-like illnesses and severe acute respiratory infection surveillance, Yemen 2022
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: We aim to re-activate influenza sentinel surveillance system in Yemen after disruption related to repurposing for COVID-19 pandemic. WHO Country Office (CO) in collaboration with Yemen's Ministry of Public Health and Population (MOPH&P) jointly conducted an assessment mission to assess the current situation of the influenza sentinel surveillance system and assess its capacity to detect influenza epidemics and monitor trends in circulating influenza and other respiratory viruses of epidemic and pandemic potential. This study presents the results of the assessment for three sentinel sites located in Aden, Taiz, and Hadramout/Mukalla.Methodology: A mixed methods approach was used to guide the assessment process and to help achieve the objectives. Data were collected as follows: desk review of the sentinel sites records and data; interviews with stakeholders, including key informants and partners; and direct observation through field visits to the sentinel sites, MOPH&P and the Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL). Two assessment checklists were used: assessment of sentinel sites for SARI surveillance, and checklist for assessment of availability of SARI sentinel surveillance.Results and Conclusion: COVID-19 has affected health systems and services, and this was demonstrated in this assessment. The influenza sentinel surveillance system in Yemen is not effectively functional; however, there is plenty of room for improvement if investment in the system's restructuring, training, building technical and laboratory capacities, and conducting continuous and regular supervision visits.

TI  - Transmitting Culture through Building Systems: The Case of the Tile Vault
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Until now, the technology behind building systems has largely been neglected, and an exploration of the cultural transmission of these systems has been undervalued as a way of understanding changes in the symbolic worldview of society. This article analyses the developmental transitions in a specific building system, specifically the tile vault, as a case study that illustrates the changing values of a construction process as it has evolved, together with an understanding of the philosophy that has accompanied those changes over time. An ethnohistorical and ethnographic method has been used, enabling a longitudinal and rich analysis through time that illustrates the indissolubility of the technical issues from the prevailing social institutions of each era. These are based on a careful reading of changing conditions (environmental, social, and cultural), and of the progressive participatory appropriation which takes place through cooperative, synergistic working.

TI  - The Conception of Woman in the Thought of Maharal of Prague
T2  - REVIEW OF RABBINIC JUDAISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research has criticized medieval Jewish thought for perpetuating misogynist models inherited from Aristotle, which legitimate men's domination of women. Critics have focused on hylomorphism. By identifying man with "form" and women with "matter," Aristotle and his disciples placed the former beside being, intellect, and activ-ity, and the latter beside privation, irrationality, and passivity. This article shows how, during the Renaissance, hylomorphism was transformed by Judah Loew ben Betzalel (Maharal of Prague; 1512?-1609) in a manner more favorable to women. Maharal's thought still has a patriarchal worldview; nevertheless, he recognizes a positive value to matter, the body, and sexuality, assigning woman an active role within the marital couple as well as in the historical process that leads to redemption.

TI  - Drought Assessment across Erbil Using Satellite Products
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, meteorological and agricultural droughts across the Erbil province, Iraq, were assessed using remote sensing data and satellite products. To this end, the long-term (2000-2022) Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at 1- and 3-month accumulation periods (SPEI-1 and SPEI-3) as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) across Erbil were utilized. While the former was retrieved from the global SPEI data repository, the latter was derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The spatiotemporal variations in the SPEI indices indicated that two to nine extreme drought events occurred in the province with an increasing northward pattern. An increasing trend in the long-term NDVI series was also detected, having more diversity in vegetation coverage in the northern part of the province. The relationship between the SPEI and MODIS-NDVI was found to be positive but insignificant. Thus, we concluded that short-term meteorological droughts were not the only reason for the agricultural droughts in Erbil. Furthermore, the climate characteristics related to the cumulative water balance over a previous season is not an important trigger for the spatial variation in vegetation coverage across the province.

TI  - Investigation of the Atmospheric Chemical Properties over Kuwait
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Kuwait is a Middle Eastern country that is in the middle of the global dust belt. The country is also situated in the northeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula and is recognized for its deserts and its hot and arid climate. In this research, a comprehensive study of atmospheric air pollution over Kuwait has been proposed using satellite remote sensing data, in situ particulate matter suites distributed over Kuwait, and meteorological observation stations. Both natural aerosols beside anthropogenic particulate matter will be studied in this research. The vertical structure of atmospheric distribution is retrieved from space-borne CALIOP lidar. The POLIPHON method has been applied to lidar recording to separate dust and non-dust contribution. The combination of near-surface urban pollution and lofted dust aerosols are revealed in the atmosphere over Kuwait. The stratospheric, tropospheric, and total column amounts of SO2 will be retrieved from the Copernicus Sentinel-5p TROPOMI measurements. The results will also provide valuable information about the long-term trends of particulate air pollution in the atmosphere over Kuwait.

TI  - Optimizing testing strategies for early detection of disease outbreaks in animal trade networks via MCMC
T2  - CHAOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The animal trades between farms and other livestock holdings form a complex livestock trade network. The movement of animals between trade actors plays an important role in the spread of infectious diseases among premises. Particularly, the outbreak of silent diseases that have no clinically obvious symptoms in the animal trade system should be diagnosed by taking special tests. In practice, the authorities regularly conduct examinations on a random number of farms to make sure that there was no outbreak in the system. However, these actions, which aim to discover and block a disease cascade, are yet far from the effective and optimum solution and often fail to prevent epidemics. A testing strategy is defined as making decisions about distributing the fixed testing budget N between farms/nodes in the network. In this paper, first, we apply different heuristics for selecting sentinel farms on real and synthetic pig-trade networks and evaluate them by simulating disease spreading via the SI epidemic model. Later, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based testing strategy with the aim of early detection of outbreaks. The experimental results show that the proposed method can reasonably well decrease the size of the outbreak on both the realistic synthetic and real trade data. A targeted selection of an N / 52 fraction of nodes in the real pig-trade network based on the MCMC or simulated annealing can improve the performance of a baseline strategy by 89%. The best heuristic-based testing strategy results in a 75% reduction in the average size of the outbreak compared to that of the baseline testing strategy.

TI  - Detecting the Archaeological Traces of Tar Production Kilns in the Northern Boreal Forests Based on Airborne Laser Scanning and Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the development and application of a deep learning-based approach for semi-automated detection of tar production kilns using new Finnish high-density Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data in the boreal taiga forest zone. The historical significance of tar production, an important livelihood for centuries, has had extensive environmental and ecological impacts, particularly in the thinly inhabited northern and eastern parts of Finland. Despite being one of the most widespread archaeological features in the country, tar kilns have received relatively little attention until recently. The authors employed a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) U-Net-based algorithm to detect these features from the ALS data, which proved to be more accurate, faster, and capable of covering systematically larger spatial areas than human actors. It also produces more consistent, replicable, and ethically sustainable results. This semi-automated approach enabled the efficient location of a vast number of previously unknown archaeological features, significantly increasing the number of tar kilns in each study area compared to the previous situation. This has implications also for the cultural resource management in Finland. The authors' findings have influenced the preparation of the renewal of the Finnish Antiquities Act, raising concerns about the perceived impacts on cultural heritage management and land use sectors due to the projected tenfold increase in archaeological site detection using deep learning algorithms. The use of environmental remote sensing data may provide a means of examining the long-term cultural and ecological impacts of tar production in greater detail. Our pilot studies suggest that artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques have the potential to revolutionize archaeological research and cultural resource management in Finland, offering promising avenues for future exploration.

TI  - Holistic Reduction to Compare and Create New Indices for Global Inter-Seasonal Monitoring: Case Study for High Resolution Surface Water Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A remote sensing method that integrates virtual sampling from formalized visual interpretations is proposed to facilitate land cover mapping and enhance its accuracy, with an emphasis on spatial and temporal scalability. Indices are widely used for mapping and monitoring surface water across space and time; however, they typically display some kind of limitation across different environments and seasons. A decision matrix framework based on observations derived from interpretation keys was designed to compare the performance of existing indices alongside a set of newly developed indices. This comparison helped to shortlist indices that warranted further evaluation and accuracy assessment to identify effective indices for global inter-seasonal surface water extent mapping. Additional visual inspections were conducted for criteria that remained unresolved by the decision matrix to examine index consistency across the seasons in a wide range of geographic settings around the world, and further reduce the shortlist. An accuracy assessment was performed for three new shortlisted indices. On a global scale, CAWI (Comprehensive Automatic Water Index) was the best-performing index. Its distinct binary data distribution provides the possibility of regional automatic Otsu thresholding. CAWI was determined to be compatible for Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 sensors, providing the highest possible spatial resolution as well as the longest time series for retrospective analyses with freely available multispectral imagery. Two alternative indices were identified for sensors limited to the visible and NIR bands. The first index, CATWIC (Clear and Turbid Water Index Combination), split the classification of water into two components, with one index for generally clear water and another index for turbid water. The second, NDCHRWI (Normalized Difference Colourimetric High Resolution Water Index), applied the hue angle from a normalized difference RGB. Masking indices based on modified HSV Saturation equations were developed to reduce misclassification due to other high reflectance features. The indices' overall accuracies, respectively, were: 94.97%, 94.51%, and 94.85%. This study concludes with recommendations for the application of different indices for sensors possessing shortwave infrared bands and for sensors limited to the visible and NIR bands, with a simple stratification of six zones for Global Surface Water monitoring.

TI  - FAULT DETECTION USING PALSAR-1/2 IMAGE DATA FOR GROUNDWATER ANALYSIS IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHWEST OF br DJIBOUTI
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fault mapping is done to observe the possibility of fault-driven groundwater flow into the fault systems. Fault detection analysis on PALSAR-1/2 data has been implemented through a series of adaptive and gradient filters to derive a Relief Image. This method was applied to delineate good-resolution faults distribution and to revise faults mapping derived from existing geology maps over Djibouti. Study areas are located in the central and southwest of Djibouti, where faults exist because of continental plate movements, contact of geological formation, and tectonics activities. Results show that the processed Relief Image could delineate the fault lines and remove artifacts from PALSAR-1/2 data. Furthermore, the Geology Scoring Index was introduced in this study to analyze the correlation of groundwater data with the geology setting of borehole sites such as geological formation, fault system from Relief Image, distance to rivershed, type of aquifer, etc. It is shown that the occurrence of fault systems possibly increases the groundwater volume of boreholes in study areas. The proposed study is useful to locate the potential area for groundwater resources in Djibouti.

TI  - Appraisal of Climate Response to Vegetation Indices over Tropical Climate Region in India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme climate events are becoming increasingly frequent and intense due to the global climate change. The present investigation aims to ascertain the nature of the climatic variables association with the vegetation variables such as Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). In this study, the impact of climate change with respect to vegetation dynamics has been investigated over the Indian state of Haryana based on the monthly and yearly time-scale during the time period of 2010 to 2020. A time-series analysis of the climatic variables was carried out using the MODIS-derived NDVI and LAI datasets. The spatial mean for all the climatic variables except rainfall (taken sum for rainfall data to compute the accumulated rainfall) and vegetation parameters has been analyzed over the study area on monthly and yearly basis. The liaison of NDVI and LAI with the climatic variables were assessed at multi-temporal scale on the basis of Pearson correlation coefficients. The results obtained from the present investigation reveals that NDVI and LAI has strong significant relationship with climatic variables during the cropping months over study area. In contrast, during the non-cropping months, the relationship weakens but remains significant at the 0.05 significance level. Furthermore, the rainfall and relative humidity depict strong positive relationship with NDVI and LAI. On the other, negative trends were observed in case of other climatic variables due to the limitations of NDVI viz. saturation of values and lower sensitivity at higher LAI. The influence of aerosol optical depth was observed to be much higher on LAI as compared to NDVI. The present findings confirmed that the satellite-derived vegetation indices are significantly useful towards the advancement of knowledge about the association between climate variables and vegetation dynamics.

TI  - Using the Generic Analysis Method to Analyze Sentinel Event Reports Across Hospitals: A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PATIENT SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesImproving patient safety by investigating sentinel events (SEs) is hampered by the focus on isolated events within hospitals and a narrow scope of traditional root cause analysis methods. We aimed to examine if performing cross-hospital aggregate analysis of SEs applying a novel generic analysis method (GAM) bearing a human factor perspective can enhance learning from SEs.MethodsA retrospective cross-sectional review of SE reports from 28 Dutch general hospitals using the GAM to reanalyze events was performed. A qualitative approach was used to identify contributing factors and system issues. Findings were discussed with a patient safety expert panel. Descriptive statistics and measures of associations between domains were calculated.ResultsSixty-nine SE reports were reviewed. Applying the GAM provided a more holistic SE analysis than a traditional method. Of the 405 identified contributing factors in all SEs, the majority was related to the persons involved (patients and professionals, n = 146 [36.2%]) and the organization (n = 121 [30%]). The most frequently recurring pattern was the combination of factors related to the persons involved, the technology used, the tasks of professionals, and organizational factors influencing the event. Cross-hospital aggregate GAM analysis of SEs helped to identify system issues and propose more system-oriented overarching recommendations.ConclusionsThis study found that applying the GAM to analyze SEs across hospitals can help to improve learning from SEs and may result in proposing stronger recommendations. The method can support hospitals, working together in a network of hospitals, to jointly learn from SEs.

TI  - Estimating the Crop Acreage of Menthol Mint Crop from Remote Sensing Satellite Imagery Using ANN
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Acreage estimates are crucial for forecasting menthol mint acreage, as crop output figures fluctuate from year to year in response to fluctuations in the market price of menthol mint oil. Thus, there are yearly fluctuations in the maximum price that farmers can obtain. Since low production arises from low rates, and high production results from high prices, these acreage estimate studies may be useful in lowering uncertainty regarding menthol mints' output. The widespread adoption of remote sensing technologies for assessing crop acreage at both the national and international levels can be attributed to their low cost, ease of use, and flexibility. The extent of an area planted with menthol mint in the Vishakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh, India, was estimated using Sentinel-2A satellite data for that year. After conducting a comprehensive ground survey, the area of the menthol mint crop was estimated using an adaptive maximum chance-type set of rules for taluk-level statistics. According to the research, the Bheemunipatnam taluk in the Vishakhapatnam district was the most productive in growing menthol mint. Using customer and manufacturer accuracies of 89.13% and 87.23%, along with the average accuracy (90.67%) and kappa rate (0.9), the total acreage of menthol mint crop in the study region was estimated to be around 58,000,284.70 ha (0.844). A further aim in this study was to estimate the acreage planted with early and late menthol mint. Around 26,123.50 ha and 29,911.40 ha were found to be home to early menthol mint and late menthol mint, respectively. This method shows promise for early- and late-stage crop acreage assessment of menthol mint using a localised degree of precision.

TI  - Mapping Structurally Controlled Alterations Sparked by Hydrothermal Activity in the Fatira-Abu Zawal Area, Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - ACTA GEOLOGICA SINICA-ENGLISH EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eastern Desert of Egypt suffered a protracted period of deformation triggered by cratonization of the new juvenile crust known as the Arabian Nubian Shield (ANS), which has been proposed for potential gold discoveries associated with the corresponding tectonic event. The Fatira area, on the border of Egypt's Northern and Central Eastern Deserts, is covered with metavolcanic rocks twisted by a dextral relocation of the Fatira Shear Zone (FSZ) relative to the Barud magmatic body. The recent study evaluated many deformed post-orogenic granitic intrusions and felsite dikes associated with promising mineralization localities, notably orogenic gold deposits. The combination of various field observations and remote sensing data, followed by the analysis of aeromagnetic enhanced maps, allowed the differentiation of distinct lithologies, structural features, and hydrothermal alterations in the study area. Additionally, the integrated results obtained from the different interpretation techniques are utilized to identify and confirm the previously supposed mineralized localities in the Fatira and Abu Zawal areas and predict other matched localities. The final ASTER, Sentinel 2 hydrothermal alteration, and orientation entropy heat maps demonstrate the association between these mineralized regions and major structures related to the FSZ late stage of deformation rather than other structures studied throughout the area of interest.

CP  - 12th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT (ICEEM)
CL  - Iasi, ROMANIA
AB  - The purpose of this research was to analyse the dynamics of remote sensing indices calculated based on Sentinel 2 satellite images over a period of 5 years: 2017-2021. The analysed area is a protected natural area in Western Romania. Remote sensing images were taken in approximately the same month of each year and based on them the remote sensing indexes was determined: NDVI, MSAVI2, NDSI, SI and BI. An unsupervised classification of the RGB image from 2017 and 2021 was also performed. Based on the remote sensing data, strong correlations have resulted between NDVI and SI, NDVI and NDSI, NDVI and MSAVI2, SI and NDSI, SI and MSAVI2, NDSI and MSAVI2. Considering the high level of correlations between NDVI and SI, NDSI, MSAVI2 indices, the regression analysis was used in evaluating the predictive relationship of each index based on the spectral values of the NDVI index. Prediction of SI, NDSI, MSAVI2 values based on spectral data of the NDVI index was possible with high statistic accuracy. For SI, the statistical security obtained was expressed by R-2 = 0.89576, for NDSI the statistical security obtained was expressed by R-2= 0.9845 and for MSAVI2 the statistical security obtained was expressed by R-2= 0.99988. This study presents a recent and efficient approach to monitor protected areas, based on spectral information provided by remote sensing. This study provides useful scientific information for the management of the studied protected area.

TI  - Satellite-Based Estimation of Soil Moisture Content in Croplands: A Case Study in Golestan Province, North of Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) plays a critical role in soil science via its influences on agriculture, water resources management, and climate conditions. There is broad interest in finding relationships between groundwater recharge, soil characteristics, and plant properties for the quantification of SMC. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of optical satellite imagery for estimating the SMC over cropland areas. For this purpose, we collected 394 soil samples as targets in Gonbad-e Kavus in the Golestan province in the north of Iran, where a variety of crop types are cultivated. As input data, we first computed several spectral indices from Sentinel 2 (S2) and Landsat 8 (L8) images, such as the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI), and then analyzed their relationships with surveyed SMC using four machine learning regression algorithms: random forests (RFs), XGBoost, extra tree decision (EDT), and support vector machine (SVM). Results revealed a high and rather similar correlation between the spectral indices and measured SMC values for both S2 and L8 data. The EDT regression algorithm yielded the highest accuracy, with an R-2 = 0.82, MAE = 3.74, and RMSE = 1.08 for S2 and R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 2.42, and MAE = 1.08 for L8 images. Results also revealed that MNDWI, NDWI, and NDSI responded most sensitively to SMC estimation.

TI  - Assessing Urban Flood Hazard Vulnerability Using Multi-Criteria Decision Making and Geospatial Techniques in Nabadwip Municipality, West Bengal in India
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The flood hazard risks and vulnerability in the urban areas alongside major rivers of India have been gradually increasing due to extreme climatic events. The present study is intended to assess flood hazard vulnerability and potential risk areas and aims to ascertain the management strategies in Nabadwip Municipality, a statutory urban area of West Bengal. The multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) of selected criteria and geospatial techniques have been employed to determine the urban flood vulnerability in the study area. The study has been conducted using secondary datasets including relevant remotely sensed data and participant observation. The potential flood-affected zones have been determined using the normalized difference flood index (NDFI) and flood vulnerability index (FVI). The analysis of the standardized precipitation index (SPI) of 20 years of monthly precipitation shows the variability of seasonal rainfall distribution in the study area. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the composite Ibrahim index of socio-economic development accents that the urban development of the study area was uneven. The municipal wards situated in the central and northeastern portions of Nabadwip Municipality were extremely vulnerable, whereas the western and southwestern wards were less vulnerable. It is also revealed from the strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-challenges (SWOC) of the principal management strategies of the flood situation analysis that the unplanned sewerage system is one of the most effective weaknesses in the area. All-embracing and integrative flood management strategies need to be implemented in the study area considering the intra-regional vulnerability and development for the resilient and sustainable development of the study area.

TI  - Cyclonic circulation and climatology of SST, CHL and wind stress curl in a semi-enclosed bay (Bah?a de La Paz, Gulf of California, Mexico)
T2  - ATMOSFERA
M3  - Article
AB  - The first direct current observations (with the Lowering Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler [LADCP] and surface drifters) in Bahia de La Paz, in the southwestern Gulf of California (GC), concur with previous reports that the main dynamical feature during summer is a closed cyclonic circulation. However, we found that geostrophic calculations overestimate the speed of the orbital velocity: actual speeds (0.20-0.25 m s(-1)) were similar to 25-40% lower than those estimated from geostrophic balance (0.25-0.35 m s(-1)). The reason is that the centrifugal force cannot be neglected in this case. The mean rotation period during ship-borne observations in August 2004 was similar to 1.4 days, but it varied in the time that surface drifters were inside the bay, from similar to 1-2 days in June-July to similar to 2.5-3 days in September-October. The analysis of satellite data (wind velocity, sea surface temperature and chlorophyll) shows that from May to September the wind stress curl is strong and cyclonic, and the surface of the bay is cooler and richer than the adjacent Gulf of California waters, which could be attributed to the positive wind stress curl. This positive wind stress curl on the bay is part of a larger-scale positive wind stress curl distribution that surrounds the southern part of the Baja California Peninsula during summer, probably enhanced in the bay by local topography features. Although there is an exchange of water between the bay and the GC, its effect on the dynamics is poorly known.

TI  - Biophysical and biochemical features' feedback associated with a flood episode in a tropical river basin model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change scenarios such as frequent and extreme floods disturb the river basins by destructing the vegetation resulting in rehabilitation procedures being more costly. Thus, understanding the recovery and regeneration of vegetation followed by extreme flood events is critical for a successful rehabilitation process. Spatial and temporal variation of biochemical and biophysical features derived from remote sensing technology in vegetation can be incorporated to understand the recovery and regeneration of vegetation. The present study explores the flood impact on vegetation caused by major river basins in Sri Lanka (a model tropical river basin) by comparing pre-flood and post-flood cases. The study utilized enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), and gross primary productivity (GPP) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) platform. A remarkable decline in EVI, LAI, FPAR, GPP, and vegetation condition index was observed in the post-flood case. Notably, coupled GPP-EVI and GPP-LAI portrayed dependency of features and showed a significant impact triggered by the flood episode by narrowing the feature in post-flood events. EVI depicted the highest regeneration (0.333) while GPP presented the lowest regeneration (0.093) after the flood event. Further, it was revealed that 1.18 years have been on the regeneration. The regeneration of GPP and LAI remained low comparatively justifying the magnitude and impact of the flood event. The study revealed successful implications of vegetation indices on flood basin management of small to large tropical river basins.

TI  - EVI and NDVI as proxies for multifaceted avian diversity in urban areas.
T2  - Ecological Applications
M3  - Article
AB  - Most ecological studies use remote sensing to analyze broad-scale biodiversity patterns, focusing mainly on taxonomic diversity in natural landscapes. One of the most important effects of high levels of urbanization is species loss (i.e., biotic homogenization). Therefore, cost-effective and more efficient methods to monitor biological communities' distribution are essential. This study explores whether the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can predict multifaceted avian diversity, urban tolerance, and specialization in urban landscapes. We sampled bird communities among 15 European cities and extracted Landsat 30-meter resolution EVI and NDVI values of the pixels within a 50-m buffer of bird sample points using Google Earth Engine (32-day Landsat 8 Collection Tier 1). Mixed models were used to find the best associations of EVI and NDVI, predicting multiple avian diversity facets: Taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity, specialization levels, and urban tolerance. A total of 113 bird species across 15 cities from 10 different European countries were detected. EVI mean was the best predictor for foraging substrate specialization. NDVI mean was the best predictor for most avian diversity facets: taxonomic diversity, functional richness and evenness, phylogenetic diversity, phylogenetic species variability, community evolutionary distinctiveness, urban tolerance, diet foraging behavior, and habitat richness specialists. Finally, EVI and NDVI standard deviation were not the best predictors for any avian diversity facets studied. Our findings expand previous knowledge about EVI and NDVI as surrogates of avian diversity at a continental scale. Considering the European Commission's proposal for a Nature Restoration Law calling for expanding green urban space areas by 2050, we propose NDVI as a proxy of multiple facets of avian diversity to efficiently monitor bird community responses to land use changes in the cities.

TI  - A Neural Network-Based Cloud Mask for PREFIRE and Evaluation with Simulated Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Polar Radiant Energy in the Far Infrared Experiment (PREFIRE) will fill a gap in our understanding of polar processes and the polar climate by offering widespread, spectrally resolved measurements through the far-infrared (FIR) with two identical CubeSat spacecraft. While the polar regions are typically difficult for skillful cloud identification due to cold surface temperatures, the reflection by bright surfaces, and frequent temperature inversions, the inclusion of the FIR may offer increased spectral sensitivity, allowing for the detection of even thin ice clouds. This study assesses the potential skill, as well as limitations, of a neural network (NN)-based cloud mask using simulated spectra mimicking what the PREFIRE mission will capture. Analysis focuses on the polar regions. Clouds are found to be detected approximately 90% of time using the derived neural network. The NN's assigned confidence for whether a scene is "clear" or "cloudy" proves to be a skillful way in which quality flags can be attached to predictions. Clouds with higher cloud-top heights are typically more easily detected. Low-altitude clouds over polar surfaces, which are the most difficult for the NN to detect, are still detected over 80% of the time. The FIR portion of the spectrum is found to increase the detection of clear scenes and increase mid-to high-altitude cloud detection. Cloud detection skill improves through the use of the overlapping fields of view produced by the PREFIRE instrument's sampling strategy. Overlapping fields of view increase accuracy relative to the baseline NN while simultaneously predicting on a sub-FOV scale.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE COMPUTACAO APLICADA
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat island is a phenomenon that occurs in cities, causing a considerable increase in the temperature of the region in relation to neighboring areas. The objective of this article is the temporal analysis of the soil surface temperature, known as LST (Land Surface Temperature), and the NDVI Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), in order to assess the emergence of heat islands from digital image processing in the city of Rio Branco, capital of Acre state, from 2000 to 2020. For this purpose, digital images generated by the Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 satellite were used. The steps present in the SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithms for Land) model were applied to calculate the temperature and the vegetation index from the bands obtained with the satellite images. The results found for the NDVI indicate a decrease of 1.08% in medium/dense vegetation when comparing the years 2000 and 2020, the results also show an increase of 14.97% on the average temperature surface, mainly due to the reduction of green areas, disorderly urban growth and soil impermeability due to the asphalt coating. Therefore, these factors contributed to the appearance of Heat Islands, specifically in the analyzed area it is possible to notice the emergence of a Heat Island located in the center of the city of Rio Branco.

TI  - Shoreline Temporal Variability Inferred from Satellite Images at Mar del Plata, Argentina
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sandy beaches are fragile and dynamic coastal areas exposed to numerous environmental forcings. Systematic long-term data acquisition programs and exhaustive data series analyses are fundamental for a comprehensive understanding of the coastal processes. The software CoastSat was implemented to detect the shoreline position at beaches located to the south of Mar del Plata city (Buenos Aires Province, Argentina), by means of satellite images (period: 1986-2020). Tides in this area are mixed semidiurnal with a mean range of 1.74 m. The most frequent waves are characterized by significant wave heights from 0.5 to 2 m and periods of around 8 s propagating mainly from SSE. Seasonal and interannual variability and long-term trends of the shoreline position were investigated at Punta Mogotes (PM) bay, Faro Norte (FN) bay, and Ensenada Mogotes (EM). Seasonal cycles were noticed in the beach width variation series. In general, maximum accumulation was observed in summer and maximum erosion in winter. Exceptions were appreciated at southern PM bay (maximum accretion in autumn and maximum erosion in spring) and at FN bay (beach rotation on a seasonal scale). The drivers of seasonal variation are likely seasonal variations in the significant wave height and direction. PM bay showed a strong interannual variability with a clear alternating pattern between the northern and southern sectors of the bay, in an 8 +/- 1.2 years period. Long-term trends showed a generalized erosion along 9 of the 12 km of the analyzed coast.

TI  - Regional radiotherapy after primary systemic treatment for cN plus breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Pathologic complete response (pCR) after Primary Systemic Treatment (PST) for breast cancer is associated with excellent long-term outcomes. With increasing use of PST, the indication for regional nodal irradiation (RNI) has been challenged. The aim of this paper is to review the literature on de-escalation of RNI in patients treated with PST.We found no level 1 evidence on de-escalation of RNI after PST, but several randomized trials are ongoing. Consequently, current de-escalation strategies are based on cohort studies. These studies showed that in patients with low nodal tumour burden (LNTB) (<= 3 suspicious nodes at imaging) prior to PST, and ypN0 based on Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND), omission of RNI resulted in very low regional recurrences (RR) without compromising survival. In patients with LNTB and ypN0 based on Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB), omission of axillary treatment also resulted in low RR; the majority of these patients received local radiotherapy. Similarly, in patients with ypN1 (ALND) disease, omission of RNI resulted in low 5-year RR rates. Low RR-rates were also found in the few studies replacing ALND by RNI, in patients with ypN1 (SLNB) disease.In patients with high nodal tumour burden prior to PST and ypN0 (SLNB), replacing ALND by RNI also resulted in low RR. Due to the limited number of patients, these data should be interpreted with caution.We conclude that although level 1 evidence is lacking, de-escalation of RNI after PST can be considered in selected cases.

TI  - Yield Prediction for Winter Wheat with Machine Learning Models Using Sentinel-1, Topography, and Weather Data
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - We train and compare the performance of two different machine learning algorithms to learn changes in winter wheat production for fields from the southwest of Sweden. As input to these algorithms, we use cloud-penetrating Sentinel-1 polarimetry radar data together with respective field topography and local weather over four different years. We note that all of the input data were freely available. During training, we used information on winter wheat production over the fields of interest which was available from participating farmers. The two machine learning models we trained are the Light Gradient-Boosting Machine and a Feed-forward Neural Network. Our results show that Sentinel-1 data contain valuable information which can be used for training to predict winter wheat yield once two important steps are taken: performing a critical transformation of each pixel in the images to align it to the training data and then following up with despeckling treatment. Using this approach, we were able to achieve a top root mean square error of 0.75 tons per hectare and a top accuracy of 86% using a k-fold method with k=5. More importantly, however, we established that Sentinel-1 data alone are sufficient to predict yield with an average root mean square error of 0.89 tons per hectare, making this method feasible to employ worldwide.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Network Shows Greater Spatial and Temporal Stability in Multi-Annual Land Cover Mapping Than Pixel-Based Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery is the only feasible approach to annual monitoring and reporting on land cover change. Unfortunately, conventional pixel-based classification methods based on spectral response only (e.g., using random forests algorithms) have shown a lack of spatial and temporal stability due, for instance, to variability between individual pixels and changes in vegetation condition, respectively. Machine learning methods that consider spatial patterns in addition to reflectance can address some of these issues. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, U-Net, was trained for a 500 km x 500 km region in southeast Australia using annual Landsat geomedian data for the relatively dry and wet years of 2018 and 2020, respectively. The label data for model training was an eight-class classification inferred from a static land-use map, enhanced using forest-extent mapping. Here, we wished to analyse the benefits of CNN-based land cover mapping and reporting over 34 years (1987-2020). We used the trained model to generate annual land cover maps for a 100 km x 100 km tile near the Australian Capital Territory. We developed innovative diagnostic methods to assess spatial and temporal stability, analysed how the CNN method differs from pixel-based mapping and compared it with two reference land cover products available for some years. Our U-Net CNN results showed better spatial and temporal stability with, respectively, overall accuracy of 89% verses 82% for reference pixel-based mapping, and 76% of pixels unchanged over 33 years. This gave a clearer insight into where and when land cover change occurred compared to reference mapping, where only 30% of pixels were conserved. Remaining issues include edge effects associated with the CNN method and a limited ability to distinguish some land cover types (e.g., broadacre crops vs. pasture). We conclude that the CNN model was better for understanding broad-scale land cover change, use in environmental accounting and natural resource management, whereas pixel-based approaches sometimes more accurately represented small-scale changes in land cover.

TI  - Morphotectonic and morphostructural investigation in northwestern Minas Gerais State, Brazil: a lineament mapping assessment
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to investigate whether linear natural features are associated with structural or tectonic control of landforms and current drainage patterns in northwestern Minas Gerais State (Southeastern Brazil). To answer this question, more than 1,700 lineaments were manually mapped in a broader area encompassing the Paracatu and Urucuia River catchments. One satellite image scene (Operational Land Imager/Landsat-8), three different digital elevation models (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer-Global digital elevation model, and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and digitised analogical maps (geologic and topographic maps) were used to draw linear geometric features representing the lineament population. The resulting vector databases were integrated in a Geographic Information System for quantitative and spatial analyses, which resulted in two main trending lineament sets: NNW-SSE and NE-SW. Subsequent field assessments revealed that numerous lineaments from the first set were correlated to the formerly Upper Precambrian reverse and strike-slip faults. The second set were correlated to NE-SW normal faults derived from the Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectonic event following the breakup of Gondwana. These datasets contribute to a better understanding of the regional-, sub-regional-, and catchment-scale features underlying the structural control of the drainage network arrangement and pattern, which present long straight channels and are interrupted by anomalous and prominent bends that strictly fit major structural directions.

TI  - Challenges of acute febrile illness diagnosis in a national infectious diseases center in Rio de Janeiro: 16-year experience of syndromic surveillance
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionAcute febrile illnesses (AFI) are a frequent chief complaint in outpatients. Because the capacity to investigate the causative pathogen of AFIs is limited in low- and middle-income countries, patient management may be suboptimal. Understanding the distribution of causes of AFI can improve patient outcomes. This study aims to describe the most common etiologies diagnosed over a 16-years period in a national reference center for tropical diseases in a large urban center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. MethodsFrom August 2004-December 2019, 3591 patients > 12 years old, with AFI and/or rash were eligible. Complementary exams for etiological investigation were requested using syndromic classification as a decision guide. Results. Among the 3591 patients included, endemic arboviruses such as chikungunya (21%), dengue (15%) and zika (6%) were the most common laboratory-confirmed diagnosis, together with travel-related malaria (11%). Clinical presumptive diagnosis lacked sensitivity for emerging diseases such as zika (31%). Rickettsia disease and leptospirosis were rarely investigated and an infrequent finding when based purely on clinical features. Respiratory symptoms increased the odds for the diagnostic remaining inconclusive. ConclusionsNumerous patients did not have a conclusive etiologic diagnosis. Since syndromic classification used for standardization of etiological investigation and presumptive clinical diagnosis had moderate accuracy, it is necessary to incorporate new diagnostic technologies to improve diagnostic accuracy and surveillance capacity.Author summaryDifferent etiologies of acute fever may have an unspecific clinical presentation, especially in the early days of onset. Urban centers in low-and middle-income countries share the reality of overloaded healthcare systems-especially during outbreaks-whose diagnostic capacity is limited. Even in reference centers, determining the etiology of acute fever may not be possible in a large proportion of patients. The incidence of pathogens other than Malaria and Arboviruses is scarcely reported in Latin America. In cities where Dengue Fever is highly endemic, management of acutely ill patients is jeopardized by the unfamiliarity of health professionals with the spectrum possible diagnosis. Therefore, learning about the distribution of different etiologies of fever in outpatient services can impact positively in patient care. Since specific laboratory tests are determinant for differentiating among etiological agents of fever, further improvement for point-of-care diagnosis, as well as their availability for the front-row assistance settings is essential. This study aims to describe the most common etiologies of Acute Febrile Illnesses observed over a 16-year period time inside one of the largest reference centers for tropical diseases research in Brazil, discussing the accuracy of presumptive clinical diagnosis and the challenges of laboratorial investigation.

TI  - Outcome of Multidisciplinary Treatment of Merkel Cell Carcinoma of the Hand and Wrist
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Skin cancers are the most common malignancy of the hand and wrist. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive non-melanoma skin cancer arising from cutaneous neuroendocrine cells and is known for local and distant recurrence. The purpose of the current study was to examine the treatment outcome of patients with MCC of the hand and wrist. Patients and Methods: We reviewed 25 patients (18 males:7 females) with MCC that occurred in the hand and wrist. The mean age at the time of biopsy of 71 +/- 11 years. Results: Tumors were located on the hand (n=13), finger/thumb (n=9), and wrist (n=3). Local control included wide local excision (n=22). This included 21 non-amputation resections and one 5th digit ray amputation. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 21 patients with positive nodal disease in seven cases. Adjuvant radiotherapy was delivered to the primary site in 17 patients and additionally to the regional lymph node basin in six patients. Recurrence within five years was noted in 40% of patients (mean time to recurrence 18.4 +/- 20.6 months). Recurrence-free and disease -specific survival rates at 5-years were 54.8% and 67.6%. Conclusion: MCC is a rare cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma with a high propensity for regional nodal spread. Despite aggressive local treatment, adjuvant radiotherapy to the primary site and regional nodes, MCC of the hand and wrist has a high rate of recurrence and mortality within five years of diagnosis.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution of Ground Subsidence and Extensional Basin Bedrock Organization: An Application of Multitemporal Multi-Satellite SAR Interferometry
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the early 1990s, the European (ESA) and Italian (ASI) space agencies have managed and distributed a huge amount of satellite-recorded SAR data to the research community and private industries. Moreover, the availability of advanced cloud computing services implementing different multi-temporal SAR interferometry techniques allows the generation of deformation time series from massive SAR images. We exploit the information provided by a large PS dataset to determine the temporal trend of ground deformation and the relative deformation rate with millimetric accuracy to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of land subsidence induced by water pumping from a deep confined aquifer in the Northern Valle Umbra Basin (Central Italy), exploiting 24 years of Permanent Scatterers-interferometric SAR data archives. The SAR images were acquired between 1992 and 2016 by satellites ERS1/2 and ENVISAT, the Sentinel 1 ESA missions and the COSMO-SkyMed ASI mission. We observed ground velocities and deformation geometries between 1992 and 2016, with displacements of more than 70 cm and velocities of up to 55 mm/yr. The results suggest that the shape and position of the surface ground displacement are controlled by the fault activity hidden under the valley deposits.

TI  - De-Implementation of Axillary Staging and Radiotherapy in Low-Risk Breast Cancer Patients Aged 70-79 Years from Six Italian Cancer Institutes
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In women aged >= 70 with low-risk breast cancer (BrC), some major international guidelines recommend against sentinel lymph node biopsy (for example, those from the Society of Surgical Oncology, U.S.) and post-lumpectomy radiotherapy (for example, those from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, U.S.). We assessed the frequency of both procedures in six National Cancer Institutes (IRCCSs) in the North, the Centre, and the South of Italy. Data on tumour characteristics and treatment were obtained from each centre. Patients aged 70-79 years diagnosed with a pT1-pT2, clinically axillary lymph node-negative, oestrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative BrC between 2015 and 2020 were eligible for the study. Factors associated with the omission of the two procedures were evaluated using binary penalised logistic regression models. Axillary staging was omitted in 33/1000 (3.3%) women. After simultaneous adjustment for the centre of treatment and all other key variables, axillary staging was omitted more often in 2015-2016 vs. 2017-2020 (odds ratio (OR): 2.7; 95% CI: 1.0-7.5), in women aged 75-79 vs. 70-74 years (OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1-4.9), and in those who had mastectomy vs. breast-conserving surgery (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.2-9.0). The higher the histological grade was, the less frequent were the omissions (OR for grade 3 vs. grade 1: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.0-0.7). Post-lumpectomy radiotherapy was omitted in 56/651 (8.6%) women with no significant association with age, period, tumour stage, and tumour grade. In conclusion, the omission of axillary staging and post-lumpectomy radiotherapy in low-risk older BrC patients was rare in the Italian IRCCSs. Although women included in the study cannot be considered a nationally representative sample of BrC patients in Italy, our findings can serve as a baseline to monitor the impact of future guidelines. To do that, the recording and storage of hospital-based information should be improved.

TI  - The Risk of Recurrence in Endometrial Cancer Patients with Low-Volume Metastasis in the Sentinel Lymph Nodes: A Retrospective Multi-Institutional Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The surgical management of apparent early-stage endometrial cancer is still unclear. Nodal involvement is prognostic, but the role of retroperitoneal staging is still debated. Sentinel node mapping has been introduced and accepted as a valid alternative to full lymphadenectomy. Furthermore, ultrastaging provides a more accurate analysis of the excised lymph nodes by detecting a higher rate of low-volume metastasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of low-volume metastasis on recurrence-free survival in women with apparent early-stage endometrial cancer in a large retrospective multi-institutional collaboration.The aim of this study was to assess the impact of low-volume metastasis (LVM) on disease-free survival (DFS) in women with apparent early-stage endometrial cancer (EC) who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. Patients with pre-operative early-stage EC were retrospectively collected from an international collaboration including 13 referring institutions. A total of 1428 patients were included in this analysis. One hundred and eighty-six patients (13%) had lymph node involvement. Fifty-nine percent of positive SLN exhibited micrometastases, 26.9% micrometastases, and 14% isolated tumor cells. Seventeen patients with positive lymph nodes did not receive any adjuvant therapy. At a median follow-up of 33.3 months, the disease had recurred in 114 women (8%). Patients with micrometastases in the lymph nodes had a worse prognosis of disease-free survival compared to patients with negative nodes or LVM. The rate of recurrence was significantly higher for women with micrometastases than those with low-volume metastases (HR = 2.61; p = 0.01). The administration of adjuvant treatment in patients with LVM, without uterine risk factors, remains a matter of debate and requires further evaluation.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing, Proximal Sensing, and Probabilistic Modeling to Support Agricultural Project Planning and Decision-Making for Waterlogged Fields
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Waterlogging in agriculture poses severe threats to soil properties, crop yields, and farm profitability. Remote sensing data coupled with drainage systems offer solutions to monitor and manage waterlogging in agricultural systems. However, implementing agricultural projects such as drainage is associated with high uncertainty and risk, with substantial negative impacts on farm profitability if not well planned. Cost-benefit analyses can help allocate resources more effectively; however, data scarcity, high uncertainty, and risks in the agricultural sector make it difficult to use traditional approaches. Here, we combined a wide range of field and remote sensing data, unsupervised machine learning, and Bayesian probabilistic models to: (1) identify potential sites susceptible to waterlogging at the farm scale, and (2) test whether the installation of drainage systems would yield a positive benefit for the farmer. Using the K-means clustering algorithm on water and vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, we were able to detect potential waterlogging sites in the investigated field (elbow point = 2, silhouette coefficient = 0.46). Using a combination of the Bayesian statistical model and the A/B test, we show that the installation of a drainage system can increase farm profitability by 1.7 times per year compared to the existing farm management. The posterior effect size associated with yield, cropping area, and time (year) was 0.5, 1.5, and 1.9, respectively. Altogether, our results emphasize the importance of data-driven decision-making for agriculture project planning and resource management in the wake of smart agriculture for food security and adaptation to climate change.

TI  - Global Mangrove Watch: Monthly Alerts of Mangrove Loss for Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current mangrove mapping efforts, such as the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW), have focused on providing one-off or annual maps of mangrove forests, while such maps may be most useful for reporting regional, national and sub-national extent of mangrove forests, they may be of more limited use for the day-to-day management of mangroves and for supporting the Global Mangrove Alliance (GMA) goal of halting global mangrove loss. To this end, a prototype change mangrove loss alert system has been developed to identify mangrove losses on a monthly basis. Implemented on the Microsoft Planetary Computer, the Global Mangrove Watch v3.0 mangrove baseline extent map for 2018 was refined and used to define the mangrove extent mask under which potential losses would be identified. The study period was from 2018 to 2022 due to the availability of Sentinel-2 imagery used for the study. The mangrove loss alert system is based on optimised normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) thresholds used to identify mangrove losses and a temporal scoring system to filter false positives. The mangrove loss alert system was found to have an estimated overall accuracy of 92.1%, with the alert commission and omission estimated to be 10.4% and 20.6%, respectively. Africa was selected for the mangrove loss alert system prototype, where significant losses were identified in the study period, with 90% of the mangrove loss alerts identified in Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Mozambique and Guinea. The primary drivers of these losses ranged from economic activities that dominated West Africa and Northern East Africa (mainly agricultural conversion and infrastructure development) to climatic in Southern East Africa (primarily storm frequency and intensity). The production of the monthly mangrove loss alerts for Africa will be continued as part of the wider Global Mangrove Watch project, and the spatial coverage is expected to be expanded to other regions over the coming months and years. The mangrove loss alerts will be published on the Global Mangrove Watch online portal and updated monthly.

TI  - Surgical Treatments for Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) in Elderly Patients
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Despite an aging population, there is no consensus regarding ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treatment for elderly women. Breast surgery can be well tolerated even in elderly patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the surgical management of DCIS in elderly patients. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients with DCIS from 2016 to 2022 at our Breast Unit and divided our population according to age. Results: Out of 231 patients with DCIS, 45 (19.5%) were elderly. The Charlson comorbidity index and American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score was significantly higher in the elderly (p<0.001 for both). Among the elderly, 10 (22.2%) patients received upstaging diagnoses, versus 18 (9.7%) in the control (p=0.048). Twelve (26.7%) of the elderly patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, versus 93 (50%) in the control group (p=0.005). No difference was reported between groups in terms of breast conserving surgeries performed. A higher incidence of surgeries performed using local anesthesia was reported in the elderly group (p=0.041). Thirty-day surgical complications, according to Clavien-Dindo, did not show significant differences. Conclusion: Despite higher comorbidity and ASA score, breast surgery is safe and feasible in elderly patients. Due to the higher risk of upstaging to invasive ductal carcinoma, surgery should be performed but sentinel lymph node biopsy should be omitted, owing to the low risk of lymph node metastasis and lower use of adjuvant treatments.

TI  - Incidence of Lyme Borreliosis in Europe from National Surveillance Systems (2005-2020)
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-borne disease in Europe. To inform European intervention strategies, including vaccines under development, we conducted a systematic review for LB incidence.Methods: We searched publicly available surveillance data reporting LB incidence in Europe from 2005 to 2020. Population-based incidence was calculated as the number of reported LB cases per 100,000 population per year (PPY), and high LB risk areas (incidence >10/100,00 PPY for 3 consecutive years) were estimated.Results: Estimates of LB incidence were available for 25 countries. There was marked heterogeneity in surveillance systems (passive vs. mandatory and sentinel sites vs. national), case definitions (clinical, laboratory, or both), and testing methods, limiting comparison across countries. Twenty-one countries (84%) had passive surveillance; four (Belgium, France, Germany, and Switzerland) used sentinel surveillance systems. Only four countries (Bulgaria, France, Poland, and Romania) used standardized case definitions recommended by European public health institutions. Among all surveillance systems and considering any case definition for the most recently available years, national LB incidences were highest in Estonia, Lithuania, Slovenia, and Switzerland (>100 cases/100,000 PPY), followed by France and Poland (40-80/100,000 PPY), and Finland and Latvia (20-40/100,000 PPY). Incidences were lowest in Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, England, Hungary, Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Scotland, and Serbia (<20/100,000 PPY). At the subnational level, highest LB incidences (>100/100,000 PPY) were observed in areas of Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, and Poland. Overall, on average 128,888 cases are reported annually. An estimated 202/844 million (24%) persons in Europe reside in areas of high LB incidence and 202/469 million (43.2%) persons reside in areas of high LB incidence among countries with surveillance data.Conclusion: Our review showed substantial variability in reported LB incidence across and within European countries, with highest incidences reported from the Eastern, Northern (Baltic states and Nordic countries), and Western Europe surveillance systems. Standardization of surveillance systems, including wider implementation of common case definitions, is urgently needed to interpret the range of differences in LB incidence observed across European countries.

TI  - Synergy of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series for Cloud-Free Vegetation Water Content Mapping with Multi-Output Gaussian Processes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical Earth Observation is often limited by weather conditions such as cloudiness. Radar sensors have the potential to overcome these limitations, however, due to the complex radar-surface interaction, the retrieving of crop biophysical variables using this technology remains an open challenge. Aiming to simultaneously benefit from the optical domain background and the all-weather imagery provided by radar systems, we propose a data fusion approach focused on the cross-correlation between radar and optical data streams. To do so, we analyzed several multiple-output Gaussian processes (MOGP) models and their ability to fuse efficiently Sentinel-1 (S1) Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and Sentinel-2 (S2) vegetation water content (VWC) time series over a dry agri-environment in southern Argentina. MOGP models not only exploit the auto-correlations of S1 and S2data streams independently but also the inter-channel cross-correlations. The S1 RVI and S2 VWC time series at the selected study sites being the inputs of the MOGP models proved to be closely correlated. Regarding the set of assessed models, the Convolutional Gaussian model (CONV) delivered noteworthy accurate data fusion results over winter wheat croplands belonging to the 2020 and 2021 campaigns (NRMSEwheat 2020 = 16.1%; NRMSEwheat 2021 = 10.1%). Posteriorly, we removed S2 observations from the S1 & S2 dataset corresponding to the complete phenological cycles of winter wheat from September to the end of December to simulate the presence of clouds in the scenes and applied the CONV model at the pixel level to reconstruct spatiotemporally-latent VWC maps. After applying the fusion strategy, the phenology of winter wheat was successfully recovered in the absence of optical data. Strong correlations were obtained between S2 VWC and S1 & S2 MOGP VWC reconstructed maps for the assessment dates ((R-2) over bar (wheat-2020) = 0.95, (R-2) over bar (wheat-2021) = 0.96). Altogether, the fusion of S1 SAR and S2 optical EO data streams with MOGP offers a powerful innovative approach for cropland trait monitoring over cloudy high-latitude regions.

TI  - MULTI-TEMPORARY ANALYSIS APPLIED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT IN THE EXTRACTION OF ROCKS AND INDUSTRIAL MINERALS IN SUMBE, ANGOLA
T2  - REVISTA UNIVERSIDAD Y SOCIEDAD
M3  - Article
AB  - The disorganized exploitation of natural resources, either by companies or by small human groups, results in the destruction of the natural environment, the contamination of surface and ground water, as well as the inefficient use of resources. The purpose of this research is to carry out the multitemporal analysis of Landsat images, applied to environmental management in areas of industrial rock and mineral extraction in the municipality of Sumbe, province of Cuanza-Sul, Angola. It is a case of limestone extraction, where it is intended to quantify the changes in coverage that occurred between the years 2013-2019. In the study, theoretical, empirical and statistical-mathematical methods were used; the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated for the different years, allowing the reclassification of the resulting images. In addition, the Conesa matrix was calculated to examine the environmental impacts. As a result, the environmental diagnosis of the region is shown, the severe impacts caused to the natural environment and the proposal for mitigation and restoration of the quarries to improve the environmental situation of the area. As part of the management, it is planned to carry out training and awareness actions in the communities related to the extraction of limestone.

TI  - Reversible Impacts of a Cold Spell on Forest Cover, Tree Growth and Carbohydrates in Mediterranean Pine and Oak Forests
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate extremes such as cold spells are becoming more frequent as climate variability increases. However, few studies have evaluated the impacts of winter cold spells on forest cover, tree growth and leaf and sapwood non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations. We analyzed changes in tree cover using remote sensing data and compared the radial growth of coexisting and defoliated Pinus halepensis trees and non-defoliated P. halepensis and Pinus pinaster trees. We also compared NSC concentrations in leaves and sapwood of defoliated and non-defoliated P. halepensis and Quercus ilex trees. In January 2021, a rapid drop in temperatures led to minimum values (-21.3 degrees C) in eastern Spain and triggered canopy defoliation in several planted (P. halepensis) and native (Q. ilex) tree species. The cold spell led to a decrease in forest cover in the most defoliated stands and reduced radial growth of defoliated P. halepensis and sapwood NSC concentrations in P. halepensis and Q. ilex, particularly starch. Prior to the cold spell, defoliated P. halepensis trees significantly (p < 0.05) grew more (2.73 +/- 1.70 mm) in response to wetter winter conditions than non-defoliated P. halepensis (2.29 +/- 1.08 mm) and P. pinaster (1.39 mm) trees. Those P. halepensis individuals which grew faster at a young age were less resilient to the winter cold spell in later years. The study stands showed a high recovery capacity after the cold spell, but the Mediterranean drought-avoiding P. halepensis was the most affected species.

TI  - Research on Remote Sensing Inversion Method of Surface Moisture Content of Iron Tailings Based on Measured Spectra and Domestic Gaofen-5 Hyperspectral High -Resolution Satellites
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The tailings dams, as a high-potential manufactured debris flow danger source, has the risk of dam failure when the moisture content is too high, and the generation of dust in the state of low moisture content will endanger the surrounding environment. Monitoring tailings' moisture content is of great significance to the safety of tailings dams and the environmental protection of mining areas. Compared with traditional sampling and testing methods, hyperspectral remote sensing has the characteristics of a large observation area, easy acquisition of real-time data, and rich spectral information, which provides a means for rapid and high-precision monitoring of tailings moisture. The high-silicon type iron tailing in the Anshan-Benxi iron ore group was selected as the research area, and 77 tailings samples were collected on the spot. The spectral data was obtained by Vis-NIR (350 similar to 2 500 nm) spectrometer, and the competitive adaptive reweighted resampling method (CARS) was introduced to screen out the optimal bands and establish three-band spectral indices (TBI), combining random forest (RF), particle swarm optimization extreme learning machine algorithm ( PSO-ELM) and convolutional neural network ( CNN) model, a tailings moisture inversion model was established to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of surface moisture in the tailings dam. Using the domestic Gaofen-5 hyperspectral satellite as the data source, the model was applied to obtain the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the surface moisturecontent in the tailings dam. The results showed that: (1) The spectral reflectance of tailings decreased significantly with the increase of moisture content, the spectra characteristic appeared in the O-H absorption bands at 1 455 and 1 930 nm, and the absorption depth gradually decreased with the decrease of moisture content; (2) Based on the CARS method, 18 moisture sensitive bands were screened out, and further use the sensitive bands to construct different forms of three-dimensional tailings moisture content characteristic spectral indices. It is proposed that TBI5= (R-1 097.47 - R-1 990. 67) (R-1 990. 67 - R-437. 39) which has the highest correlation with moisture content, reaching 0. 844 4; (3) Based on the three-dimensional spectral indices combined reflectance data set and the CNN method, the measured spectral model achieves the verification accuracy R-2 = 0. 92, the residual predictive deviation (RPD) =3. 43. Based on this model, the spatial distribution results of tailings moisture content in the study area were obtained by inversion using the Gaofen-5 satellite data. The moisture content field verification model prediction result in R-2 reached 0. 79. The result is relatively effective. This study can provide a reference for large-scale reaLtime, and rapid monitoring of iron tailings moisture content based on hyperspectral technology.

TI  - Multi-LEO Satellite Stereo Winds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The stereo-winds method follows trackable atmospheric cloud features from multiple viewing perspectives over multiple times, generally involving multiple satellite platforms. Multi-temporal observations provide information about the wind velocity and the observed parallax between viewing perspectives provides information about the height. The stereo-winds method requires no prior assumptions about the thermal profile of the atmosphere to assign a wind height, since the height of the tracked feature is directly determined from the viewing geometry. The method is well developed for pairs of Geostationary (GEO) satellites and a GEO paired with a Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellite. However, neither GEO-GEO nor GEO-LEO configurations provide coverage of the poles. In this paper, we develop the stereo-winds method for multi-LEO configurations, to extend coverage from pole to pole. The most promising multi-LEO constellation studied consists of Terra/MODIS and Sentinel-3/SLSTR. Stereo-wind products are validated using clear-sky terrain measurements, spaceborne LiDAR, and reanalysis winds for winter and summer over both poles. Applications of multi-LEO polar stereo winds range from polar atmospheric circulation to nighttime cloud identification. Low cloud detection during polar nighttime is extremely challenging for satellite remote sensing. The stereo-winds method can improve polar cloud observations in otherwise challenging conditions.

TI  - AERONET-OC LWN Uncertainties: Revisited
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ocean Color Component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) aims at supporting the assessment of satellite ocean color radiometric products with in situ reference data derived from automated above-water measurements. This study, applying metrology principles and taking advantage of recent technology and science advances, revisits the uncertainty estimates formerly provided for AERONET-OC normalized water-leaving radiances LWN. The new uncertainty values are quantified for a number of AERONET-OC sites located in marine regions representative of chlorophyll-a-dominated waters (i.e., Case 1) anda variety of optically complex waters. Results show uncertainties typically increasing with the optical complexity of water and wind speed. Relative and absolute uncertainty values are provided for the various sites together with contributions from each source of uncertainty affecting measurements. In view of supporting AERONET-OC data users, the study also suggests practical solutions to quantify uncertainties for LWN from its spectral values. Additionally, results from an evaluation of the temporal variability characterizing LWN at various AERONET-OC sites are presented to address the impact of temporal mismatches between in situ and satellite data in matchup analysis.

TI  - Land Cover Mapping with Convolutional Neural Networks Using Sentinel-2 Images: Case Study of Rome
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover monitoring is crucial to understand land transformations at a global, regional and local level, and the development of innovative methodologies is necessary in order to define appropriate policies and land management practices. Deep learning techniques have recently been demonstrated as a useful method for land cover mapping through the classification of remote sensing imagery. This research aims to test and compare the predictive models created using the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) VGG16, DenseNet121 and ResNet50 on multitemporal and single-date Sentinel-2 satellite data. The most promising model was the VGG16 both with single-date and multi-temporal images, which reach an overall accuracy of 71% and which was used to produce an automatically generated EAGLE-compliant land cover map of Rome for 2019. The methodology is part of the land mapping activities of ISPRA and exploits its main products as input and support data. In this sense, it is a first attempt to develop a high-update-frequency land cover classification tool for dynamic areas to be integrated in the framework of the ISPRA monitoring activities for the Italian territory.

TI  - Appraisal of Ancient Quarries and WWII Air Raids as Factors of Subsidence in Rome: A Geomatic Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ancient mining and quarrying activities left anthropogenic geomorphologies that have shaped the natural landscape and affected environmental equilibria. The artificial structures and their related effects on the surrounding environment are analyzed here to characterize the quarrying landscape in the southeast area of Rome in terms of its dimensions, typology, state of preservation and interface with the urban environment. The increased occurrence of sinkhole events in urban areas has already been scientifically correlated to ancient cavities under increasing urban pressure. In this scenario, additional interacting anthropogenic factors, such as the aerial bombardments perpetrated during the Second World War, are considered here. These three factors have been investigated by employing a combined geomatic methodology. Information on air raids has been organized in vector archives. A dataset of historical aerial photographs has been processed into Digital Surface Models and orthomosaics to reconstruct the quarry landscape and its evolution, identify typologies of exploitation and forms of collapse and corroborate the discussion concerning the induced historical and recent subsidence phenomena, comparing these outputs with photogrammetric products obtained from recent satellite data. Geological and urbanistic characterization of the study area allowed a better connection between these historical and environmental factors. In light of the information gathered so far, SAR interferometric products allowed a preliminary interpretation of ground instabilities surrounding historical quarries, air raids and recent subsidence events. Various sub-areas of the AOI where the presence of the considered factors also corresponds to areas in slight subsidence in the SAR velocity maps have been highlighted. Bivariate hotspot analysis allowed substantiating the hypothesis of a spatial correlation between these multiple aspects.

TI  - An observation-based method to assess tropical stratocumulus and shallow cumulus clouds and feedbacks in CMIP6 and CMIP5 models
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Earth system models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled Models Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), the tropical low-cloud feedback is 50% more positive than its predecessors (CMIP5) and continues to dominate the spread in simulated climate sensitivity. In the context of recent studies reporting larger feedbacks for stratocumulus (Sc) than shallow cumulus (Cu) clouds, it appears crucial to faithfully represent the geographical extent of each cloud type to simulate realistic low-cloud feedbacks. Here we use a novel observation-based method to distinguish Sc and Cu clouds together with satellite data from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) to evaluate Sc and Cu cloud fractions, cloud radiative effects and cloud feedbacks in the two latest generations of CMIP ESMs. Overall, the CMIP6 models perform better than the CMIP5 models in most aspects considered here, indicating progress. Yet the ensemble mean continues to underestimate the marine tropical low-cloud fraction, mostly attributable to Sc. Decomposition of the bias reveals that the Sc-regime cloud fraction is better represented in CMIP6, although Sc regimes occur too infrequently-even less frequently than in CMIP5. Building on our Sc and Cu discrimination method, we demonstrate that CMIP6 models also simulate more realistic low-cloud feedbacks than CMIP5 models, especially the Sc component. Finally, our results suggest that part of the CMIP6 low-cloud feedback increase can be traced back to greater cloud fraction in Sc-dominated regions.

TI  - Determination of the Impacts of Mining Activities on Land Cover and Soil Organic Carbon: Altintepe Gold Mine Case, Turkey
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining activities degrade the landscape and ecosystems by introducing new land uses that alter soil characteristics. Mapping of this degradation is critical, particularly in the context of environmental protection, including climate change research. Even though mining provides significant industrial and economic benefits to society, it also decreases soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and increases atmospheric carbon levels. This study aims to develop a practical method for determining the changes in SOC in the Altintepe Gold Mine, Ordu, Turkey, due to land cover changes caused by the mining process. 2013 and 2021 Landsat 8 images and CORINE data were used to map the land cover of the study area. NDVI analyses were conducted to detect land cover and SOC stocks, while the NDWI method was used to identify the water surfaces. SOC stock changes on the changed lands were calculated compared to the Turkey Soil Organic Carbon Stock Project database. The results showed that 109.85 ha of forest and 5.30 ha of agricultural land, corresponding to 4450.82 tons of SOC loss, were destroyed in the research area. Since the alterations in SOC levels are commonly determined by verifying remote sensing based analysis results with the site surveys, it becomes quite challenging to conduct such research in areas like Altintepe due to site access restrictions or data unavailability. From this point, this study presents a practical and alternative approach that avoids the necessity of fieldwork and provides a quick SOC change estimation based on the comparison of available data. The results are expected to provide a comprehensive and holistic perspective for the future operations and management of the mine sites and the surrounding environments.

TI  - Uncovering the Potential of Multi-Temporally Integrated Satellite Imagery for Accurate Tree Species Classification
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, prior to the launch of compact advanced satellite 500 (CAS500-4), which is an agriculture and forestry satellite, nine major tree species were classified using multi-temporally integrated imageries based on a random forest model using RapidEye and Sentinel-2. Six scenarios were devised considering the composition of the input dataset, and a random forest model was used to evaluate the accuracy of the different input datasets for each scenario. The highest accuracy, with accuracy values of 84.5% (kappa value: 0.825), was achieved by using RapidEye and Sentinel-2 spectral wavelengths along with gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) statistics (Scenario IV). In the variable importance analysis, the short-wave infrared (SWIR) band of Sentinel-2 and the GLCM statistics of RapidEye were found to be sequentially higher. This study proposes an optimal input dataset for tree species classification using the variance error range of GLCM statistics to establish an optimal range for window size calculation methodology. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-temporally integrated satellite imageries in improving the accuracy of the random forest model, achieving an approximate improvement of 20.5%. The findings of this study suggest that combining the advantages of different satellite platforms and statistical methods can lead to significant improvements in tree species classification accuracy, which can contribute to better forest resource assessments and management strategies in the face of climate change.

TI  - Satellite-Based Carbon Estimation in Scotland: AGB and SOC
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The majority of state-of-the-art research employs remote sensing on AGB (Above Ground Biomass) and SOC (Soil Organic Carbon) separately, although some studies indicate a positive correlation between the two. We intend to combine the two domains in our research to improve state-of-the-art total carbon estimation. We begin by establishing a baseline model in our study area in Scotland, using state-of-the-art methodologies in the SOC and AGB domains. The effects of feature engineering techniques such as variance inflation factor and feature selection on machine learning models are then investigated. This is extended by combining predictor variables from the two domains. Finally, we leverage the possible correlation between AGB and SOC to establish a relationship between the two and propose novel models in an attempt to outperform the state-of-the-art results. We compared three machine learning techniques, boosted regression tree, random forest, and xgboost. These techniques have been demonstrated to be the most effective in both domains. This research makes three contributions: (i) Including Digital Elevation Map (DEM) as a predictor variable in the AGB model improves the model result by 13.5 % on average across the three machine learning techniques experimented, implying that DEM should be considered for AGB estimation as well, despite the fact that it has previously been used exclusively for SOC estimation. (ii) Using SOC and SOC Density improves the prediction of the AGB model by a significant 14.2% on average compared to the state-of-the-art baseline (When comparing the R2 value across all three modeling techniques in Model B and Model H, there is an increase from 0.5016 to 0.5604 for BRT, 0.4958 to 0.5925 for RF and 0.5161 to 0.5750 for XGB), which strengthens our experiment results and suggests a future research direction of combining AGB and SOC as a joint study domain. (iii) Including AGB as a predictor variable for SOC improves model performance for Random Forest, but reduced performance for Boosted Regression tree and XG Boost, indicating that the results are specific to ML models and more research is required on the feature space and modeling techniques. Additionally, we propose a method for estimating total carbon using data from Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2, Landsat 8, Digital Elevation, and the Forest Inventory.

TI  - Kinematic Response of Subaerial Salt Diapirs to Geomorphic, Tectonic and Climatic Regimes: Insights From Space-Based Observations in the Western Kuqa Fold-Thrust Belt, NW China
T2  - TECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ephemeral subaerial salt diapirs are gravitationally unstable and vulnerable to climate and tectonic activity due to the rheology and incompressibility of rock salt. Quantifying the kinematics of subaerial salt and clarifying the role of tectonics, surface processes, and climate in reshaping the surface salt morphology provides an invaluable opportunity to explore the interactions between Earth's spheres on a much shorter timescale. With diverse exposed salt diapirs and potential motions, the Kuqa fold-thrust belt (KFTB), NW China, represents an optimum natural laboratory to understand subaerial salt kinematics. Here, we integrated ascending and descending geometries of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar images with optical remote sensing data, seismic profiles, digital elevation models, and meteorological records to explore the potential correlation between subaerial salt motions and geomorphic, tectonic, and climatic factors. Using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique, we observed a maximum of 25 mm/yr in vertical and 40 mm/yr in horizontal surface salt deformation in the KFTB from 2014 to 2020. Our findings demonstrate a gravity spreading dominant system, where topography exerts a primary control on the surface displacement patterns of salt structures, while weather variables influence deformation mainly by softening salt and facilitating gravity-driven salt flow.

TI  - Dynamic Responses of Landscape Pattern and Vegetation Coverage to Urban Expansion and Greening: A Case Study of the Severe Cold Region, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is the natural trend of human social development, which leads to various changes in vegetation conditions. Analyzing the dynamics of landscape patterns and vegetation coverage in response to urban expansion is important for understanding the ecological influence of urban expansion and guiding sustainable urban development. However, existing studies on the effects of urbanization on vegetation conditions in severe cold regions are limited. Here, taking Harbin, China as an example, the study explored the evolution of the urban expansion process and adopted landscape metrics to derive landscape pattern changes from 2005 to 2020. Based on the fraction of vegetation coverage (FVC) derived from Landsat satellite observations during 2004-2020, we investigated the spatiotemporal change characteristics of FVC. By separating the direct and indirect effects of urbanization on vegetation growth, we quantified the impacts of urbanization on vegetation. The results show that the urban area increased by 70.37%, and urban expansion exhibited a compact sprawl pattern. Cropland and water were the major resources converted for urban expansion. The distribution of FVC exhibits a pattern that the urban fringe region is significantly higher than the central region. The FVC trend is decreased overall, but the changes are not significant with regional variation. Moreover, the average observed FVC decreased with increasing urban intensity. By contrast, the indirect impact is increased along the intensity gradient, with growth enhancement offsetting about 2.26%similar to 2.71% of direct vegetation loss. The study further shows that vegetation growth responses to urbanization vary according to urbanization levels. Our findings provide detailed information and reveal the relationship between urban intensity and vegetation coverage, which could help to manage urban vegetation for planners and stakeholders.

TI  - Impact of Axillary Lymph Node Dissection and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy on Upper Limb Morbidity in Breast Cancer Patients A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective:To evaluate the impact of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) on upper limb (UL) morbidity in breast cancer patients. Background:Axillary de-escalation is motivated by a desire to reduce harm of ALND. Understanding the impact of axillary surgery and disparities in operative procedures on postoperative arm morbidity would better direct resources to the point of need and cement the need for de-escalation strategies. Methods:Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsychINFO were searched from 1990 until March 2020. Included studies were randomized-controlled and observational studies focusing on UL morbidities, in breast surgery patients. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The prevalence of UL morbidity comparing SLNB and ALND at <12 months, 12 to 24 months, and beyond 24 months were analyzed. Results:Sixty-seven studies were included. All studies reported a higher rate of lymphedema and pain after ALND compared with SLNB. The difference in lymphedema and pain prevalence between SLNB and ALND was 13.7% (95% confidence interval: 10.5-16.8, P<0.005) and 24.2% (95% confidence interval: 12.1-36.3, P<0.005), respectively. Pooled estimates for prevalence of reduced strength and range of motion after SLNB and ALND were 15.2% versus 30.9% and 17.1% versus 29.8%, respectively. Type of axillary surgery, greater body mass index, and radiotherapy were some of the predictors for UL morbidities. Conclusions:Prevalence of lymphedema after ALND was higher than previously estimated. ALND patients experienced greater rates of lymphedema, pain, reduced strength, and range of motion compared with SLNB. The findings support the continued drive to de-escalate axillary surgery.

TI  - Synergy biochemical and physiological traits for rice heavy metal stress detection from Sentinel-2 images using signal-decomposition technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing pollution of soil with heavy metals has greatly damaged the ecological environment and endangered human health. Heavy metal stress affects not only biochemical constituents (i.e., chlorophyll) but also physiological functions (i.e., photosynthesis). We aimed to detect heavy metal stress in rice by integrating these two aspects. We selected Zhuzhou, Hunan Province as the study area and collected Sentinel-2 images from 2019 to 2021 and situ-measured data. First, two indicators were computed from Sentinel-2 images characterizing biochemical components and physiological functions, respectively. Second, the original time series were decomposed using the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise. Finally, a time-spectrum feature space (TSFS) model based on signal decomposition in critical periods sensitive to heavy metal stress was developed to determine the level of heavy metal stress. It showed that, regardless of individuals years, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficients of the TSFS model were >85 % and 0.8, and compared with a single indicator, combining two indicators with the signal-decomposition method significantly improved the accuracy of stress detection. This demonstrates that the integration of biochemical components with physiological functions and signal decomposition techniques can provide an important reference for crop heavy metal stress monitoring.

TI  - Concomitant Use of Biopsy Clips and Wire Localization in Invasive Breast Cancer is Associated With Successful Retrieval
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - This 5-year analysis of real-world data confirms the durable response and long-term survival with immune checkpoint blockade therapies in a broader range of patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma. After 24 months, PFS and OS curves remained nearly flat. The safety profile was consistent with previous reports, and no new safety signals were observed.Introduction: Surgical management of the axilla in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer has shifted to less invasive surgical approaches, such as sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) and targeted axillary dissection (TAD). Successful retrieval of the biopsy clip marking the lymph node of interest is crucial for assessment of pathologic response and locoregional disease control. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients >= 18 years old with invasive breast cancer and biopsy-proven axillary LN involvement, who underwent LN clip placement from January 2012 to July 2017 at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Results: Of the 128 eligible patients, the median age at diagnosis was 51.5 years (range, 23-92 years) with predominately stage T2-3 disease (54.7% T2, 42.2% T3), of ductal histology (76.6%), and located in the upper outer quadrant (42.2%). Among the 63.3% (81) of patients who received neoadjuvant systemic therapy, 43.2% (35) had a partial response and 30.9% (25) had a complete response. Axillary procedures performed consisted of 36.7% (47) SLND/TAD, 53.9% (69) ALND, and 9.4% (12) SLND/TAD with conversion to ALND. The clipped LN was successfully retrieved in 63.8% (30) of SLND/TADs, 39.1% (27) of ALNDs, and 58.3% (7) of SLND/TADs followed by ALND. Pre-operative node localization by wire and/or skin markings was performed for 16.4% (21) of patients. Among these, 90.5% (19) of clipped LNs were successfully retrieved, compared to 42.1% (45) retrieved in axillary procedures without preoperative node localization. Conclusion: Use of preoperative targeted node localization improved rate of clipped LN retrieval across all three types of axillary procedures.

TI  - An Improved Multi-Source Data-Driven Landslide Prediction Method Based on Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides pose a significant threat to human lives and property, making the development of accurate and reliable landslide prediction methods essential. With the rapid advancement of multi-source remote sensing techniques and machine learning, remote sensing data-driven landslide prediction methods have attracted increasing attention. However, the lack of an effective and efficient paradigm for organizing multi-source remote sensing data and a unified prediction workflow often results in the weak generalization ability of existing prediction models. In this paper, we propose an improved multi-source data-driven landslide prediction method based on a spatio-temporal knowledge graph and machine learning models. By combining a spatio-temporal knowledge graph and machine learning models, we establish a framework that can effectively organize multi-source remote sensing data and generate unified prediction workflows. Our approach considers the environmental similarity between different areas, enabling the selection of the most adaptive machine learning model for predicting landslides in areas with scarce samples. Experimental results show that our method outperforms machine learning methods, achieving an increase in F1 score by 29% and an improvement in processing efficiency by 93%. Furthermore, by comparing the susceptibility maps generated in real scenarios, we found that our workflow can alleviate the problem of poor prediction performance caused by limited data availability in county-level predictions. This method provides new insights into the development of data-driven landslide evaluation methods, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by limited data availability.

TI  - Scattering feature extraction and fuse network for aircraft detection in synthetic aperture radar images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) aircraft detection methods based on deep learning have become a current research hotspot. However, considerable challenges still remain due to the scattering feature of aircraft, variations in aircraft size, and interference from complex scenarios. To tackle these problems, the scattering feature extraction and fuse network (SFEF-Net) is proposed. First, considering the scattering characteristics of aircraft, we propose a scattering feature extraction and relation enhancement (SFERE) backbone based on the deformable convolution and the global context block. The SFERE backbone is used to extract the scattering feature of aircraft and model the correlation of scattering points. Furthermore, to enhance the detection ability for multi-scale aircraft targets in complex scenes, we redesign an attention bidirectional feature fusion pyramid (ABFFP). Two novel modules are proposed in ABFFP, namely, the attention guidance feature fusion (AGFF) module and the residual efficient channel attention (RECA) module. The AGFF module is proposed to suppress the interference of backgrounds and aggregate the multi-level feature maps. After the feature fusion operation, the output feature maps contain richer channel information, but there is some redundant information that could reduce the accuracy. Therefore, we adopt the RECA module to further select useful information in the channel dimension. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SFEF-Net, SAR aircraft images from the Gaofen-3 system are utilized in the experiments. The detection results show that the proposed model achieves competitive performance with an average precision of 95.5%.

TI  - Estimating the Actual Evapotranspiration Using Remote Sensing and SEBAL Model in an Arid Environment of Northwest China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important channel for water transport and energy conversion in land-air systems, and the spatial quantification of actual ET is crucial for water resource management and scheduling in arid areas. Using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model and satellite images, this study determined the actual ET during the growing season of 2020 in the Shiyang River Basin of northwest China and investigated the driving mechanism of ET using a principal component regression. The results showed that the ET obtained using the Penman-Monteith equation exhibited a good correlation with the ET estimated using SEBAL (R-2 = 0.85). Additionally, SEBAL overestimated ET to some extent compared to the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ET (MOD16) product. The daily ET (ETd) in the Shiyang River Basin showed a single-peak variation during the growing season, with the maximum value occurring around mid-July. Spatially, the ET gradually increased from northeast to southwest with the variation in the land use/land cover (LULC) type. Among the six LULC types, ETd was higher for woodland, water body, and grassland, all exceeding 5.0 mm/d; farmland and built-up land had ETd close to 3.9 mm/d; and barren land had the lowest ETd of below 2.5 mm/d. Furthermore, the standardized regression coefficients indicated that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the main driving factor influencing ET. Overall, the SEBAL model has the potential to estimate spatially actual ET, and the study results provide a scientific basis for water resource accounting and hydrological analysis in arid areas.

TI  - Interaction of Climate Change and Anthropogenic Activity on the Spatiotemporal Changes of Surface Water Area in Horqin Sandy Land, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water dynamics are sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic activity, and they exert important feedback to the above two processes. However, it is unclear how climate and human activity affect surface water variation, especially in semi-arid regions, such as Horqin Sandy Land (HQSL), a typical part of the fragile region for intensive interaction of climate and land use change in northern China. We investigated the changes of spatiotemporal distribution and the influence of climatic and anthropogenic factors on Surface Water Area (SWA) in HQSL. There are 5933 Landsat images used in this research, which were processed on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform to extract water bodies by vegetation index and water index method. The results revealed that the area and number of water bodies showed a significant decrease in HQSL from 1985 to 2020. Spatially, the SWA experienced different amplitudes of variation in the Animal Husbandry Dominated Region (AHDR) and in the Agriculture Dominated Region (ADR) during two periods; many water bodies even dried up and disappeared in HQSL. Hierarchical partitioning analysis showed that the SWA of both regions was primarily influenced by climatic factors during the pre-change period (1985-2000; the mutation occurred in 2000), and human activity has become more and more significantly important during the post-change period (2001-2020). Thus, it is predictable that SWA variation in the following decades will be influenced by the interaction of climate change and human activity, even more by the later in HQSL, and the social sectors have to improve their ability to adapt to climate change by modifying land use strategy and techniques toward the sustainable development of water resources.

TI  - Global Multi-Attention UResNeXt for Semantic Segmentation of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation has played an essential role in remote sensing image interpretation for decades. Although there has been tremendous success in such segmentation with the development of deep learning in the field, several limitations still exist in the current encoder-decoder models. First, the potential interdependencies of the context contained in each layer of the encoder-decoder architecture are not well utilized. Second, multi-scale features are insufficiently used, because the upper-layer and lower-layer features are not directly connected in the decoder part. In order to solve those limitations, a global attention gate (GAG) module is proposed to fully utilize the interdependencies of the context and multi-scale features, and then a global multi-attention UResNeXt (GMAUResNeXt) module is presented for the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. GMAUResNeXt uses GAG in each layer of the decoder part to generate the global attention gate (for utilizing the context features) and connects each global attention gate with the uppermost layer in the decoder part by using the Hadamard product (for utilizing the multi-scale features). Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that use of GAG in each layer lets the model focus on a certain pattern, which can help improve the effectiveness of semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, GMAUResNeXt not only outperforms MDCNN by 0.68% on the Potsdam dataset with respect to the overall accuracy but is also the MANet by 3.19% on the GaoFen image dataset. GMAUResNeXt achieves better performance and more accurate segmentation results than the state-of-the-art models.

TI  - On the Performance of Sentinel-3 Altimetry over High Mountain and Cascade Reservoirs Basins: Case of the Lancang and Nu River Basins
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite radar altimetry has been widely utilized in hydrological research, particularly with the advent of Sentinel-3, a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) altimeter operating globally and equipped with an innovative onboard tracking system referred to as the open-loop tracking command (OLTC). Utilizing a pseudo-DEM (Digital Elevation Model), controlled through the OLTC, holds significant promise for the reliable observation of inland water bodies. Nevertheless, the complex geographical conditions in high mountain and reservoir river basins pose challenges in defining an appropriate pseudo-DEM for hydrological targets, potentially leading to reduced performance of Sentinel-3. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the performance of Sentinel-3 by selecting the Lancang and Nu River basins in southwest China as a case study. These two rivers have a similar natural environment, but cascade reservoirs distinguish the Lancang River basin. By analyzing waveform energy from echoes of virtual stations (VSs) in both river basins (27 VSs in the Lancang River basin and 39 VSs in the Nu River basin), the performance of Sentinel-3 in different tracking modes and OLTC versions were compared. The results indicated that the detection rate of Sentinel-3A increased when transitioning from the closed-loop mode to the open-loop mode and with the implementation of newer OLTC versions (36.8% increased to 47.4%, 60.5%, and 63.2% in OLTC V5.0, V6.0, and V6.1, respectively). Similarly, the detection rate of Sentinel-3B rose from 64.3% (OLTC V2.0) to 71.4% and 75.0% in OLTC V3.0 and V3.1, respectively. Additionally, the cascade reservoir causing river channel expansion results in a better performance of Sentinel-3A in the Lancang River compared to the Nu River in the closed-loop mode (13.0% and 35.7%, respectively). Nevertheless, the considerable fluctuations in water surface caused by reservoir impoundment led to a wrong pseudo-DEM, resulting in poor performance of Sentinel-3 in reservoir regions before OLTC V6.0 was updated. The detection rate of low altitude, broad water surfaces (>500 m) decreased from 100% in a closed-loop mode to 0% in an open-loop mode, but increased to 100% in OLTC V6.0 and V6.1, respectively. The detection rate of high altitude, narrow water surfaces (<500 m) increased from 0% in a closed-loop mode to 40.9% in OLTC V6.1. Although the detection ability of Sentinel-3 is improving with the implementation of newer OLTC versions, the seasonal variations (usually more than 60 m) of water levels in reservoirs exceeded the size of the range window (60 m), rendering a complete measurement impossible.

TI  - Monitoring of Land Degradation in Greece and Tunisia Using Trends.Earth with a Focus on Cereal Croplands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation (LD) processes are widespread in drylands worldwide and are accelerated by climate change. As a result, food security and livelihoods are at risk. Thus, there is a need to monitor LD trends, especially in agricultural areas. Mediterranean countries, including Tunisia and Greece, are concerned due to the presence of drivers and pressures causing land degradation. Through the Trends.Earth plugin, the SDG 15.3.1 indicator can be implemented to map LD status. In this study, we mapped LD in Greece and Tunisia for the recommended baseline period of 2001-2015 and the selected reporting period of 2016-2020. The land productivity was assessed within Trends.Earth using the MODIS MOD13Q1 product, while the default datasets were used for the other sub-indicators. The main findings are: (i) the percentage of degraded land decreased from the baseline to the reporting period from 4.83% to 2.62% of total area in Greece and 9.97% to 6.26% in Tunisia-degradation rates that differ from those reported to the UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification) by the respective national authorities; (ii) the dominant land condition in Greece was improved, while in Tunisia, it was stable; (iii) land productivity presented a similar trend through the SDG 15.3.1 indicator over both countries, including the net land productivity dynamics over croplands; (iv) based on analysis using plant functional types performed with MODIS MCD12Q1, the highest portion of degraded land in Greece was located in grasslands and in Tunisia in cereal croplands (after desert areas); and (v) with a focus on LD over cereal croplands, the portion of degraded areas appeared to decrease in both Greece and Tunisia. The percentage was higher in Tunisia, representing 16.52% of the total degraded land during the reporting period compared to 10.83% in Greece. All the above stress the need to foster the adoption of sustainable land management practices, especially in Tunisia, and speed up the implementation of measures to achieve LD neutrality.

TI  - Backscattering Characteristics of SAR Images in Damaged Buildings Due to the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most research on the extraction of earthquake-caused building damage using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images used building damage certification assessments and the EMS-98-based evaluation as ground truth. However, these methods do not accurately assess the damage characteristics. The buildings identified as Major damage in the Japanese damage certification survey contain damage with various characteristics. If Major damage is treated as a single class, the parameters of SAR images will vary greatly, and the relationship between building damage and SAR images would not be properly evaluated. Therefore, it is necessary to divide Major damage buildings into more detailed classes. In this study, the Major damage buildings were newly classified into five damage classes, to correctly evaluate the relationship between building damage characteristics and SAR imagery. The proposed damage classification is based on Japanese damage assessment data and field photographs, and is classified according to the dominant damage characteristics of the building, such as collapse and damage to walls and roofs. We then analyzed the backscattering characteristics of SAR images for each classified damage class. We used ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images observed before and after the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake in Mashiki Town, where many buildings were damaged by the earthquake. Then, we performed the analysis using two indices, the correlation coefficient R and the coherence differential value gamma(dif), and the damage class. The results indicate that the backscattering characteristics of SAR images show different trends in each damage class. The R tended to decrease for large deformations such as collapsed buildings. The gamma(dif) was likely to be sensitive not only to collapsed buildings but also to damage with relatively small deformation, such as distortion and tilting. In addition, it was suggested that the ground displacement near the earthquake fault affected the coherence values.

TI  - Extending the GPS IIIA antenna calibration for precise orbit determination of low Earth orbit satellites
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision applications of GNSS require accurate calibrations to correct for phase variations of the transmitting antennas. Calibrations distributed by the International GNSS Service (IGS), based upon observations from the global network of ground stations, are often used as the source of the transmitter calibrations as they are inherently linked to a specific definition of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame. The IGS provides antenna phase variations as a function of boresight angle for each basic block of navigation satellite. To support scientific missions operating in low Earth orbit, the antenna calibrations must be extended beyond the 14-degrees limit that can be observed by GNSS receivers on the Earth. Extended antenna calibrations to accommodate low Earth orbiting satellites have already been derived for the GPS Block II satellites. This paper derives an extension solution for the new GPS IIIA antenna calibration, based on a year of observations from the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich altimetry mission and validated using Jason-3. These solutions are inherently consistent with the IGS-provided models of the Block II antenna calibrations. We use the new model for the GPS IIIA transmitter antenna calibration extensions to evaluate the impact on precise orbit solutions of both Sentinel-6 MF and Jason-3.

TI  - Improvements of Fire Fuels Attributes Maps by Integrating Field Inventories, Low Density ALS, and Satellite Data in Complex Mediterranean Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most determining factors in forest fire behaviour is to characterize forest fuel attributes. We investigated a complex Mediterranean forest type-mountainous Abies pinsapo-Pinus-Quercus-Juniperus with distinct structures, such as broadleaf and needleleaf forests-to integrate field data, low density Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), and multispectral satellite data for estimating forest fuel attributes. The three-step procedure consisted of: (i) estimating three key forest fuel attributes (biomass, structural complexity and hygroscopicity), (ii) proposing a synthetic index that encompasses the three attributes to quantify the potential capacity for fire propagation, and (iii) generating a cartograph of potential propagation capacity. Our main findings showed that Biomass-ALS calibration models performed well for Abies pinsapo (R-2 = 0.69), Juniperus spp. (R-2 = 0.70), Pinus halepensis (R-2 = 0.59), Pinus spp. mixed (R-2 = 0.80), and Pinus spp.-Juniperus spp. (R-2 = 0.59) forests. The highest values of biomass were obtained for Pinus halepensis forests (190.43 Mg ha(-1)). The structural complexity of forest fuels was assessed by calculating the LiDAR Height Diversity Index (LHDI) with regard to the distribution and vertical diversity of the vegetation with the highest values of LHDI, which corresponded to Pinus spp.-evergreen (2.56), Quercus suber (2.54), and Pinus mixed (2.49) forests, with the minimum being obtained for Juniperus (1.37) and shrubs (1.11). High values of the Fuel Desiccation Index (IDM) were obtained for those areas dominated by shrubs (-396.71). Potential Behaviour Biomass Index (ICB) values were high or very high for 11.86% of the area and low or very low for 77.07%. The Potential Behaviour Structural Complexity Index (ICE) was high or very high for 37.23% of the area, and low or very low for 46.35%, and the Potential Behaviour Fuel Desiccation Index (ICD) was opposite to the ICB and ICE, with high or very high values for areas with low biomass and low structural complexity. Potential Fire Behaviour Index (ICP) values were high or very high for 38.25% of the area, and low or very low values for 45.96%. High or very high values of ICP were related to Pinus halepensis and Pinus pinaster forests. Remote sensing has been applied to improve fuel attribute characterisation and cartography, highlighting the utility of integrating multispectral and ALS data to estimate those attributes that are more closely related to the spatial organisation of vegetation.

TI  - Soil Moisture Inversion in Grassland Ecosystem Using Remote Sensing Considering Different Grazing Intensities and Growing Seasons
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although vegetation community information such as grazing gradient, biomass, and density have been well characterized in typical grassland communities with Stipa grandis and Leymus chinensis as dominant species, their impact on the soil moisture (SM) inversion is still unclear. This study investigated the characteristics of a grassland vegetation community at different grazing gradients and growing seasons and its impact on SM inversion using remote sensing data. The water cloud model (WCM) was used for SM inversion, and both field and remote sensing data collected from 2019 to 2021 were used for calibration and prediction. The study found that the calibrated WCM achieved prediction results of SM inversion with average R-2 values of 0.41 and 0.38 at different grazing gradients and growing seasons, respectively. Vegetation biomass and height were significantly correlated with vegetation indexes, and the highest model prediction accuracy was achieved for biomass and height around 121.1 g/m(2) [102.3-139.9] and 18.6 cm [17.3-19.8], respectively. Generally, NDWI1 produced higher SM estimation accuracy than NDWI2. The growing season of vegetation also affects the accuracy of the WCM to retrieve SM, with the highest accuracy achieved in mid-growing season I. Therefore, the developed WCM with optimal height and biomass of vegetation communities can enhance the SM prediction capacity; it thus can be potentially used for SM prediction in typical grasslands.

TI  - Artificial intelligence tools and vegetation indices combined to estimate aboveground biomass in tropical forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurement of forest biomass is a time-, money-, and labor-consuming activity. Developing methodological approaches for quantifying biomass in natural ecosystems has motivated countless investigations in several vegetation types worldwide. In this study, we developed a model to estimate the above-ground biomass (AGB) in a study site spatially located in Western Para state, Brazilian Amazon. We applied artificial neural networks and remotely sensed data for adjusting our model based on forest inventory data. We tested four vegetation indices retrieved from a Landsat-5 thematic mapper scene and assessed their correlations with the field measured AGB. We trained 286 artificial neural networks using the vegetation stratus (two phytophysiognomies: dense lowland ombrophilous forest and dense submontane ombrophilous forest) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and aerosol-free vegetation index as predictors variables of the AGB. We selected the artificial neural network model showing higher correlation coefficient and concentration of residuals in the center classes, which indicates higher predictive capabilities of biomass estimation. The generated model architecture (4-13-1) was composed by 4 predictor neurons in the input layer, 13 neurons in the hidden layer, activated by logistic functions, and a single neuron (the AGB in ton . ha(-1)) in the output layer, activated by an identity function. We observed that the NDVI and aerosol free vegetation index showed the best performance to estimate the AGB in the study area. Using artificial neural network and a Landsat-5 image combined, we were able to accurately predict (estimation error of similar to 20%) AGB in tropical forest. This is a promising methodological approach that can be applied to assess ecosystem services related to carbon stock in tropical regions.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Framework for Soil Moisture Content Retrieval of Bare Soil from Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that has been successfully applied in a variety of remote sensing applications, including geophysical information retrieval such as soil moisture content (SMC). Deep learning (DL) is a subfield of ML that uses models with complex structures to solve prediction problems with higher performance than traditional ML. In this study, a framework based on DL was developed for SMC retrieval. For this purpose, a sample dataset was built, which included synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering, radar incidence angle, and ground truth data. Herein, the performance of five optimized ML prediction models was evaluated in terms of soil moisture prediction. However, to boost the prediction performance of these models, a DL-based data augmentation technique was implemented to create a reconstructed version of the available dataset. This includes building a sparse autoencoder DL network for data reconstruction. The Bayesian optimization strategy was employed for fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the ML models in order to improve their prediction performance. The results of our study highlighted the improved performance of the five ML prediction models with augmented data. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) showed the best prediction performance with 4.05% RMSE and 0.81 R-2 on a 10% independent test subset.

TI  - A Modified Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (mTVDI) for Agricultural Drought Assessment Based on MODIS Data: A Case Study in Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based drought indices have been shown to be effective and convenient in detecting drought conditions. The temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) is one of the most frequently used drought indices; however, it is not suitable for areas with high fractional vegetation cover (FVC). In this study, a modified temperature vegetation dryness index (mTVDI) was constructed by using the multispectral vegetation dryness index (MVDI) proposed by a PROSAIL simulation and water stress experiments which was based on the theory of the TVDI and utilized MODIS data. Compared with the TVDI, the mTVDI presents a more triangular feature space, as well as obviously increased R-2 values for dry and wet edges (from 0.37-0.90 to 0.53-0.91 for dry edges and from 0.00-0.77 to 0.24-0.80 for wet edges). The mTVDI was evaluated using standardized precipitation evapotranspiration indices (SPEIs), precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (PET), and the crop water deficit index (CWDI), and the results confirmed that the mTVDI can better reflect the actual spatial changes, compared to the TVDI, under high FVC, as well as presenting an increased Pearson correlation coefficient (by 0.06-0.10) when compared with SPEIs. Moreover, the good performance of the mTVDI in major drought events indicates its reliability and accuracy for drought monitoring. Overall, the mTVDI is a reliable and accurate satellite-based dryness index suitable for high FVC conditions.

TI  - Two-Dimensional Space Turntable Pitch Axis Trajectory Prediction Method Based on Sun Vector and CNN-LSTM Model
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - A two-dimensional space turntable system has been used to ensure that the Solar X-ray and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (X-EUVI) can track the Sun stably, and the prediction of the two-dimensional turntable trajectory is an important part of payload health management. Different from the dynamic model using traditional trajectory prediction, we propose a new method for predicting the pitch axis trajectory of the turntable based on the sun vector and a deep learning CNN-LSTM model. First, the ideal solar position of the pitch axis was calculated using the sun vector. Then, the ideal solar position was combined with the running turntable pitch axis motor speed, current, and solar position error signal as the CNN-LSTM model input data. The model parameters were trained and adjusted through test data simulation using Fengyun-3E satellite orbit data. Finally, the next position of the pitch axis was predicted. The test results showed that in the sun vector and CNN-LSTM model, the RMSE value was 0.623 and the MSE value was 0.388. It was better than the LSTM model or CNN model alone and could accurately predict the pitch axis position.

TI  - Evolution of the Chenglingji-Datong Channel in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River and Its Drivers
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the water-sand composition of the Yangtze River channel has changed due to the influence of human factors, especially the construction of water reservoirs such as the Three Gorges Project. Changing water-sand conditions have a long-term impact on the shaping of the river channel morphology in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the erosion retreat of local river sections has caused great harm to embankment projects. This paper focuses on the river evolution mechanism of the river channel from Chenglingji to Datong in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River over the past 31 years. Landsat remote sensing images from 1989-2019 were used to extract and interpret water bodies, river shorelines, and central bars in the study area using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) combined with visual interpretation. We used near analysis to study the morphological evolution characteristics of the river, the channel, and selected typical river reaches for comparative analysis. We found out that the overall change in river morphology between 1989 and 2019 was small in the horizontal direction, but the local area changed significantly. Considerable scouring occurred in the vertical direction. Combining hydrological and meteorological data, we investigated the effects of the Three Gorges Dam, instream sand mining, boundary conditions, vegetation cover on both sides of the riverbanks, and aspects of storm flooding in the watershed on the evolution of the river. The study indicated that the geological conditions on both sides of the river, the implementation of the bank protection project, and the improvement of vegetation cover on both sides of the river have made the riverbanks more resistant to scouring. However, heavy rainfall floods, the operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir, and sand mining activities in the river channel make the river channel more susceptible to scouring. Based on the calculation of the slope change rate of the accumulated volume, it was found that the runoff is mainly influenced by precipitations, while the sand transport is mainly affected by human activities. This study shows that natural and anthropogenic activities affect the equilibrium state of the river's water and sediment to varying degree.

TI  - The monetary facilities payment for ecosystem services as an approach to restore the Degraded Urmia Lake in Iran.
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This study analyzed the potential use of Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) as a strategy for improving water supply management. This study focused on the Siminehroud Sub-basin due to its high importance to the Basin of Urmia Lake (UL). Siminehroud is the second provider of water (by volume) to Urmia Lake. To evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of a PES scheme, the current land use map was extracted using satellite imagery. In addition, the two algorithms of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) are used for Landsat images classification, rather than analyzing the relationship between land use and ecosystem services. Then, the most relevant ecosystem services provided in the region were evaluated using the Benefit Transfer Method. In the last step, by designing and implementing a survey, on the one hand, the local farmers' Willingness to Accept (WTA) cash payments for reducing the area they cultivate, and on the other hand, the farmers' Willingness to Pay (WTP) for managing the water consumption were determined. The results illustrated that the WTA program is more acceptable among the beneficiaries. It is also notable that this program needs very high governmental funding. Furthermore, the results of the program indicate that the land area out of the cultivation cycle will gradually increase while the price of agricultural water will also increase.

TI  - A Hybrid Chlorophyll a Estimation Method for Oligotrophic and Mesotrophic Reservoirs Based on Optical Water Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Low- and medium-resolution satellites have been a relatively mature platform for inland eutrophic water classification and chlorophyll a concentration (Chl-a) retrieval algorithms. However, for oligotrophic and mesotrophic waters in small- and medium-sized reservoirs, problems of low satellite resolution, insufficient water sampling, and higher uncertainty in retrieval accuracy exist. In this paper, a hybrid Chl-a estimation method based on spectral characteristics (i.e., remote sensing reflectance (Rrs)) classification was developed for oligotrophic and mesotrophic waters using high-resolution satellite Sentinel-2 (A and B) data. First, 99 samples and quasi-synchronous Sentinel-2 satellite data were collected from four small- and medium-sized reservoirs in central China, and the usability of the Sentinel-2 Rrs data in inland oligotrophic and mesotrophic waters was verified by accurate atmospheric correction. Second, a new optical classification method was constructed based on different water characteristics to classify waters into clear water, phytoplankton-dominated water, and water dominated by phytoplankton and suspended matter together using the thresholds of Rrs490/Rrs560 and Rrs665/Rrs560. The proposed method has a higher classification accuracy compared to other classification methods, and the band-ratio algorithm is simpler and more effective for satellite sensors without NIR bands. Third, given the sensitivity of the empirical method to water variability and the ease of development and implementation, a nonlinear least squares fitted one-dimensional nonlinear function was established based on the selection of the best-fitting spectral indices for different optical water types (OWTs) and compared with other Chl-a estimation algorithms. The validation results showed that the hybrid two-band method had the highest accuracy with squared correlation coefficient, root mean squared difference, mean absolute percentage error, and bias of 0.85, 2.93, 32.42%, and -0.75 mg/m(3), respectively, and the results of the residual values further validated the applicability and reliability of the model. Finally, the performance of the classification and estimation algorithms on the four reservoirs was evaluated to obtain images mapping the Chl-a in the reservoirs. In conclusion, this study improves the accuracy of Chl-a estimation for oligotrophic and mesotrophic waters by combining a new classification algorithm with a two-band hybrid model, which is an important contribution to solving the problem of low resolution and high uncertainty in the retrieval of Chl-a in oligotrophic and mesotrophic waters in small- and medium-sized reservoirs and has the potential to be applied to other optically similar oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes and reservoirs using similar spectrally satellite sensors.

TI  - A New Bioassay for the Detection of Paralytic and Amnesic Biotoxins Based on Motor Behavior Impairments of Zebrafish Larvae
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The global concern about the increase of harmful algal bloom events and the possible impacts on food safety and aquatic ecosystems presents the necessity for the development of more accessible techniques for biotoxin detection for screening purposes. Considering the numerous advantages that zebrafish present as a biological model and particularly as a toxicants sentinel, we designed a sensitive and accessible test to determine the activity of paralytic and amnesic biotoxins using zebrafish larvae immersion. The ZebraBioTox bioassay is based on the automated recording of larval locomotor activity using an IR microbeam locomotion detector, and manual assessment of four complementary responses under a simple stereoscope: survival, periocular edema, body balance, and touch response. This 24 h acute static bioassay was set up in 96-well microplates using 5 dpf zebrafish larvae. For paralytic toxins, a significant decrease in locomotor activity and touch response of the larvae was detected, allowing a detection threshold of 0.1-0.2 mu g/mL STXeq. In the case of the amnesic toxin the effect was reversed, detecting hyperactivity with a detection threshold of 10 mu g/mL domoic acid. We propose that this assay might be used as a complementary tool for environmental safety monitoring.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study of energy, water, and carbon exchanges between ecosystems and the atmosphere is important in understanding the role of vegetation in regional microclimates. However, they are still relatively scarce when it comes to Caatinga vegetation. This study aims to identify differences in the dynamics of critical environmental variables such as net radiation (Rn), evapotranspiration (ET), and carbon fluxes (gross primary production, GPP) in contrasting recovered Caatinga (dense Caatinga, DC) and degraded Caatinga (sparse Caatinga, SC) in the state of Paraiba, northeastern Brazil. Estimates were performed using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), and comparisons between estimated and measured data were conducted based on the coefficient of determination (R-2). The fluxes were measured using the Eddy Covariance (EC) method for comparison with the same variables derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data aboard the Terra satellite. The estimates showed higher Rn values for the DC, indicating that this area should have greater energy availability for physical, biological, and chemical processes. The R-2 between daily Rn estimates and observations was 0.93. The ET estimated using the SEBAL showed higher differences in relation to the observed values; however, it presented better spatial discrimination of the surface features. The MOD16A2 algorithm, however, presented ET values closer to the observed data and agreed with the seasonality of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The DC generally showed higher ET values than the SC, while the MODIS data (GPP MOD17A2H) presented a temporal behavior closer to the observations. The difference between the two areas was more evident in the rainy season. The R-2 values between GPP and GPP MOD17A2H were 0.76 and 0.65 for DC and SC, respectively. In addition, the R-2 values for GPP Observed and GPP modeled were lower, i.e., 0.28 and 0.12 for the DC and SC, respectively. The capture of CO2 is more evident for the DC considering the whole year, with the SC showing a notable increase in CO2 absorption only in the rainy season. The GPP estimated from the MOD17A2H showed a predominant underestimation but evidenced the effects of land use and land cover changes over the two areas for all seasons.

TI  - Spiritual Discourse in the Jesuit Missions: The Role of Nature in the Evangelization of Peru (Sixteenth-Seventeenth Centuries)
T2  - JOURNAL OF JESUIT STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article explores how, notwithstanding their suspicions that the devil could take advantage of the animistic beliefs of Peru's native inhabitants to consolidate idolatry, the Jesuit missionaries ultimately became more understanding of the spiritual Andean worldview. From St. Ignatius of Loyola's postulate of "Contemplation to Obtain Love" in the Spiritual Exercises, by which God is acting and present in nature and inhabits creatures, and thanks to their continuous contact with the aboriginal population, the Jesuit missionaries were able to better understand the indigenous relationship with nature, for example through natural medicine and pharmacopoeia. They were therefore able to bridge some gaps in an intercultural exchange that produced forms of religious hybridization that are still a feature of Andean Christianity today.

TI  - Impact of Regional Warming on Primary Production of the Kara Sea in the Last Two Decades (2002-2021)
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The interannual (2002-2021) variability of primary production (PP) of the Kara Sea and associated environmental factors was assessed by MODIS-Aqua data and model calculations. Warming in the Kara Sea region during the last two decades was characterized by a pronounced positive trend of the sea surface temperature (T-0) and weak positive trend of the ice-free area (S) averaged for the growing season (April-October). During the investigated period, T-0 increased by 3.55 degrees C with a trend of 10% y(-1) and S increased by 110 x 10(3) km(2) with a trend of 1.4% y(-1), on average. The values for the water column PP (IPP) averaged over the growing season statistically significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the all Kara Sea regions (R (2) = 0.22-0.59). For the entire Kara Sea, IPP declined by 38 mgC m(-2) d(-1) with a moderate trend of 1.1% y(-1) (R (2) = 0.37). The value of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) averaged over the growing season weakly, but statistically significantly (p < 0.05), decreased in the entire Kara Sea areas (R-2 = 0.20-0.31). Also, in all regions, significant (R (2) = 0.24 - 0.38) weak or moderate negative trends of surface chlorophyll (chl) a were specified. The total annual PP (PPtot) increased insignificantly in accordance with an increase in S (0.7% y(-1), R (2) = 0.08). The most significant decrease in IPP was specified for spring (R (2) = 0.28). In autumn, a statistically significant positive trend of S (R (2) = 0.24) was observed. Owing to such an increase in S, the notable growth of PPtot was noted in autumn. This study demonstrates that the decrease of IPP, resulting from the decrease in PAR and chl, in some degree was the reason for moderation of PPtot. It should be concluded that in a period of intense warming, the decrease in IPP of the Kara Sea should affect the productivity of higher trophic levels of the food web.

TI  - Eco-Efficiency Evaluation of Sloping Land Conversion Program and Its Spatial and Temporal Evolution: Evidence from 314 Counties in the Loess Plateau of China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - China's Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) is the largest ecological restoration program (ERP) in the world. Since its full implementation in China in 2002, it has achieved remarkable eco-effects worldwide. However, few researchers have paid attention to the efficiency behind the ecological achievements. Understanding the eco-efficiency of the Sloping Land Conversion Program (EEoSLCP) and its spatial and temporal evolution is necessary for the design and implementation of other ERPs. Therefore, we took the counties reflecting the basic implementation units of the SLCP as the research samples, and evaluated and analyzed the EEoSLCP on the Loess Plateau (LP) and its spatial and temporal evolution based on remote sensing data and county statistics. Our results reveal that: (1) The SLCP in LP has achieved good eco-effects, but the eco-efficiency is generally low. (2) The EEoSLCP of the LP is increasing year by year in time and the spatial distribution pattern is "high in the southeast and low in the northwest" with a gradual decrease in efficiency from southeast to northwest. (3) The EEoSLCP in each county of the LP has a positive spatial autocorrelation and this correlation increases with the passage of time. (4) The EEoSLCP in each county of the LP shows relatively stable geographical spatial agglomeration characteristics of "H-H" and "L-L" in local spatial autocorrelation, and there are spatial neighboring companion effects and spatial neighboring spillover effects in the EEoSLCP in each county of the LP. (5) Natural conditions and redundancy of input and output are important reasons that affect the level of EEoSLCP. Our study will not only provide a general approach and methodological framework for evaluating the eco-efficiency of ERPs and their spatial and temporal evolution, but also provide better guidance and inspiration for the implementation of large-scale ERPs in the background of "The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration" and the "carbon peaking and carbon neutrality" strategy.

TI  - Investigation of the Efficiency of Satellite-Derived LST Data for Mapping the Meteorological Parameters in Istanbul
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential parameter for studying environmental and ecological processes and climate change at various scales. It is also valuable for studies of evapotranspiration, soil moisture conditions, surface energy balance, and urban heat islands. Since meteorological station data can provide a limited number of point data, satellite images that provide high temporal and spatial resolution LST data in large areas are needed to be used in all these applications. In this study, the usage of satellite-derived LST images was investigated in comparison with meteorological station data measurements in Istanbul, which has heterogeneous urban structures. LST data were obtained from Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The linear correlation analysis performed between Landsat LST and MODIS LST images gave a high correlation (r = 0.88). In the correlation analysis, hourly air temperature and soil temperature meteorology station data provided by the State Meteorological Service and LST values obtained from images taken from Landsat TM/TIRS and Terra MODIS were used. The correlations between air temperatures and Landsat LST ranged from 0.47-0.95 for 1987-2017 to 0.44-0.80 for MODIS LST for 2000-2017. The correlations between 5 cm soil temperatures and Landsat LST ranged from 0.76-0.93 for 2009-2017 to 0.22-0.61 for MODIS LST 2000-2017. In addition, linear regression models produced with meteorological parameters and LST values were applied to 2022 LST maps to show the spatial distribution of these parameters, and then, accuracy analyses were made.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Data for Accurate Crop Yield Predictions: A Case Study Using STARFM NDVI in Bavaria, Germany
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability and variety of global satellite products and the rapid development of new algorithms has provided great potential to generate a new level of data with different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. However, the ability of these synthetic spatiotemporal datasets to accurately map and monitor our planet on a field or regional scale remains underexplored. This study aimed to support future research efforts in estimating crop yields by identifying the optimal spatial (10 m, 30 m, or 250 m) and temporal (8 or 16 days) resolutions on a regional scale. The current study explored and discussed the suitability of four different synthetic (Landsat (L)-MOD13Q1 (30 m, 8 and 16 days) and Sentinel-2 (S)-MOD13Q1 (10 m, 8 and 16 days)) and two real (MOD13Q1 (250 m, 8 and 16 days)) NDVI products combined separately to two widely used crop growth models (CGMs) (World Food Studies (WOFOST), and the semi-empiric Light Use Efficiency approach (LUE)) for winter wheat (WW) and oil seed rape (OSR) yield forecasts in Bavaria (70,550 km(2)) for the year 2019. For WW and OSR, the synthetic products' high spatial and temporal resolution resulted in higher yield accuracies using LUE and WOFOST. The observations of high temporal resolution (8-day) products of both S-MOD13Q1 and L-MOD13Q1 played a significant role in accurately measuring the yield of WW and OSR. For example, L- and S-MOD13Q1 resulted in an R-2 = 0.82 and 0.85, RMSE = 5.46 and 5.01 dt/ha for WW, R-2 = 0.89 and 0.82, and RMSE = 2.23 and 2.11 dt/ha for OSR using the LUE model, respectively. Similarly, for the 8- and 16-day products, the simple LUE model (R-2 = 0.77 and relative RMSE (RRMSE) = 8.17%) required fewer input parameters to simulate crop yield and was highly accurate, reliable, and more precise than the complex WOFOST model (R-2 = 0.66 and RRMSE = 11.35%) with higher input parameters. Conclusively, both S-MOD13Q1 and L-MOD13Q1, in combination with LUE, were more prominent for predicting crop yields on a regional scale than the 16-day products; however, L-MOD13Q1 was advantageous for generating and exploring the long-term yield time series due to the availability of Landsat data since 1982, with a maximum resolution of 30 m. In addition, this study recommended the further use of its findings for implementing and validating the long-term crop yield time series in different regions of the world.

TI  - Image-Guided Localization Techniques for Metastatic Axillary Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer; What Radiologists Should Know
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) is an axillary staging technique after NACT that involves the removal of biopsy-proven metastatic lymph nodes in addition to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). This technique avoids the morbidity of traditional axillary lymph node dissection and has shown a lower false-negative rate than SLNB alone. Therefore, marking positive axillary lymph nodes before NACT is critical in order to locate and remove them in the subsequent surgery. Current localization methods include clip placement with intraoperative ultrasound, carbon-suspension liquids, localization wires, radioactive tracer-based localizers, magnetic seeds, radar reflectors, and radiofrequency identification devices. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the management of axillary lymph nodes based on current guidelines and explain the features of axillary lymph node markers, with relative advantages and disadvantages.

TI  - Research on Scale Improvement of Geochemical Exploration Based on Remote Sensing Image Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Both remote sensing and geochemical exploration technologies are effective tools for detecting target objects. Although information on anomalous geochemical elemental abundances differs in terms of professional attributes from remote sensing data, both are based on geological bodies or phenomena on the Earth's surface. Therefore, exploring the use of remote sensing data with high spatial resolution to improve the accuracy of small-scale geochemical data, and fusing them to obtain large-scale geochemical layers could provide new data for geological and mineral exploration through inversion. This study provides a method of fusing remote sensing images with small-scale geochemical data based on a linear regression model that improves the resolution of geochemical elemental layers and provides reference data for mineral exploration in areas lacking large-scale geochemical data. In the Xianshuigou area of Northwest China, a fusion study was conducted using 200,000 geochemical and remote sensing data. The method provides fused large-scale regional chemical data in well-exposed areas where large-scale geochemical data are lacking and could provide potential data sources for regional mineral exploration.

TI  - A Study of GNSS-IR Soil Moisture Inversion Algorithms Integrating Robust Estimation with Machine Learning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture monitoring is widely used in agriculture, water resource management, and disaster prevention, which is of great significance for sustainability. The global navigation satellite system interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR) technology provides a supplementary method for soil moisture monitoring. However, due to the quality of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements and the complex surface environment, inevitable outliers in multipath interference signal metrics (amplitude, frequency, and phase) were used as modeling variables to inverse GNSS-IR soil moisture. Besides, it is hard to use the univariate model to comprehensively analyze the relationship between the various factors, due to the poor fitting effect and weak generalization ability of the model. In this paper, the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) robust estimation and machine learning algorithms are adopted. The MCD robust estimation can eliminate outliers of the multipath signal metrics and machine learning algorithms, including the back propagation neural network (BPNN), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forest (RF), and can comprehensively establish nonlinear GNSS-IR soil moisture inversion models using multipath interference signal metrics. Moreover, the study of the modeling parameter selection for the three machine learning algorithms and the inversion results for single satellite and all satellites are also carried out to make the algorithms more generalizable. The results show that the correlation coefficients (R) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the machine learning models for all satellite tracks are increased by 4.3 similar to 86.6% and reduced by 2.8 similar to 30%, respectively, compared with the MCD multiple regression model. The RF model with 80 decision trees and 1 node shows the clearest improvement. The total model using all satellite data has more generalization ability than the single satellite model but causes some loss of accuracy.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted hybrid satellite-terrestrial cooperative system is considered, where direct transmission between the satellite and the destination is not present due to the masking effect and the destination node receives amplify-and-forward relayed transmission through an IRS. It is assumed that the channel between satellite and relay undergoes shadowed Rician fading, while the cascaded relay-IRS-destination link follow Rayleigh distribution. The performance of the considered system is evaluated by deriving an approximate closed-form expression for the average symbol error rate (SER) of the considered system for $M$-ary phase-shift keying modulation. Further, analysis for diversity order is also carried out using the asymptotic SER. In addition to this, analytical expressions for upper bound on the ergodic capacity and the outage probability of the considered system are also obtained.

TI  - Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided Integrated Terrestrial-Satellite Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a novel technology to manipulate wireless propagation channels via smart and controllable signal reflection. In this paper, we investigate an IRS-aided integrated terrestrial-satellite network (ITSN) system, where the IRS is deployed to assist the co-existing transmissions of the terrestrial small base stations (SBSs) and the satellite. Because of the spectrum sharing in the ITSN, the interference between the two systems should be carefully mitigated. Our objective is to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all users by jointly optimizing the frame-based coordinated transmit beamforming vectors at the SBSs, the phase shift matrix at the IRS, and the frame user scheduling, subject to SBSs' individual power constraints and unit modulus constraints of phase shifters. To this end, we first adopt the agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) method to schedule the satellite users to different frames. Then the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is proposed, which alternately optimizes the transmit beamforming vectors and the reflective phase shift matrix. In particular, the optimal transmit beamforming vectors are obtained via the fractional programming (FP) technique. Meanwhile, two efficient algorithms, i.e., the Riemannian manifold (RM) and the successive convex approximation (SCA), are proposed for the phase shift optimization. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance gain of our schemes over other benchmark schemes.

TI  - Modeling the Corn Residue Coverage after Harvesting and before Sowing in Northeast China by Random Forest and Soil Texture Zoning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residue cover is vital for reducing soil erosion and improving soil fertility, which is an important way of conserving tillage to protect the black soil in Northeast China. How much the crop residue covers on cropland is of significance for black soil protection. Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images were used to estimate corn residue coverage (CRC) in Northeast China in this study. The estimation model of CRC was established for improving CRC estimation accuracy by the optimal combination of spectral indices and textural features, based on soil texture zoning, using the random forest regression method. Our results revealed that (1) the optimization C5 of spectral indices and textural features improves the CRC estimation accuracy after harvesting and before sowing with determination coefficients (R-2) of 0.78 and 0.73, respectively; (2) the random forest improves the CRC estimation accuracy after harvesting and before sowing with R-2 of 0.81 and 0.77, respectively; (3) considering the spatial heterogeneity of the soil background and the usage of soil texture zoning models increase the accuracy of CRC estimation after harvesting and before sowing with R-2 of 0.84 and 0.81, respectively. In general, the CRC estimation accuracy after harvesting was better than that before sowing. The results revealed that the corn residue coverage in most of the study area was 0.3 to 0.6 and was mainly distributed in the Songnen Plain. By the estimated corn residue coverage results, the implementation of conservation tillage practices is identified, which is vital for protecting the black soil in Northeast China.

TI  - Intensive land-use is associated with development status in port cities of Southeast Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Port cities in Southeast Asia (SEA) have been undergoing intensive land use and land cover change (LUCC) because of rapid socio-economic development in recent decades. However, various development statuses among these cities could result in divergent LUCC transitions and therefore affect the local ecosystem at different levels. This study investigated the historic land-use transition in the SEA port cities by classifying Landsat images from 1990 to 2020 with the random forest algorithm, and further integrated these patterns with land-use modeling to inform the future land uses under the current developing mode. DIVISON was used to assess land-use fragmentation and investigated its relationship with development levels represented by the average nighttime light index (ANLI). The results showed an intensive LUCC in SEA port cities in 1990-2020, with artificial surface increasing by 9.2% (175.9 km(2)) of the total area, mainly converted from cultivated land which decreased by 136.9 km(2). An inverted V-shaped relationship between fragmentation and development level was found at the landscape level and for cultivated land, in which both turning points (TPs) occurred in the mid-developed stage (ANLI = 41.1 and 20.0, respectively). Artificial surfaces tended to be more aggregated in later developed stages, showing a TP of ANLI around 53.2. Under the current developing mode, the aggregation trend will be generally continued for the next three decades, mainly resulting from the increased connection in artificial surfaces. The findings also highlighted a tradeoff between city development and agricultural production in SEA port cities, leading to increased food insecurity in more developed stages. Recent developments also negatively affected aqua ecosystems, such as aquaculture, mangroves, and natural waterbodies in several cities. This study underscored the importance of the sustainable LUCC strategy in SEA port cities and provides insights into rationalizing land-use policies for other port cities worldwide.

TI  - Deep Machine Learning Based Possible Atmospheric and Ionospheric Precursors of the 2021 Mw 7.1 Japan Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)- and Remote Sensing (RS)-based Earth observations have a significant approach on the monitoring of natural disasters. Since the evolution and appearance of earthquake precursors exhibit complex behavior, the need for different methods on multiple satellite data for earthquake precursors is vital for prior and after the impending main shock. This study provided a new approach of deep machine learning (ML)-based detection of ionosphere and atmosphere precursors. In this study, we investigate multi-parameter precursors of different physical nature defining the states of ionosphere and atmosphere associated with the event in Japan on 13 February 2021 (M-w 7.1). We analyzed possible precursors from surface to ionosphere, including Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Air Temperature (AT), Relative Humidity (RH), Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR), and Total Electron Content (TEC). Furthermore, the aim is to find a possible pre-and post-seismic anomaly by implementing standard deviation (STDEV), wavelet transformation, the Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with Exogenous Inputs (NARX) model, and the Long Short-Term Memory Inputs (LSTM) network. Interestingly, every method shows anomalous variations in both atmospheric and ionospheric precursors before and after the earthquake. Moreover, the geomagnetic irregularities are also observed seven days after the main shock during active storm days (Kp > 3.7; Dst < -30 nT). This study demonstrates the significance of ML techniques for detecting earthquake anomalies to support the Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling (LAIC) mechanism for future studies.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatial-Temporal Pattern of the Newly Increased Cultivated Land and Its Vulnerability in Northeast China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensuring compliance with China's "1.8 billion mu" (120 million hectares) cultivated land preservation policy is a fundamental goal of land policy. Northeast China has experienced significant cultivated land expansion due to rigorous compensation policies over the past two decades, resulting in sustainable increases in grain output. This research employs remote sensing data to examine the spatial-temporal pattern and vulnerability of newly increased cultivated land expansion in Northeast China and its potential impact on food security. Results indicate a 3.08% increase in newly increased cultivated land from 2000 to 2020, with the majority located in the Sanjiang Plain's humid area and Inner Mongolia's arid and semi-arid regions. The low quality of newly added cultivated land makes it highly vulnerable. Temperature instability significantly and negatively correlates with cultivated land expansion. The vulnerability of cultivated land is negatively and significantly related to grain yield, suggesting an adverse impact on national food security. This study focuses on the marginal impact of newly increased cultivated land and proposes policy recommendations.

TI  - Black Carbon Emissions, Transport and Effect on Radiation Forcing Modelling during the Summer 2019-2020 Wildfires in Southeast Australia
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The emission of black carbon (BC) particles, which cause atmospheric warming by affecting radiation budget in the atmosphere, is the result of an incomplete combustion process of organic materials. The recent wildfire event during the summer 2019-2020 in south-eastern Australia was unprecedented in scale. The wildfires lasted for nearly 3 months over large areas of the two most populated states of New South Wales and Victoria. This study on the emission and dispersion of BC emitted from the biomass burnings of the wildfires using the Weather Research Forecast-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model aims to determine the extent of BC spatial dispersion and ground concentration distribution and the effect of BC on air quality and radiative transfer at the top of the atmosphere, the atmosphere and on the ground. The predicted aerosol concentration and AOD are compared with the observed data using the New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment (DPE) aethalometer and air quality network and remote sensing data. The BC concentration as predicted from the WRF-Chem model, is in general, less than the observed data as measured using the aethalometer monitoring network, but the spatial pattern corresponds well, and the correlation is relatively high. The total BC emission into the atmosphere during the event and the effect on radiation budget were also estimated. This study shows that the summer 2019-2020 wildfires affect not only the air quality and health impact on the east coast of Australia but also short-term weather in the region via aerosol interactions with radiation and clouds.

TI  - Wetlands Insight Tool: Characterising the Surface Water and Vegetation Cover Dynamics of Individual Wetlands Using Multidecadal Landsat Satellite Data
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands around the world provide crucial ecosystem services and are under increasing pressure from multiple sources including climate change, changing flow and flooding regimes, and encroaching human populations. The Landsat satellite imagery archive provides a unique observational record of how wetlands have responded to these impacts during the last three decades. Information stored within this archive has historically been difficult to access due to its petabyte-scale and the challenges in converting Earth observation data into biophysical measurements that can be interpreted by wetland ecologists and catchment managers. This paper introduces the Wetlands Insight Tool (WIT), a workflow that generates WIT plots that present a multidecadal view of the biophysical cover types contained within individual Australian wetlands. The WIT workflow summarises Earth observation data over 35 years at 30 m resolution within a user-defined wetland boundary to produce a time-series plot (WIT plot) of the percentage of the wetland covered by open water, areas of water mixed with vegetation ('wet'), green vegetation, dry vegetation, and bare soil. We compare these WIT plots with documented changes that have occurred in floodplain shrublands, alpine peat wetlands, and lacustrine and palustrine wetlands, demonstrating the power of satellite observations to supplement ground-based data collection in a diverse range of wetland types. The use of WIT plots to observe and manage wetlands enables improved evidence-based decision making.

TI  - Paddy Rice Double-Cropping Field Monitoring via Vegetation Indices with Limited Ground Data-A Case Study for Thapanzeik Dam Irrigation District in Myanmar
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated two popular satellite-derived vegetation indices (VIs), MODIS NDVI and EVI, as tools for monitoring crop growth at the Thapanzeik Dam irrigation district in Myanmar, where quality ground data are difficult to obtain. The time-series analysis for seasonal peak VIs presented a considerable improvement in paddy cultivation during 2001-2020 in the irrigation district during summer and monsoon. Fields outside the district had a much lower improvement ratio. Within the irrigation district, a canal with limited water supply was identified via peak and average VIs evaluation. The evaluation of precipitation impact on crop growth demonstrated an opposite impact on crop growth in summer and monsoon cultivations. Water is one of the limiting factors in summer in the irrigation district; thus, precipitation improves water conditions. However, water is not the limiting factor in monsoon; thus, extra water from precipitation, both hydraulically and meteorologically, negatively impacts crop growth. Compared to NDVI, EVI better captured crop growth in densely vegetated surfaces. Meanwhile, information degradation might have occurred with 250 m EVI, using 500 m blue-band reflectance as an input. Thus, the best vegetation index to use depends on the purpose of monitoring and the site situation.

TI  - Integrating Satellite Imagery and Ground-Based Measurements with a Machine Learning Model for Monitoring Lake Dynamics over a Semi-Arid Region
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term variability of lacustrine dynamics is influenced by hydro-climatological factors that affect the depth and spatial extent of water bodies. The primary objective of this study is to delineate lake area extent, utilizing a machine learning approach, and to examine the impact of these hydro-climatological factors on lake dynamics. In situ and remote sensing observations were employed to identify the predominant explanatory pathways for assessing the fluctuations in lake area. The Great Salt Lake (GSL) and Lake Chad (LC) were chosen as study sites due to their semi-arid regional settings, enabling the testing of the proposed approach. The random forest (RF) supervised classification algorithm was applied to estimate the lake area extent using Landsat imagery that was acquired between 1999 and 2021. The long-term lake dynamics were evaluated using remotely sensed evapotranspiration data that were derived from MODIS, precipitation data that were sourced from CHIRPS, and in situ water level measurements. The findings revealed a marked decline in the GSL area extent, exceeding 50% between 1999 and 2021, whereas LC exhibited greater fluctuations with a comparatively lower decrease in its area extent, which was approximately 30% during the same period. The framework that is presented in this study demonstrates the reliability of remote sensing data and machine learning methodologies for monitoring lacustrine dynamics. Furthermore, it provides valuable insights for decision makers and water resource managers in assessing the temporal variability of lake dynamics.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS combined DT and DB AOD retrievals and their association with meteorological variables over Qena, Egypt
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to validate the daily Terra-MODIS level 2 combined dark target (DT) and deep blue (DB) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals with a spatial resolution of 10 km against the ground-based AERONET AOD data to be used in evaluating the air pollution and impact of meteorological variables over Qena, Egypt, in 2019. The regression analysis demonstrated an accepted agreement between the MODIS and AERONET AOD data with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.7118 and 74.22% of the collocated points fall within the expected error (EE) limits. Quality flag filtering and spatial and temporal collocation were found to have a significant impact on the regression results. Quality flag filtering increased R by 0.2091 and % within EE by 17.97, spatial collocation increased R by 0.0143 and % within EE by 1.13, and temporal collocation increased R by 0.0089 and % within EE by 4.43. By validating the MODIS AOD data seasonally and analyzing the temporal distribution of the seasonal AOD data to show the retrieval accuracy variations between seasons, it was found that the MODIS AOD observations overestimated the AERONET AOD values in all seasons, and this may be because of underestimating the surface reflectance. Perhaps the main reason for the highest overestimation in summer and autumn is the transportation of aerosols from other regions, which changes the aerosol model in Qena, making accurate aerosol-type assumptions more difficult. Therefore, this study recommends necessary improvements regarding the aerosol model selection and the surface reflectance calculations. Temperature and relative humidity were found to have a strong negative relationship with a correlation of - 0.735, and both have a moderate association with AOD with a correlation of 0.451 and - 0.356, respectively. Because Qena is not a rainy city, precipitation was found to have no correlation with the other variables.

TI  - Nudging General Practitioners to explore suicidal thoughts among depressed patients
T2  - BMC PRIMARY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWhile frank discussion of suicidal thoughts in patients with depression is important for the prevention of suicide, suicide exploration of General Practitioners (GPs) is suboptimal. This study aimed to assess whether an intervention that prompts pop-up screens nudges GPs to more frequently explore suicidal thoughts over the course of two years.MethodsFrom January 2017 to December 2018, the intervention was incorporated in the information system of the Dutch general practice sentinel network. New registration of an episode of depression triggered a pop-up screen referring to a questionnaire about GPs' behaviour with regard to exploring suicidal thoughts. In two years, 625 questionnaires were completed by GPs and analysed using multilevel logistic regression analyses.ResultsCompared to the first year, GPs were 50% more likely to explore suicidal thoughts among patients in the second year (OR 1.48; 95%CI 1.01-2.16). When adjusting for patients' gender and age we found that the effect of the pop-up screens disappeared (OR 1.33; 95% CI 0.90-1.97). Suicide exploration occurred less frequently in women than in men (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.43-0.98) and in older compared to younger patients (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.96-0.98 per year older). In addition, 26% of variation in suicide exploration was because of differences in general practice. There was no evidence that general practices developed differently over time.ConclusionsAlthough low cost and easy to administer, the pop-up system was not effective in nudging GPs to explore suicidality more frequently. We encourage studies to test whether implementing these nudges as part of a multifaceted approach will lead to a stronger effect. Moreover, we recommend researchers to include more variables, such as work experience or previous mental health training, to better understand the effects of the intervention on GPs' behaviour.

TI  - Pure Tubular Breast Carcinoma: Clinicopathological Characteristics and Clinical Outcomes
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Tubular breast carcinoma (TBC) is a rare subtype of breast carcinoma (BC) with a good prognosis. In this study, we aimed to assess the clinicopathological characteristics of pure TBC (PTBC), analyze factors that may influence long-term prognosis, examine the frequency of axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM), and discuss the need for axillary surgery in PTBC.Materials and Methods: Fifty-four Patients diagnosed with PTBC between January 2003 and December 2020 at Istanbul Faculty of Medicine were included. Clinicopathological, surgical, treatment, and overall survival (OS) data were analyzed.Results: A total of 54 patients with a mean age of 52.2 years were assessed. The mean size of the tumor was 10.6 mm. Four (7.4%) patients had not undergone axillary surgery, while thirty-eight (70.4%) had undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy and twelve (22.2%) had undergone axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Significantly, four (33.3%) of those who had undergone ALND had tumor grade 2 (p = 0.020) and eight of them (66.7%) had ALNM. Fifty percent (50%) of patients who were treated with chemotherapy had grade 2 and multifocal tumors and ALNM. Moreover, the frequency of ALNM was higher in patients with tumor diameters greater than 10 mm. Median follow-up time was 80 months (12-220). None of the patients had locoregional recurrence, but one patient had systemic metastasis. Furthermore, five-year OS was 97.9%, while ten-year OS was 93.6%.Conclusion: PTBC is associated with favorable prognosis, good clinical outcomes and high survival rate, with rare recurrences and metastases.

TI  - Estimation for Ground Air Temperature Using GEO-KOMPSAT-2A and Deep Neural Network
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study suggests deep neural network models for estimating air temperature with Level 1B (L1B) datasets of GEO-KOMPSAT-2A (GK-2A). The temperature at 1.5 m above the ground impact not only daily life but also weather warnings such as cold and heat waves. There are many studies to assume the air temperature from the land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from satellites because the air temperature has a strong relationship with the LST. However, an algorithm of the LST, Level 2 output of GK-2A, works only clear sky pixels. To overcome the cloud effects, we apply a deep neural network (DNN) model to assume the air temperature with L1B calibrated for radiometric and geometrics from raw satellite data and compare the model with a linear regression model between LST and air temperature. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of the air temperature for model outputs are used to evaluate the model. The number of 95 in-situ air temperature data was 2,496,634 and the ratio of datasets paired with LST and L1B show 42.1% and 98.4%. The training years are 2020 and 2021 and 2022 is used to validate. The DNN model is designed with an input layer taking 16 channels and four hidden fully connected layers to assume an air temperature. As a result of the model using 16 bands of L1B, the DNN with RMSE 2.22 degrees C showed great performance than the baseline model with RMSE 3.55 degrees C on clear sky conditions and the total RMSE including overcast samples was 3.33 degrees C. It is suggested that the DNN is able to overcome cloud effects. However, it showed different characteristics in seasonal and hourly analysis and needed to append solar information as inputs to make a general DNN model because the summer and winter seasons showed a low coefficient of determinations with high standard deviations.

TI  - Friction Velocity and Aerodynamic Drag Coefficient Retrieval from Sentinel-1 IW Cross-Polarization C-SAR Images under Hurricane Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an approach for friction velocity and aerodynamic drag coefficient retrieval utilizing C-band VH SAR observations from Sentinel-1. The dataset contained 14 SAR images collected under six hurricane scenes co-analyzed with stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) measurements. The basis for creating this approach utilizes the results proposed earlier linking the parameters of the atmospheric boundary layer from GPS-dropsondes data to the ocean surface emissivity from SFMR measurements. The obtained dependencies of the ocean surface emissivity on surface friction velocity, aerodynamic drag coefficient, and surface wind speed are analyzed together with the collocated SAR data leading to the new GMF valid for the retrieval of friction velocities ranging from 0.55-1.56 m/s and drag coefficient values ranging from 0.00076-0.00232 for all sub swaths. Within the framework of the proposed approach, dependences of the normalized radar cross-section on the surface wind speed were also obtained and used for comparison with existing GMFs to show that the proposed approach is valid. A good consistency was obtained when comparing our results with H14(E) and MS1A. As an example the distributions of friction velocity, drag coefficient, and surface wind speed retrieved from the Hurricane Maria SAR image (23 September 2017) were considered.

TI  - Utilization of ASTER data in lithological and lineament mapping of the southern flank of the Central High Atlas in Morocco
T2  - GEOLOGOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological mapping undoubtedly plays an important role in several studies and remote sensing data are of great significance in geological mapping, particularly in poorly mapped areas situated in inaccessible regions. In the present study, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Band Rationing (BR) and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) algorithms are applied to map lithological units and extract lineaments in the Amezri-Amassine area, by using multispectral ASTER image and global digital elevation model (GDEM) data for the first time. Following preprocessing of ASTER images, advanced image algorithms such as PCA, BR and MNF analyses are applied to the 9ASTER bands. Validation of the resultant maps has relied on matching lithological boundaries and faults in the study area and on the basis of pre-existing geological maps. In addition to the PCA image, a new band-ratio image, 4/6-5/8-4/5, as adopted in the present work, provides high accuracy in discriminating lithological units. The MNF transformation reveals improvement over previous enhancement techniques, in detailing most rock units in the area. Hence, results derived from the enhancement techniques show a good correlation with the existing litho-structural map of the study area. In addition, the present results have allowed to update this map by identifying new lithological units and structural lineaments. Consequently, the methodology followed here has provided satisfactory results and has demonstrated the high potential of multispectral ASTER data for improving lithological discrimination and lineament extraction.

TI  - Differences in fruit yields and essential oil contents and composition among natural provenances of <i>Litsea cubeba</i> in China and their relationships with main habitat factors
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Litsea cubeba (Lour.) Pers. is an important industrial tree in southern China and Southeast Asia. We surveyed and sampled wild L. cubeba in 32 provenances spread across nine provinces of China. We used nested variance analysis, multiple comparisons analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, Pearson's correlation analysis, path analysis with multiple stepwise regression, detrended correspondence analysis, redundancy analysis, and variance partitioning analysis to evaluate the phenotypic diversity of fresh fruit yield (FFY) and essential oil (EO) characteristics of L. cubeba, and to explore the relationship between the main habitat factors and phenotypic diversity. We detected wide phenotypic diversity in FFY, EO content (EOC), citral yield (CitrY), and the pro-portions of the seven main components of EOs (citral, D-limonene, 3,7-dimethyl-3,6-octadienal, 4-methyl-3-pentenal, linalool, citronellal, and 1-(cyclopanecarbonyl)piperidin-4-one). The variation was mainly derived from among provenances (P <= 0.01) rather than within provenances, and the variation in FFY and CitrY was greater than that of EOC and the seven dominant components among provenances. We also detected several region-specific components of EOs in fresh fruit, including alpha-terpineol, geraniol, eucalyptol, and 7-methyl-3-methyleneoct-6-enal. Most of the provenances with higher FFY were distributed in southwestern China (lower longitude and latitude, and higher elevation), while most of those with higher EOC were distributed in south-eastern China (higher longitude and latitude, and lower elevation). The three provenances with excellent FFY were YN-XC, GZ-ZY, and SC-KJ; the two with higher EOC were SC-KJ and HN-DX; and CitrP was higher in GZ-ZF than in other provenances. Longitude, total potassium content (TotalKC), and bulk density (BD) were the most important factors that influenced FFY diversity, while latitude, elevation, annual average relative humidity (AARH), and organic carbon content (OCC) most strongly influenced EOC diversity, and annual average temperature and annual average maximum temperature (AAMaxT) influenced CitrP diversity. The six main habitat factors together explaining the largest proportions of phenotypic diversity were longitude, AARH, AAMaxT, elevation, latitude, and soil total phosphorus content (TotalPC). Higher soil TotalKC, BD, and TotalPC were suitable conditions for cultivation of L. cubeba to achieve higher FFY, while lower AARH and OCC were favorable for accumulation of EOs, and only lower temperature was more likely conducive to citral synthesis. The wide diversity of FFY and EO characteristics should be taken into account when selecting germplasms for protection and utilization, and the identification of the most important environmental factors affecting phenotypic diversity provides a theoretical basis for the optimization of L. cubeba cultivation.

TI  - The Spatio-Temporal Evolution Characteristics of the Vegetation NDVI in the Northern Slope of the Tianshan Mountains at Different Spatial Scales
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purposes of this study are to reveal the spatial pattern and dynamic changes of NDVI in the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains for an extended period and to explore whether the spatial and temporal evolution of NDVI in different spatial scales is consistent so as to provide a reasonable theoretical basis for the selection of appropriate remote sensing spatial resolution in the study area. The GIMMS NDVI remote sensing data set was used to resample the NDVI data with three spatial resolutions of 0.5 km x 0.5 km, 1 km x 1 km, and 8 km x 8 km. The Mann-Kendall method was used to analyze the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of vegetation NDVI on the NTSM from 1981 to 2015. The results showed that the interannual variation trend and spatial distribution of vegetation NDVI were consistent at different spatial scales. The change of NDVI displayed an increasing trend with changes concentrated in the middle of the NTSM. Five distinct trends were observed: no significant change (35% of the area), significant positive change (26%), significant single peak change (15%), a significant U-shaped change relationship (12%), and significant negative change (11%). Remote sensing NDVI data with a spatial resolution of 8 km could be used to analyze the long-term interannual variation trend of vegetation NDVI on the NTSM.

TI  - Study on Factors Affecting Remote Sensing Ecological Quality Combined with Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reasonable allocation of urban resources can effectively control changes in ecological quality. This study used Sentinel-2 images, taking urban functional areas as the dividing scale, and combined spatial analysis, statistics, and other relevant methods to explore the factors influencing remote sensing ecological quality in Puxi, Shanghai, China. Landsat-8 and high-resolution Sentinel-2 data fusion achieved more refined remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) distribution data, which is of great significance for ecological quality exploration in small areas; the degree of influence of the selected research factors on the RSEI was spectral index > building > social perception > terrain. The R-value of the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was 0.970, and it exerted the strongest influence. The R-value of the average building height was 0.103, indicating that it had the weakest influence. The interactions among the selected factors were mainly two-factor and nonlinear enhancements. Most factor combinations exhibited two-factor enhancement. There were six groups of factor combinations for nonlinear enhancement, of which five were related to the average building height. The results of the present study provide a reference for multi-path ecological quality control in small-area regions.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Fusion Based on Two- branch U- shaped Transformer
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-spectral images are key references for earth observation. However,capturing rich spectral information introduces limited spatial resolution in multi-spectral imaging. To overcome the trade-off between spatial resolution and spectral resolution in remote sensing,panchromatic images with high spatial resolution but poor spectral information are adopted to complement multi-spectral imagery. As a result,the technique of fusing high- resolution panchromatic images and low-resolution multi- spectral images,namely pan-sharpening,is developed and facilitates various remote sensing application. Existing pan- sharpening methods can be roughly divided into four main categories: component substitution, multi-resolution analysis,variational optimization and deep learning. Each category has its own fusion strategy. Recently,a number of deep-learning- based methods are developed and obtain superior performance on fusion quality. These methods are typically based on convolutional neural networks and even combine the idea of generative adversarial networks. However,the inadequate extraction of global contextual and multi-scale features always leads to a loss of spectral information and spatial details. To solve this problem,a two-branch u- shaped transformer is proposed in this paper. Firstly,the multi-spectral and panchromatic images to be fused are partitioned into non-overlapping patches with fixed patch sizes,and each patch is embedded into a vector. The embedding vectors have the same feature dimension and contain the rich spectral and spatial information of the image patches. Subsequently,the embedding vectors of the multi- spectral and panchromatic images are fed into the two branches of the transformer encoder to extract hierarchical feature representations, respectively. The encoder consists of shifted windowing transformer blocks and patch emerging layers. Therefore,it can fully extract global and multi- scale features. In the encoding process, hierarchical panchromatic feature representations are injected into multi-spectral feature representations to obtain hierarchical fused feature representations. Besides,the high-level features are further fused through a transformer-based bottleneck. The transformer decoder progressively up-samples the high-level fused feature representation via patch expanding layers and suppresses redundant features via feature compression layers. In the decoding process,the hierarchical representations from the encoder are aggregated with the high-level fused feature representation via skip connections to avoid information loss. Finally,the decoder produces a high- resolution fused feature representation. Rearrangement and transposed convolution operations are used to reconstruct the desired high-resolution multi-spectral image from embedded patches. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on three datasets acquired by Gaofen- 2, QuickBird and WorldView-3 satellites. Since the ground-truth highresolution multi- spectral image is non-existent,the multi-spectral and panchromatic images are spatially degraded according to the Wald's protocol, and the original multi-spectral images can be used as the reference images to supervise the training of the proposed network. The proposed network is trained for 500 epochs by using an AdamW optimizer. The mean absolute error between the reference image and the fusion result is used as a loss function to guide the optimization of the proposed network.To evaluate the fusion results,four full- reference indices are adopted for testing at the reduced resolution. One no-reference index with its spectral distortion and spatial distortion components is used for testing at the full resolution. Since the feature dimension of embedding vectors and the size of partitioned patches are important hyperparameters that affect the performance and the computational complexity of the proposed method. Several model variants are built to observe the impact of the two hyper-parameters. The variant with an embedding vector dimension of 192 and a patch size of 4 has the best fusion results. However,compared with its huge computational cost, the improvement of fusion results is relatively limited. Therefore, the embedding vector dimension is set to 128 and the patch size is set to 4 in this paper. Subsequently,the proposed method is compared with eight widely used fusion methods to verify its effectiveness. With the original multi- spectral image as the reference image,the methods are firstly compared on images acquired by the three satellites at reduced resolution. Through visual results and residual maps between the fusion results and the reference image,it can be observed that the proposed method obtains the best visual quality and the smallest errors. As for quantitative evaluation via the objective indices,the proposed method also has the best quantitative results in terms of all the indicators on all the three kinds of testing data. Next,all the methods are compared on the original images acquired by the three satellites at full resolution. The visual result of the proposed method shows better preservation of both spectral information and spatial details than those of other methods. As for objective quantitative evaluation,the proposed method obtains the best results in terms of all the metrics on the Gaofen-2 data. On the QuickBird and WorldView-3 data,the proposed method shows better values than other methods on the spatial and overall indices. In conclusion, the reduced-resolution and full-resolution experimental results on the three data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of both subjective visual effect and quantitative metrics.

TI  - GF-1/6 Satellite Pixel-by-Pixel Quality Tagging Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat and Sentinel series satellites contain their own quality tagging data products, marking the source image pixel by pixel with several specific semantic categories. These data products generally contain categories such as cloud, cloud shadow, land, water body, and snow. Due to the lack of mid-wave and thermal infrared bands, the accuracy of traditional cloud detection algorithm is unstable when facing Chinese Gaofen-1/6 (GF-1/6) data. Moreover, it is challenging to distinguish clouds from snow. In order to produce GF-1/6 satellite pixel-by-pixel quality tagging data products, this paper builds a training sample set of more than 100,000 image pairs, primarily using Sentinel-2 satellite data. Then, we adopt the Swin Transformer model with a self-attention mechanism for GF-1/6 satellite image quality tagging. Experiments show that the model's overall accuracy reaches the level of Fmask v4.6 with more than 10,000 training samples, and the model can distinguish between cloud and snow correctly. Our GF-1/6 quality tagging algorithm can meet the requirements of the "Analysis Ready Data (ARD) Technology Research for Domestic Satellite" project.

TI  - Assessing the Spatial Agricultural Land Use Transition in Thies Region, Senegal, and Its Potential Driving Factors
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural land use transition (ALUT) assessment can be a prominent tool for comprehensively implementing suitable agricultural land use and agricultural development in Senegal. Based on remote sensing and survey data, this investigation aimed to simultaneously assess the geographical dispersion of ALUT and its probable mechanisms and determine the agricultural land functions in the Thies region. Through ArcGIS and ENVI software, the remote sensing data of 2000, 2010, and 2020, the transfer matrix method and a spatial index calculation were used to characterize the ALUT. Then, the mixed linear regression model was constructed to determine the relationship between ALUT and its potential driving factors. The main results show that ALUT was about -588.66 km(2). Regarding spatial distribution, a positive net ALUT was experienced in the north-west department of Tivaouane; conversely, a negative transition was noted in the southern Mbour department. The agricultural land per capita (0.37 ha/per) and the per capita agricultural income (USD $167.18) were unsatisfactory, and only 59.49% of the respondents frequently used fertilizers for production. The linear regression model showed that rainfall variability, research and development, soil salinization, and land tenure were significant at 1% (p < 0.01) with agricultural land change, living security, and ecological functions. Parallelly, transportation facilities (p < 0.01) and agricultural investment (p < 0.01) were also significant with agricultural land morphology change, while population growth (p < 0.1) was only correlated with agricultural land morphology change. These factors reflect the farmer's income and often induce land abandonment and degradation of agricultural land. Consequentially, the ALUT in the Thies region revealed several insights, such as the need to strengthen land use reforms and research and development. Therefore, agricultural land use is impacted by many fields that require an inter-discipline research method for practical and balanced use. Such endeavors could start with reconciling agricultural development and land conservation.

TI  - The Study of the Lithospheric Magnetic Field over Xinjiang and Tibet Areas Based on Ground, Airborne, and Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combined with the ground, airborne, and CHAMP satellite data, the lithospheric field over Xinjiang and Tibet is modeled through the three-dimensional Surface Spline (3DSS) model, Regional Spherical Harmonic Analysis (RSHA) model, and CHAOS-7.11 model. Then, we compare the results with the original measuring data, NGDC720, LCS-1, and the newest SHA model with the degree to 1000 (SHA1000). Moreover, the error estimation and the geological analysis are carried out, and we investigate the possible correspondence between the lithospheric field and the surface heat flow. The results show that the 3DSS model can better describe the detailed distribution of the lithospheric field after comparing it with other models. Some new features are reflected, particularly in the areas of Southern Xinjiang and Tibet, such as a positive anomaly stripe in the southwest, its neighboring Tashkurgan-Hotan-Cele-Minfeng-Qiemo-Ruoqiang belt, and the middle edge of the Kunlun Mountains. The stripe, in terms of rock composition, has a shallow magnetic field source and is related to magnetic intrusions; the lithospheric field in Tibet is weak. Additionally, when the heat flow distribution is compared to our results, there is a good consistency between a positive stripe of heat flow and a positive stripe of the lithospheric field in southern Tibet. The large heat flow values may be related to the shallow Curie surface, which shows that demagnetization is happening close to the surface. However, more of a ferromagnetic mineral, Titanium magnetite, is found there.

TI  - Review on Ultra-Long Distance Propagation of Femtosecond Laser Pulses for Remote Sensing Applications
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Review
AB  - Significance Intense femtosecond laser pulses propagate far beyond the diffraction limit in air, producing high-intensity filaments and low-density plasma along with the radiation of supercontinuum white light. The properties of filamentation have attracted significant attention owing to their potential applications in many areas, such as lighting control, remote sensing of atmospheric pollution, terahertz emission, and rainmaking. To achieve these goals, a filament with a long-distance transmission is required. However, the variety of complicated environments, for example, cloud, fog, aerosol, and rain, has strong influence on the propagation of filamentation. The atmospheric turbulence and inhomogeneous energy distribution of the initial beam profile result in the generation of multiple filaments, which can shorten the filament length, reduce the spot quality of the beam, and limit various applications of the laser filamentation. Therefore, the generation and control of long-distance filamentation are crucial. In this study, the research progress on the long-distance propagation of femtosecond laser pulses for space-based remote sensing applications is summarized, including the basic research methods of filament propagation, producing long-distance filaments, and modulation of filament characteristics. Furthermore, the advantages of femtosecond laser filaments in atmospheric remote sensing applications and the fundamental science problems to be solved are summarized.Progress The propagation of laser filament in air relies on a dynamic balance between Kerr self-focusing, which causes laser intensity to be clamped at a level of 10(13)-10(14) W/cm(2), and plasma defocusing due to laser-induced ionization, with typical peak electron densities limited to 10(16)-10(17) W/cm(-3). The high intensity filament persists over many diffractions in this process, providing a great opportunity for various applications, particularly remote sensing. Currently, numerous methods have been developed to manipulate the filamentation. The filament lengths can be extended by simply increasing the input power. While the incident pulse exceeding the critical power by an order of magnitude will quickly lead to multifilamentation, which is unstable both in space and time, incorporating certain external conditions can optimize the characteristics of the optical filament. Using a phase plate, spatial light modulator, and axicon (Fig. 1) to reshape the phase of the laser beam, the formation of multiple filaments can be effectively suppressed, and the filament length can be extended. In addition, the onset and length of the filament and the intensity of the laser and plasma density can also be controlled by numerous other methods, such as using optical systems of certain lens combinations (Figs. 2 and 4), introducing an initial pulse chirp, changing the wavefront phase of the Gaussian beam to obtain the Bessel beam (Fig. 7), phase-nested beam (Fig. 8), and annular beam (Fig. 9), externally refuelling the energy of the filaments (Figs. 10 and 11), and adopting a technique with two-or multiple-pulse (Figs. 12 and 13). The studies conducted on the methods of long-distance propagation of filamentation provide a great opportunity for remote sensing applications.Since Braun et al. observed the self-guided propagation of intense femtosecond laser pulses in air, the generation of long-distance filaments has attracted much attention. Subsequently, an optical filament was transmitted over more than 50 m in the Laboratoire d'Optique Appliquee, and then La Fontaine et al. obtained a propagation distance of several hundred meters. In 2004, Mechain et al. showcased horizontal filamentation over a distance greater than 2 km. Then, the Teramobile group observed a filamentation that was generated by the vertical propagation of high-power femtosecond pulses and emitted in a supercontinuum from the ultraviolet to the infrared regions, which was detected from an altitude of more than 20 km (Fig. 14). Furthermore, the linear absorption spectra of some molecules, such as water (humidity) and ozone, were measured by filament-based LIDARs in an atmospheric environment from several km to tens of km. Moreover, the proof-of-concept of spaceborne laser filamentation for atmospheric remote sensing was presented by the European Space Agency (ESA) group. They numerically simulated the remote generation of filaments from an Earth-orbiting satellite, as well as a white light continuum extending from 350 nm to 1.1 mu m (Fig. 15). Spaceborne laser filamentation might offer promising applications for atmospheric science and chemistry studies. Recently, the characteristics of the filaments generated by propagating a femtosecond Gaussian beam in a 2 m long gas cell with continuously varying pressures at different focal distances have been numerically investigated. It was demonstrated that maintaining a large pressure (1 atm) and changing to a larger pressure (such as 0.3-1.0 atm) benefit filament propagation and spectral broadening (Fig. 16). Although a large refractive index gradient was present in our calculation, we predict that the similar impact induced by the pressure variations is also applicable to propagating a femtosecond laser pulse over a real atmosphere. In addition, we also numerically simulated the propagation of a femtosecond laser pulse from a 400-km altitude towards the ground (Fig. 17). It is crucial to improve the simulation precision and perfect the theoretical model in the future.Conclusions and Prospects Based on remote sensing applications, we review the major advances in the long-distance transmission of laser filament, including the basic research methods, the generation and modulation of the long-distance filaments, and the transmission of a femtosecond laser pulse over an ultra-long-distance. After more than 20 years of continuous exploration, research on femtosecond laser filament has made great progress in both theoretical mechanism and practical application. However, numerous scientific problems remain to be explored regarding the ultra-long distance transmission of filaments, such as the intensity of the filament and peak plasma density not being high enough, developing a laser technique with high power for complicated atmospheric conditions, and establishing a complete theoretical model for the atmospheric environment. Although laser filamentation and remote supercontinuum generation from orbital altitudes are in the theoretical proof-of-concept stage, an earth-orbiting white-light LIDAR might become a new remote sensing tool for atmospheric research.

TI  - Landscape Implications of Contemporary Abandonment of Extensive Sheep Grazing in a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In Southern Europe, the abandonment of the traditional transhumant system where sheep graze lowland areas during winter and distant mountain systems during summer has led to an important cultural loss and still poorly understood ecological consequences. We investigate the landscape-scale implications of contemporary sheep grazing patterns in a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS). Our analysis showed a heterogeneous use of mountain grazing areas between 1990 and 2020. The areas most used by sheep had more abundance of pasture, fewer forests, and structurally different landscapes than those that had been fully abandoned by sheep. Likewise, we have detected decreasing trends in landscape diversity in those areas not used by sheep over the study period, whereas landscape heterogeneity is maintained in those areas grazed by sheep. Our study constitutes an original analysis of landscape patterns and shifts in relation to extensive sheep grazing by using novel approaches that combine interviews, updated satellite time series, and state-of-the-art landscape analysis techniques. Likewise, our results constitute a benchmark as they inform on the importance of preserving extensive sheep grazing if we aim to maintain the cultural heritage, and traditional diverse landscape and the semi-natural grasslands in the Mountains of Leon.

TI  - Estimation of Multi-Frequency, Multi-Incidence and Multi-Polarization Backscattering Coefficients over Bare Agricultural Soil Using Statistical Algorithms
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, many SAR missions have been launched to reinforce the all-weather observation capacity of the Earth. The precise modeling of radar signals becomes crucial in order to translate them into essential biophysical parameters for the management of natural resources (water, biomass and energy). The objective of this study was to demonstrate the capabilities of two statistical algorithms (i.e., multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF)) to accurately simulate the backscattering coefficients observed over bare agricultural soil surfaces. This study was based on satellite and ground data collected on bare soil surfaces over an agricultural region located in southwestern France near Toulouse. Multi-configuration backscattering coefficients were acquired by TerraSAR-X and Radarsat-2 in the X- and C-bands, in co-(abbreviated sigma(0)(HH) and sigma(0)(VV)) and cross-polarization states (abbreviated sigma(0)(HV) and sigma(0)(VH)) and at incidence angles ranging from 24 degrees to 53 degrees. Models were independently calibrated and validated using a ground dataset covering a wide range of soil conditions, including the topsoil moisture (range: 2.4-35.3%), root-mean-square height (range: 0.5-7.9cm) and clay fraction (range: 9-58%). Higher-magnitude correlations (r) and lower errors (RMSE) were obtained when using RF (r values ranging from 0.69 to 0.86 and RMSE from 1.95 to 1.00 dB, depending on the considered signal configuration) compared to MLR (r values ranging from 0.58 to 0.77 and RMSE from 2.22 to 1.24 dB). Both surpass the performance presented in previous studies based on either empirical, semi-empirical or physical models. In the linear approach, the information is mainly provided by the surface moisture and the angle of incidence (especially in the case of co-polarized signals, regardless of the frequency), while the influence of roughness or texture becomes significant for cross-polarized signals in the C-band. On the contrary, all the surface descriptors contribute in the approach based on RF. In future work, the use of the RF algorithm developed in this paper should improve the estimation of soil parameters.

TI  - Ground-Based Oblique-View Photogrammetry and Sentinel-1 Spaceborne RADAR Reflectivity Snow Melt Processes Assessment on an Arctic Glacier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The snowpack evolution during the melt season on an Arctic glacier is assessed using ground-based oblique-view cameras, spaceborne imaging and spaceborne RADAR. The repeated and systematic Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) imaging by the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 spaceborne RADARs allows for all-weather, all-illumination condition monitoring of the snow-covered fraction of the glacier and hence assessing its water production potential. A comparison of the RADAR reflectivity with optical and multispectral imaging highlights the difference between the observed quantities-water content in the former, albedo in the latter-and the complementarity for understanding the snow melt processes. This work highlights the temporal inertia between the visible spring melting of the snowpack and the snow metamorphism. It was found that the snowpack exhibits that approximately 30 days before it starts to fade.

TI  - Variability of the Primary Productivity in the Yellow and Bohai Seas from 2003 to 2020 Based on the Estimate of Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring marine primary productivity (PP) is crucial for understanding changes in the marine ecosystem. Based on satellite data and the vertically generalized production model (VGPM), this study investigated the spatiotemporal distribution and long-term trend of PP in the Yellow and Bohai Seas (YBSs) from 2003 to 2020. By using the calibrated satellite data and optimized parameterization scheme, the accuracy of the PP results in the YBSs was significantly improved compared to online PP products. The annual mean PP in the YBSs from 2003 to 2020 was 523.8 mgC/(m(2).d), with significant seasonal and interannual differences. Seasonally, PP in the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea exhibited bimodal (two peaks in May and October) and unimodal (one peak in June) variation, respectively. The magnitude of mean PP in the YBSs was ranked as spring > summer > autumn > winter, with spring PP (similar to 1000 mgC/(m(2).d)) contributing more than 40% of the annual PP. The annual mean PP in the YBSs showed an overall decrease from 2003 to 2020, with a decrease rate of 5-6 mgC/(m(2).d)/y. The interannual variation of the PP was mainly related to the variability of the chlorophyll-a concentration and was essentially inverse to the phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.

TI  - Satellite, UAV, and Geophysical Data to Identify Surface and Subsurface Hydrodynamics of Geographically Isolated Wetlands: Understanding an Undervalued Ecosystem at the Atlantic Forest-Cerrado Interface of Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In two small and isolated wetlands located at the interface of the Atlantic Forest and Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, we employed a pixel-based supervised classification approach using a combination of panchromatic and multispectral bands obtained from Landsat 2, 5, 7, and CBERS-04A satellites (ranging from 80 to 2 m/pixel). In addition, we acquired DJI Phantom 4 Pro UAV-RGB images in twelve different periods with a resolution of +5 cm/pixel. Furthermore, we utilized 2D and 3D Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to obtain data on the surroundings and center of the wetlands. Finally, we conducted a climatological data analysis. The results from the multisource data allowed us to classify the ecosystems as geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs), for which we documented a seasonal month-to-month (12 months) spatial variation of inundated area, vegetation pattern, soil water interaction, and a point of surface and deep-subsurface water interaction. These results are essential for high-accuracy characterization of small wetlands' hydrodynamics and hydroperiods at the local scale. Our study contributes to optimizing GIWs understanding, monitoring, and reapplication of the methodology in other wetlands or small ecosystems.

TI  - Gulls as potential sentinels for urban litter: combining nest and GPS-tracking information
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of urban waste has increased in the past decades leading to its mishandling. The effects on public health, economy, and wildlife that waste mismanagement can have are forcing governments to increase their efforts in detecting and mitigating the presence of waste. Identifying and monitoring sentinel species to assess the presence of urban litter could be a cost-effective option. Thus, analyzing the nest composition of yellow-legged gulls from an urban population inhabiting a very high populated city (Barcelona, Spain), and combining this information with accurate GPS tracking data, provides a potential tool to monitor the presence of marine and terrestrial litter over time. The results revealed the highest presence of debris in the nests of a seabird ever recorded. All the nests examined contained anthropogenic waste, with plastic items present in all of them. Crossing the nest composition with GPS tracking movements confirmed that the waste to build the nests was collected in the urban area and not in other environments surrounding the city. Then, the nest waste composition may be a good indicator of waste mismanagement and advise the municipalities to improve waste management and recycling strategies for the different types of litter. Using gulls breeding in cities as sentinel species and, in particular, the study of their nest composition, may provide essential data to decision-making stakeholders to adopt a One Health approach and help improve not only the environment's health but also the health of those who live in it.

TI  - Assessing the impact of land use and land cover on river water quality using water quality index and remote sensing techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of land use on water quality is becoming a global concern due to the increasing demand for freshwater. This study aimed to assess the effects of land use and land cover (LULC) on the surface water quality of the Buriganga, Dhaleshwari, Meghna, and Padma river system in Bangladesh. To determine the state of water, water samples were collected from twelve locations in the Buriganga, Dhaleshwari, Meghna, and Padma rivers during the winter season of 2015 and collected samples were analysed for seven water quality indicators: pH, temperature (Temp.), conductivity (Cond.), dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) for assessing water quality (WQ). Additionally, same-period satellite imagery (Landsat-8) was utilised to classify the LULC using the object-based image analysis (OBIA) technique. The overall accuracy assessment and kappa co-efficient value of post-classified images were 92% and 0.89, respectively. In this research, the root mean squared water quality index (RMS-WQI) model was used to determine the WQ status, and satellite imagery was utilised to classify LULC types. Most of the WQs were found within the ECR guideline level for surface water. The RMS-WQI result showed that the "fair" status of water quality found in all sampling sites ranges from 66.50 to 79.08, and the water quality is satisfactory. Four types of LULC were categorised in the study area mainly comprised of agricultural land (37.33%), followed by built-up area (24.76%), vegetation (9.5%), and water bodies (28.41%). Finally, the Principal component analysis (PCA) techniques were used to find out significant WQ indicators and the correlation matrix revealed that WQ had a substantial positive correlation with agricultural land (r = 0.68, P < 0.01) and a significant negative association with the built-up area (r = - 0.94, P < 0.01). To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt in Bangladesh to assess the impact of LULC on the water quality along the longitudinal gradient of a vast river system. Hence, we believe that the findings of this study can support planners and environmentalists to plan and design landscapes and protect the river environment.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Changes of Mangrove-Covered Tidal Flats over 35 Years Using Satellite Remote Sensing Imageries: A Case Study of Beibu Gulf, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats provide ecosystem services to billions of people worldwide; however, their changing status is largely unknown. Several challenges in the fine extraction of tidal flats using remote sensing techniques, including tide-level and water-edge line changes, exist at present, especially regarding the spatial and temporal distribution of mangroves. This study proposed a tidal flats extraction method using a combination of threshold segmentation and tidal-level correction, considering the influence of mangrove changes. We extracted the spatial distribution of tidal flats in Beibu Gulf, Southwest China, from 1987 to 2021 using time-series Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, and further analyzed the dynamic variation characteristics of the total tidal flats, each coastal segment, and the range of erosion and silting. To quantitatively investigate the interaction between tidal flats and mangroves, this study established a regression model based on multi-temporal tidal flats and mangrove data. The results indicated that the overall accuracy of the tidal flat extraction results was 93.9%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.82. The total area of tidal flats in Beibu Gulf decreased by 130 km(2) from 1987 to 2021, with an average annual change of -3.7 km(2)/a. In addition, a negative correlation between the tidal flat change area and mangrove change area in Shankou, Maowei Sea, and Pearl Bay was observed, with correlation coefficients of -0.28, -0.30 and -0.64, respectively. These results demonstrate that the distribution of tidal flats provides a good environment and expansion space for the rapid growth of mangroves. These results can provide references for tidal flats' resource conservation, ecological health assessment, and vegetation changes in coastal wetlands in China and other countries in Southeast Asia.

TI  - Comparing eight remotely sensed sea surface temperature products and Bayesian maximum entropy-based data fusion products
T2  - SPATIAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature is an important oceanographic physical attribute. In this work, 5 kinds of infrared SST data sets (in-cluding FY3C-VIRR, MetopB-AVHRR3, MODIS-Aqua, MODIS-Terra, SNPP-VIIRS) and 3 kinds of microwave SST data sets (including AMSR-2, GMI, WindSat) were considered for fusion purposes. The area with geographical coordinates ranging from 100 degrees W to 180 degrees W and from 10 degrees N to 10 degrees S was chosen as the study area. Using the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) method, four SST fusion products were generated from January 1 to January 31, 2020, with temporal resolution of 1 day, spatial resolution of 0.25 decimal degrees, and coverage rate of 100%. The Holdout cross -validation method was employed to evaluate the performance of BME for SST interpolation purposes by using two data sets, i.e., WinSat SST and MODIS-Terra SST data; and the valida-tion results showed that the mean absolute error (MAE) values of the WindSat SST data and the MODIS-Terra SST data were 0.117 mg/m3 and 0.191 mg/m3, respectively, and the root mean square error (RMSE) values were 0.158 mg/m3 and 0.321 mg/m3, respectively. In addition, four SST interpolation products were compared with the Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temper-ature (OISST) and the Group for High-Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) products by combining Argo data with Buoy data treated as in-situ measured data sets. Three (MW-WindSat SST product, ALL-Terra SST product and ALL-WindSat SST product) of the four interpolation products performed better than the OISST and GHRSST data sets. Among them, the ALL-WindSat SST product considering WindSat SST data and other 7 SST data as hard and soft data exhibited the best performance in terms of all three indicators: the coefficient of determination value (0.744), the MAE value (0.82 mg/m3) and the RMSE value (1.082 mg/m3). In sum, the present work made full use of the inclusiveness and integration abilities of the BME method for various types of data, and demonstrated its high accuracy in a number of real world data, thus demonstrating its considerable potential in the context of marine data interpolation and fusion.

TI  - LiDAR-Derived Relief Typology of Loess Patches (East Poland)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of the automated analysis of remote sensing data processed into high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) using geographic information systems (GIS) tools provides a geomorphometric characterization of the diversity of the relief of loess patches over large areas. Herein, a quantitative classification of 79 loess patches with a total area of 3361 km(2), distributed within the eastern part of the Polish Uplands belt, is carried out. A high-resolution 1 x 1 m DTM was generated from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with densities ranging from 4 pts/m(2) to 12 pts/m(2), which was resampled to a resolution of 5 x 5 m for the study. This model was used to classify landform surfaces using the r.geomorphon (geomorphon algorithm) function in GRASS GIS software. By comparing the values in the neighborhood of each cell, a map of geomorphometric features (geomorphon) was obtained. The classification and typology of the relief of the studied loess patches was performed using GeoPAT2 (Geospatial Pattern Analysis Toolbox) software. Pattern signatures with a resolution of 100 x 100 m were extracted from the source data grid, and the similarity of geomorphological maps within the signatures was calculated and saved as a signature file and segment map using the spatial coincidence method. The distance matrix between each pair of segments was calculated, and the heterogeneity and isolation of the maps were generated. R system was used to classify the segments, which generated a dendrogram and a heat map based on the distance matrix. This made it possible to distinguish three main types and eight subtypes of relief. The morphometric approach used will contribute to a better understanding of the spatial variation in the relief of loess patches.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing Techniques and Meteorological Data to Assess the Ideal Irrigation System Performance Scenarios for Improving Crop Productivity
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - To increase agricultural productivity and ensure food security, it is important to understand the reasons for variations in irrigation over time. However, researchers often avoid investigating water productivity due to data availability challenges. This study aimed to assess the performance of the irrigation system for winter wheat crops using a high-resolution satellite, Sentinel 2 A/B, combined with meteorological data and Google Earth Engine (GEE)-based remote sensing techniques. The study area is located north of Erbil city in the Kurdistan region of Iraq (KRI) and consists of 143 farmer-owned center pivots. This study also aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of key variables (Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Precipitation (mm), Evapotranspiration (ETo), Crop evapotranspiration (ETc), and Irrigation (Hours), during the wheat-growing winter season in the drought year 2021 to understand the reasons for the variance in field performance. The finding revealed that water usage fluctuated significantly across the seasons, while yield gradually increased from the 2021 winter season. In addition, the study revealed a notable correlation between soil moisture based on the (NDMI) and vegetation cover based on the (NDVI), and the increase in yield productivity and reduction in the yield gap, specifically during the middle of the growing season (March and April). Integrating remote sensing with meteorological data in supplementary irrigation systems can improve agriculture and water resource management by boosting yields, improving crop quality, decreasing water consumption, and minimizing environmental impacts. This innovative technique can potentially enhance food security and promote environmental sustainability.

M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover change and climate change have diverse impacts on the water resources of river basins. This study investigated the trends of climate change and land use/land cover change in the Nile River Basin. The climate trends were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimator test and an innovative trend analysis method. Land use/land cover (LULC) change was examined using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) with a resolution of 30 m during 2012-2022. The findings revealed that forestland and shrub land area decreased by 5.18 and 2.39%, respectively. On the other hand, area of grassland, cropland, settlements and water bodies increased by 1.56, 6.18, 0.05 and 0.11%, respectively. A significant increasing trend in precipitation was observed at the Gondar (Z = 1.69) and Motta (Z = 0.93) stations. However, the trend was decreasing at the Adet (Z = -0.32), Dangla (Z = -0.37) and Bahir Dar stations. The trend in temperature increased at all stations. The significant changes in land use/land cover may be caused by human-induced activities in the basin.

TI  - Comparing the Capability of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 9 Imagery for Mapping Water and Sandbars in the River Bed of the Lower Tagus River (Portugal)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping river beds to identify water and sandbars is a crucial task for understanding the morphology and hydrodynamics of rivers and their ecological conditions. The main difficulties of this task so far have been the limitations of conventional approaches, which are generally costly (e.g., equipment, time- and human resource-demanding) and have poor flexibility to deal with all river conditions. Currently, alternative approaches rely on remote sensing techniques, which offer innovative tools for mapping water bodies in a quick and cost-effective manner based on relevant spectral indices. This study aimed to compare the capability of using imagery from the Sentinel-2 and newly launched Landsat 9 satellite to achieve this goal. For a segment of the Lower Tagus River (Portugal) with conditions of very low river discharge, comparison of the Normalized Difference Water Index, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, Augmented Normalized Difference Water Index, and Automated Water Extraction Index calculated from the imagery of the two satellites shows that the two satellites' datasets and mapping were consistent and therefore could be used complementarily. However, the results highlighted the need to classify satellite imagery based on index-specific classification decision values, which is an important factor in the quality of the information extracted.

TI  - Impact of urban and peri-urban growth on arable land (1976-2029) in a medium sized city of Shire Indaselassie, North Western Tigray, Ethiopia
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban and peri-urban areas have been growing rapidly globally due to population increase and other factors. However, poor urban land use planning caused remarkable impacts on the loss of potentially arable land. This study aimed to analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of urban and peri-urban expansion and its impact on arable land in the Shire Indaselassie city, North Western Tigray. Multi-temporal and spectral Landsat images were used as an input and processed using TerrSet, ERDAS imagine 2015, and ArcGIS 10.8.1 softwares. The Cellular Automata-Markov Chain model was used to predict the future urban and peri-urban areas. Pearson correlation coefficient was applied to examine the association among the population, urban, peri-urban growth, and its impact on arable land in Stata/SE v14. The findings revealed that urban and peri-urban lands increased by 7.5 km(2) (22.1%) and 1.0 km(2) (2.9%), while arable land decreased by - 0.1 km(2) (- 0.2%) from 1976 to 2019. It is also predicted to increase by 1.0 km(2) (2.80%) and 0.9 km(2) (2.70%) until 2029, while arable land is anticipated to shrink by - 1.0 km(2) (- 3.0%). The relationship among population growth, urban, and peri-urban land shows positive (r = 0.942, p = 0.058; r = 0.985, p = 0.016). However, arable land has been negatively correlated with population growth, urban, and peri-urban lands (r = - 0.610, p = 0.392). The result of this research is indispensable for urban planners and decision makers to optimize urban and peri-urban expansion related information without jeopardizing the size of arable lands.

TI  - A Technology for Seismogenic Process Monitoring and Systematic Earthquake Forecasting
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquakes are a severe natural phenomenon that require continuous monitoring, analysis, and forecasting to mitigate their risks. Seismological data have long been used for this purpose, but geodynamic data from remote sensing of surface displacements have become available in recent decades. In this paper, we present a novel information technology for monitoring, analyzing seismogenic fields, and predicting earthquakes using Earth remote sensing data presented as a time series of surface displacement points for systematic regional earthquake prediction. We demonstrate, for the first time, the successful application of this technology and discuss the method of the minimum area of alarm, which was developed for machine learning and systematic earthquake prediction, as well as the architecture and tools of the GIS platform. Our technology is implemented as a network platform consisting of two GISs. The first GIS automatically loads earthquake catalog data and GPS time series, calculates spatiotemporal fields, performs systematic earthquake prediction in multiple seismically active regions, and provides intuitive mapping tools to analyze seismic processes. The second GIS is designed for scientific research of spatiotemporal processes, including those related to earthquake forecasting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of platform analysis tools that are intuitive and accessible to a wide range of users in solving problems of systematic earthquake prediction. Additionally, we provide examples of scientific research on earthquake prediction using the second GIS, including the effectiveness of using GPS data for forecasting earthquakes in California, estimating the density fields of earthquake epicenters using the adaptive weighted smoothing (AWS) method for predicting earthquakes in Kamchatka, and studying earthquake forecasts in the island part of the territory of Japan using the earthquake catalog and GPS. Our examples demonstrate that the method of the minimum area of alarm used for machine learning is effective for forecasting both catalog and remote sensing data.

TI  - Crop Phenology Modelling Using Proximal and Satellite Sensor Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding crop phenology is crucial for predicting crop yields and identifying potential risks to food security. The objective was to investigate the effectiveness of satellite sensor data, compared to field observations and proximal sensing, in detecting crop phenological stages. Time series data from 122 winter wheat, 99 silage maize, and 77 late potato fields were analyzed during 2015-2017. The spectral signals derived from Digital Hemispherical Photographs (DHP), Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC), and Sentinel-2 (S2) were crop-specific and sensor-independent. Models fitted to sensor-derived fAPAR (fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) demonstrated a higher goodness of fit as compared to fCover (fraction of vegetation cover), with the best model fits obtained for maize, followed by wheat and potato. S2-derived fAPAR showed decreasing variability as the growing season progressed. The use of a double sigmoid model fit allowed defining inflection points corresponding to stem elongation (upward sigmoid) and senescence (downward sigmoid), while the upward endpoint corresponded to canopy closure and the maximum values to flowering and fruit development. Furthermore, increasing the frequency of sensor revisits is beneficial for detecting short-duration crop phenological stages. The results have implications for data assimilation to improve crop yield forecasting and agri-environmental modeling.

TI  - Carcinoma vulva: Ten years experience in a teaching institution of North India
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND PRIMARY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Vulvar carcinoma is primarily a disease of post-menopausal women. Surgery is a primary treatment strategy. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are a part of multimodal therapy. Presently, there is a shift towards neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy so as to decrease the surgical morbidities. Objective: To study the surgical outcome and prognostic factors in Ca vulva patients. Methodology: A retrospective analysis of 19 vulvar cancer patients, surgically treated at a teaching institution of Punjab (2009-2019). Results: Mean age of the patients was 60.95 years. Ulcerative swelling (89.5%) over labia majora (73.7%) was the main presenting symptom. Radical vulvectomy-bilateral IFLN dissection was performed in 74% patients, hemivulvectomy-unilateral IFLN dissection in 21% patients and wide local excision in one patient. Squamous cell carcinoma was detected in all, and one had verrucous carcinoma. Thirty-seven per cent patients had FIGO stage III disease, 31.5% - stage II and 31.5% - stage I. On HPE, 78.57% (11/14) patients had positive nodes and two had ECS. Only 5/9 (55.5%) cases could receive PORT. Seven patients defaulted follow-up. Two developed nodal metastasis, and seven women developed recurrence. One patient with regional recurrence faced demise during RT course. In 10/19 regular follow-up patients, four are alive and disease free, five patients are on palliative chemoradiation, and one is undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy for regional recurrence. Estimated 5-year overall survival is 83.33%. Conclusion: Tumour stage, nodal positivity and nodal ECS were poor prognostic factors. Radical surgery-extensive groin node dissection causes significant morbidity; hence, studies evaluating the role of neoadjuvant treatment are needed so as to modify current treatment practices. HPV vaccination as a preventive measure and a thorough and extensive evaluation of patients with suspicious signs in vulvar disease is needed.

TI  - Characteristics and processes of registered nurses' clinical reasoning and factors relating to the use of clinical reasoning in practice: a scoping review
T2  - JBI EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: The objective of this review was to examine the characteristics and processes of clinical reasoning used by registered nurses in clinical practice, and to identify factors reported to relate to the use of clinical reasoning by registered nurses in clinical practice.Introduction: Significant variability in the clinical reasoning of graduate registered nurses has been identified in research, with underdeveloped and unsafe clinical reasoning being linked to failure-to-rescue and sentinel events in the clinical setting. The identification of characteristics and processes of clinical reasoning, and factors relating to registered nurses' clinical reasoning when engaged in clinical practice, will increase understanding of the clinical reasoning requirements for undergraduate registered nurses and of potential factors that may affect their clinical reasoning.Inclusion criteria: Studies including registered nurses who met the criteria for registered nurse registration in Australia and who used clinical reasoning to engage with health care consumers in all practice environments were eligible for inclusion.Methods: Eight databases were searched, with articles identified through CINAHL, MedNar, PubMed, Science Direct, ERIC, PsycINFO, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Database searches were conducted on December 31, 2020, and updated August 20, 2021, with primary qualitative and quantitative research studies in English from 2000 onwards considered for inclusion. Opinion papers, text, and reports were not included. Data were extracted based on the draft charting tool from the scoping review protocol, with results presented in tabular format and in a narrative summary.Results: The 29 qualitative and 5 quantitative research studies included in the scoping review utilized exploratory descriptive, descriptive rationalist, narrative, ethnography, correlational, observational, and grounded theory methodologies in their research designs. Observation, think-aloud sessions, questionnaires, surveys, interviews, and focus groups were used to collect data from the 1099 participants in 9 countries. Multiple concepts related to the characteristics (n = 35) and processes (n = 30) of clinical reasoning were detected in the research studies, with 5 categories identified: i) situation management, ii) data management, iii) interpreting, iv) implementing and evaluating, and v) professional practice, with an additional processes category identified (decision-making processes). The factors (n = 26) reported to relate to clinical reasoning were categorized into environment of care, care requirements, professional practice, experience, knowledge, and decision-making processes. Connections between the various concepts were evident throughout the review.Conclusions: The scoping review identified characteristics and processes of clinical reasoning, as well as factors reported to relate to clinical reasoning in all studies. The concepts that comprise the clinical reasoning of registered nurses in clinical practice must be considered in undergraduate registered nurse education. Registered nurses must complete their baccalaureate program with well-developed clinical reasoning to ensure safe clinical practice. Understanding the characteristics and processes of registered nurses' clinical reasoning in clinical practice, and the factors reported to relate to clinical reasoning, supports the creation of targeted resources for development and assessment of clinical reasoning.

TI  - Extended Cross-Calibration Analysis Using Data from the Landsat 8 and 9 Underfly Event
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat 8 and 9 Underfly Event occurred in November 2021, during which Landsat 9 flew beneath Landsat 8 in the final stages before settling in its final orbiting path. An analysis was performed on the images taken during this event, which resulted in a cross-calibration with uncertainties estimated to be less than 0.5%. This level of precision was due, in part, to the near-identical sensors aboard each instrument, as well as the underfly event itself, which allowed the sensors to take nearly the exact same image at nearly the exact same time. This initial calibration was applied before the end of the on-orbit initial verification (OIV) period; this meant the analysis was performed in less than a month. While it was an effective and efficient first look at the data, a longer-term analysis was deemed prudent to obtain the most accurate cross-calibration with the smallest uncertainties. The three forms of uncertainty established in the initial analysis, dubbed "Phase 1", were geometric, spectral, and angular. This paper covers Phase 2 of the underfly analysis; several modifications were made to the Phase 1 process to improve the cross-calibration results, including a spectral correction in the form of a spectral band adjustment factor (SBAF) and a more robust filtering system that used the statistics of the reflectance data to better include important data compared to the more aggressive filters used in Phase 1. A proper uncertainty analysis was performed to more accurately quantify the uncertainty associated with the underfly cross-calibration. The results of Phase 2 showed that the Phase 1 analysis was within its 0.5% uncertainty estimation, and the cross-calibration gain values in this paper were used by USGS EROS to update the Landsat 9 calibration at the end of 2022.

TI  - Development Process, Quantitative Models, and Future Directions in Driving Analysis of Urban Expansion
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Driving analysis of urban expansion (DAUE) is usually implemented to identify the driving factors and their corresponding driving effects/mechanisms for the expansion processes of urban land, aiming to provide scientific guidance for urban planning and management. Based on a thorough analysis and summarization of the development process and quantitative models, four major limitations in existing DAUE studies have been uncovered: (1) the interactions in hierarchical urban systems have not been fully explored; (2) the employed data cannot fully depict urban dynamic through finer social perspectives; (3) the employed models cannot deal with high-level feature correlations; and (4) the simulation and analysis models are still not intrinsically integrated. Four future directions are thus proposed: (1) to pay attention to the hierarchical characteristics of urban systems and conduct multi-scale research on the complex interactions within them to capture dynamic features; (2) to leverage remote sensing data so as to obtain diverse urban expansion data and assimilate multi-source spatiotemporal big data to supplement novel socio-economic driving factors; (3) to integrate with interpretable data-driven machine learning techniques to bolster the performance and reliability of DAUE models; and (4) to construct mechanism-coupled urban simulation to achieve a complementary enhancement and facilitate theory development and testing for urban land systems.

TI  - Constructing a Comprehensive National Wildfire Database from Incomplete Sources: Israel as a Case Study
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In many regions, the frequency and extent of wildfires has increased in recent years, a trend which is expected to continue. Hence, there is a need for effective fire management strategies. Such strategies need to be based on accurate and complete data on vegetation condition and post-fire effects, collected in the field as well as by remote sensing approaches. Unfortunately, wildfire databases are often incomplete in terms of their spatial and temporal coverage, as well as the documentation of fire outcomes. The aim of this study was to devise a methodology to construct a comprehensive national wildfire database. We developed and tested this methodology for Israel, as a case study. The methodology combines data on wildfires in Israel from two sources: remote sensing and field data collected by governmental agencies, representing the period between 2015 and 2022. The resulting database contains 2276 wildfires larger than 10 ha with information (where and when available) on their occurrence date, fire duration, ignition cause, and more. The methodology presented here provides a blueprint for developing large-scale and comprehensive fire databases elsewhere, and facilitates future studies on wildfire risk by providing a robust, unified database of the fire history of Israel from 2015 onwards.

TI  - Evaluation of Hybrid Models for Maize Chlorophyll Retrieval Using Medium- and High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of the leaf or canopy chlorophyll content is crucial for monitoring crop growth conditions. Remote sensing monitoring of crop chlorophyll is a non-destructive, large-area, and real-time method that requires reliable retrieval models and satellite data. High-resolution satellite imagery generally has better object recognition capabilities. However, the influence of the spectral and spatial resolution of medium- and high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery on chlorophyll retrieval is currently unexplored, especially in conjunction with radiative transfer models (RTMs). This has important implications for the accurate quantification of crop chlorophyll over large areas. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to establish an RTM for the retrieval of maize chlorophyll and to compare the chlorophyll retrieval capability of the model using medium- and high-spatial-resolution satellite images. We constructed a hybrid model consisting of the PROSAIL model and the Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithm to retrieve maize leaf and canopy chlorophyll contents (LCC and CCC). In addition, an active learning (AL) strategy was incorporated into the hybrid model to enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency. Sentinel-2 imagery with a spatial resolution of 10 m and 3 m-resolution Planet imagery were utilized for the LCC and CCC retrieval, respectively, using the hybrid model. The accuracy of the model was verified using field-measured maize chlorophyll data obtained in Dajianchang Town, Wuqing District, Tianjin City, in 2018. The results showed that the AL strategy increased the accuracy of the chlorophyll retrieval. The hybrid model for LCC retrieval with 10-band Sentinel-2 without AL had an R-2 of 0.567 and an RMSE of 5.598, and the model with AL had an R-2 of 0.743 and an RMSE of 3.964. Incorporating the AL strategy improved the model performance (R-2 = 0.743 and RMSE = 3.964). The Planet imagery provided better results for chlorophyll retrieval than 4-band Sentinel-2 imagery but worse performance than 10-band Sentinel-2 imagery. Additionally, we tested the model using maize chlorophyll data obtained from Youyi Farm in Heilongjiang Province in 2021 to evaluate the model's robustness and scalability. The test results showed that the hybrid model used with 10-band Sentinel-2 images achieved good accuracy in the Youyi Farm area (LCC: R-2 = 0.792, RMSE = 2.8; CCC: R-2 = 0.726, RMSE = 0.152). The optimal hybrid model was applied to images from distinct periods to map the spatiotemporal distribution of the chlorophyll content. The uncertainties in the chlorophyll content retrieval results from different periods were relatively low, demonstrating that the model had good temporal scalability. Our research results can provide support for the precise management of maize growth.

TI  - WISE J141530.7+592234: A Very Low Mass Ratio Contact Binary with Significant Light Curve Variations
T2  - PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-band photometric observations and period investigations of the total eclipsing binary WISE J141530.7+592234 (hereinafter J141530), whose mass ratio close to the low mass ratio limit, were carried out for the first time. The stellar atmospheric parameters of the primary component were calculated by the spectral fitting, yielding the following results: T (eff) = 5890 +/- 22 K, [Fe/H] = 0.01 +/- 0.03 dex, log g = 4.53 +/- 0.04 cm s(-2). Our observations show that the light curve of V-band on May 2 is about 0.1 mag brighter than that observed in February and March at phase 0.6. Comparing with the small amplitude (about 0.2 mag), the variations are remarkable. Meanwhile, obvious light curve variations and quick reversal of O'Connell effects are found in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, which is likely caused by magnetic activity. Photometric solutions derived from multi-band light curves indicate that J141530 has a high contact degree (f similar to 70%) and a very low mass ratio (q similar to 0.0546). Based on the O - C diagram, a long-term period increase was found. The period increase rate is calculated to be dP/dt = 3.90 x 10(-7) day yr(-1), which can be explained by mass transfer from the low mass component to the large mass component. By analyzing the merging criterion, such as the ratio of spin angular momentum (J (spin)) to the orbital angular momentum (J (orb)), the instability separation and the instability mass ratio, J141530 can be regarded as a potential progenitor of luminous red novae.

TI  - Channel Imbalance Calibration Based on the Zero Helix of Bragg-like Targets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The calibration of channel imbalances is currently the main concern in polarimetric calibration (POLCAL) since the crosstalk of recent polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (Pol-SAR) systems is lower than -20 dB. The existing channel imbalance calibration method without corner reflectors utilizes both volume-dominated and Bragg-like targets. However, there are two limitations to using volume-dominated targets. One is that the inaccurate selection of volume-dominated areas in the uncalibrated Pol-SAR images has a negative influence on the estimation of cross-polarization (x-pol) channel imbalance, which subsequently impacts the estimation of copolarization (copol) channel imbalance. The other is that there are minimal volume-dominated areas in some special applications of Pol-SAR, such as planetary exploration. Thus, only selecting Bragg-like targets to estimate the values of both transmitting and receiving channel imbalances, which is proposed in this paper, can avoid the uncertainty brought about by selecting other distributed targets in an uncalibrated imaginary. In addition, the reciprocity assumption and characteristics corresponding to H/adecomposition are introduced to eliminate the phase ambiguity for the first time. Compared with previous methods, our method had an obvious advantage in terms of universality, since Bragg-like targets are common in the most illuminating areas. The novel method was applied to both the simulated data from the L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) and C-band GaoFen-3 (GF-3), and to real data with corner reflectors on site. The results from the simulated data showed that the errors of the amplitude and phase estimation were less than 0.5 dB and 5.0 degrees in most topographical features. Meanwhile, the vv /HH terms from all trihedral corner reflectors were less than 0.3 dB for amplitude, and 5.5 degrees for phase after calibration by using the estimated channel imbalances.

TI  - Vegetation Cover Variation in Dry Valleys of Southwest China: The Role of Precipitation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many ecological restoration projects have been carried out in Southwest China; however, changes in vegetation cover in the dry valleys of Southwest China have rarely been reported. With their unique characteristics of high temperatures and low humidity, these dry valleys have considerably lower vegetation cover than their neighboring areas, making them the main sediment sources of rivers in Southwest China. Thus, it is imperative to understand changes in vegetation cover in China's dry valleys, as well as the effects of changes in precipitation, since water deficit is the dominant cause of obstructed plant growth. In this study, changes in fractional vegetation cover (FVC) in dry valleys in the period 2000 to 2020 were analyzed based on MODIS-NDVI data, and the effects of precipitation were also analyzed. Our results indicated that: (1) the long-term mean annual FVC values in the dry-hot valleys (DHVs), dry-warm valleys (DWVs), and dry-temperate valleys (DTVs) were 0.426, 0.504, and 0.446, respectively; (2) significant decreasing trends in FVC were mainly found in DHVs and DWVs that were distributed in the southwestern part of the dry valley region (DVR), which was mainly due to the decrease in precipitation; and (3) significant increasing trends were reported in DTVs of the Min River and the Baishui River, which was probably due to the increase in precipitation. By analyzing the temporal trends of FVC in dry valleys, this study highlighted the effects of precipitation on the dynamics of FVC and demonstrated that anthropogenic activities such as urbanization, land use changes, and hydro-power project construction may also have considerable effects on FVC in dry valleys. Overall, this study not only provides insights that might inform further detailed studies on the dynamics and mechanisms of vegetation cover, but could also provide valuable guidance for ecological restoration management in the dry valley region.

TI  - Estimation of Root-Zone Soil Moisture in Semi-Arid Areas Based on Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a bridge between the atmosphere, vegetation and soil, and its dynamics reflect the energy exchange and transformation between the three. Among SM at different soil profiles, root zone soil moisture (RZSM) plays a significant role in vegetation growth. Therefore, reliable estimation of RZSM at the regional scale is of great importance for drought warning, agricultural yield estimation, forest fire monitoring, etc. Many satellite products provide surface soil moisture (SSM) at the thin top layer of the soil, approximately 2 cm from the surface. However, the acquisition of RZSM at the regional scale is still a tough issue to solve, especially in the semi-arid areas with a lack of in situ observations. Linking the dynamics of SSM and RZSM is promising to solve this issue. The soil moisture analytical relationship (SMAR) model can relate RZSM to SSM based on a simplified soil water balance equation, which is suitable for the simulation of soil moisture mechanisms in semi-arid areas. In this study, the Xiliaohe River Basin is the study area. The SMAR model at the pixels where in situ sites were located is established, and parameters (a, b, s(w2), s(c1)) at these pixels are calibrated by a genetic algorithm (GA). Then the spatial parameters are estimated by the random forest (RF) regression method with the soil, meteorological and vegetation characteristics of the study area as explanatory variables. In addition, the importance of soil, climatic and vegetation characteristics for predicting SMAR parameters is analyzed. Finally, the spatial RZSM in the Xiliaohe River Basin is estimated by the SMAR model at the regional scale with the predicted spatial parameters, and the variation of the regional SMAR model performance is discussed. A comparison of estimated RZSM and in-situ RZSM showed that the SMAR model at the point and regional scales can both meet the RMSE benchmark from NASA of 0.06 cm(3)center dot cm(-3), indicating that the method this study proposed could effectively estimate RZSM in semi-arid areas based on remotely sensed SSM data.

TI  - Assessing Livestock Grazing Distribution in Communal Rangelands of the Eastern Cape, South Africa: Towards Monitoring Livestock Movements in Rangelands
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past, rangelands were managed in a semi-nomadic manner, where pastoralists would distribute livestock to different parts of the rangeland depending on the availability of forage. However, understanding how livestock use rangelands has not been a subject of many studies as the devices to monitor livestock were not available. The objective of this study was to assess livestock grazing distribution in communal rangeland of the Eastern Cape in South Africa in order to improve livestock grazing. The study used Global Positioning Systems (GPS) that were placed on six animals including three sheep and three cattle, selected randomly from participating households. The GPS collars recorded the geographic position of the areas where animals were grazing, at five-minute intervals during the wet and dry season. Grass species composition was surveyed using line transects on areas where livestock grazing occurred. The study further identified three production domains, which were separated by bound polygons on Google Earth Pro to extract MODIS EVI where livestock grazing occurred. Livestock grazing distribution was analysed using T-LoCoH installed in R. The results revealed that both sheep and cattle spent most of their time grazing in areas associated with human features. The dominant grass species were Hyperrenia hirta and Eragrostis plana, suggesting a negative impact of the current livestock grazing distribution. Possible explanations of the current grazing distribution might be that these areas are close to homesteads and provide grazing lawns that contain a high nitrogen content. This study will help in providing an informed basis for the development of South African communal rangeland policies for effective livestock management.

TI  - Determination of Spatially-Distributed Hydrological Ecosystem Services (HESS) in the Red River Delta Using a Calibrated SWAT Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The principles of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), conservation of natural capital, and water accounting requires Hydrological Eco-System Services (HESS) to be determined. This paper presents a modeling approach for quantifying the HESS framework using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT was used-after calibration against remote sensing data-to quantify and spatially identify total runoff, natural livestock feed production, fuelwood from natural forests, dry season flow, groundwater recharge, root zone storage for carrying over water from wet to dry season, sustaining rainfall, peak flow attenuation, carbon sequestration, microclimate cooling, and meeting environmental flow requirements. The environmental value of the current land use and vegetation was made explicit by carrying out parallel simulations for bare soil and vegetation conditions and reporting the incremental ecosystem services. Geographical areas with more and fewer HESS are identified. The spatial and temporal variability of annual HESS services is demonstrated for the Day Basin-which is part of the Red River delta (Vietnam)-for the period 2003 to 2013. The result shows that even though the basin is abundant with HESS, e.g., 7482 m(3)/ha of runoff, 3820 m(3)/ha of groundwater recharge, the trend for many HESS values, e.g., micro-climate cooling, meeting environmental flow requirements, and rootzone storage, are declining. It is found and proven that quantified HESS indicators highlighted the provisioning and regulating characters of ecosystem services, as well as geographical hotspots across the basin. The SWAT model shows the capability of simulating terrestrial eco-hydrological processes such as climate, soil, and current land use. The methodology illustrates how eco-hydrologists can benchmark ecosystem values and include HESS in exploring river basin management scenarios, climate change studies, and land use planning.

TI  - Systematic Evaluation of Four Satellite AOD Datasets for Estimating PM<sub>2.5</sub> Using a Random Forest Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The latest epidemiological studies have revealed that the adverse health effects of PM2.5 have impacts beyond respiratory and cardio-vascular diseases and also affect the development of the brain and metabolic diseases. The need for accurate and spatio-temporally resolved PM2.5 data has thus been substantiated. While the selective information provided by station measurements is mostly insufficient for area-wide monitoring, satellite data have been increasingly applied to comprehensively monitor PM2.5 distributions. Although the accuracy and reliability of satellite-based PM2.5 estimations have increased, most studies still rely on a single sensor. However, several datasets have become available in the meantime, which raises the need for a systematic analysis. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of four satellite-based AOD datasets obtained from different sensors and retrieval methodologies to derive ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. We apply a random forest approach and analyze the effect of the resolution and coverage of the satellite data and the impact of proxy data on the performance. We examine AOD data from the Moderate resolution Imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua satellites, including Dark Target (DT) algorithm products and the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) product. Additionally, we explore more recent datasets from the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) onboard Sentinel-3a and from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) operating on the Sentinel-5 precursor (S5p). The method is demonstrated for Germany and the year 2018, where a dense in situ measurement network and relevant proxy data are available. Overall, the model performance is satisfactory for all four datasets with cross-validated R-2 values ranging from 0.68 to 0.77 and excellent for MODIS AOD reaching correlations of almost 0.9. We find a strong dependency of the model performance on the coverage and resolution of the AOD training data. Feature importance rankings show that AOD has less weight compared to proxy data for SLSTR and TROPOMI.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal and Driving Factors of Land Use/Cover Change in Mongolia from 1990 to 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the past several decades, desertification and land degradation have become more and more serious in Mongolia. The drivers of land use/cover change (LUCC), such as population dynamics and climate change, are increasingly important to local sustainability studies. They can only be properly analyzed at small scales that capture the socio-economic conditions. Several studies have been carried out to examine the pattern of LUCC in Mongolia, but they have been focused on changes in single land types at a local scale. Although some of them were carried out at the national scale, the data interval is more than 10 years. A small-scale and year-by-year dataset of LUCC in Mongolia is thus needed for comprehensive analyses. We obtained year-by-year land use/cover changes in Mongolia from 1990 to 2021 using Landsat TM/OLI data. First, we established a random forest (RF) model. Then, in order to improve the classification accuracy of the misclassification of cropland, grassland, and built and barren areas, the classification and regression trees model (CART) was introduced for post-processing. The results show that 17.6% of the land surface has changed at least once among the six land categories from 1990 to 2021. While the area of barren land has significantly increased, the grassland and forest areas have exhibited a decreasing trend in the past 32 years. The other land types do not show promising changes. To determine the driving factors of LUCC, we applied an RF feature importance ranking to environmental factors, physical factors, socioeconomic factors, and accessibility factors. The mean annual precipitation (MAP), evapotranspiration (ET), mean annual air temperature (MAAT), DEM, GDP, and distance to railway are the main driving factors that have determined the distribution and changes in land types. Interestingly, unlike the global anti-V-shaped pattern, we found that the land use/cover changes show an N-shaped trend in Mongolia. These characteristics of land use/cover change in Mongolia are primarily due to the agricultural policies and rapid urbanization. The results present comprehensive land use/cover change information for Mongolia, and they are of great significance for policy-makers to formulate a scientific sustainable development strategy and to alleviate the desertification of Mongolia.

TI  - Uplifted marine terraces by active coastal tectonic deformation along the east of Algiers: implications for African and European plate convergence and sea-level curves
T2  - BOLETIN GEOLOGICO Y MINERO
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine terraces are geological features composed of elevated, flat surfaces and steep slopes. The evolution of these terraces is largely influenced by active coastal tectonic deformation. This study investigates the uplift of marine terraces along the east coast of Algiers and its implications for the African and European plate convergence and sea-level curves. The objective of studying marine terraces in the Zemmouri area is to gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of the Earth's coastlines and how they have been shaped over time by natural processes such as sea level changes, tectonic activity, geomorphic parameters, and erosion. Marine terraces provide valuable information about the history of sea level changes and the rate of tectonic uplift or subsidence of the coastal areas. Secondary data sources, including qualitative information and high-resolution satellite imagery (SRTM 30 m and ALOS 12.5 m), were used to analyze the impact of sea level on marine terraces. Fieldwork using GPS and altimeter measurements at the site of the Mw=6.8 Zemmouri earthquake that occurred on May 21, 2003, revealed the presence of two well-preserved marine terraces, which serve as important markers for measuring the long-term fault slip rate. The analysis highlights the significance of active coastal tectonic deformation in shaping the coastlines. This research offers new insights into the ongoing processes of plate convergence and sea level change along the east coast of Algiers, contributing to our overall comprehension of coastal evolution and the potential for seismic hazards in the region.

TI  - Location and Activity Changes of Slow-Moving Landslides Due to an Earthquake: Perspective from InSAR Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Strong earthquakes can not only trigger many landslides in a short period of time but can also change the stability of slopes in the earthquake area, causing them to be active for a long time after the earthquake. Research on the variation of slow-motion slopes before and after earthquakes can help us to better understand the mechanism of earthquake-affected landslides, which is also crucial for assessing the long-term landslide risk in seismically active areas. Here, L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images are utilized with the SBAS-InSAR algorithm to monitor and assess the location and activity changes of slow-moving landslides in the Iburi region (Hokkaido, Japan) before and after an earthquake occurred on 6 September 2018. Unlike previous studies, which focused on single typical landslides, we tracked all the landslides within a 33 x 55 km region close to the epicenter. According to the results, the majority of the co-seismic landslides that quickly failed during the earthquake are now stable, and a few of them are still moving. In contrast, due to near-field seismic shaking, certain slopes that did not show substantial surface changes during the earthquake period continued to move and eventually developed into slow-moving landslides. In addition, it can be seen from the spatial distribution of slow-moving landslides after the earthquake that this distribution is not only dependent on strong earthquake seismic vibration or the hanging-wall effect. Far-field weak vibrations can also accelerate landslides. Additionally, we discovered that the earthquake made the unstable slopes move more quickly but also tended to stabilize the slopes that were already in motion before the earthquake. The various response modes of slow-moving landslides to seismic events are related not only to the intensity of seismic vibration but also to the geological conditions of the region and to the size of the landslide itself. These findings are extremely valuable for studying the mechanism of earthquake-affected landslides.

TI  - Hierarchical Cross-Domain Satellite Resource Management: An Intelligent Collaboration Perspective
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of satellite applications induces the formation of the multi-domain satellite system (MDSS) containing multiple domains with specific applications such as earth resource remote sensing and the Internet of remote things. Resource management is pivotal in enhancing the scheduling capability of the MDSS. However, this is challenging since the dynamic buffer space and communication opportunity, as well as the uncertain data traffic, exacerbate the difficulty of matching satellite resources with data traffic. Moreover, the coexistence of resource competition and collaboration across domains aggravates the dilemma of cross-domain collaboration. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical cross-domain collaborative resource management framework that can flexibly allocate the mission data through local intra-domain and global cross-domain scheduling. Then, to match the uncertain demands of missions with dynamic and limited resources, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based resource management method to guide collaboration for multi-satellite data carry-forward in a domain. Further, considering resource competition and collaboration in MDSS, we propose a domain-satellite nested matching game data scheduling algorithm to achieve pair-wise stable collaboration of cross-domain satellites. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm improves the amount of offloaded data by 64.4% and 12.7% compared to the non-collaborative and the non-cross-domain schemes, respectively.

TI  - Evapotranspiration of Winter Wheat in the Semi-Arid Southeastern Loess Plateau Based on Multi-Source Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of evapotranspiration (ET) at high spatio-temporal resolutions is vital for managing agricultural water resources in arid and semi-arid regions. This study used the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) to calculate the ET of winter wheat between the green-up and milk stages in Linfen Basin, a typical, semi-arid area of the Loess Plateau, at temporal and spatial resolutions of 30 m and 8 d, respectively. We then analyzed the impact of meteorological factors on ET and its variation during the main growth period of winter wheat. The fused ET data displayed the spatial details of the OLI ET data better and could accurately reflect ET variation and local sudden variations during the main growth period of winter wheat. Moreover, winter wheat ET in rain-fed areas is more heavily influenced by meteorological factors, and the effect is more direct. Affected by the synergistic effect of wind velocity, precipitation, and temperature, the ET of winter wheat in rain-fed area was lower in the green-up stage. Then, ET gradually increased, reaching its maximum in the heading-grain filling stage. At the jointing stage, temperature had a significant effect on ET. A combination of precipitation and temperature had the greatest impact on the ET of winter wheat in the heading-filling stage. In the milk stage, meteorological factors had a minor impact on ET. This study serves as a reference for ET in winter wheat in semi-arid areas and its influencing meteorological factors, which can assist in drought mitigation and regional food security strategies.

TI  - Using Multi-Source Data to Assess the Hydrologic Alteration and Extremes under a Changing Environment in the Yalong River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and human activities are two important factors in the changing environment that affect the variability of the hydrological cycle and river regime in the Yalong River basin. This paper analyzed the hydrological alteration and extremes in the Yalong River basin based on multi-source satellite data, and projected the hydrological response under different future climate change scenarios using the CwatM hydrological model. The results show that: (1) The overall change in hydrological alteration at Tongzilin station was moderate during the period of 1998-2011 and severe during the period of 2012-2020. (2) Precipitation (average 781 mm/a) is the dominant factor of water cycle on a monthly scale, which can explain the temporal variability of runoff, evaporation, and terrestrial water storage, while terrestrial water storage is also simultaneously regulated by runoff and evaporation. (3) The GRACE data are comparable with regional water resource bulletins. The terrestrial water storage is mainly regulated by surface water (average 1062 x 10(8) m(3)), while the contribution of groundwater (average 298 x 10(8) m(3)) is relatively small. (4) The evaporation and runoff processes will intensify in the future due to climate warming and increasing precipitation (similar to 10%), and terrestrial water storage will be depleted. The magnitude of change will increase with the enhancement of emission scenarios.

TI  - Where boundaries become bridges: Mosquito community composition, key vectors, and environmental associations at forest edges in the central Brazilian Amazon
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Risk of spillover and spillback of mosquito-borne viruses in the neotropics, including yellow fever, dengue, Zika (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus), chikungunya, and Mayaro (Togaviridae: Alphavirus) viruses, is highest at ecotones where humans, monkeys, and mosquitoes coexist. With a view to identifying potential bridge vectors, we investigated changes in mosquito community composition and environmental variables at ground level at distances of 0, 500, 1000, and 2000 m from the edge of a rainforest reserve bordering the city of Manaus in the central Brazilian Amazon. During two rainy seasons in 2019 and 2020, we sampled 9,467 mosquitoes at 244 unique sites using BG-Sentinel traps, hand-nets, and Prokopack aspirators. Species richness and diversity were generally higher at 0 m and 500 m than at 1000 m and 2000 m, while mosquito community composition changed considerably between the forest edge and 500 m before stabilizing by 1000 m. Shifts in environmental variables mainly occurred between the edge and 500 m, and the occurrence of key taxa (Aedes albopictus, Ae. scapularis, Limatus durhamii, Psorophora amazonica, Haemagogus, and Sabethes) was associated with one or more of these variables. Sites where Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were detected had significantly higher surrounding mean NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) values than sites where they were not detected, while the opposite was true for Sabethes mosquitoes. Our findings suggest that major changes in mosquito communities and environmental variables occur within 500 m of the forest edge, where there is high risk for contact with both urban and sylvatic vectors. By 1000 m, conditions stabilize, species diversity decreases, and forest mosquitoes predominate. Environmental variables associated with the occurrence of key taxa may be leveraged to characterize suitable habitat and refine risk models for pathogen spillover and spillback.Author summaryMosquito-borne viruses, including yellow fever, dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and Mayaro viruses, derive from sylvatic transmission cycles involving forest mosquitoes and wild animals. Occasionally, these sylvatic viruses spill over into humans, which can lead to limited disease outbreaks or sustained human transmission by urban mosquitoes. When translocated by humans to new geographic regions, these viruses have potential to spill back into novel sylvatic cycles, creating a lasting threat to human health. Ecotones, such as forest edges, where humans, mosquitoes, and monkeys coexist, are at high risk of spillover and spillback. We investigated changes in mosquito community composition at incremental distances up to 2000 m into rainforest bordering the Amazonian city of Manaus, where the above viruses circulate in urban and sylvatic cycles. We also characterized mosquito habitat and analyzed associations between key vector species and environmental variables like temperature and vegetation. Our results show that mosquito communities and environmental variables change abruptly within 500 m of the forest edge, where there is high risk for contact of both monkeys and humans with both urban and forest mosquitoes. By 1000 m, conditions stabilize, and forest mosquitoes predominate. Environmental variables associated with the presence of particular mosquito taxa will help characterize suitable habitat for key vector species and refine spillover and spillback risk models for these viruses.

AB  - Taking the realms of business, finance and economic history by storm, polycrisis captures the complexity of an increasingly uncertain world in a state of flux and transition. Proponents of the polycrisis model, such as prominent economic historian and Financial Times contributing editor Adam Tooze, propose polycrisis as a marker of our age, capturing overlapping and interconnected crises beyond cause and effect. In his article, the authors offer some prompts for considering the usefulness and limitations of polycrisis for the anthropological toolkit. The authors cautiously welcome the polycrisis trope as a multidimensional means to account for the consequences of interrelated crises in an unprecedented era.

TI  - Analysis of Spatial-Temporal Variability of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations Using Optical Satellite Images and Geographic Information System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5) is an air pollutant that has become a major environmental concern for governments around the world. Management and control require air quality monitoring and prediction. However, previous studies did not fully utilize the spectral information in multispectral satellite images and land use data in geographic datasets. To alleviate these problems, this study proposes the extraction of land use information not only from geographic inventory but also from satellite images with a machine learning-based classification. In this manner, near up-to-date land use data and spectral information from satellite images can be utilized, and the integration of geographic and remote sensing datasets boosts the accuracy of PM2.5 concentration modeling. In the experiments, Landsat-8 imagery with a 30-m spatial resolution was used, and cloud-free image generation was performed prior to the land cover classification. The proposed method, which uses predictors from geographic and multispectral satellite datasets in modeling, was compared with an approach which utilizes geographic and remote sensing datasets, respectively. Quantitative assessments showed that the proposed method and the developed model, with a performance of RMSE = 3.06 mu g/m(3) and R-2 = 0.85 comparatively outperform the models with a performance of RMSE = 3.14 mu g/m(3) and R-2 = 0.68 for remote sensing datasets and a performance of RMSE = 3.47 mu g/m(3) and R-2 = 0.79 for geographic datasets.

TI  - Patterns of Change and Successional Transition in a 47-Year Period (1973-2020) in Rangelands of the Tamaulipan Highlands, Northeastern Mexico
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangelands in arid and semi-arid regions are the main source of livestock feed. The fragmentation of these ecosystems by continuous grazing gives rise to the modification of ecological processes, which alters the structure and functionality of plant communities. Therefore, the use of geographic information systems and the analysis of satellite images are important to monitor spatial changes and to evaluate these areas in the Tamaulipan Highlands of northeastern Mexico. This work aimed to evaluate the current state of the rangelands and to determine the percentage of modified areas as well as propose the time of permanence, succession, or recovery of five different areas destined for rangelands. For the analysis, Landsat satellite scenes from the period 1973-2020 were used: they were classified into four categories using segmentation and maximum likelihood analysis, as well as a cross-tabulation method to determine the degree of succession. An increase in rangelands was found in three of the five areas analyzed in the period from 1973 to 2020. As rangeland areas increase, the coverage of pine-oak forests, submontane-thorny scrub, and anthropogenic areas, decreases. The disturbance processes were not linear, and the increase in rangeland areas was greater in xerophilous scrub and secondary vegetation. This work is the first contribution that evaluates the changes in land use and cover in grazing areas compromised by continuous grazing in the Tamaulipan Highlands and Mexico. In addition, the results indicate the importance of performing studies based on the coexistence of wildlife and livestock as well as the interaction between soil degradation and plant diversity with the increase in rangelands.

TI  - The Role of Data-Driven Methodologies in Weather Index Insurance
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - There are several index insurance methodologies. Most of them rely on linear piece-wise methods. Recently, there has been studies promoting the potential of data-driven methodologies in construction index insurance models due to their ability to capture intricate non-linear structures. However, these types of frameworks have mainly been implemented in high-income countries due to the large amounts of data and high-frequency requirements. This paper adapts a data-driven methodology based on high-frequency satellite-based climate indices to explain flood risk and agricultural losses in the Antioquia area (Colombia). We used flood records as a proxy of crop losses, while satellite data comprises run-off, soil moisture, and precipitation variables. We analyse the period between 3 June 2000 and 31 December 2021. We used a logistic regression model as a reference point to assess the performance of a deep neural network. The results show that a neural network performs better than traditional logistic regression models for the available loss event data on the selected performance metrics. Additionally, we obtained a utility measure to derive the costs associated for both parts involved including the policyholder and the insurance provider. When using neural networks, costs associated with the policyholder are lower for the majority of the range of cut-off values. This approach contributes to the future construction of weather insurance indexes for the region where a decrease in the base risk would be expected, thus, resulting in a reduction in insurance costs.

TI  - Mapping Sea Grass Coverage of Tanjung Benoa Bali Using Medium Resolution Satellite Imagery Sentinel 2B
T2  - SAINS MALAYSIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass beds are important components of a coastal ecosystem. This ecosystem serves as the primer producers of the water food chain, habitat for marine biota, produces organic carbon, and indirectly contributes to the economic well-being of coastal communities. However, the ecosystem is vulnerable to damage caused by natural factors and human activities. The objectives of this study were, firstly to identify the distribution of seagrass beds in Tanjung Benoa using Sentinel 2B satellite imagery and secondly to compare classification results from two different approaches namely pixel-based image classification and object-based image classification. Accuracy-test was carried out using field data reference of 195 sample points in the form of a 10 m X 10 m transect. The image pre-processing process was conducted with Bottom of Atmosphere (BoA) correction using the Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) method. Furthermore, the water column correction was performed using the Depth Invariant Index (DII) and the Lyzenga algorithm. The mapping results showed that the area of seagrass beds in the shallow waters of Tanjung Benoa reaches 242.99 ha. There were seven seagrass species in the study area, with an average cover of 75%. The accuracy of object-based image classification was higher than that of pixel-based classification with a difference up to 25% for six classes classification and 15% for two classes classification. Excellent results for classifying seagrasses based on cover density can be obtained when high-resolution satellite imagery and OBIA are combined with the SVM or Fuzzy Logic algorithm.

TI  - Enhancing FAIR Data Services in Agricultural Disaster: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The agriculture sector is highly vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change, leading to severe impacts on food security, economic stability, and rural livelihoods. The use of geospatial information and technology has been recognized as a valuable tool to help farmers reduce the adverse impacts of natural disasters on agriculture. Remote sensing and GIS are gaining traction as ways to improve agricultural disaster response due to recent advancements in spatial resolution, accessibility, and affordability. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the FAIR agricultural disaster services. It holistically introduces the current status, case studies, technologies, and challenges, and it provides a big picture of exploring geospatial applications for agricultural disaster "from farm to space". The review begins with an overview of the governments and organizations worldwide. We present the major international and national initiatives relevant to the agricultural disaster context. The second part of this review illustrates recent research on remote sensing-based agricultural disaster monitoring, with a special focus on drought and flood events. Traditional, integrative, and machine learning-based methods are highlighted in this section. We then examine the role of spatial data infrastructure and research on agricultural disaster services and systems. The generic lifecycle of agricultural disasters is briefly introduced. Eventually, we discuss the grand challenges and emerging opportunities that range from analysis-ready data to decision-ready services, providing guidance on the foreseeable future.

TI  - JEDI-Based Three-Dimensional Ensemble-Variational Data Assimilation System for Global Aerosol Forecasting at NCEP
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - A three-dimensional ensemble-variational global aerosol data assimilation system based on the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) was developed for the Global Ensemble Forecast System-Aerosols (GEFS-Aerosols) coupled with the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. Aerosol mass mixing ratios in GEFS-Aerosols were selected as control or analysis variables and were adjusted by assimilating 550 nm Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrievals from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instruments onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite produced by the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The original NOAA/NESDIS S-NPP VIIRS Level 2.0 550 nm AOD retrievals were converted to JEDI Interface for Observation Data Access format. AOD forward operator and its tangent-linear and adjoint models were implemented based on GOCART in JEDI Unified Forward Operator. A stochastically perturbed emission (SPE) approach was developed in the Common Community Physics Package-based GEFS-Aerosols to account for aerosol emission uncertainty. One-month retrospective and three-month near-real-time experiments consistently showed improved GEFS-Aerosols analyses and forecasts from assimilating VIIRS 550 nm AOD retrievals against independent NASA Aqua and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer AOD retrievals, Aerosol Robotic Network AOD, and independent AOD and aerosol analyses from NASA and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Through scaling and perturbing aerosol emissions, SPE enhanced ensemble error-spread consistency and further improved AOD assimilation. The valid-time-shifting ensemble approach in a cost-effective manner of populating background ensembles showed positive impacts on AOD assimilation.

TI  - Classification of the Land Cover of a Megacity in ASEAN Using Two Band Combinations and Three Machine Learning Algorithms: A Case Study in Ho Chi Minh City
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate classification of land cover data can facilitate the intensive use of urban land and provide scientific and reasonable data support for urban development. Rapid changes in land cover due to economic growth are occurring in the megacities of developing countries more and more. A land cover classification method with a high spatiotemporal resolution and low cost is needed to support sustainable urban development for continuous land monitoring. This study discusses better machine learning algorithms for land cover classification in Ho Chi Minh City. We used band combination 764 and band combination 543 of LANDSAT8-OLI image data to classify the land cover in Ho Chi Minh City by combining three machine learning algorithms: Back-Propagation Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. We divided the land cover into six types and collected 2221 samples, 60% of which were used for training and 40% for validation. Our results show that using the band combination 764 combined with the Random Forest algorithm is the most appropriate, with an overall classification accuracy of 99.41% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.99. Moreover, it shows a more significant advantage regarding city-level land cover details than other classification products.

TI  - Landslide Monitoring along the Dadu River in Sichuan Based on Sentinel-1 Multi-Temporal InSAR
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Dadu River travels in the mountainous areas of southwestern China, one of regions with the most hazards that has long suffered from frequent geohazards. The early identification of landslides in this region is urgently needed, especially after the recent Luding earthquake (MS 6.8). While conventional ground-based monitoring techniques are limited by the complex terrain conditions in these alpine valley regions, space interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) provides an incomparable advantage in obtaining surface deformation with high precision and over a wide area, which is very useful for long-term and slow geohazard monitoring. In this study, more than 500 Sentinel-1 SAR images with four frames acquired during 2017 similar to 2022 were collected to detect the hidden landslide regions from the Jinchuan to Ebian Section along the Dadu River, based on joint-scatterer InSAR (JS-InSAR) and small baseline subset (SBAS) techniques. The results showed that our method could be successfully applied for landslide monitoring in complex mountainous regions. Furthermore, 143 potential landslide regions spreading over an 800 km area along the Dadu River were extracted by integrating the deformation measurements and optical images. Our study can provide a reference for large-scale geological hazard surveys in mountainous areas, and the InSAR technique will be encouraged for the local government in future long-term monitoring applications in the Dadu River Basin.

TI  - Evaluation of DEM Accuracy Improvement Methods Based on Multi-Source Data Fusion in Typical Gully Areas of Loess Plateau
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the accuracy of DEMs is a critical goal in digital terrain analysis. The combination of multi-source data can be used to increase DEM accuracy. Five typical geomorphic study areas in the Loess Plateau in Shaanxi were selected for a case study and a 5 m DEM unit was used as the basic data input. Data from three open-source databases of DEM images, the ALOS, SRTM and ASTER, were obtained and processed uniformly through a previously geographical registration process. Three methods, Gram-Schmidt pan sharpening (GS), weighted fusion and feature-point-embedding fusion, were used for mutual enhancement of the three kinds of data. We combined the effect of these three fusion methods in the five sample areas and compared the eigenvalues taken before and after the fusion. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The GS fusion method is convenient and simple, and the three combined fusion methods can be improved. Generally speaking, the fusion of ALOS and SRTM data led to the best performance, but was greatly affected by the original data. (2) By embedding feature points into three publicly available types of DEM data, the errors and extreme error value of the data obtained through fusion were significantly improved. Overall, ALOS fusion resulted in the best performance because it had the best raw data quality. The original eigenvalues of the ASTER were all inferior and the improvement in the error and the error extreme value after fusion was evident. (3) By dividing the sample area into different areas and fusing them separately according to the weights of each area, the accuracy of the data obtained was significantly improved. In comparing the improvement in accuracy in each region, it was observed that the fusion of ALOS and SRTM data relies on a gentle area. A high accuracy of these two data will lead to a better fusion. Merging ALOS and ASTER data led to the greatest increase in accuracy, especially in the areas with a steep slope. Additionally, when SRTM and ASTER data were merged, the observed improvement was relatively stable with little difference.

TI  - A neural network model to predict spatiotemporal PM2.5 with FY-4A total precipitable water
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy pollution weather has been proven by many to be very dangerous to human health and the normal functioning of society and the economy. PM2.5 is one of the causes of the formation of heavily polluted weather. At present, PM2.5 prediction results are only single station values or average values for small areas, but in our practical application large area gridded prediction values are the most valuable. So, we propose a FFT-ConvLSTM (Fast Fourier Transform ConvLSTM Network) model. The model first uses FFT to extract/analyze the common oscillation period of all input features and sets the time sliding window's size according to the period's length. Finally, not only high accuracy gridded prediction is achieved, but also long time prediction is realized by frame by frame output. In this study, air pollutants, meteorological elements and FY-4A water vapor data in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region are used as input features of the model, among which FY-4A water vapor data solve the drawback that other monitoring devices cannot obtain high spatiotemporal resolution water vapor data. It is shown that the best common periods are 200 h, 133 h and 103 h for plains, mountains and plateaus in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, respectively. The RMSE of the FFT-ConvLSTM model is reduced by 5.4 mu g/m3, 1.46 mu g/m3 and 0.95 mu g/m3 compared with the ConvLSTM model under the three different regions. The FFT-ConvLSTM model reduced the three-region mean RMSE by 3.69 mu g/m3 and 5.2 mu g/m3 compared to the MLR and CNN models, respectively.

TI  - Enhanced Estimate of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter Using Machine Learning Algorithms from Landsat-8 OLI Data in the Pearl River Estuary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) plays a critical role in the carbon and biogeochemical cycles within aquatic ecosystems. Satellite imagery can be employed to determine aquatic CDOM concentrations, highlighting the need for effective and precise algorithms for this task. In this study, a cruise survey dataset containing CDOM absorption coefficients and water-leaving radiances in the Pearl River estuary (PRE) was utilized to develop machine learning algorithms for CDOM retrieval from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) observations. Based on OLI wavelength bands, five bands and six band-ratios were chosen as input parameters for the machine learning models. Six machine learning models were trained to develop CDOM algorithms, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The results indicated that, among the six machine learning models, the XGBoost algorithm performed best, with the highest R-2 value of 0.9 and the lowest CDOM root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.37 m(-1), outperforming empirical algorithms. The XGBoost algorithm identified B4/B1 as the most critical input parameter, contributing 71%, followed by B3/B2 with a 16% contribution, where B1, B2, B3, and B4 are the wavelength bands of the OLI. These two band-ratios accounted for most of the contributions, suggesting their significant role in CDOM retrieval from Landsat OLI images. By employing the developed XGBoost algorithm, CDOM spatial patterns at six instances were derived from Landsat-8 OLI image reflectance, illustrating CDOM variations in the PRE influenced by various factors. Further analysis revealed that, in the PRE, tides and winds are the primary driving forces behind the spatial and temporal variability of CDOM. At present, the exploration of employing machine learning algorithms to infer CDOM concentrations in this region remains relatively limited; therefore, with a higher R-2 value, the machine learning model we established unveils fresh and novel results.

TI  - Long-Term Change of Lake Water Storage and Its Response to Climate Change for Typical Lakes in Arid Xinjiang, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes play a role as the sentinel of climate change. Surrounded by vast expanses of barren land with limited infrastructure, there is also a lack of knowledge about the dynamics of dryland lakes. The change of lake area can be effectively monitored by remote sensing, and multi-source satellite altimetry datasets provide the possibility to obtain long-term lake water level data. Using the Global Surface Water Monthly Historical dataset and altimetry water level dataset (Hydroweb), we reconstructed a time series of lake water storage changes in Xinjiang, Northwestern China, by establishing the empirical models based on the statistical relationship between the surface area and water level of each lake. We further explored lake response to climate change. The results show that the storage of water at Ayakkum Lake, Aqqikkol Lake and Aksayquin Lake have been undergoing an obvious expanding trend from 2000 to 2020, at a rate of 3.59x10(8)m(3)/a, 9.43x10(8)m(3)/a and 0.44x10(8)m(3)/a, respectively. In the plain and transition zone, Ulungur Lake showed an upward tendency (0.413x10(8)m(3)/a) in water storage, while Manas Lake and Bosten Lake experienced shrinkage with descending rates of -0.1x10(8)m(3)/a and -0.86x10(8)m(3)/a. Temperature changes significantly affect the lake water storage on plateaus, especially those lakes supplied with a large proportion of glacial meltwater. Precipitation is a key factor for changes of lake storage in the plain and transition zones. Meanwhile, extreme weather and man-made factors also play crucial roles. To reduce the risk of flood and drought disasters, rational regulation of water resources is required, and a large-scale integrated catchment management plan can avoid inadvertent trade-offs. This research provides a new perspective for lake water storage inversion, as well as data support for water resources management in arid areas including Xinjiang.

TI  - Seasonal mass concentration variation and potential source regions of atmospheric particulate matter in Ngari area, Tibet Plateau
T2  - Huanjing Huaxue-Environmental Chemistry
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a GRIMM Environmental Dust Monitor EDM 365, the temporal variation and PM2.5/PM10 ratio of atmospheric particulate matter concentration at Ngari Station from December 1, 2018 to November 30, 2019 were analyzed . The results showed that during the monitoring period, the average daily concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 were (10.51 +/- 8.62) mu g center dot m-3, (4.05 +/- 2.36) mu g center dot m-3, (2.47 +/- 1.56) mu g center dot m-3, respectively, which were lower than those in the urban areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.PM2.5andPM10are much lower than the annual average threshold value of classI standard of the ambient air quality standard(GB 3095-2012), indicating the clean atmospheric background characteristics in Ngari. Ngari is located in the transitional zone between westerly winds and Indian monsoon. The southwest monsoon significantly affects the change of particulate matter concentration at Ngari station, and the warm and humid air mass brought by monsoon significantly reduces the particulate matter mass concentration during monsoon. In addition, the seasonal variation of meteorological factors such as boundary layer height makes the mass concentration of PM show obvious seasonal variation, which is higher in winter and pre-monsoon than in monsoon and post-monsoon. Ngari Station is located in alpine desert environment, and atmospheric particles are mainly coarse particles. The average ratio ofPM2.5/PM10is 0.39, which is lower than other sites. The cluster analysis shows that Ngari station is mainly affected by the westerly winds. The results of potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration-weight trajectory (CWT) showed that the main potential source regions ofPM10,PM2.5,PM1 were located in north-western India and northern Pakistan. Due to the different monitoring principles and the influence of meteorological factors, the MODIS AOD data and in-situ PM data are quite different in December, July and August, and the aerosol parameters obtained by remote sensing need to be further revised to improve their applicability in the plateau.

TI  - Spatial Modeling of Forest and Land Fire Susceptibility Using the Information Value Method in Kotawaringin Barat Regency, Indonesia
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Kotawaringin Barat is a high-risk area for forest and land fires; a total of 564.13 km(2) of forest land was burned from 2015 to 2022, the majority of which spread to peatlands. The goal of this contribution is to use the information value method (IVM) to construct forest and land fire spatial susceptibility maps for the Kotawaringin Barat regency. MODIS hotspots from 2016 to 2020 were used as the dependent variable, with six independent variables included in the modeling. According to the data, there were 925 hotspots detected in Kotawaringin Barat between 2016 and 2020. The areas closest to rivers and roads are more susceptible to forest and land fires, while the areas closest to settlements are safer. Flat slopes have an IVM of 0.697, while peatlands have an IVM of 0.667, making them the most susceptible to forest and land fires. Furthermore, the most susceptive land covers are swamps (IVM = 1.071) and shrublands (IVM = 0.024). According to the IVM model of susceptibility mapping, Kotawaringin Barat is categorized as very high (18.32%) and high (27.97%) risk. About 33.57% of the study area is classified as moderately susceptible, while the remaining 20.14% is classified as low risk. The accuracy of the IVM for forest and land fires is 66.87% (AUC), indicating that the model can be used for susceptibility assessments particularly for very high to high susceptibility areas.

TI  - Bias correction of Sentinel-2 with unmanned aerial vehicle multispectral data for use in monitoring walnut fruit forest in western Tien Shan, Kyrgyzstan
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The scope of our work is to compare Sentinel-2 and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) imagery from Western Tian Shan for monitoring applications in walnut fruit forests. Because acquiring field data on walnut fruit forests is difficult due to access limitations in the Tian Shan, remote sensing offers a unique opportunity to increase spatial and temporal coverage of ecological parameters. Sentinel-2 satellites launched in 2015 have been providing images at spatial resolutions of 10 to 20 m; however, difficulties remain as information retrieved from Sentinel pixels result from a mixture of objects that affect reflectance signals. We used submeter multispectral UAV images to assess the sensitivity of Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to subpixel vegetation. Results showed that Sentinel-2 data overestimates NDVI in regions with open terrain and grass, and underestimates NDVI in areas with trees. By implementing a bias correction method, the accuracy of the Sentinel-2 derived NDVI increased; R-2 values increased from 0.59 to 0.88 (p value < 0.001). We also showed that drought index derived from Sentinel-2 vegetation condition index (VCI) is well correlated with the ground-based standard precipitation index (SPI). Using this bias correction method, on average the correlation increased by 3% between VCI and SPI.

TI  - Is It Possible to Quantify Irrigation Water-Use by Assimilating a High-Resolution Satellite Soil Moisture Product?
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation is the largest human intervention in the water cycle that can modulate climate extremes, yet irrigation water use (IWU) remains largely unknown in most regions. Microwave remote sensing offers a practical way to quantify IWU by monitoring changes in soil moisture caused by irrigation. However, high-resolution satellite soil moisture data is typically infrequent (e.g., 6-12 days) and thus may miss irrigation events. This study evaluates the ability to quantify IWU by assimilating high-resolution (1 km) SMAP-Sentinel 1 remotely sensed soil moisture with a physically based land surface model (LSM) using a particle batch smoother (PBS). A suite of synthetic experiments is devised to evaluate different error sources. Results from the synthetic experiments show that unbiased simulations with known irrigation timing can produce an accurate irrigation estimate with a mean annual bias of 0.45% and a mean R-2 of 0.97, relative to observed IWU. Unknown irrigation timing can significantly deteriorate the model performance, resulting in an increased mean annual bias to 23% and decreased mean R-2 to 0.36. Adding random noise to synthetic observations does not significantly decrease model performance except for the experiments with low observation frequency (>12 days). In real-world experiments, the PBS data assimilation approach underestimates observed IWU by 18.6% when the timing of IWU is known. IWU estimates are consistently significantly higher over irrigated pixels compared to the non-irrigated pixels, indicating data assimilation skillfully conveys irrigation signals to the LSM.

TI  - Optimized Classification of Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS)-Enabled GEO Satellite Signals
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a cutting-edge technology for cost-effectively achieving future spectrum- and energy-efficient wireless communication. In particular, an IRS comprises many low-cost passive devices that can independently reflect the incident signal with a configurable phase shift to produce three-dimensional (3D) passive beamforming without transmitting Radio-Frequency (RF) chains. Thus, the IRS can be utilized to greatly improve wireless channel conditions and increase the dependability of communication systems. This article proposes a scheme for an IRS-equipped GEO satellite signal with proper channel modeling and system characterization. Gabor filter networks (GFNs) are jointly proposed for the extraction of distinct features and the classification of these features. Hybrid optimal functions are used to solve the estimated classification problem, and a simulation setup was designed along with proper channel modeling. The experimental results show that the proposed IRS-based methodology provides higher classification accuracy than the benchmark without the IRS methodology.

TI  - A Study on Domestic Applicability for the Korean Cosmic-Ray Soil Moisture Observing System
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In terms of understanding the water cycle and efficient water resource management, the importance of soil moisture has been highlighted. However, in Korea, the lack of qualified in-situ soil moisture data results in very limited utility. Even if satellite-based data are applied, the absence of ground reference data makes objective evaluation and correction difficult. The cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) can play a key role in producing data for satellite data calibration. The installation of CRNP is non-invasive, minimizing damage to the soil and vegetation environment, and has the advantage of having a spatial representative for the intermediate scale. These characteristics are advantageous to establish an observation network in Korea which has lots of mountainous areas with dense vegetation. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the applicability of the CRNP soil moisture observatory in Korea as part of the establishment of a Korean cOsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (KOSMOS). The CRNP observation station was installed with the Gunup-ri observation station, considering the ease of securing power and installation sites and the efficient use of other hydro-meteorological factors. In order to evaluate the CRNP soil moisture data, 12 additional in-situ soil moisture sensors were installed, and spatial representativeness was evaluated through a temporal stability analysis. The neutrons generated by CRNP were found to be about 1,087 counts per hour on average, which was lower than that of the Solmacheon observation station, indicating that the Hongcheon observation station has a more humid environment. Soil moisture was estimated through neutron correction and early-stage calibration of the observed neutron data. The CRNP soil moisture data showed a high correlation with r=0.82 and high accuracy with root mean square error=0.02 m(3)/m(3) in validation with in-situ data, even in a short calibration period. It is expected that higher quality soil moisture data production with greater accuracy will be possible after recalibration with the accumulation of annual data reflecting seasonal patterns. These results, together with previous studies that verified the excellence of CRNP soil moisture data, suggest that high-quality soil moisture data can be produced when constructing KOSMOS.

TI  - Geolocation Accuracy Validation of High-Resolution SAR Satellite Images Based on the Xianning Validation Field
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geolocation accuracy of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for their application in various industries. Five high-resolution SAR satellites, namely ALOS, TerraSAR-X, Cosmo-SkyMed, RadarSat-2, and Chinese YG-3, provide a vast amount of image data for research purposes, although their geometric accuracies differ despite similar resolutions. To evaluate and compare the geometric accuracy of these satellites under the same ground control reference, a validation field was established in Xianning, China. The rational function model (RFM) was used to analyze the geometric performance of the five satellites based on the Xianning validation field. The study showed that each image could achieve sub-pixel positioning accuracy in range and azimuth direction when four ground control points (GCPs) were placed in the corners, resulting in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.5 pixels. The study also highlighted the effectiveness of an automated GCP-matching approach to mitigate manual identification of points in SAR images, and results demonstrate that the five SAR satellite images can all achieve sub-pixel positioning accuracy in range and azimuth direction when four GCPs are used. Overall, the verification results provide a reference for SAR satellite systems' designs, calibrations, and various remote sensing activities.

TI  - Sub-Pixel Surface Water Mapping for Heterogeneous Areas from Sentinel-2 Images: A Case Study in the Jinshui Basin, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping high-spatial-resolution surface water bodies in urban and suburban areas is crucial in understanding the spatial distribution of surface water. Although Sentinel-2 images are popular in mapping water bodies, they are impacted by the mixed-pixel problem. Sub-pixel mapping can predict finer-spatial-resolution maps from the input remote sensing image and reduce the mixed-pixel problem to a great extent. This study proposes a sub-pixel surface water mapping method based on morphological dilation and erosion operations and the Markov random field (DE_MRF) to predict a 2 m resolution surface water map for heterogeneous regions from Sentinel-2 imagery. DE_MRF first segments the normalized difference water index image to extract water pixels and then detects the mixed pixels by using combined morphological dilation and erosion operations. For the mixed pixels, DE_MRF considers the intra-pixel spectral variability by extracting multiple water endmembers and multiple land endmembers within a local window to generate the water fraction images through spectral unmixing. DE_MRF was evaluated in the Jinshui Basin, China. The results suggested that DE_MRF generated a lower commission error rate for water pixels compared to the comparison methods. Because DE_MRF considers the intra-class spectral variabilities in the unmixing, it is better in mapping sub-pixel water distribution in heterogeneous regions where different water bodies with distinct spectral reflectance are present.

TI  - Lithium-bearing Pegmatite Exploration in Western Altun, Xinjiang, using Remote-Sensing Technology
T2  - ACTA GEOLOGICA SINICA-ENGLISH EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Western Altun in Xinjiang is an important area, where lithium (Li)-bearing pegmatites have been found in recent years. However, the complex terrain and harsh environment of western Altun exacerbates in prospecting for Li-bearing pegmatites. Therefore, remote-sensing techniques can be an effective means for prospecting Li-bearing pegmatites. In this study, the fault information and lithologyical information in the region were obtained using the median-resolution remote-sensing image Landsat-8, the radar image Sentinel-1 and hyperspectral data GF-5. Using Landsat-8 data, the hydroxyl alteration information closely related to pegmatite in the region was extracted by principal component analysis, pseudo-anomaly processing and other methods. The high spatial resolution remote-sensing data WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 short-wave infrared images were used and analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA), the band ratio method and multi-class machine learning (ML), combined with conventional thresholds specified the algorithms used to automatically extract Li-bearing pegmatite information. Finally, the Li-bearing pegmatite exploration area was determined, based on a comprehensive analysis of the faults, hydroxyl alteration lithology and Li-bearing pegmatite information. Field investigations have verified that the distribution of pegmatites in the central part of the study area is consistent with that of Li-bearing pegmatites extracted in this study. This study provides a new technique for prospecting Li-bearing pegmatites, which shows that remote-sensing technology possesses great potential for identifying lithium-bearing pegmatites, especially in areas that are not readily accessible.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring Model of Tobacco Growth and Yield Based on Ecological Process and Carbon Cycle
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOBASED MATERIALS AND BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tobacco growth monitoring and yield estimation are very important for tobacco planting control and allocation. However, traditional tobacco yield estimation models have not considered the light energy utilization, carbon cycle, and ecological processes, resulting in the mechanisms poorly explained and the reduced monitoring accuracy. To address these limitations, a tobacco yield remote sensing monitoring model based on ecological process and carbon cycle was proposed. The model couples the Carbon Exchange between Vegetation, Soil, and Atmosphere (CEVSA) ecosystem process model and the global production efficiency model (GLO-PEM), to simulate effective solar radiation and tobacco light energy utilization, stress effects of surface air temperature, water vapour pressure deficit and photosynthetic effective radiation. Then the tobacco gross primary production (GPP), net primary productivity (NPP), tobacco biomass were estimated. Finally, the tobacco yield estimation model based on the correlation between tobacco yield and NPP was proposed. The results showed that there was a significant correlation (correlation = 0.94) between NPP and tobacco leaves weight IP: 203.8.109.20 On: Tue, 13 Jun 2023 06:25:21 at 99% confidence level, andtheCopyright:yieldAmericanestimated bytheScientificremotePublisherssensing monitoring model was in good agreement with the measured results, with errors of Clss I, II, III were 9.644%, 4.316%, and Delivered by Ingenta 8.495% respectively. In conclusion, the proposed model can be used to estimate tobacco yield, support decision-making of tobacco planting plan, and strengthen purchasing management.

TI  - Forest Fire Patterns and Lightning-Caused Forest Fire Detection in Heilongjiang Province of China Using Satellite Data
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Large forest fires can cause significant damage to forest ecosystems and threaten human life and property. Heilongjiang Province is a major forested area in China with the highest number and concentration of lightning-caused forest fires in the country. This study examined the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of forest fires in Heilongjiang Province, as well as the ability of satellite remote sensing to detect these fires using VIIRS 375 m fire point data, ground history forest fire point data, and land cover dataset. The study also investigated the occurrence patterns of lightning-caused forest fires and the factors affecting satellite identification of these fires through case studies. Results show that April has the highest annual number of forest fires, with 77.6% of forest fires being caused by lightning. However, less than 30% of forest fires can be effectively detected by satellites, and lightning-caused forest fires account for less than 15% of all fires. There is a significant negative correlation between the two. Lightning-caused forest fires are concentrated in the Daxing'an Mountains between May and July, and are difficult to monitor by satellites due to cloud cover and lack of satellite transit. Overall, the trend observed in the number of forest fire pixels that are monitored by satellite remote sensing systems is generally indicative of the trends in the actual number of forest fires. However, lightning-caused forest fires are the primary cause of forest fires in Heilongjiang Province, and satellite remote sensing is relatively weak in monitoring these fires due to weather conditions and the timing of satellite transit.

TI  - A Preliminary Analysis of Ki-67 Expression in Breast Cancer in the Caribbean.
T2  - Cureus
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There has been a void of data regarding Ki-67 expression in breast cancer in the Caribbean. Ki-67 is a widely used marker to determine the grade and prognosis of breast cancer. Ki-67 has been shown to be a valuable tool in predicting the response to chemotherapy and hormonal therapy in breast cancer patients.The objective of this preliminary study aims to describe the Ki-67 (Ki) status in this population and its correlations with other parameters in breast cancer histology. This study also aims to lay the groundwork for Ki-67 analysis in this population so that future studies may better describe it.METHOD: The methodology involved gathering data from histology reports for all breast cancer-related biopsies from the 1st of January 2018 to the 12th of July 2021. This data was retrospectively analyzed.RESULTS: Twenty-three Ki-67 cases were obtained, 19 of which had Ki expression >10%. This >10% group was mostly staged from T1c up (one T1, three T1c cases, two T2 cases, four T3 cases while nine were not T staged). Two were N2/M1 while 9 were N0 and two were M0, the rest werenot staged. The mean age was 65.6 years with a range of 54 and a standard deviation of 12.5. Lymphovascular invasion was confirmed in four cases and suspected in three. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) yielded >10 nodes involved in two cases while <5 nodes in the remaining. The most common receptor status was hormone positive/ human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER) negative (eight). Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) occurred in 10 cases while intermediate grade was in 14 cases. The Ki 6-10 % group consisted of two cases, one staged at T1aN0Mx while the other T2NxMx. Lymphovascular invasion was suspected in one. The average age was 67.5 years. ALND yielded less than five nodes in one case and 5-10 nodes in the other. Grades were high and intermediate. Histology was invasive ductal carcinoma/ductal carcinoma in situ (IDC/DCIS), and ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS) respectively. The Ki <6% group comprised two cases, staged at T1NxMx and T3N2M1. Lymphovascular invasion was absent in both. The mean age was 58.5 years. ALND yielded >10 nodes in one case and <5 in the other.Grades were high and intermediate. Histology was IDC/DCIS in both. There were no sentinel nodes involved in all but two cases belonging to the Ki >10% group.CONCLUSION: This preliminary study was the first to describe the Ki-67 marker in the Caribbean population. The vast majority of this population has a Ki-67 level of>10%. Higher Ki-67 expression is associated with larger tumors, lymphovascular invasion, metastases, and higher tumor grades. There is a need for consistent Ki-67 reporting in histology samples before follow-up studies are conducted.

TI  - Constitutive secretion of pro-IL-18 allows keratinocytes to initiate inflammation during bacterial infection
T2  - PLOS PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Group A Streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes) is a professional human pathogen that commonly infects the skin. Keratinocytes are one of the first cells to contact GAS, and by inducing inflammation, they can initiate the earliest immune responses to pathogen invasion. Here, we characterized the proinflammatory cytokine repertoire produced by primary human keratinocytes and surrogate cell lines commonly used in vitro. Infection induces several cytokines and chemokines, but keratinocytes constitutively secrete IL-18 in a form that is inert (pro-IL-18) and lacks proinflammatory activity. Canonically, IL-18 activation and secretion are coupled through a single proteolytic event that is regulated intracellularly by the inflammasome protease caspase-1 in myeloid cells. The pool of extracellular pro-IL-18 generated by keratinocytes is poised to sense extracellular proteases. It is directly processed into a mature active form by SpeB, a secreted GAS protease that is a critical virulent factor during skin infection. This mechanism contributes to the proinflammatory response against GAS, resulting in T cell activation and the secretion of IFN-gamma. Under these conditions, isolates of several other major bacterial pathogens and microbiota of the skin were found to not have significant IL-18-maturing ability. These results suggest keratinocyte-secreted IL-18 is a sentinel that sounds an early alarm that is highly sensitive to GAS, yet tolerant to non-invasive members of the microbiota.Author summaryTimely and appropriate inflammation is critical for an effective immune response against an invading pathogen. Some immune effectors are stored in an inert form that is enzymatically activated. This can allow for responses much more rapidly than transcriptionally regulation, on the order of minutes. An important regulator of these rapid responses is the inflammasome, which among its activities, processes the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-18 into truncated forms that gain the ability to bind their cognate receptors. These cytokines are typically stored intracellularly until activation, but human keratinocytes constitutively secrete IL-18 in its unprocessed form. We show that this pool of IL-18 initiates an immune response to the human pathogen group A Streptococcus, but not non-pathogens. Mechanistically, this occurs from IL-18 cleavage by SpeB, a major virulence factor that is required for tissue invasion. Keratinocytes live in close association with diverse microbes and face a challenge in selectively responding to pathogens while tolerating normal microbiota. Our findings outline a strategy for discriminating species with high virulence potential through their use of proteolytic virulence factors and IL-18 as bait.

TI  - Remote-Sensing Data and Deep-Learning Techniques in Crop Mapping and Yield Prediction: A Systematic Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Reliable and timely crop-yield prediction and crop mapping are crucial for food security and decision making in the food industry and in agro-environmental management. The global coverage, rich spectral and spatial information and repetitive nature of remote sensing (RS) data have made them effective tools for mapping crop extent and predicting yield before harvesting. Advanced machine-learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL), can accurately represent the complex features essential for crop mapping and yield predictions by accounting for the nonlinear relationships between variables. The DL algorithm has attained remarkable success in different fields of RS and its use in crop monitoring is also increasing. Although a few reviews cover the use of DL techniques in broader RS and agricultural applications, only a small number of references are made to RS-based crop-mapping and yield-prediction studies. A few recently conducted reviews attempted to provide overviews of the applications of DL in crop-yield prediction. However, they did not cover crop mapping and did not consider some of the critical attributes that reveal the essential issues in the field. This study is one of the first in the literature to provide a thorough systematic review of the important scientific works related to state-of-the-art DL techniques and RS in crop mapping and yield estimation. This review systematically identified 90 papers from databases of peer-reviewed scientific publications and comprehensively reviewed the aspects related to the employed platforms, sensors, input features, architectures, frameworks, training data, spatial distributions of study sites, output scales, evaluation metrics and performances. The review suggests that multiple DL-based solutions using different RS data and DL architectures have been developed in recent years, thereby providing reliable solutions for crop mapping and yield prediction. However, challenges related to scarce training data, the development of effective, efficient and generalisable models and the transparency of predictions should be addressed to implement these solutions at scale for diverse locations and crops.

TI  - Atmosphere-Ocean Processes Governing Inflow to the Northern Caribbean Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface currents entering the northern Caribbean from the Atlantic are described using ocean reanalysis at monthly to daily timescales, underpinned by satellite data assimilation. Statistical analyses involved spatial clustering into current vector modes with associated time scores for quantifying spectral power and regression onto atmospheric fields. Inflow across the Anegada, Mona, Windward (AMW) Passages peaks at similar to 100 m depth at similar to 0.2 m/s during summer and pulses at periods of 45, 100, and 365 days, and at 3, 6.5 years. The intra-seasonal periods may relate to Madden-Julian Oscillations and westward ocean Rossby waves, while inter-annual periods associate with regional climate anomalies. An empirical orthogonal function analysis demonstrates that AMW inflow varies across multiple timescales and is enhanced when the subtropical high-pressure ridge penetrates into the western Caribbean. A case study reveals key features during a surge of inflow to the northern Caribbean. Marine climate change involves heat advected poleward by currents along the western edge of the tropical Atlantic, fed through the Caribbean Sea. Consequently, the study of inflows garners wide interest.

TI  - Forest Structure Characterization in Germany: Novel Products and Analysis Based on GEDI, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring forest conditions is an essential task in the context of global climate change to preserve biodiversity, protect carbon sinks and foster future forest resilience. Severe impacts of heatwaves and droughts triggering cascading effects such as insect infestation are challenging the semi-natural forests in Germany. As a consequence of repeated drought years since 2018, large-scale canopy cover loss has occurred calling for an improved disturbance monitoring and assessment of forest structure conditions. The present study demonstrates the potential of complementary remote sensing sensors to generate wall-to-wall products of forest structure for Germany. The combination of high spatial and temporal resolution imagery from Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR) and Sentinel-2 (multispectral) with novel samples on forest structure from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI, LiDAR, Light detection and ranging) enables the analysis of forest structure dynamics. Modeling the three-dimensional structure of forests from GEDI samples in machine learning models reveals the recent changes in German forests due to disturbances (e.g., canopy cover degradation, salvage logging). This first consistent data set on forest structure for Germany from 2017 to 2022 provides information of forest canopy height, forest canopy cover and forest biomass and allows estimating recent forest conditions at 10 m spatial resolution. The wall-to-wall maps of the forest structure support a better understanding of post-disturbance forest structure and forest resilience.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of lake chlorophyll-<i>a</i> with combined in situ and satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimated chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration using various combinations of routine sampling, automatic station measurements, and MERIS satellite images. Our study site was the northern part of the large, shallow, mesotrophic Lake Pyhajarvi located in southwestern Finland. Various combinations of measurements were interpolated spatiotemporally using a data fusion system (DFS) based on an ensemble Kalman filter and smoother algorithms. The estimated concentrations together with corresponding 68% confidence intervals are presented as time series at routine sampling and automated stations, as maps and as mean values over the EU Water Framework Directive monitoring period, to evaluate the efficiency of various monitoring methods. The mean Chl-a calculated with DFS in June-September was 6.5-7.5 mu g/l, depending on the observations used as input. At the routine monitoring station where grab samples were used, the average uncertainty (standard deviation, SD) decreased from 2.7 to 1.6 mu g/l when EO data were also included in the estimation. At the automatic station, located 0.9 km from the routine monitoring site, the SD was 0.7 mu g/l. The SD of spatial mean concentration decreased from 6.7 to 2.9 mu g/l when satellite observations were included in June-September, in addition to in situ monitoring data. This demonstrates the high value of the information derived from satellite observations. The conclusion is that the confidence of Chl-a monitoring could be increased by deploying spatially extensive measurements in the form of satellite imaging or transects conducted with flow-through sensors installed on a boat and spatiotemporal interpolation of the multisource data.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Carbon Sequestration in Different Ecosystems of Iran and Its Relationship with Agricultural Droughts
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in environmental and human-related changes (e.g., increase in the carbon cycle flux of plants) has increased the dynamism of ecosystems. Examining fluctuations in net primary production (NPP) is very important in adopting correct strategies for ecosystem management. The current study explores the spatiotemporal variations in NPP and its association with agricultural droughts in Iran's ecosystems over 20 years (2000-2020). Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope methods in each pixel were used to track changes in trends. Drought upsets the terrestrial carbon cycle balance. In this study, Vegetation Health Index (VHI) used to assess drought that extracted from different bands of images satellite. Then, the relationship between NPP rates and agricultural droughts was investigated through running Pearson correlation. The results demonstrated that Iran's annual share of carbon sequestration is 1.38 kg*C/m(2)/year. The highest carbon sequestration rate was recorded in Caspian Hyrcanian forests. In contrast, the lowest rate was observed in the Arabian Desert and East Sahero-Arabian xeric shrublands in southwestern Iran. Moreover, the highest photosynthesis variations were recorded in Arabian Desert and East Sahero-Arabian xeric shrublands and Tigris-Euphrates alluvial salt marsh, while the lowest changes were registered in Badghyz and Karabil. In total, 34.2% of the studied pixels showed a statistically significant rising or falling trend. Sen's slope estimator demonstrated that the sharpest negative trend in carbon sequestration belonged to Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests (-12.24 g*C/m(2)/year), while the sharpest positive trend was observed in Azerbaijan shrub desert and steppe (12.29 g*C/m(2)/year). The results of the Pearson correlation revealed significant correlations between NPP and VHI in different ecosystems with coefficients ranging from -0.93 to 0.95. The largest area with a positive correlation (33.97%) belonged to the Zagros Mountains forest steppe. Identification of areas with the greatest carbon sequestration changes could result in prioritizing varied ecosystems management for carbon sequestering. It can be also utilized in environmental planning such as scaling up ecosystem values or estimating current and past ecological capacity.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Classification of Asbestos-Containing Roofs Using Airborne RGB and Thermal Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting asbestos-containing roofs has been of great interest in the past few years as the substance negatively affects human health and the environment. Different remote sensing data have been successfully used for this purpose. However, RGB and thermal data have yet to be investigated. This study aims to investigate the classification of asbestos-containing roofs using RGB and airborne thermal data and state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) classification techniques. With the rapid development of ML reflected in this study, we evaluate three classifiers: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We have used several image enhancement techniques to produce additional bands to improve the classification results. For feature selection, we used the Boruta technique; based on the results, we have constructed four different variations of the dataset. The results showed that the most important features for asbestos-containing roof detection were the investigated spectral indices in this study. From a ML point of view, SVM outperformed RF and XGBoost in the dataset using only the spectral indices, with a balanced accuracy of 0.93. Our results showed that RGB bands could produce as accurate results as the multispectral and hyperspectral data with the addition of spectral indices.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy after nipple-sparing mastectomy in early postoperative period: Is it feasible?
T2  - Indian journal of cancer
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node status is one of the most important prognostic factors for breast cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after mastectomy is highly controversial. There is not enough data about SLNB in the early period after nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM). This study investigated the feasibility of SLNB in the early postoperative period of NSM.Materials and Methods: Patients who were operated on for breast cancer in Acibadem Maslak Hospital between 2009 and 2018 were searched retrospectively. Results of SLNB as the second session in patients whose final pathology report revealed breast carcinoma after contralateral/bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and mastectomy for benign lesions were evaluated.Results: In the early period (median 14 days) after NSM, SLNB was performed by intradermal radioisotope injection in five patients with occult breast cancer in contralateral/bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and in one patient with preoperatively suspicious mass which yielded breast cancer at final pathology. In five (80%) patients, SLNB was performed, whereas in one patient axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed due to the undetectability of SLN. In one patient, micrometastasis was observed, whereas no metastasis was observed in other patients including the one who underwent ALND. No complication due to SLNB was detected. No recurrence and distant metastasis were detected in a mean follow-up of 42.82 (19-70) months. While SLNB did not change the treatment of patients with contralateral occult carcinoma, other patients had hormonal therapy due to negative SLNB.Conclusion: SLNB in the early postoperative period of NSM can be performed by intradermal radioisotope injection. However, further studies are needed to determine the feasibility of SLNB in the early postoperative period of NSM.

TI  - The Role of Axillary SUVmax in 18F-FDG PET/CT in Predicting the Number of Axillary Metastases of Breast Cancer
T2  - JCPSP-JOURNAL OF THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS PAKISTAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the role of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET-CT) in determining the maximum number of axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) detectable in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Study Design: Observational study.Place and Duration of the Study: Sivas Cumhuriyet University Faculty of Medicine, Turkiye, from January 2015 to August 2021.Methodology: A total of 104 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery after a PET-CT scan were examined. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was utilised to determine optimal cut-off values for the standardised uptake values of the primary tumour (pSUVmax) and axillary lymph nodes (nSUVmax) in the presence of ALNM and the presence of more than two ALNMs.Results: The presence of more than two ALNMs was associated with pSUVmax, nSUVmax, LVI, and the number of LNs detected on PET-CT. In the ROC analysis, for the ability to predict more than two ALNMs in SLNB/axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), cut-offvalues were calculated as 4.65 for pSUVmax (AUC=0.669, sensitivity=66.7%, specificity=62%, PPV=0.482, NPV=0.800, p=0.006) and 1.75 for nSUVmax (AUC=0.838, sensitivity=81.8%, specificity=88.7%, PPV= 0.676, NPV=0.913, p<0.001).Conclusion: Low sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy values that limit the use of PET-CT in preoperative axillary evaluation can be increased by targeting the criterion of more than two ALNMs. Thus, PET-CT can be used more effectively in axilla management.

TI  - The Development of Dark Hyperspectral Absolute Calibration Model Using Extended Pseudo Invariant Calibration Sites at a Global Scale: Dark EPICS-Global
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aimed to develop a novel dark hyperspectral absolute calibration (DAHAC) model using stable dark targets of "Global Cluster-36" (GC-36), one of the clusters from the "300 Class Global Classification". The stable dark sites were identified from GC-36 called "Dark EPICS-Global" covering the surface types viz. dark rock, volcanic area, and dark sand. The Dark EPICS-Global shows a temporal variation of 0.02 unit reflectance. This work used the Landsat-8 (L8) Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2A (S2A) Multispectral Instrument (MSI), and Earth Observing One (EO-1) Hyperion data for the DAHAC model development, where well-calibrated L8 and S2A were used as the reference sensors, while EO-1 Hyperion with a 10 nm spectral resolution was used as a hyperspectral library. The dark hyperspectral dataset (DaHD) was generated by combining the normalized hyperspectral profile of L8 and S2A for the DAHAC model development. The DAHAC model developed in this study takes into account the solar zenith and azimuth angles, as well as the view zenith and azimuth angles in Cartesian coordinates form. This model is capable of predicting TOA reflectance in all existing spectral bands of any sensor. The DAHAC model was then validated with the Landsat-7 (L7), Landsat-9 (L9), and Sentinel-2B (S2B) satellites from their launch dates to March 2022. These satellite sensors vary in terms of their spectral resolution, equatorial crossing time, spatial resolution, etc. The comparison between the DAHAC model and satellite measurements showed an accuracy within 0.01 unit reflectance across the overall spectral band. The proposed DAHAC model uncertainty level was determined using Monte Carlo simulation and found to be 0.04 and 0.05 unit reflectance for the VNIR and SWIR channels, respectively. The DAHAC model double ratio was used as a tool to perform the inter-comparison between two satellites. The sensor inter-comparison results for L8 and L9 showed a 2% difference and 1% for S2A and S2B across all spectral bands.

TI  - Multi-Source Mapping of Peatland Types Using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Terrain Derivatives-A Comparison Between Five High-Latitude Landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping wetland types in northern-latitude regions with Earth Observation (EO) data is important for several practical and scientific applications, but at the same time challenging due to the variability and dynamic nature in wetland features introduced by differences in geophysical conditions. The objective of this study was to better understand the ability of Sentinel-1 radar data, Sentinel-2 optical data and terrain derivatives derived from Copernicus digital elevation model to distinguish three main peatland types, two upland classes, and surface water, in five contrasting landscapes located in the northern parts of Alaska, Canada and Scandinavia. The study also investigated the potential benefits for classification accuracy of using regional classification models constructed from region-specific training data compared to a global classification model based on pooled reference data from all five sites. Overall, the results show high promise for classifying peatland types and the three other land cover classes using the fusion approach that combined all three EO data sources (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and terrain derivatives). Overall accuracy for the individual sites ranged between 79.7% and 90.3%. Class specific accuracies for the peatland types were also high overall but differed between the five sites as well as between the three classes bog, fen and swamp. A key finding is that regional classification models consistently outperformed the global classification model by producing significantly higher classification accuracies for all five sites. This suggests for progress in identifying effective approaches for continental scale peatland mapping to improve scaling of for example, hydrological- and greenhouse gas-related processes in Earth system models.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapidly changing LULC scenario with growing population is of great concern in the modern world. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the changes in LULC pattern in Ramgarh-Naudiha region of Sonbhadra district, UP, over 20 years during 1998-2018 using datasets from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) 5 and Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) satellites. LULC map for the chosen period has been generated by unsupervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm. Results indicate that the study area is vulnerable to such LULC changes due to its sensitive geographic location. It is found that the major changes did happen in agriculture, forest, wasteland and water bodies. Agriculture and Forest areas have decreased by similar to 2 and 6.56% respectively in the study period. The wastelands had increased fast from 5.08% in 1998 to 18.87% in 2018 at the cost of the forest cover and agricultural land respectively. In 1998, water bodies were 7.49%, whereas, it has decreased to 2.04% in 2018. On the contrary, urban fringe area has grown from 0.33% in 1998 to 0.49% in 2018 especially due to population growth. The present study concludes that this LULC analysis will increase awareness and help in taking necessary action in appropriate land use planning and management.

TI  - Combining Digital Covariates and Machine Learning Models to Predict the Spatial Variation of Soil Cation Exchange Capacity
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is a soil property that significantly determines nutrient availability and effectiveness of fertilizer applied in lands under different managements. CEC's accurate and high-resolution spatial information is needed for the sustainability of agricultural management on farms in the Nagaland state (northeast India) which are fragmented and intertwined with the forest ecosystem. The current study applied the digital soil mapping (DSM) methodology, based on the CEC values determined in soil samples obtained from 305 points in the region, which is mountainous and difficult to access. Firstly, digital auxiliary data were obtained from three open-access sources, including indices generated from the time series Landsat 8 OLI satellite, topographic variables derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), and the WorldClim dataset. Furthermore, the CEC values and the auxiliary were used data to model Lasso regression (LR), stochastic gradient boosting (GBM), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) machine learning (ML) algorithms were systematically compared in the R-Core Environment Program. Model performance were evaluated with the square root mean error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R-2), and mean absolute error (MAE) of 10-fold cross-validation (CV). The lowest RMSE was obtained by the RF algorithm with 4.12 cmol(c) kg(-1), while the others were in the following order: SVR (4.27 cmol(c) kg(-1)) <KNN (4.45 cmol(c) kg(-1)) <LR (4.67 cmol(c) kg(-1)) <GBM (5.07 cmol(c) kg(-1)). In particular, WorldClim-based climate covariates such as annual mean temperature (BIO-1), annual precipitation (BIO-12), elevation, and solar radiation were the most important variables in all algorithms. High uncertainty (SD) values have been found in areas with low soil sampling density and this finding is to be considered in future soil surveys.

TI  - Routine cerebral embolic protection in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: rationale and design of the randomised British Heart Foundation PROTECT-TAVI trial
T2  - EUROINTERVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established treatment for aortic stenosis. Cerebral embolic protection (CEP) devices may impact periprocedural stroke by capturing debris destined for the brain. However, there is a lack of high-quality randomised trial evidence supporting the use of CEP during TAVI. The British Heart Foundation (BHF) PROTECT-TAVI trial will address whether the routine use of CEP reduces the incidence of stroke in patients undergoing TAVI. BHF PROTECT-TAVI is a prospective, open-label, outcome-adjudicated, multicentre randomised controlled trial. The trial is open to all adult patients scheduled for TAVI at participating specialist cardiac centres across the United Kingdom who are able to receive the CEP device. The trial will recruit 7,730 participants. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to undergo TAVI with CEP or TAVI without CEP (standard of care). The primary outcome is the incidence of stroke at 72 hours post-TAVI. Key secondary outcomes include the incidence of stroke and all-cause mortality up to 12 months post-TAVI, disability and cognitive outcomes, stroke severity, access site complications and a health economics analysis. The sample size of 7,730 participants has 80% power to detect a 33% relative risk reduction from a 3% incidence of the primary outcome in the controls. Trial recruitment commenced in October 2020. As of October 2022, 3,068 patients have been enrolled. BHF PROTECT-TAVI is designed to provide definitive evidence on the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of using routine CEP with the SENTINEL device to reduce stroke in TAVI.

M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal variability of forest floor moisture characteristics is analyzed on the basis of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Indices (CFFWIS) for the territory of Western Siberia (45 & DEG;-75 & DEG; N, 60 & DEG;-90 & DEG; E) over 2016-2021 for the first time. The floor moisture effect on the number of wildfires (hotspots) during the warm season (March-October) is assessed. The results are given for different natural zones. Statistically significant correlations are found between hotspots and floor moisture at a depth of 7 cm only in certain spring and summer months (correlation coefficient is up to 0.54). The strongest effect (correlation coefficient is up to 0.60) on wildfires is observed for floor moisture at a depth of 1.2 cm in the south of Western Siberia in April. Thus, we can conclude that the forest floor moisture is an important parameter in description of conditions for fire initiation and development. However, its effect on the behavior of wildfires requires additional studies with accounting for meteorological and atmospheric conditions. The results can be used for forecasting the potential fire danger.

T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN SOCIETY FOR ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, machine learning technique was applied by using PM10, PM2.5 and air quality data acquired from Urban Air Monitoring Network and Meteorological data acquired from Automated Synoptic Observing System (ASOS) and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), & ANGS;ngstrom Exponent (AE) data acquired from the ground-based Sun-sky radiometer (AERONET) observation network or Satellite data (MODIS). For the determination of the best machine learning (ML) model, four ML techniques such as Multi Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Deep Neural Network (DNN) were tested and compared accuracy using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R2, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Since the error range can be presented according to the diversity and variability of input data and ML, it is possible to compare the prediction accuracy of each model or determine the optimal prediction model. We also proved the assumption that more accurate results can be obtained by the optimized ML technique having the lowest error rate. The results showed that optimized ML model has the accuracy of 81.27% for PM10 concentration prediction and 73.25% for PM2.5 concentration prediction. It is expected that expanded air quality information through the using of ML based PM concentration prediction with the remote sensing data.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Assessing the metastasis status of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) for hematoxylin and eosin-stained frozen tissue sections by pathologists is an essential but tedious and time-consuming task that contributes to accurate breast cancer staging. This study aimed to review a challenge competition (HeLP 2019) for the development of automated solutions for classifying the metastasis status of breast cancer patients.Materials and Methods A total of 524 digital slides were obtained from frozen SLN sections: 297 (56.7%) from Asan Medical Center (AMC) and 227 (43.4%) from Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH), South Korea. The slides were divided into training, development, and validation sets, where the development set comprised slides from both institutions and training and validation set included slides from only AMC and SNUBH, respectively. The algorithms were assessed for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and measurement of the longest metastatic tumor diameter. The final total scores were calculated as the mean of the two metrics, and the three teams with AUC values greater than 0.500 were selected for review and analysis in this study.Results The top three teams showed AUC values of 0.891, 0.809, and 0.736 and major axis prediction scores of 0.525, 0.459, and 0.387 for the validation set. The major factor that lowered the diagnostic accuracy was micro-metastasis.Conclusion In this challenge competition, accurate deep learning algorithms were developed that can be helpful for making a diagnosis on intraoperative SLN biopsy. The clinical utility of this approach was evaluated by including an external validation set from SNUBH.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the ability of Sentinel-1 polarimetric and backscatter attributes in relation to COSMO-SkyMed (CSM) texture and backscatter features to discriminate secondary vegetation areas in an Amazon Forest domain area, located in Mato Grosso state. In this study, we used polarizations VV and VH from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image and HH from CSM SAR image, both in Single Look Complex format. In the Sentinel-1 image, a covariance matrix was generated and the H-Alpha target decomposition theorem was applied, allowing to obtain the attributes Entropy and Angle alpha. In the CSM image obtained the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture attributes: dissimilarity, contrast, homogeneity and second moment. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used for the classification. The Sentinel-1 polarimetric attributes result, with a Kappa index of 0.70 and an overall accuracy of 79.58%, performed better than those derived from CSM, with a Kappa index of 0.56 and overall accuracy 63.67%. However, the Sentinel-1 and CSM attributes did not present satisfactory results to discriminate the different stages of secondary forest.

T2  - Georgian medical news
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Deciphering the mutational pattern of skin tumours, remains a major challenge for clinicians and researchers. Over 80% of mutations in tumours are acquired, which in practice also means preventable. The surgical treatment of skin cancer and cancer in general is a worldwide, unsolved but at the same time not unsolvable problem. The problem concerning the dilemma of acquired mutations lies in the circumstance of their being allowed and subsequently treated. A more logical solution would be to eliminate the problem by making contact with mutagens in drugs public, clarifying it, studying it in detail and definitively stopping it. At present, there is an alarming and unexplained tendency worldwide : 1) Potential acquired mutations, caused in all probability by contact with known exogenous mutagens- the nitrosamines in most commonly prescribed drugs, are allowed to occur. 2) And subsequently, the diseases generated by them- treated (at a later stage) by multiple surgical interventions and unjustifiably expensive targeted therapy; 3) Mutagens - such as nitrosamines for example, to be in a permissive or possibly permissive availability regime. Moreover, this permissible availability turns out to be ubiquitous and affects the most common medicines worldwide: metformin, ranitidine, propranolol, rifampicin, irbesartan, olmesartan, valsartan, telmisartan, eprosartan, losartan, ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, etc. In certain geographical regions, there is almost no patient taking this type of medication who has not had at least one tumour detected. These significant correlations (nitrosamines/cancer) are labeled by the regulatory institutions as possible, probable, or not currently relevant. But in spite of ˝this inconclusiveness˝, the drugs, containing nitrosamines, are withdrawn from the pharmaceutical market: quickly and quietly, despite the fact that ˝they did not pose a threat˝. The FDA was the only organization and the most important regulatory body worldwide, which lifted the veil from this ominous picture back in 2018: nitrosamines in blood medicines and cancer risk. Unfortunately, at the moment, the problems with this issue are proving to be more than the solutions, and at the same time it remains completely unclear who is to blame for this 'sporadic contamination': the packaging of the drug, the humidity in the rooms where the preparations are stored or the synthesis process itself - the explanations are divergent, the responsibility is blurred. This fuzzy liability does not affect the manufacturers and distributors of the preparations/nitrosamines themselves in the manner required by law for this (mis)act. The Bulgarian Society of Dermatological Surgery remains to be the only organization worldwide that for the 5th consecutive year continues to seek solutions to the above-mentioned problems by: 1) Officialising all cases of skin tumors (but not only) occurring after intake of nitrosamine-contaminated drugs, 2) also officialising a significant number of cases of patients with cutaneous melanomas treated by the one-stage surgical removal method within one surgical session (OSMS). The main priorities of the organization remain: 1) the complete elimination of nitrosamines from drugs worldwide, 2) the optimization of melanoma surgical treatment guidelines with the goal of treatment within 1 surgical session: for thin melanomas, dysplastic nevi and melanoma in situ, a surgical margin of safety of 1 cm in all directions and without detection and removal of the draining sentinel lymph node. Whereas for medium and thick melanomas, the focus should be directed to the following recommendation: 2 cm surgical margin of safety plus detection and removal of the draining lymph node within one surgical session. The indication for the surgical removal of these lesions should be made on the basis of radically different criteria from those used to date by the AJCC/EJC, namely: based on 1) clinical presentation/ clinical morphology, 2) dermatoscopic finding, and if there is a melanoma suspected lesion with possible tumour thickness greater than 1 mm , 3) ultrasonographic measurement for preoperative determination of tumor thickness should be additionally performed. The methodology is applicable in up to 80% of cases, excluding only some rare findings such as: amelanotic cutaneous melanomas, cutaneous melanomas with regression zones or those with localization in the neck and head. However, after careful individual assessment and a subsequent selected approach, even these exceptions could be included in the innovative algorithm for one step surgical removal of cutaneous melanomas. The resulting problems of not resolving these two dilemmas could lead to: 1) Generation of skin cancer (but not only), through the availability of nitrosamines in drugs. 2) Unnecessary and stressful /surgeries for the patients- 2 in number, which not infrequently lead to complication of their status (due to delay of histopathological analysis/ desire for second opinion/ delay regarding the timeframe for the second surgical intervention/ uncertainty regarding the resection lines within the first intervention/ failure to respect the recommended surgical security resection margins already within the first surgical session, etc.). 3) Huge additional costs to health care systems on the order of probably/roughly calculated about $50 billion per year. Resolution of these two dilemmas would likely result in a dramatic drop in cancer incidence worldwide and a significant improvement in the effectiveness/efficiency of surgical treatment for cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - Syphilis screening coverage and positivity by HIV treatment status among South African pregnant women enrolled in the 2019 antenatal HIV sentinel survey
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe coverage of maternal syphilis screening, syphilis positivity, coverage of treatment and their association with maternal HIV infection and antiretroviral treatment (ART) status among pregnant women attending South African antenatal clinics. The 2019 antenatal care sentinel survey was a cross-sectional survey conducted from 1 October to 15 November 2019 at 1589 sentinel sites in all nine provinces of the country and aimed to enrol 36,000 pregnant women ages 15-49 years regardless of HIV, ART or syphilis status. Data collection procedures included obtaining written informed consent, a brief interview, medical record review and blood specimen collection. Completed data collection forms and specimens were sent to designated regional laboratories for data capture and HIV serology testing. Data analysis determined four outcomes i) syphilis screening coverage ii) syphilis positivity iii) coverage of any treatment and iv) with Benzathine penicillin G (BPG). Multivariable logistic regression models with or without interaction between HIV infection and ART status with province were used to determine factors associated with syphilis positivity. Of the 41 598 women enrolled, 35 900 were included in the analysis for syphilis screening coverage. The weighted syphilis screening coverage was 96.4% [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 95.9-96.7%] nationally and was lowest among HIV positive women not on ART at 93.5% (95% CI 92.2-94.5%). Syphilis positivity was 2.6% (95% CI 2.4-2.9%) nationally. Among those who were syphilis positive, 91.9% (95% CI 89.8-93.7%) had documentation of syphilis treatment status, of whom 92.0% (95% CI 89.8-93.9%) were treated, with the majority treated with one or more doses of BPG [92.2% (95% CI 89.8-94.3%)]. HIV-positive women, not on ART [adjusted odd ratio (aOR) 2.24 (95% 1.71-2.93)] and those on ART [aOR 2.25 (95% CI 1.91-2.64)] were more likely to be syphilis positive compared to those who were HIV negative. The national syphilis screening coverage met the global screening target of 95%. Syphilis positivity was higher among HIV positive women compared to negative women. Introduction of rapid syphilis testing and ensuring a universal supply of appropriate treatment for syphilis will reduce the likelihood of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis.

TI  - A Framework for Assessment of Flood Conditions Using Hydrological and Hydrodynamic Modeling Approach
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - River flooding has been triggering significant damage to lives and infrastructure and is a major worry all around the globe. To lessen these losses, proper planning and management methods need to be deployed. The purpose of this research is to fill a knowledge gap on the effects of reservoirs operation of the Idukki and Idamalyar to Periyar River Basin massive flooding. The proposed methodology is implemented on the Periyar River Basin located in Kerala, India, where severe flooding occurred during monsoon season in the year 2018. In this study, modelling technique has been used in two-step: (1) development of 1D physically based, distributed-parameter model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT) to compute the stream flow and estimate the stream discharge at different outlet points; and (2) hybrid model is developed by linking SWAT with a well-known 2D hydrodynamic model (International River Interface Cooperative, iRIC) to display flood scenarios and to identify the flood-prone areas. The ArcSWAT user interface employed in the ArcGIS software was utilized to delineate the river basin. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated on daily and monthly basis at two gauge discharge stations, i.e., Neeleeswaram and Kalady. The statistical coefficients result obtained from SWAT model was in good agreement with the measured values for calibration and validation. The hybrid model simulation results compared with observed flood depth and remote sensing data demonstrated good capability of the model. Agreeable performances of computed results were observed in both flow fields and flood propagations. The result was compared with 2018 flood to check model accuracy and found to be satisfactory. The proposed framework can be utilized as an effective tool for efficient planning and management of natural disasters, such as flash floods.

TI  - Assessment of the Breaching Event, Breach Parameters and Failure Mechanisms of the Spillway Collapse in the Swa Dam, Myanmar
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The spillway of the Swa earthen dam, constructed in Yedashe Township, Bago Region, Myanmar, collapsed suddenly on 29 August 2018 and resulted in a huge flood to downstream areas causing fatalities and the displacement of thousands of localities. This study aimed to assess the spillway breaching process in terms of the breaching parameters such as the average breach width, failure time and peak outflow, and failure mechanisms. We analyzed the event from the changes in the study site before and after the event and used water discharge conditions from satellite data and water level records during the event. We compared the breaching parameters using empirical equations from past failed events with tested scenarios for failure mechanisms, such as overtopping and piping. According to satellite data, 97% of the storage from the reservoir was discharged, and the peak breach outflow rate was 7643 m(3)/s calculated from the water level records. The selected empirical formulas were applied, and the estimated average breach widths, failure times and peak discharge from the formulas were larger in overtopping and nearer in piping than that of the observed data for the Swa Dam. Thus, a concrete spillway might impact the erodibility rate of breaching compared with concrete-faced and earthen dam types.

TI  - Tracking the Source of Human Q Fever from a Southern French Village: Sentinel Animals and Environmental Reservoir
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coxiella burnetii, also known as the causal agent of Q fever, is a zoonotic pathogen infecting humans and several animal species. Here, we investigated the epidemiological context of C. burnetii from an area in the Herault department in southern France, using the One Health paradigm. In total, 13 human cases of Q fever were diagnosed over the last three years in an area comprising four villages. Serological and molecular investigations conducted on the representative animal population, as well as wind data, indicated that some of the recent cases are likely to have originated from a sheepfold, which revealed bacterial contamination and a seroprevalence of 47.6%. However, the clear-cut origin of human cases cannot be ruled out in the absence of molecular data from the patients. Multi-spacer typing based on dual barcoding nanopore sequencing highlighted the occurrence of a new genotype of C. burnetii. In addition, the environmental contamination appeared to be widespread across a perimeter of 6 km due to local wind activity, according to the seroprevalence detected in dogs (12.6%) and horses (8.49%) in the surrounding populations. These findings were helpful in describing the extent of the exposed area and thus supporting the use of dogs and horses as valuable sentinel indicators for monitoring Q fever. The present data clearly highlighted that the epidemiological surveillance of Q fever should be reinforced and improved.

TI  - Monitoring and Mapping Floods and Floodable Areas in the Mekong Delta (Vietnam) Using Time-Series Sentinel-1 Images, Convolutional Neural Network, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Random Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The annual flood cycle of the Mekong Basin in Vietnam plays an important role in the hydrological balance of its delta. In this study, we explore the potential of the C-band of Sentinel-1 SAR time series dual-polarization (VV/VH) data for mapping, detecting and monitoring the flooded and flood-prone areas in the An Giang province in the Mekong Delta, especially its rice fields. Time series floodable area maps were generated from five images per month taken during the wet season (6-7 months) over two years (2019 and 2020). The methodology was based on automatic image classification through the application of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and random forests (RFs). Based on the segmentation technique, a three-level classification algorithm was developed to generate maps of the development of floods and floodable areas during the wet season. A modification of the backscatter intensity was noted for both polarizations, in accordance with the evolution of the phenology of the rice fields. The results show that the CNN-based methods can produce more reliable maps (99%) compared to the MLP and RF (97%). Indeed, in the classification process, feature extraction based on segmentation and CNNs has demonstrated an effective improvement in prediction performance of land use land cover (LULC) classes, deriving complex decision boundaries between flooded and non-flooded areas. The results show that between 53% and 58% of rice paddies areas and 9% and 14% of built-up areas are affected by the flooding in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Our methodology and results could support the development of the flood monitoring database and hazard management in the Mekong Delta.

TI  - The Moral Foundations of Left-Wing Authoritarianism: On the Character, Cohesion, and Clout of Tribal Equalitarian Discourse
T2  - JOURNAL OF COGNITION AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Left-wing authoritarianism remains far less understood than right-wing authoritarianism. We contribute to literature on the former, which typically relies on surveys, using a new social media analytic approach. We use a list of 60 terms to provide an exploratory sketch of the outlines of a political ideology -tribal equalitarianism - with origins in igth and 20th century social philosophy. We then use analyses of the English Corpus of Google Books (n > 8 million books) and scraped unique tweets from Twitter (n = 202,582) to conduct a series of investigations to discern the extent to which this ideology is cohesive amongst the public, reveals signatures of authoritarianism and has been growing in popularity. Though exploratory, our results provide some evidence of left-wing authoritarianism in two forms: (i) a uniquely conservative signature amongst ostensible liberals using measures derived from Moral Foundations Theory and (2) a substantial prevalence of anger, relative to anxiety or sadness, in tweets analyzed for sentiment. In general, results indicate that this worldview is growing in popularity, is increasingly cohesive, and shows signatures of authoritarianism.

TI  - Exploring the Use of Orthophotos in Google Earth Engine for Very High-Resolution Mapping of Impervious Surfaces: A Data Fusion Approach in Wuppertal, Germany
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Germany aims to reduce soil sealing to under 30 hectares per day by 2030 to address negative environmental impacts from the expansion of impervious surfaces. As cities adapt to climate change, spatially explicit very high-resolution information about the distribution of impervious surfaces is becoming increasingly important for urban planning and decision-making. This study proposes a method for mapping impervious surfaces in Google Earth Engine (GEE) using a data fusion approach of 0.9 m colour-infrared true orthophotos, digital elevation models, and vector data. We conducted a pixel-based random forest (RF) classification utilizing spectral indices, Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix texture features, and topographic features. Impervious surfaces were mapped with 0.9 m precision resulting in an Overall Accuracy of 92.31% and Kappa-Coefficient of 84.62%. To address challenges posed by high-resolution imagery, we superimposed the RF classification results with land use data from Germany's Authoritative Real Estate Cadastre Information System (ALKIS). The results show that 25.26% of the city of Wuppertal is covered by impervious surfaces coinciding with a government-funded study from 2020 based on Sentinel-2 Copernicus data that defined a proportion of 25.22% as built-up area. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for semi-automated mapping of impervious surfaces in GEE to support urban planning on a local to regional scale.

TI  - Land use-land cover change in the Tano basin, Ghana and the implications on sustainable development goals
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The changes in land use and land cover (LULC) contribute to carbon emissions that lead to climate change and global warming. Obtaining information on LULC change is of necessity to ensure land transformation planning, and anthropogenic and natural impact evaluation. The objective of this study is to analyze the historical changes in LULC in the Tano River Basin of Ghana, to provide scientific information for decision-making on achieving sustainable development. A supervised classification of Landsat images (1986, 2010, and 2020) using the Random Forest algorithm was performed, as well as a post-classification comparison of LULC maps in terms of area and size. A "from-to" matrix was used to identify the changes in LULC that occurred between the periods 1986-2010, 2010-2020, and 1986-2020. The results show an overall classification accuracy of 88.9, 88.5, and 88% for LULC maps for the years 1986, 2010, and 2020, respectively. Between the period 1986 and 2020, there is a conversion of the greater part of dense forest to open forest, and subsequently to settlement and cropland as a major historical LULC change pattern in the Tano basin. Cropland and Settlement increased at the rate of 24.8 km/yr and 1.5 km/yr respectively, while Dense forest and Open forest decreased at the rate of 298.4 km/yr and 173.9 km/yr over the period 1986 to 2020. The study outputs are not only useful for formulating and implementing national policies and programs but also, can contribute to assessing and monitoring progress towards attaining Sustainable Development Goal 13 (climate action).

TI  - A Cloud Detection Neural Network Approach for the Next Generation Microwave Sounder Aboard EPS MetOp-SG A1
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents an algorithm based on a neural network (NN) for cloud detection to detect clouds and their thermodynamic phase using spectral observations from spaceborne microwave radiometers. A standalone cloud detection algorithm over the ocean and land has been developed to distinguish clear sky versus ice and liquid clouds from microwave sounder (MWS) observations. The MWS instrument-scheduled to be onboard the first satellite of the Eumetsat Polar System Second-Generation (EPS-SG) series, MetOp-SG A1-has a direct inheritance from advanced microwave sounding unit A (AMSU-A) and the microwave humidity sounder (MHS) microwave instruments. Real observations from the MWS sensor are not currently available as its launch is foreseen in 2024. Thus, a simulated dataset of atmospheric states and associated MWS synthetic observations have been produced through radiative transfer calculations with ERA5 real atmospheric profiles and surface conditions. The developed algorithm has been validated using spectral observations from the AMSU-A and MHS sounders. While ERA5 atmospheric profiles serve as references for the model development and its validation, observations from AVHRR cloud mask products provide references for the AMSU-A/MHS model evaluation. The results clearly show the NN algorithm's high skills to detect clear, ice and liquid cloud conditions against a benchmark. In terms of overall accuracy, the NN model features 92% (88%) on the ocean and 87% (85%) on land, for the MWS (AMSU-A/MHS)-simulated dataset, respectively.

TI  - Mapping Tree Species Using CNN from Bi-Seasonal High-Resolution Drone Optic and LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the importance of forests has increased, continuously monitoring and managing information on forest ecology has become essential. The composition and distribution of tree species in forests are essential indicators of forest ecosystems. Several studies have been conducted to classify tree species using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms because of the constraints of the traditional approach for classifying tree species in forests. In the machine learning approach, classification accuracy varies based on the characteristics and quantity of the study area data used. Thus, applying various classification models to achieve the most accurate classification results is necessary. In the literature, patch-based deep learning (DL) algorithms that use feature maps have shown superior classification results than point-based techniques. DL techniques substantially affect the performance of input data but gathering highly explanatory data is difficult in the study area. In this study, we analyzed (1) the accuracy of tree classification by convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based DL models with various structures of CNN feature extraction areas using a high-resolution LiDAR-derived digital surface model (DSM) acquired from a drone platform and (2) the impact of tree classification by creating input data via various geometric augmentation methods. For performance comparison, the drone optic and LiDAR data were separated into two groups according to the application of data augmentation, and the classification performance was compared using three CNN-based models for each group. The results demonstrated that Groups 1 and CNN-1, CNN-2, and CNN-3 were 0.74, 0.79, and 0.82 and 0.79, 0.80, and 0.84, respectively, and the best mode was CNN-3 in Group 2. The results imply that (1) when classifying tree species in the forest using high-resolution bi-seasonal drone optical images and LiDAR data, a model in which the number of filters of various sizes and filters gradually decreased demonstrated a superior classification performance of 0.95 for a single tree and 0.75 for two or more mixed species; (2) classification performance is enhanced during model learning by augmenting training data, especially for two or more mixed tree species.

TI  - Estimation of actual carbon dioxide removal in burned forests using satellite data: A case study in South Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing impact of climate change, carbon emissions and removals have become major issues. Forests are major carbon pools, and forest fires are an essential part of the carbon cycle. This study introduces a model for estimating the detailed actual CO2 removal in burned forests using burn severity and tree survivability. Actual CO2 removal was estimated from empirical yield tables without using the standard carbon removal provided by the national inventory. The primary CO2 calculation method followed the guidelines of the International Panel on Climate Change. The burn severity was mapped using Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument data, and the survivability of each forest type was estimated according to burn severity. The survivability was applied to the pre-fire CO2 removal of each forest to estimate post-fire CO2 removal. In our case study, the burned forest area was 1,034 ha, and the CO2 removal before the fire was 8,615.3 t/year. After the fire, removal decreased by 81.2% to 1,618.4 t/yr. In particular, the decrease in coniferous forests was high, more than 86%. The lack of survivability data on burned trees was a major limitation of our study. Systematically accumulating field monitoring data of post-fire forests will be necessary for future research and could serve as a reference for devising immediate countermeasures against forest fires.

TI  - Intelligent reflecting surface-aided Doppler compensation for Low-Earth orbit satellite networks: Joint power allocation and passive beamforming optimisation
T2  - IET SIGNAL PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the reduction in costs of manufacture and launch of Low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, LEO satellite communication (SATCOM) has become a promising solution to provide high data rates and low latency connectivity for future communications. However, due to the fast movement of LEO satellites, it has to face a large Doppler effect, leading to high inter-carrier interference (ICI) power and severe received symbol error rate. To tackle this problem, a novel optimisation framework is proposed that boosts the achievable rate in LEO SATCOM networks by utilising passive beamforming of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to compensate for the Doppler effect. First, a carrier-to-interference-noise ratio (CINR) was derived for each subcarrier and a joint optimisation problem of both power allocation is formulated to each subcarrier and passive beamforming of IRS. Moreover, a simultaneous iterative-water-filling-algorithm (SIWFA) and semidefinite programing (SDP) are utilised, thereby striking a balance that minimises ICI power and maximises desired signal power. Numerical results demonstrate the superior achievable rate performance of the proposed IRS-aided Doppler compensation for LEO SATCOM networks compared to benchmark schemes.

TI  - Monitoring and Prediction of Smoke Emitted from the Large Explosion Accident: 2015 Tianjin Explosion Case
T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN SOCIETY FOR ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing data with a trajectory modelling have been a valuable tool for severe aerosol event monitoring. In this study, we present the results of explosion smoke monitoring for large accident in Tianjin, China by using the combination of geostationary satellite observation data and forward trajectory analysis. The integrated analysis with the continuous satellite detected smoke data and matching forward trajectories, airmass transport patterns for the smoke aerosol plume. Explosion smoke detection based on the Himawari-8 observation data using infrared brightness temperature difference technique was used as input to the forward trajectory analysis by the HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. These integrated analysis for China's Tianjin explosion in 12 August 2015 reveals remarkable spatial coherence for source-transport pattern. The result showed that the forward trajectories of explosion smoke are consistent with the area of satellite detected smoke plume. The success rate of the 24 hour smoke forecast result was about 92.68% in this study. These results support the feasibility of using the integration of satellite observed and model derived data for emergency monitoring and forecasting.

TI  - Improvement of GOCI-II Water Vapor Absorption Correction through Fusion with GK-2A/AMI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing of the ocean color, in particular, in coarse-resolution global model simulations, atmospheric trace gases including water vapor are generally treated as auxiliary data, which create uncertainties in atmospheric correction. The second Korean geostationary satellite mission, Geo-Kompsat 2 (GK-2), is unique in combining visible and infrared observations from the second geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI-II) and the advanced meteorological imager (AMI) over Asia and the Pacific Ocean. In this study, we demonstrate that AMI total precipitable water (TPW) data to allow realistic water vapor absorption correction of GOCI-II color retrievals for the ocean. We assessed the uncertainties of two candidate TPW products for GOCI-II atmospheric correction using atmospheric sounding data, and then analyzed the sensitivity of four ocean-color products (remote sensing reflectance [Rrs], chlorophyll-a concentration [CHL], colored dissolved organic matter [CDOM], and total suspended sediment [TSS]) for GOCI-II water vapor transmittance correction using AMI and global model data. Differences between the TPW sources increased the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of Rrs from 2.97% to 6.43% in the blue to green bands, higher than the global climate observing system requirements (<5%) at 412 nm. By contrast, MAPE values of 3.53%, 6.18%, and 7.71% were increased to 6.63%, 13.53%, and 16.14% at high sun and sensor zenith angles for CHL, CDOM, and TSS, respectively. Uncertainty analysis provided similar results, indicating that AMI TPW produced approximately 3-fold lower error rates in ocean-color products than obtained using TPW values from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. These results imply that AMI TPW can improve the accuracy and ability of GOCI-II ocean-color products to capture diurnal variability.

TI  - Recognizing the Wadi Fluvial Structure and Stream Network in the Qena Bend of the Nile River, Egypt, on Landsat 8-9 OLI Images
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With methods for processing remote sensing data becoming widely available, the ability to quantify changes in spatial data and to evaluate the distribution of diverse landforms across target areas in datasets becomes increasingly important. One way to approach this problem is through satellite image processing. In this paper, we primarily focus on the methods of the unsupervised classification of the Landsat OLI/TIRS images covering the region of the Qena governorate in Upper Egypt. The Qena Bend of the Nile River presents a remarkable morphological feature in Upper Egypt, including a dense drainage network of wadi aquifer systems and plateaus largely dissected by numerous valleys of dry rivers. To identify the fluvial structure and stream network of the Wadi Qena region, this study addresses the problem of interpreting the relevant space-borne data using R, with an aim to visualize the land surface structures corresponding to various land cover types. To this effect, high-resolution 2D and 3D topographic and geologic maps were used for the analysis of the geomorphological setting of the Qena region. The information was extracted from the space-borne data for the comparative analysis of the distribution of wadi streams in the Qena Bend area over several years: 2013, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2022, and 2023. Six images were processed using computer vision methods made available by R libraries. The results of the k-means clustering of each scene retrieved from the multi-temporal images covering the Qena Bend of the Nile River were thus compared to visualize changes in landforms caused by the cumulative effects of geomorphological disasters and climate-environmental processes. The proposed method, tied together through the use of R scripts, runs effectively and performs favorably in computer vision tasks aimed at geospatial image processing and the analysis of remote sensing data.

TI  - Computing Vegetation Indices from the Satellite Images Using GRASS GIS Scripts for Monitoring Mangrove Forests in the Coastal Landscapes of Niger Delta, Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the issue of the satellite image processing using GRASS GIS in the mangrove forests of the Niger River Delta, southern Nigeria. The estuary of the Niger River Delta in the Gulf of Guinea is an essential hotspot of biodiversity on the western coast of Africa. At the same time, climate issues and anthropogenic factors affect vulnerable coastal ecosystems and result in the rapid decline of mangrove habitats. This motivates monitoring of the vegetation patterns using advanced cartographic methods and data analysis. As a response to this need, this study aimed to calculate and map several vegetation indices (VI) using scripts as advanced programming methods integrated in geospatial studies. The data include four Landsat 8-9 OLI/TIRS images covering the western segment of the Niger River Delta in the Bight of Benin for 2013, 2015, 2021, and 2022. The techniques included the 'i.vi', 'i.landsat.toar' and other modules of the GRASS GIS. Based on the GRASS GIS 'i.vi' module, ten VI were computed and mapped for the western segment of the Niger River Delta estuary: Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI), Green Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (GARI), Green Vegetation Index (GVI), Difference Vegetation Index (DVI), Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI), Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Second Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI2), Infrared Percentage Vegetation Index (IPVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The results showed variations in the vegetation patterns in mangrove habitats situated in the Niger River Delta over the last decade as well as the increase in urban areas (Onitsha, Sapele, Warri and Benin City) and settlements in the Delta State due to urbanization. The advanced techniques of the GRASS GIS of satellite image processing and analysis enabled us to identify and visualize changes in vegetation patterns. The technical excellence of the GRASS GIS in image processing and analysis was demonstrated in the scripts used in this study.

TI  - Research on Air-Conditioning Cooling Load Correction and Its Application Based on Clustering and LSTM Algorithm
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and urban heat island effects affect the energy consumption of buildings in urban heat islands. In order to meet the requirements of engineering applications for detailed daily design parameters for air conditioning, the 15-year summer meteorological data for Beijing and Shanghai and the corresponding average heat island intensity data were analyzed. Using the CRITIC objective weighting method and K-means clustering analysis, the hourly change coefficient, beta, of dry bulb temperature was calculated, and the LSTM algorithm was used to predict the changing trends in beta. Finally, the air conditioning load model for a hospital was established using DeST (version DeST3.0 1.0.2107.14 20220712) software, and the air conditioning cooling load in summer was calculated and predicted. The results show that, compared with the original design days, regional differences in the new design days are more obvious, the maximum temperature and time have changed, and the design days parameters are more consistent with the local meteorological conditions. Design day temperatures in Shanghai are expected to continue rising for some time to come, while those in Beijing are expected to gradually return to previous levels. Among hospital buildings, the cooling load of outpatient buildings in Beijing and Shanghai will decrease by 0.69% and increase by 12.61% and by 12.12% and 15.51%, respectively, under the influence of the heat island effect. It is predicted to decrease by 1.35% and increase by 29.75%, respectively, in future. The cooling load of inpatient buildings in Beijing and Shanghai increased by 0.27% and 6.71%, respectively, and increased by 7.13% and 8.09%, respectively, under the influence of the heat island effect, and is predicted to decrease by 0.93% and increase by 16.07%, respectively, in future.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Bias Correction of Precipitation Measurements at High Altitude
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate precipitation measurements are essential for understanding hydrological processes in high-altitude regions. Conventional gauge measurements often yield large underestimations of actual precipitation, prompting the development of statistical methods to correct the measurement bias. However, the complex conditions at high altitudes pose additional challenges to the statistical methods. To improve the correction of precipitation measurements in high-altitude areas, we selected the Yakou station, situated at an altitude of 4147 m on the Tibetan plateau, as the study site. In this study, we employed the machine learning method XGBoost regression to correct precipitation measurements using meteorological variables and remote sensing data, including Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). Additionally, we examined the transferability of this method between different stations in our study site, Norway, and the United States. Our results show that the Yakou station experiences a large underestimation of precipitation, with a magnitude of 51.4%. This is significantly higher than similar measurements taken in the Arctic or lower altitudes. Furthermore, the remote sensing precipitation datasets underestimated precipitation when compared to the Double Fence Intercomparison Reference (DFIR) precipitation observation. Our findings suggest that the machine learning method outperformed the traditional statistical method in accuracy metrics and frequency distribution. Introducing remote sensing data, especially the GSMaP precipitation, could potentially replace the role of in situ wind speed in precipitation correction, highlighting the potential of remote sensing data for correcting precipitation rather than in situ meteorological observation. Moreover, our results indicate that the machine learning method with remote sensing data demonstrated better transferability than the traditional statistical method when we cross-validated the method with sites located in different countries. This study offers a promising strategy for obtaining more accurate precipitation measurements in high-altitude regions.

TI  - A New Method for Hour-by-Hour Bias Adjustment of Satellite Precipitation Estimates over Mainland China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly accurate near-real-time satellite precipitation estimates (SPEs) are important for hydrological forecasting and disaster warning. The near-real quantitative precipitation estimates (REGC) of the recently developed Chinese geostationary meteorological satellite Fengyun 4A (FY4A) have the advantage of high spatial and temporal resolution, but there are errors and uncertainties to some extent. In this paper, a self-adaptive ill-posed least squares scheme based on sequential processing (SISP) is proposed and practiced in mainland China to correct the real-time biases of REGC hour by hour. Specifically, the scheme adaptively acquires sample data by setting temporal and spatial windows and constructs an error-correction model based on the ill-posed least squares method from the perspectives of climate regions, topography, and rainfall intensity. The model adopts the sequential idea to update satellite precipitation data within time windows on an hour-by-hour basis and can correct the biases of real-time satellite precipitation data using dynamically changing parameters, fully taking into account the influence of precipitation spatial and temporal variability. Only short-term historical data are needed to accurately rate the parameters. The results show that the SISP algorithm can significantly reduce the biases of the original REGC, in which the values of relative bias (RB) in mainland China are reduced from 11.2% to 3.3%, and the values of root mean square error (RMSE) are also reduced by about 17%. The SISP algorithm has a better correction in humid and semi-humid regions than in arid and semi-arid regions and is effective in reducing the negative biases of precipitation in each climate region. In terms of rain intensity, the SISP algorithm can improve the overestimation of satellite precipitation estimates for low rain intensity (0.2-1 mm/h), but the correction for high rain intensity (>1 mm/h) needs further improvement. The error component analysis shows that the SISP algorithm can effectively correct the hit bias. This study serves as a valuable reference for real-time bias correction using short-term accumulated precipitation data.

TI  - MST-UNet: a modified Swin Transformer for water bodies' mapping using Sentinel-2 images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning is widely used in remote sensing field of feature recognition. Symmetric encoder-decoder network, such as UNet, is one of the most commonly used image segmentation networks, but the accuracy is often low due to its simple structure. We combine two neural network models of convolutional neural network (CNN) and Swin Transformer called modified Swin Transformer using UNet structure (MST-UNet) to achieve accurate segmentation of water bodies from remote sensing data, with Xiamen City as study area. MST-UNet is based on symmetric encoder-decoder network. We use CNN and Swin Transformer blocks to extract features from input images and capture the interdependence among different pixels, respectively. More attention is paid to global information of images. By four times upsampling to obtain predictions, the results show that the accuracy of MST-UNet is better than UNet and its improved models. The Intersection of Union (IoU), mean IoU, and Dice score on test set reach 87.80%, 92.93%, 93.08%, respectively, which verifies the feasibility of the MST-UNet. This experiment has a reference value for related studies.

AB  - The sustainable development of the water environment in the Yangtze River basin has become a critical issue in China. Turbidity is a comprehensive element for water quality monitoring. In this study, the baseline of water turbidity in the Yangtze River was constructed using 36 years of Landsat images from 1986 to 2021. The spatial and temporal dynamics of turbidity and its driving factors were explored. The results show that (i) the proposed Landsat-based turbidity model performs well, with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.68 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 7.83 NTU for the whole basin. (ii) The turbidity level in the Yangtze River basin is spatially high in the upper reaches (41.7 NTU), low in the middle reaches (30.9 NTU), and higher in the lower reaches (37.6 NTU). The river turbidity level (60.1 NTU) is higher than the turbidity in lakes and reservoirs (29.6 NTU). The turbidity in the Yangtze River basin shows a decreasing trend from 1986 to 2021, with the most significant decrease in the mainstream of the Yangtze River. Seasonally, the mean turbidity in the Yangtze River basin shows a "low in summer and high in winter" trend, but opposite trends were revealed for the first time in rivers and lakes, such as Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake, and Taihu Lake, etc. (iii) Natural factors, including precipitation and natural vegetation cover (woodlands, grasslands, and shrubs) could explain 58% of the turbidity variations, while human activities including impervious surfaces, cropland, and barren land are lower impact. Annual precipitation was negatively correlated with water turbidity, while cropland and barren land showed a significant positive correlation. The study is of great practical value for the sustainable development of the water environment in the Yangtze River basin and provides a reference for remote sensing monitoring of the water environment in inland water bodies.

TI  - Multiscale Entropy-Based Surface Complexity Analysis for Land Cover Image Semantic Segmentation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recognizing and classifying natural or artificial geo-objects under complex geo-scenes using remotely sensed data remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneity in their spatial distribution and sampling bias. In this study, we propose a deep learning method of surface complexity analysis based on multiscale entropy. This method can be used to reduce sampling bias and preserve entropy-based invariance in learning for the semantic segmentation of land use and land cover (LULC) images. Our quantitative models effectively identified and extracted local surface complexity scores, demonstrating their broad applicability. We tested our method using the Gaofen-2 image dataset in mainland China and accurately estimated multiscale complexity. A downstream evaluation revealed that our approach achieved similar or better performance compared to several representative state-of-the-art deep learning methods. This highlights the innovative and significant contribution of our entropy-based complexity analysis and its applicability in improving LULC semantic segmentations through optimal stratified sampling and constrained optimization, which can also potentially be used to enhance semantic segmentation under complex geo-scenes using other machine learning methods.

TI  - Deep Learning Application for Crop Classification via Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Images
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of multi-temporal images and deep learning is an efficient way to obtain accurate crop distributions and so has drawn increasing attention. However, few studies have compared deep learning models with different architectures, so it remains unclear how a deep learning model should be selected for multi-temporal crop classification, and the best possible accuracy is. To address this issue, the present work compares and analyzes a crop classification application based on deep learning models and different time-series data to exploit the possibility of improving crop classification accuracy. Using Multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images as source data, time-series classification datasets are constructed based on vegetation indexes (VIs) and spectral stacking, respectively, following which we compare and evaluate the crop classification application based on time-series datasets and five deep learning architectures: (1) one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs), (2) long short-term memory (LSTM), (3) two-dimensional-CNNs (2D-CNNs), (4) three-dimensional-CNNs (3D-CNNs), and (5) two-dimensional convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM2D). The results show that the accuracy of both 1D-CNN (92.5%) and LSTM (93.25%) is higher than that of random forest (similar to 91%) when using a single temporal feature as input. The 2D-CNN model integrates temporal and spatial information and is slightly more accurate (94.76%), but fails to fully utilize its multi-spectral features. The accuracy of 1D-CNN and LSTM models integrated with temporal and multi-spectral features is 96.94% and 96.84%, respectively. However, neither model can extract spatial information. The accuracy of 3D-CNN and ConvLSTM2D models is 97.43% and 97.25%, respectively. The experimental results show limited accuracy for crop classification based on single temporal features, whereas the combination of temporal features with multi-spectral or spatial information significantly improves classification accuracy. The 3D-CNN and ConvLSTM2D models are thus the best deep learning architectures for multi-temporal crop classification. However, the ConvLSTM architecture combining recurrent neural networks and CNNs should be further developed for multi-temporal image crop classification.

TI  - Wetland Evolution and Driving Force Analysis in the Qingtongxia Reservoir Area
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the combination of river disruption and irrational human activities has caused serious damage to wetlands. Based on long-time-series remote-sensing images, this study applied the land use transfer matrix and landscape index method to investigate the dynamic evolution and driving forces of the Qingtongxia wetland in the upper reaches of the Yellow River from 1999 to 2020. The results show that the land use types of Qingtongxia wetland changed insignificantly from 1999 to 2020, with the area of water and grassland decreasing and the area of reed wetland, beach, farmland and forest increasing. The spatial changes in the watershed changed the distribution of other land uses within the wetland, with the watershed concentrating in a southwest-northeast direction and shrinking in the southwestern part of the wetland area between years. From 1999 to 2011, the wetlands were restored, the landscape became less fragmented and simpler in shape and the dominant species developed significantly. From 2010 to 2020, the wetlands were disturbed and, as a new tourist destination, the planning and renovation work increased fragmentation and the complexity of the patches. The complexity of the patch shape increased, and, at the same time, with the implementation of various conservation measures, the development of the dominant species within recovered. The drivers of change in the different land use areas within the wetlands of the Qingtongxia reservoir are dominated by flow, and the drivers of the evolution of landscape patterns within the wetlands are closely related to the population and gross regional product, in addition to being influenced by flow. In recent years, increased fragmentation has been the main reason for the decline in bird habitat quality. Maintaining bird diversity in the wetlands of the Qingtongxia reservoir can be based on rational planning of the proportion of different land uses within the wetlands, reducing landscape fragmentation by limiting human activities in the corresponding areas, as well as appropriate flow control measures. This study provides some reference for biodiversity conservation within wetlands.

TI  - Multispectral Remote Sensing Monitoring of Soil Particle-Size Distribution in Arid and Semi-Arid Mining Areas in the Middle and Upper Reaches of the Yellow River Basin: A Case Study of Wuhai City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Particle size distribution is an important characteristic of reclaimed soil in arid and semi-arid mining areas in western China, which is important in the ecological environment protection and control of the Yellow River Basin. Large-scale coal resource mining disturbances have caused serious damage to the fragile ecological environment. The timely and accurate dynamic monitoring of mining area topsoil information has practical significance for ecological restoration and management evaluation. Investigating Wuhai City in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, this study uses Landsat8 OLI multispectral images and measured soil sample particle size data to analyze soil spectral characteristics and establish a particle size content prediction model to retrieve the particle size distribution in the study area. The experimental results and analysis demonstrate that: (1) the 6SV (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum Vector version) atmospheric correction model is more accurate than the FLAASH (Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes) model in arid and semi-arid areas with undulating terrain; (2) 0-40 cm is the optimum soil thickness for modeling and predicting particle size content in this study; and (3) the multi-band prediction model is more precise than the single-band prediction model. The multi-band model's sequence of advantages and disadvantages is SVM (Support Vector Machine) > MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) > PLSR (Partial Least Squares Regression). Among them, the 6SV-SVM model has the highest precision, and the prediction precision R-2 of the 3 particle sizes' contents is above 0.95, which can effectively predict the soil particle-size distribution and provide effective data to support topsoil quality change monitoring in the mine land reclamation area.

TI  - Mapping Groundwater Prospective Areas Using Remote Sensing and GIS-Based Data Driven Frequency Ratio Techniques and Detecting Land Cover Changes in the Yellow River Basin, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is an essential resource that meets all of humanity's daily water demands, supports industrial development, influences agricultural output, and maintains ecological equilibrium. Remote sensing data can predict the location of potential water resources. The current study was conducted in China's Yellow River region, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR). Through the use of a GIS-based frequency ratio machine learning technique, nine layers of evidence influenced by remote sensing data were generated and integrated. The layers used are soil characteristics, aspect, and roughness index of the terrain, drainage density, elevation, lineament density, depressions, rainfall, and distance to the river from the location. Six groundwater prospective zones (GWPZs) were found to have very low (13%), low (30%), moderate (25%), high (16%), very high (11%), and extreme potentiality (5.26%) values. According to well data used to validate the GWPZs map, approximately 40% of the wells are consistent to very high to excellent zones. Information about groundwater productivity was gathered from 150 well locations. Using well data that had not been used for model training, the resulting GWPZs maps were validated using area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis. FR models have an accuracy rating of 0.759. Landsat data were used to characterize the study area's changes in land cover. The spatiotemporal differences in land cover are detected and quantified using multi-temporal images which revealed changes in water, agricultural, and anthropogenic activities. Overall, combining different data sets through a GIS can reveal the promising areas of water resources that aid planners and managers.

TI  - Large-Eddy Simulations of Marine Boundary Layer Clouds Associated with Cold-Air Outbreaks during the ACTIVATE Campaign. Part II: Aerosol-Meteorology-Cloud Interaction
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol effects on micro/macrophysical properties of marine stratocumulus clouds over the western North Atlantic Ocean (WNAO) are investigated using in situ measurements and large-eddy simulations (LES) for two cold-air outbreak (CAO) cases (28 February and 1 March 2020) during the Aerosol Cloud Meteorology Interactions over the Western Atlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE). The LES is able to reproduce the vertical profiles of liquid water content (LWC), effective radius reff and cloud droplet number concentration Nc from fast cloud droplet probe (FCDP) in situ measurements for both cases. Furthermore, we show that aerosols affect cloud properties (Nc, reff, and LWC) via the pre-scribed bulk hygroscopicity of aerosols (K) and aerosol size distribution characteristics. Nc, reff, and liquid water path (LWP) are positively correlated to K and aerosol number concentration (Na) while cloud fractional cover (CFC) is insensi-tive to K and aerosol size distributions for the two cases. The realistic changes to aerosol size distribution (number concen-tration, width, and the geometrical diameter) with the same meteorology state allow us to investigate aerosol effects on cloud properties without meteorological feedback. We also use the LES results to evaluate cloud properties from two rean-alysis products, ERA5 and MERRA-2. Compared to LES, the ERA5 is able to capture the time evolution of LWP and total cloud coverage within the study domain during both CAO cases while MERRA-2 underestimates them.

TI  - Comparison of different noncontrast computed tomographic markers for predicting early perihematomal edema expansion in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) imaging markers are associated with early perihematomal edema (PHE) growth. The aim of this study was to compare the predictive value of different NCCT markers in predicting early PHE expansion.Methods: ICH patients who underwent baseline CT scan within 6 h of symptoms onset and follow-up CT scan within 36 h between July 2011 and March 2017 were included in this study. The predictive value of hypodensity, satellite sign, heterogeneous density, irregular shape, blend sign, black hole sign, island sign and expansion -prone hematoma for early perihematomal edema expansion were assessed, separately.Results: 214 patients were included in our final analysis. After adjusting for ICH characteristics, hypodensity, blend sign, island sign and expansion-prone hematoma are still predictors of early perihematomal edema expansion in multivariable logistics regression analysis (all P < 0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of expansion-prone hematoma was significantly larger than the area under the ROC curve of hypodensity, blend sign and island sign in predicting PHE expansion (P = 0.003, P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively).Conclusion: Compared with single NCCT imaging markers, expansion-prone hematoma seems to be optimal predictor for early PHE expansion than any single NCCT imaging marker.

TI  - First Results from the WindRAD Scatterometer on Board FY-3E: Data Analysis, Calibration and Wind Retrieval Evaluation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - FY-3E WindRAD (Fengyun-3E Wind Radar) is a dual-frequency rotating fan-beam scatterometer. Its data characteristics, NOC (NWP Ocean Calibration), and wind retrieval performance are investigated in this paper. The diversity of the radar view geometry varies across the swaths, with maximum diversity in the sweet swaths and limited diversity in the outer and nadir swaths. When NOC backscatter calibration coefficients are computed as a function of incidence angle only (NOCint), a smooth correction is found. However, when relative antenna azimuth angle is included (NOCant), it appears that the corrections as a function of relative azimuth angle vary harmonically and substantially for a specific incidence angle. NOCant corrections yield a better fit of the measurements to the GMF (Geophysical Model Function). Hence, NOCant is applied for the analysis of wind retrieval from the Ku-band and C-band. An extra engineering correction of 0.15 dB and 0.20 dB is applied on Ku-band and C-band backscatter values, respectively, to reduce the wind speed bias without increasing the standard deviation. Overall, NOCant is the best option for both channels. In addition, the instrument backscatter data stability over time is good, and the retrieved winds can fulfill operational requirements.

TI  - Optimized image registration algorithm at subpixel level for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Advanced Baseline Imager navigation and registration performance assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The image navigation and registration (INR) performance assessment for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is an image registration process at the subpixel level, which involves the registration of images from GOES-R ABI with corresponding images from Landsat at the same scene. We present an optimized image registration algorithm for GOES-R ABI INR performance assessment (GAIPA): a gradient descent algorithm with a Sobel edge-enhancement procedure and a normalized lookup table (NLUT) image transformation (GDSN), which is an area-based image registration approach with Pearson correlation as the similarity metric. Sobel edge enhancements increase the sensitivity of Pearson correlations that lead to much improved registration accuracy. NLUT transformations minimize radiance differences between GOES-R ABI images acquired at different times and Landsat reference images on image registration outcomes, which lead to improvements in correlation values and quality of image registration outputs. Evaluations of registration accuracy and quality metrics in GDSN show considerable improvements in computational efficiency, registration accuracy, and quality over the approach implemented on the image INR performance assessment tool set. Pearson correlations can be effective and robust similarity metrics in image registration at the subpixel level with implementing Sobel edge enhancement and NLUT transformation. The statistical analysis of the image registration outputs for GAIPA shows the new algorithm provides considerable improvements in reducing the uncertainties in the registration outputs.

TI  - Retrospective Cohort Study on the Long-term Oncologic Outcomes of Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping Methods (Dye-Only versus Dye and Radioisotope Mapping) in Early Breast Cancer: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose In sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) during breast cancer surgery, SLN mapping using dye and isotope (DUAL) may have lower false-negative rates than the dye-only (DYE) method. However, the long-term outcomes of either method are unclear. We aimed to compare long-term oncological outcomes of DYE and DUAL for SLNB in early breast cancer.Materials and Methods This retrospective single-institution cohort study included 5,795 patients (DYE, 2,323; DUAL, 3,472) with clinically node-negative breast cancer who underwent SLNB and no neoadjuvant therapy. Indigo carmine was used for the dye meth-od and Tc99m-antimony trisulfate for the isotope. To compare long-term outcomes, pathologic N0 patients were selected from both groups, and propensity score matching (PSM), considering age, pT category, breast surgery, and adjuvant treatment, was performed (1,441 patients in each group).Results The median follow-up duration was 8.7 years. The median number of harvested sentinel nodes was 3.21 and 3.12 in the DYE and DUAL groups, respectively (p=0.112). The lymph node-positive rate was not significantly different between the two groups in subgroups of similar tumor sizes (p > 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the mapping method was not significantly associated with the lymph node-positive rate (p=0.758). After PSM, the 5-year axillary recurrence rate (DYE 0.8% vs. DUAL 0.6%, p=0.096), and 5-year disease-free survival (DYE 93.9% vs. DUAL 93.7%, p=0.402) were similar between the two groups.Conclusion Dye alone for SLNB was not inferior to dual mapping regarding long-term oncological outcomes in early breast cancer.

TI  - Challenges of Retrieving LULC Information in Rural-Forest Mosaic Landscapes Using Random Forest Technique
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) information plays a crucial role in determining the trend of the global carbon cycle in various fields, such as urban land planning, agriculture, rural management, and sustainable development, and serves as an up-to-date indicator of forest changes. Accurate and reliable LULC information is needed to address the detailed changes in conservation-based and development-based classes. This study integrates Sentinel-2 multispectral surface reflectance and vegetation indices, and lidar-based canopy height and slope to generate a random forest model for 3-level LULC classification. The challenges for LULC classification by RF approach are discussed by comparing it with the SVM model. To summarize, the RF model achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.79 and a macro F1-score of 0.72 for the Level-III classification. In contrast, the SVM model outperformed the RF model by 0.04 and 0.09 in OA and macro F1-score, respectively. The accuracy difference increased to 0.89 vs. 0.96 for OA and 0.79 vs. 0.91 for macro F1-score for the Level-I classification. The mapping reliability of the RF model for different classes with nearly identical features was challenging with regard to precision and recall measures which are both inconsistent in the RF model. Therefore, further research is needed to close the knowledge gap associated with reliable and high thematic LULC mapping using the RF classifier.

TI  - Identification of Tree Species in Forest Communities at Different Altitudes Based on Multi-Source Aerial Remote Sensing Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate identification of forest tree species is important for forest resource management and investigation. Using single remote sensing data for tree species identification cannot quantify both vertical and horizontal structural characteristics of tree species, so the classification accuracy is limited. Therefore, this study explores the application value of combining airborne high-resolution multispectral imagery and LiDAR data to classify tree species in study areas of different altitudes. Three study areas with different altitudes in Muyu Town, Shennongjia Forest Area were selected. Based on the object-oriented method for image segmentation, multi-source remote sensing feature extraction was performed. The recursive feature elimination algorithm was used to filter out the feature variables that were optimal for classifying tree species in each altitude study area. Four machine learning algorithms, SVM, KNN, RF, and XGBoost, were combined to classify tree species at each altitude and evaluate the accuracy. The results show that the diversity of tree layers decreased with the altitude in the different study areas. The texture features and height features extracted from LiDAR data responded better to the forest community structure in the different study areas. Coniferous species showed better classification than broad-leaved species within the same study areas. The XGBoost classification algorithm showed the highest accuracy of 87.63% (kappa coefficient of 0.85), 88.24% (kappa coefficient of 0.86), and 84.03% (kappa coefficient of 0.81) for the three altitude study areas, respectively. The combination of multi-source remote sensing numbers with the feature filtering algorithm and the XGBoost algorithm enabled accurate forest tree species classification.

TI  - Reprocessed MODIS Version 6.1 Leaf Area Index Dataset and Its Evaluation for Land Surface and Climate Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based leaf area index (LAI) products, such as the MODIS LAI, play an essential role in land surface and climate modeling research, from regional to global scales. However, data gaps and high-level noise can exist, thus limiting their applications to a broader scope. Our previous work has reprocessed the MODIS LAI Collection 5 (C5) product, and the reprocessed data have been widely used these years. In this study, the MODIS C6.1 LAI data were reprocessed to broaden its application as a successor. We updated the integrated two-step method that is used for MODIS C5 LAI and implemented it into the MODIS C6.1 LAI product. Comprehensive evaluations for the original and reprocessed products were conducted. The results showed that the reprocessed LAI data had better performance in validation against reference maps. In addition, the site scale time series of reprocessed data was much smoother and more consistent with adjacent values. The global scale comparison showed that, though the MODIS C6.1 LAI does have improvements in ground validation with LAI reference maps, its spatial continuity, temporal continuity, and consistency showed little improvement when compared to C5. In contrast, the reprocessed data were more spatiotemporally continuous and consistent. Based on this evaluation, some suggestions for using various MODIS LAI products were given. This study assessed the quality of these different versions of MODIS LAI products and demonstrated the improvement of the reprocessed C6.1 data, which we recommended for use as a substitute for the reprocessed C5 data in land surface and climate modeling.

TI  - Fuzzy Geospatial Object-Based Membership Function Downscaling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The area-to-point kriging method (ATPK) is an important technology of downscaling without auxiliary information in remote sensing. However, it uses a constant semivariogram to downscale geospatial variables, which ignores the spatial heterogeneity between the geospatial objects. To deal with this kind of heterogeneity, this study proposes a fuzzy geospatial object-based ATPK method, which mainly consists of three steps: the extraction of fuzzy geospatial objects, the estimation of semivariograms for each object, and the downscaling of each object by ATPK with the corresponding semivariogram. Two groups of membership functions acquired from Worldview-2 and Sentinel-2 are used to test the proposed approach. Six classic downscaling algorithms are compared, and the results of two experiments show a better performance than the classical methods.

TI  - Mapping abandoned cropland using Within-Year Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic and various armed conflicts, the world is experiencing an unprecedented food crisis. The reclamation of abandoned cropland with food production potential may increase the global food supply in a short period of time, ensuring food security. At present, the extraction of abandoned cropland is mainly based on low-and medium-resolution remote sensing image data, making it difficult to extract fragmented areas in mountainous regions and to distinguish between abandoned cropland and transitional classes (such as fallow cropland). We developed a change-detection method based on within-year Sentinel-2 time series to extract cropland abandoned from 2018 to 2021 and defined four types of croplands, namely sponta-neously abandoned, induced abandoned, fallow, and lost cropland, using Linxia County in mountainous China as the study region. First, cropland objects were generated from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images using the multi -resolution segmentation method, and the land use map of Linxia County from 2017 to 2021 was drawn using random forest classifier. Second, through defining and identifying different cropland types, the interannual dynamic changes in cropland from 2018 to 2021 were extracted by analyzing the annual land use change tra-jectory. Third, by analyzing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series of cropland within -year, the active and cultivated cropland sites within-year were extracted by threshold segmentation. Finally, the changes in the four cropland types were extracted by intersecting the two result types. Our method captured the object level changes well (overall mapping accuracy = 93 +/- 5 %), and the extraction accuracy of abandoned cropland reached 81 +/- 2 %. Abandoned cropland was mostly located in areas of medium quality and with a moderate distance from rural settlements. Reclamation can potentially increase the grain production in Linxia County by at least 3.6 % and needs to be combined with the local natural geography and human activities. Our method is a robust method for extracting abandoned cropland and may be applied to other research related to land use change.

TI  - Application of ASTER Remote Sensing Data to Porphyry Copper Exploration in the Gondwana Region
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Porphyry copper ore is a vital strategic mineral resource. It is often associated with significant hydrothermal alteration, which alters the original mineralogical properties of the rock. Extracting alteration information from remote sensing data is crucial for porphyry copper exploration. However, the current method of extracting hydrothermal alteration information from ASTER remote sensing data does not consider the influence of disturbing factors, such as topography, and ignores the weak report of surface minerals, which has significant limitations. Therefore, this paper selects the Gondwana region of the East Tethys-Himalayan tectonic domain as the study area, combines waveform calculation with principal component analysis methods, proposes a spectral feature-enhanced principal component analysis (EPCA) method, and constructs a model to complete the automatic selection of principal components for each scene image. The results show that the etching information extracted by the EPCA method is significantly better than the traditional Crosta method in terms of etching area and spatial aggregation and discovers several prospective mineralization areas that have not yet been explored and exploited, such as Sakya and Xietongmen counties in Rikaze, providing theoretical support for subsequent mineralization exploration and large-scale mineral extraction. Meanwhile, obtaining the alteration information of the whole area can help to understand the distribution of mineralizing elements from a macroscopic perspective in the future, which is of great scientific significance in order to deeply analyze the formation process of metal deposits in mineralizing areas and improve the theory of porphyry mineralization.

TI  - Sorption Characteristics and Site Energy Distribution Theory of Typical Estrogens on Microplastics
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) and estrogens are high-profile emerging contaminants at present, and MPs might become the carrier of estrogens in the environment and induce combined pollution. To study the adsorption behavior of polyethylene (PE) microplastics to typical estrogens, the adsorption isothermal properties of the six estrogens[estrone (E1), 17 alpha-estradiol (17 alpha-E2), 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E2), estriol (E3), diethylstilbestrol (DES), and ethinylestradiol (17 alpha-EE2)] in single-solute and mixed-solute systems were studied through batch equilibrium adsorption experiments, in which the PE microplastics before and after adsorption were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Then, the site energy distribution theory of the adsorption of six estrogens on PE microplastics was further analyzed based on the Freundlich model. The results showed that the adsorption process of selected estrogens with two concentrations (100 mu g center dot L-1 and 1000 mu g center dot L-1) on PE were more consistent with the pseudo-second order kinetic model. The increase in initial concentration reduced the equilibrium time of adsorption and increased the adsorbing capacity of estrogens on PE. In the single system (one estrogen) or mixed system (six estrogens) with different concentrations (10 mu g center dot L-1-2000 mu g center dot L-1), the Freundlich model showed the best fitting effect for the adsorption isotherm data (R-2 > 0.94). The results of isothermal adsorption experiments and XPS and FTIR spectra showed that the adsorption of estrogens on PE in the two systems was heterogeneous adsorption, and hydrophobic distribution and van der Waals forces were the principal factors in the process of adsorption. The occurrence of C-O-C (in only the DES and 17 alpha-EE2 systems) and O-C=O (in only the 17 alpha-EE2 system) indicated that the adsorption of synthetic estrogens on PE was affected slightly by chemical bonding function, but no obvious effects were observed for natural estrogens. The results of site energy distribution analysis showed that, compared with the single system, the adsorption site energy of each estrogen shifted to the high-energy region in its entirety in the mixed system, and the site energy increased by 2.15%-40.98%. The energy change in DES was the most significant among all of the estrogens, indicating its competitive advantage in the mixed system. The above results of this study can provide some reference for the study of adsorption behavior, mechanism of action, and environmental risks under the coexisting condition of organic pollutants and MPs.

TI  - Monitoring Impervious Surface Area Dynamics in Urban Areas Using Sentinel-2 Data and Improved Deeplabv3+Model: A Case Study of Jinan City, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and rapidly mapping impervious surface area (ISA) and monitoring its spatial-temporal change pattern can deepen our understanding of the urban process. However, the complex spectral variability and spatial heterogeneity of ISA caused by the increased spatial resolution poses a great challenge to accurate ISA dynamics monitoring. This research selected Jinan City as a case study to boost ISA mapping performance through integrating the dual-attention CBAM module, SE module and focal loss function into the Deeplabv3+ model using Sentinel-2 data, and subsequently examining ISA spatial-temporal evolution using the generated annual time-series ISA data from 2017 to 2021. The experimental results demonstrated that (a) the improved Deeplabv3+ model achieved satisfactory accuracy in ISA mapping, with Precision, Recall, IoU and F1 values reaching 82.24%, 92.38%, 77.01% and 0.87, respectively. (b) In a comparison with traditional classification methods and other state-of-the-art deep learning semantic segmentation models, the proposed method performed well, qualitatively and quantitatively. (c) The time-series analysis on ISA distribution revealed that the ISA expansion in Jinan City had significant directionality from northeast to southwest from 2017 to 2021, with the number of patches as well as the degree of connectivity and aggregation increasing while the degree of fragmentation and the complexity of shape decreased. Overall, the proposed method shows great potential in generating reliable times-series ISA data and can be better served for fine urban research.

TI  - An Enhanced Offset Tracking Method: Providing Auxiliary Information for DInSAR Phase Filtering in Urban Areas
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the application of synthetic aperture radar differential interferometry in urban environments, it is easy to regard the phase change in the deformation band of buildings under construction as noise that requires filtering. This introduces an error into the surrounding area while over-filtering, resulting in an error in the magnitude of the deformation measurement results for the entire region and the loss of deformation details in the surrounding area. Based on the traditional DInSAR workflow, this study added a deformation magnitude identification step, determined the deformation magnitude by using enhanced offset tracking technology, supplemented the filtering quality map and removed the construction areas that affect the interferometry in the filtering stage. The enhanced offset tracking technique adjusted the ratio of contrast saliency and coherence via the contrast consistency peak in the radar intensity image, which was used as the basis for adjusting the adaptive window size. The method proposed in this paper was evaluated in an experiment on a stable region using simulated data and in an experiment on a large deformation region using Sentinel-1 data. The experimental results show that the enhanced method has a better anti-noise ability than the traditional method, and the accuracy rate is improved by about 12%. The supplemented quality map can effectively remove the large deformation area to prevent over-filtering while ensuring the filtering quality, and it can achieve better filtering results.

TI  - Optical System Design of Space-Based Filament LiDAR Spectrometer
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective With the development of ultrashort and ultra-intense laser, it has been revealed that when a femtosecond laser pulse propagates in air, filaments, referred to as "filament laser", would occur owing to nonlinear effects. Traditional spaceborne air-pollution monitoring devices rely on spectral imaging and LiDAR technology, which cannot realize real-time monitoring of atmospheric multi-component pollutants, identify unknown pollutants, and detect the chemical composition of various pollutants. The filament laser system in orbit emits a femtosecond laser pulse into the atmosphere, and the intensity of the femtosecond laser pulse is sufficient to ionize molecules in the atmospheric environment. Ionization excites the fluorescence spectrum carrying the information of the material composition, which can determine the various material components, species, and content in the area of the filament laser. To aid the research on space-based filament lidar technology, this study explored the optical system design of a space-based filament lidar spectrometer for remote sensing applications and realized the optical system configuration design. The spectral range and resolution of the spectrometer are 320-950 nm and 2 nm, respectively, and it has applicability in high resolution spectral detection of atmospheric pollutant composition.Methods First, the application requirements of space-based filament lidar spectrometer were analyzed. On the basis of the characteristics of pollutants and the corresponding spectra of the substance elements, the working spectrum of the spectrometer and the spectral resolution were designed to be 320-950 nm and 2 nm, respectively. Using filament laser propagation simulation software, the filament laser diameter was found to be approximately 6 mm after 400 km orbital propagation. The filament laser diameter can be constrained to a small spatial scale after ultralong-distance propagation. To conform to the spectral range and resolution requirements, the size of CCD detector is 1024x1024, with 13 mu mx13 mu m pixel size. The minimum spectral sampling interval was designed to be 0.67 nm/pixel. Considering the signal-to-noise ratio requirements of the spectrometer, the relative aperture of the optical system was determined as D/f ' = 1/3.5, and the aperture of the spectrometer system was set as 0.5 m. Then, considering the requirements of engineering and the space environment, the optical design and optical-mechanical design of the spectrometer were performed so as to provide an effective load scheme for space-based filament laser atmospheric detection.Results and Discussions The optical system of the spectrometer mainly comprises a telescopic system, slit, collimating system, plane grating, and imaging system; the collimating system, dispersion element, and imaging system constitute the spectrometer. The front telescopic system adopts a total reflection Cassegrain structure without chromatic aberration correction, and the root mean square (RMS) value of the diffuse spot radius of its imaging point is within 14 mu m. The spectrometer uses a reflective plane grating; the number of plane grating lines was determined to be approximately 263 lp/mm, and the grating aperture was 22 mm. A spectral resolution of 2 nm was achieved using first-order diffraction light. The maximum RMS diameter of the spectrometer system imaging slit is less than 17 mu m. The modulation transfer function (MTF) is greater than 0.99@3.7 lp/mm, and the maximum color distortion is 1.1 mu m. The energy concentration in three pixels is over 96%, which can be used for spaceborne high-resolution spectral detection of atmospheric components. The spectrometer system adopts a damping truss-unlocking mechanism for three-point support and is installed on the bottom plate of the satellite load compartment. The front lens tube is made of a carbon fiber composite material to ensure the thermal stability of the primary and secondary lens spacing. The main bearing frame and connecting plate are made of a titanium alloy. The design of stray light adopts the combination of "secondary mirror mask and primary mirror central hole baffle" with the simplest structure, which can ensure that the stray light coefficient of the camera is less than 0.5%. The statistics of various light paths that could reach the image surface were also obtained, and no abnormal stray light paths were found.Conclusions For space-based applications of the filament LiDAR spectrometer system, the optical system was designed and examined, and the main technical indicators of the optical system were determined. The designed spectrometer system can achieve a spectral resolution of 2 nm in the spectral range of 320-950 nm and thus provide a reference for the design and development of spectrometers used in filament LiDAR systems.

TI  - Shamanic Culture's Reconnection of Earth and Heaven (<i>Xu Ditiantong</i>) in the New Era in China: The Dialectical Relationship between Material Civilization and Cultural Intimacy
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shamanic culture, which adheres to the worldview of connecting earth and heaven, has been marginalized in the discourse of the modern material world and separated from mainstream society. However, with the increase in personal problems in civil society and the rise of regional cultural identity since the reform and opening up in China, shamanic practitioners have again become active. Adapting to the official ideology, shamanic culture has emerged in China as a new form of folk culture and cultural heritage. Using Michael Herzfeld's theory of "cultural intimacy" to a limited extent, this paper regards the new image of the shamanic tradition that has appeared in the new era as a manifestation of "cultural intimacy", which does not infringe the authority of official discourse, nor damage the interests of government departments, and is in line with the imagination of official discourse about culture. Within the shaman cultural community, the shamanic tradition continues to connect earth and heaven, helping to solve difficult personal problems, alleviating the pressure of the material world, and at the same time making the sacred expression of the members of the shaman cultural community possible. In this way, the shaman tradition, which has emerged in a new image since the new era, has maintained the ecological balance between government and folk practices and formed a more stable pattern of cooperation.

TI  - Improving the Spatial Prediction of Soil Organic Carbon Content Using Phenological Factors: A Case Study in the Middle and Upper Reaches of Heihe River Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) distribution is important for carbon sequestration and land management strategies, contributing to mitigating climate change and ensuring agricultural productivity. The Heihe River Basin in China is an important region that has immense potential for SOC storage. Phenological variables are effective indicators of vegetation growth, and hence are closely related to SOC. However, few studies have incorporated phenological variables in SOC prediction, especially in alpine areas such as the Heihe River Basin. This study used random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to study the effects of phenological variables (e.g., Greenup, Dormancy, etc.) obtained from MODIS (i.e., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) product (MCD12Q2) on SOC content prediction in the middle and upper reaches of Heihe River Basin. The current study also identified the dominating variables in SOC prediction and compared model performance using a cross validation procedure. The results indicate that: (1) when phenological variables were considered, the R-2 (coefficient of determination) of RF and XGBoost were 0.68 and 0.56, respectively, and RF consistently outperforms XGBoost in various cross validation experiments; (2) the environmental variables MAT, MAP, DEM and NDVI play the most important roles in SOC prediction; (3) the phenological variables can account for 32-39% of the spatial variability of SOC in both the RF and XGBoost models, and hence were the most important factor among the five categories of predictive variables. This study proved that the introduction of phenological variables can significantly improve the performance of SOC prediction. They should be used as indispensable variables for accurately modeling SOC in related studies.

TI  - Monitoring House Vacancy Dynamics in The Pearl River Delta Region: A Method Based on NPP-VIIRS Night-Time Light Remote Sensing Images
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban spatial interaction integrates cities into closely related urban network systems in continuous urban regions. However, it also brings differentiation and has mutual negative impacts between each location. Unbalanced development is one such impacts and needs closely monitoring. The housing vacancy rate (HVR) in a continuous urban region is an important index in the unbalanced development of a continuous urban region since it indicates the uneven distribution of population and investment across cities. This study uses NPP-VIIRS NTL data and Landsat 8 OLT images to estimate HVRs at the district level. Additionally, this study tracks the spatial-temporal dynamics of HVR distributions in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. The comparison between the sampled HVRs and estimated HVRs verifies the effectiveness of the estimated HVRs in identifying dynamic changes in HVRs. This study has found that although overall decreasing HVRs are observed in the PRD, speculations and irrational real estate investment exist in cities on the west bank of the Pearl River Estuary and in some isolated districts in other cities. Furthermore, increasing proportions of vacant pixels in most cities indicate rising real estate development, requiring further supervision. This study suggests that more precise data and advanced techniques could help to improve the accuracy of the estimation techniques.

TI  - Interpretation and Mapping Tree Crown Diameter Using Spatial Heterogeneity in Relation to the Radiative Transfer Model Extracted from GF-2 Images in Planted Boreal Forest Ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree crown diameter (CD) values, relating to the rate of material exchange between the forest and the atmosphere, can be used to evaluate forest biomass and carbon stock. To map tree CD values using meter-level optical remote sensing images, we propose a novel method that interprets the relationships between the spectral reflectance of pixels and the CD. The approach employs the spectral reflectance of pixels in the tree crown to express the diversity of inclination angles of leaves based on the radiative transfer model and the spatial heterogeneity of these pixels. Then, simulated and acquired GF-2 images are applied to verify the relationships between spatial heterogeneity and the tree CD. Meanwhile, filter-based and object-based methods are also employed to extract three types of variables (spectral features, texture features, and spatial heterogeneity). Finally, the tree CD values are mapped by four models (random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and multiple linear regression (MLR)), using three single types of variables and combinations of variables with different strategies. The results imply that the spatial heterogeneity of spectral reflectance is significantly positively correlated with tree CD values and is more sensitive to tree CD values than traditional spectral features and textural features. Furthermore, the ability of spatial heterogeneity to map tree CD values is significantly higher than traditional variable sets after obtaining stable features with appropriate filter window sizes. The results also demonstrate that the accuracy of mapped tree CD values is significantly improved using combined variable sets with different feature extraction methods. For example, in our experiments, the R-2 and rRMSE values of the optimal results ranged from 0.60 to 0.66, and from 15.76% to 16.68%, respectively. It is confirmed that spatial heterogeneity with high sensitivity can effectively map tree CD values, and the accuracy of mapping tree CD values can be greatly improved using a combination of spectral features extracted by an object-based method and spatial heterogeneity extracted by a filter-based method.

TI  - Monitoring Coastal Water Body Health with Sentinel-2 MSI Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Australian New South Wales Estuary health assessment and biodiversity monitoring program' has set state-wide targets for estuary health. A selection of water bodies is being monitored by in situ chlorophyll a concentration and turbidity measurements, indicators for water quality. We investigate whether the current monitoring program can benefit from the use of remote sensing derived data, analyzing chlorophyll a and water clarity estimates by the C2RCC and ACOLITE products based on Sentinel-2 MSI imagery for three lakes along the New South Wales coast. The C2RCC and ACOLITE products were partly successful in predicting chlorophyll a concentration and water clarity. Estimates based on Sentinel-2 MSI imagery were in the range of in situ measurements. However, results varied across years and lakes, and a significant correlation could not be found in every case. It is likely that the physical differences between the systems, such as nutrient input, tannins, and suspended algae/sediment matrix, influence the output of the algorithm. This may preclude the application of a one size fits all' monitoring approach, given the importance of local ecological phenomena in both influencing remote sensing observations and the nature of appropriate targets. However, the design of a monitoring program that incorporates remote sensing provides a way forward.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatiotemporal Urban Expansion of the Rome Coastline through GEE and RF Algorithm, Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes, through remote sensing techniques and innovative clouding services, the recent land use dynamics in the North-Roman littoral zone, an area where the latest development has witnessed an important reconversion of purely rural areas to new residential and commercial services. The survey area includes five municipalities and encompasses important infrastructure, such as the "Leonardo Da Vinci" Airport and the harbor of Civitavecchia. The proximity to the metropolis, supported by an efficient network of connections, has modified the urban and peri-urban structure of these areas, which were formerly exclusively agricultural. Hereby, urban expansion has been quantified by classifying Landsat satellite images using the cloud computing platform "Google Earth Engine" (GEE). Landsat multispectral images from 1985 up to 2020 were used for the diachronic analysis, with a five-yearly interval. In order to achieve a high accuracy of the final result, work was carried out along the temporal dimension of the images, selecting specific time windows for the creation of datasets, which were adjusted by the information related to the NDVI index variation through time. This implementation showed interesting improvements in the model performance for each year, suggesting the importance of the NDVI standard deviation parameter. The results showed an increase in the overall accuracy, being from 90 to 97%, with improvements in distinguishing urban surfaces from impervious surfaces. The final results highlighted a significant increase in the study area of the "Urban" and "Woodland" classes over the 35-year time span that was considered, being 67.4 km(2) and 70.4 km(2), respectively. The accurate obtained results have allowed us to quantify and understand the landscape transformations in the area of interest, with particular reference to the dynamics of urban development.

TI  - Climatic characteristics of mesoscale convective systems in the warm season in North China
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a total of 339 mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are obtained in North China using the temperature of brightness blackbody (TBB) data from the FY-2E in the warm season from 2010 to 2018. The number of meso-alpha-scale convective systems (M alpha CSs) is much more than that of meso-beta-scale convective systems (M beta CSs). The number of mesoscale elongated convective systems (MECSs) is more than that of mesoscale circular convective systems (MCCSs). Most MCSs occur in July and August, which have the widest influence range, the longest duration, and the strongest convection. The M alpha CS develops slowly and weakens rapidly. The diurnal variation of M alpha CSs presents a bimodal distribution, most of M alpha CSs form in the afternoon, while some of M alpha CSs form in the evening. The MCSs activities in the warm season of North China are concentrated in two belts, namely, the east-west-oriented belt along Henan Province, Shandong Province and the Yellow Sea, and the south-north-oriented belt along central-western Shandong, Tianjin City, the west of Bohai Sea and the northeast of Hebei Province. MCSs mainly move eastward, and only some MECSs move southwestward and northwestward. The easterly and northerly moving MCSs are mainly affected by the steering flow, while the southerly moving MCSs are mainly affected by storm propagation. The MCSs of North China mainly form in the high temperature, high humidity and high energy area, with favorable dynamic conditions, such as middle-level trough or vortex, low-level shear line, surface inverted trough or surface convergence line, and the terrain. Meanwhile, the MCS pregnant environment is often accompanied by low-level jet and relatively strong vertical wind shear.

TI  - The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Influenza Transmission in Poland
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to determine whether the occurrence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affected the incidence of influenza in Poland and the efficiency of the SENTINEL influenza surveillance system. Methods: The analysis was based on virologic data from the 2018/2019-2021/2022 epidemic seasons. The data in question were obtained from the SENTINEL influenza surveillance system, which is utilized in Poland. Results: In the 2020/2021 epidemic season, only one positive case was confirmed. In the epidemic season of 2021/2022, the number of positive cases increased. There was a delay in the peak of the season, since the start of pandemic, which was observed in the 14th week of 2022. Previously, it was recorded in the 5-10th week, depending on the season. Before the pandemic, the number of positive samples in relation to the tested ones oscillated between 41-49.4%. After the pandemic, it was 0.3% and below 20%, respectively, for season 2020/2021 and season 2021/2022. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a decline in many other infectious diseases, including influenza, as a result of the numerous lockdowns and from people shifting to remote work. Other safety measures, such as obligatory protective masks and the use of disinfectants, had a significant impact on reducing the number of cases.

TI  - Tree Species Classification Based on ASDER and MALSTM-FCN
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species classification based on multi-source remote sensing data is essential for ecological evaluation, environmental monitoring, and forest management. The optimization of classification features and the performance of classification methods are crucial to tree species classification. This paper proposes Angle-weighted Standard Deviation Elliptic Cross-merge Rate (ASDER) as a separability metric for feature optimization. ASDER uses mutual information to represent the separability metric and avoids the difficulty of differentiation caused by multiple ellipse centers and coordinate origins forming straight lines by angle weighting. In classification method, Multi-head Self-attention Long Short-Term Memory-Full Convolution Network (MALSTM-FCN) is constructed in this paper. MALSTM-FCN enhances the global correlation in time series and improves classification accuracy through a multi-head self-attention mechanism. This paper takes Beijing Olympic Forest Park (after this, referred to as Aosen) as the research area, constructs a tree species classification dataset based on an actual ground survey, and obtains a classification accuracy of 95.20% using the above method. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of ASDER and MALSTM-FCN by comparing temporal entropy and LSTM-FCN and shows that the method has some practicality for tree species classification.

TI  - Combining remote sensing and social media data for flood mapping: a case study in Linhai, Zhejiang Province, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid mapping of flood inundation is essential for timely assessment of damage and post-disaster recovery. Remote sensing technology provides clear spatial information for mapping flood inundation, but its real-time (RT) images are often not available due to the severe weather conditions during the disaster events; the combination of RT data can better compensate for the deficiency. In this study, a near RT (NRT) flood inundation probability mapping method based on post-event NRT remote sensing data combined with RT volunteer geographic information (VGI) was proposed for mapping the 2019 flood in Linhai City, Zhejiang Province. First, a probabilistic index distribution (PID) layer was constructed from high-resolution digital elevation model data using an inverse distance-weighted height filter based on each VGI point. Then, a quality evaluation method for non-reference data was introduced to evaluate the validity of the VGI data. The final flood probability map was generated by PID weighting. The results show that, by fusing NRT images and RT data, the proposed model for mapping flood inundation probability is more robust and enhances the spatial characteristics of the flood inundation probability index, allowing it to enable emergency responders to quickly identify areas requiring urgent attention.

TI  - Incorporating Lymphovenous Anastomosis in Clinically Node-Positive Women Receiving Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Shared Decision-Making Model and Nuanced Approached to the Axilla
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Lymphedema remains a risk for 13-34% of breast cancer patients who require an axillary dissection (ALND) and radiation. Immediate lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA) may mitigate lymphedema by up to 30% by restoring the physiologic lymphatic drainage immediately after ALND. Currently, completion of ALND (cALND) versus radiation after neoadjuvant therapy (NAC) is being addressed by the Alliance A11202 trial, leaving a paucity of data to guide practice. Our study describes the implementation process of LVA into clinical practice after NAC for node-positive breast cancer in the current clinical context. Methods: We reviewed a prospective database of LVA in node-positive patients (cT1-4,Nany) who received NAC followed by axillary surgery +/- immediate LVA from October 2021 to 2022. The evolution of the surgical approach is described. Specifically, patients who downstaged to clinically negative nodes post-NAC were offered targeted SLNB with dual-tracer and intraoperative frozen section (FS). Patients were reminded that the standard of care for any node positive is cALND. Immediate cALND with LVA was performed for grossly positive nodes or all positive SLNs; cALND was omitted for those with negative SLNs. For a microscopic disease on a frozen section, a shared decision was made pre-operatively, given each patient's differing valuations of the benefit and risks of cALND +/- LVA versus no cALND with planned regional radiation postoperatively. LVA was offered as an option as part of our institutional evaluation of the procedure. Results: A total of 15 patients were included; the mean age was 49.9 (range 32-75) with stage IIA to IIIB breast cancer. Of these, 6 (40%) were triple negative, 5 (33.3%) HER-2 positive, and 4 (26.7%) ER/PR+ HER-2 negative. There were 13 women (86.7%) who had persistent axillary adenopathy based on clinical and/or ultrasound assessment, with 8 patients proceeding directly to ALND with LVA. Among these patients, 3 (37.5%) had pathologic nodal disease, and 5 (62.5%) were node negative, confirming the limitations of pre-operative imaging. As a result, the subsequent 7 (46.7%) underwent targeted SLNB with FS, with 3 patients (42.9%) avoiding an ALND as a result of a negative FS. A total of 4 patients (57.1%) had 1 or more positive lymph nodes on FS: 3 proceeded with a cALND and LVA, and 1 patient (14.2%) opted for no cALND based on a pre-operative discussion and received adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy. Of the 11 patients who underwent ALND and LVA, 1 patient (9.1%) developed lymphedema at 6.9 months following their surgery. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of pre-operative US were 46.7%, 85.7%, and 12.5% and intraoperative FS were 88.0%, 72.7%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: As adjuvant nodal radiation and systemic therapy continue to improve, the benefit of a cALND in patients with the limited residual disease remains unclear as we await the outcomes from clinical trials. In the era of clinical uncertainty, we propose a nuanced approach to the axilla by utilizing a shared decision model with patients, incorporating targeted SLNB with FS and completion node dissection when required and desired by the patient, coupled with LVA in a simple stepwise treatment pathway.

TI  - Potential Climate Impacts of Afforestation and Waterlogging in Belarus
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the expected climate changes in Belarus as a result of two types of land transformation-rewetting degraded peatlands and increasing forest cover. The analysis was performed for the growing season (May-September) based on long-term earth remote sensing data, mesoscale modeling of atmospheric processes, and balance calculations using ERA5 reanalysis. It is shown that, as a result of waterlogging, the daytime temperature of the land surface for the southern part of Belarus (below the latitude of Minsk) decreases within 1.5 degrees C due to increased evaporation and, for the northern part, 0.5 increased due to albedo regularity. At night, waterlogging, depending on the soil and climatic conditions, can cause both an increase and decrease a specific value of the land surface temperature (LST) within 1 degrees C. Evapotranspiration due to waterlogging in the northern regions of Belarus decreases and it increases in the southern regions, which is associated with a significant ratio between evaporation and transpiration in these regions. During the afforestation of cropland, the daytime LST of Belarus decreases within 2 degrees C and, at night, increase. The total evapotranspiration for the growing season due to the increase in forest cover reaches 100 mm, and potential (maximum possible) evaporation remains at the same level, which contributes to an increase in soil moisture at an increased amount of atmospheric precipitation. The above changes in the physical characteristics of the land surface as a result of reclamation cause a decrease in the surface air temperature in the reclamated region within 0.4 degrees C and an increase in the amount of atmospheric precipitation within 2% of the climatic normals. At the same time, the maximum in the spatial distribution of secondary precipitation due to western transport shifts to the east relative to the reclaimed region.

TI  - A Novel Vegetation Index Approach Using Sentinel-2 Data and Random Forest Algorithm for Estimating Forest Stock Volume in the Helan Mountains, Ningxia, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest stock volume (FSV) is a major indicator of forest ecosystem health and it also plays an important part in understanding the worldwide carbon cycle. A precise comprehension of the distribution patterns and variations of FSV is crucial in the assessment of the sequestration potential of forest carbon and optimization of the management programs of the forest carbon sink. In this study, a novel vegetation index based on Sentinel-2 data for modeling FSV with the random forest (RF) algorithm in Helan Mountains, China has been developed. Among all the other variables and with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.778, the novel vegetation index (NDVIRE) developed based on the red-edge bands of the Sentinel-2 data was the most significant. Meanwhile, the model that combined bands and vegetation indices (bands + VIs-based model, BVBM) performed best in the training phase (R-2 = 0.93, RMSE = 10.82 m(3)ha(-1)) and testing phase (R-2 = 0.60, RMSE = 27.05 m(3)ha(-1)). Using the best training model, the FSV of the Helan Mountains was first mapped and an accuracy of 80.46% was obtained. The novel vegetation index developed based on the red-edge bands of the Sentinel-2 data and RF algorithm is thus the most effective method to assess the FSV. In addition, this method can provide a new method to estimate the FSV in other areas, especially in the management of forest carbon sequestration.

TI  - The Ocean Surface Current in the East China Sea Computed by the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-frequency observations of surface current field data over large areas and long time series are imperative for comprehending sea-air interaction and ocean dynamics. Nonetheless, neither in situ observations nor polar-orbiting satellites can fulfill the requirements necessary for such observations. In recent years, geostationary satellite data with ultra-high temporal resolution have been increasingly utilized for the computation of surface flow fields. In this paper, the surface flow field in the East China Sea is estimated using maximum cross-correlation, which is the most widely used flow field computation algorithm, based on the total suspended solids (TSS) data acquired from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager satellite. The inversion results were compared with the modeled tidal current data and the measured tidal elevation data for verification. The results of the verification demonstrated that the mean deviation of the long semiaxis of the tidal ellipse of the inverted M-2 tide is 0.0335 m/s, the mean deviation of the short semiaxis is 0.0276 m/s, and the mean deviation of the tilt angle is 6.89 degrees. Moreover, the spatially averaged flow velocity corresponds with the observed pattern of tidal elevation changes, thus showcasing the field's significant reliability. Afterward, we calculated the sea surface current fields in the East China Sea for the years 2013 to 2019 and created distribution maps for both climatology and seasonality. The resulting current charts provide an intuitive display of the spatial structure and seasonal variations in the East China Sea circulation. Lastly, we performed a diagnostic analysis on the surface TSS variation mechanism in the frontal zone along the Zhejiang coast, utilizing inverted flow data collected on 3 August 2013, which had a high spatial coverage and complete time series. Our analysis revealed that the intraday variation in TSS in the local surface layer was primarily influenced by tide-induced vertical mixing. The research findings of this article not only provide valuable data support for the study of local ocean dynamics but also verify the reliability of short-period surface flow inversion of high-turbidity waters near the coast using geostationary satellites.

TI  - Characterization of Evapotranspiration in the Orange River Basin of South Africa-Lesotho with Climate and MODIS Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial to the management of water supplies and the functioning of numerous terrestrial ecosystems. To understand and propose planning strategies for water-resource and crop management, it is critical to examine the geo-temporal patterns of ET in drought-prone areas such as the Upper Orange River Basin (UORB) in South Africa. While information on ET changes is computed from directly observed parameters, capturing it through remote sensing is inexpensive, consistent, and feasible at different space-time scales. Here, we employed the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived spectral indices within Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyze and characterize patterns of ET over the UORB from 2003 to 2021, in association with various climatic parameters. Our results show spatially consistent ET patterns with the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), with lower values in the west, increasing toward the eastern section of the basin, over the Lesotho highlands. We noted that the UORB faced significant variability in ET and VCI during pronounced drought episodes. The random forests (RF) model identified precipitation, temperature, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)-6, Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and VCI as variables of high importance for ET variability, while the wavelet analysis confirmed the coherence connectivity between these variables with periodicities ranging from eight to 32 months, suggesting a strong causal influence on ET, except for PDSI, that showed an erratic relationship. Based on the sequential Mann-Kendall test, we concluded that evapotranspiration has exhibited a statistically downward trend since 2011, which was particularly pronounced during the dry periods in 2015-2016, 2019, and 2021. Our study also confirmed the high capacity of the GEE and MODIS-derived indices in mapping consistent geo-temporal ET patterns.

TI  - An assessment of vegetation cover of Mysuru City, Karnataka State, India, using deep convolutional neural networks
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mysuru City is a unique place in India due to its culture, green cover, historical places, and pleasant weather. In the last few decades, the city was witnessed rapid urban growth. This present work is conducted to assess the decadal changes in Mysuru City vegetation cover using multispectral remotely sensed data of 2009 and 2019 within Mysuru City Corporation (MCC). The main objective of this work is to assess the vegetation cover of the city and generate the land use and land cover classes (LULC) map using the deep learning model. Therefore, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based multiple training round (CNN-MTR) deep learning model is proposed and used for the classification of remote sensing images. The classified results were analyzed to assess the vegetation cover changes in the city over one decade. Vegetation cover within the Mysuru City Corporation area was estimated in 2019 to be 39.09% as compared to 43.32% in 2009. These results indicate that over a decade vegetation cover of Mysuru City is decreased by 3.43%. The overall classification accuracy of the proposed CNN-MTR model was estimated to be 95.20% for 2009 and 94.17% for 2019 respectively.

TI  - Feral Swine as Indirect Indicators of Environmental Anthrax Contamination and Potential Mechanical Vectors of Infectious Spores
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthrax is a disease that affects livestock, wildlife, and humans worldwide; however, its relative impacts on these populations remain underappreciated. Feral swine (Sus scrofa) are relatively resistant to developing anthrax, and past serosurveys have alluded to their utility as sentinels, yet empirical data to support this are lacking. Moreover, whether feral swine may assist in the dissemination of infectious spores is unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, we intranasally inoculated 15 feral swine with varying quantities of Bacillus anthracis Sterne 34F2 spores and measured the seroconversion and bacterial shedding over time. The animals also were inoculated either one or three times. The sera were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies against B. anthracis, and nasal swabs were cultured to detect bacterial shedding from the nasal passages. We report that the feral swine developed antibody responses to B. anthracis and that the strength of the response correlated with the inoculum dose and the number of exposure events experienced. Isolation of viable bacteria from the nasal passages of the animals throughout the study period suggests that feral swine may assist in the spread of infectious spores on the landscape and have implications for the identification of environments contaminated with B. anthracis as well as the exposure risk to more susceptible hosts.

TI  - Mesoscale Circulation Controls Chlorophyll Concentrations in the East Australian Current Separation Zone
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the distribution of chlorophyll on the continental shelves adjacent to western boundary currents is important, both from an ecosystem perspective, as well as for their role as a net sink of atmospheric CO2. However, in-situ observations of chlorophyll in these dynamic regions are rare. Here, using more than a decade of underwater glider observations from 29 deployments in the East Australian Current (EAC) system, we examine the effect of the mesoscale western boundary current (WBC) circulation on chlorophyll distribution across the shelf. The extensive hydrographic dataset reveals that the mode of boundary current separation has a strong persistent spatial influence on both the stratification and chlorophyll distribution on the shelf between 31.5 degrees and 34 degrees S, a productive area adjacent to the EAC separation zone. We identify that subsurface chlorophyll maxima are common, and their depth and strength is dictated by the offshore mesoscale circulation associated with the WBC separation. The vertical chlorophyll distribution is modulated by the combination of the seasonal cycle and the sporadic influence of mesoscale eddies associated with WBC jet separation. Of the three dominant WBC separation scenarios, eddy dipoles result in shelf waters that are on average more stratified, have higher chlorophyll values, and a deeper chlorophyll maximum compared to other circulation modes. These results suggest that it is necessary to consider the influence of WBC dynamics on chlorophyll concentrations for accurate estimates of atmospheric CO2 uptake.Plain Language Summary In the past, our understanding of chlorophyll distributions in East Australian Current came mainly from satellite data. However, satellites cannot see far below the surface of the ocean. We use data from a decade of underwater glider missions to look at subsurface chlorophyll and find that the East Australian Current and its eddies strongly influence shelf chlorophyll at depth, even giving it a different seasonal cycle to the surface. We think that this is important for how this region takes up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

TI  - The Accuracy of Land Use and Cover Mapping across Time in Environmental Disaster Zones: The Case of the B1 Tailings Dam Rupture in Brumadinho, Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rupture of a tailings dam causes several social, economic, and environmental impacts because people can die, the devastation caused by the debris and mud waves is expressive and the released substances may be toxic to the ecosystem and humans. There were two major dam failures in the Minas Gerais state, Brazil, in the last decade. The first was in 2015 in the city of Mariana and the second was in 2019 in the municipality of Brumadinho. The extent of land use and cover changes derived from those collapses were an expression of their impacts. Thus, knowing the changes to land use and cover after these disasters is essential to help repair or mitigate environmental degradation. This study aimed to diagnose the changes to land cover that occurred after the failure of dam B1 in Brumadinho that affected the Ferro-Carvao stream watershed. In addition to the environmental objective, there was the intention of investigating the impact of image preparation, as well as the spatial and spectral resolution on the classification's accuracy. To accomplish the goals, visible and near-infrared bands from Landsat (30 m), Sentinel-2 (10 m), and PlanetScope Dove (4.77 m) images collected between 2018 and 2021 were processed on the Google Earth Engine platform. The Pixel Reduction to Median tool was used to prepare the record of images, and then the random forest algorithm was used to detect the changes in land cover caused by the tailings dam failure under the different spatial and spectral resolutions and to provide the corresponding measures of accuracy. The results showed that the spatial resolution of the images affects the accuracy, but also that the selected algorithm and images were all capable of accurately classifying land use and cover in the Ferro-Carvao watershed and their changes over time. After the failure, mining/tailings areas increased in the impacted zone of the Ferro-Carvao stream, while native forest, pasture, and agricultural lands declined, exposing the environmental deterioration. The environment recovered in subsequent years (2020-2021) due to tailings removal and mobilization.

TI  - Investigation and Prediction of the Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) Changes for Mashhad City in Iran during 1990-2030
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on how cities are affected by urban heat islands (UHI) are critical nowadays for a better understanding of the connected effects and for providing helpful insights for sustainable city development planning. In this study, Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+), and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were used to assess the dynamics of the spatiotemporal pattern of land use/land cover (LU/LC) and land surface temperature (LST) in the metropolitan city of Mashhad, Iran in the period between 1990 and 2019. The Markov chain model (MCM) was used to predict LU/LC and LST for 2030. In the analyzed LU/LC maps, three LU/LC classes were distinguished, including built-up land (BUL), vegetated land (VL), and bare land (BL) using the maximum likelihood (ML) classification method. The collected data showed different variations in the geographical pattern of Mashhad LST during the research period that impacted the LST in this metropolis. The study evaluated the variations in LU/LC classes and evaluated their impact on the LST. The value of the LST was positively correlated with the occurrence of the built-up land (BUL), and with the bare land areas, while it was negatively correlated with the occurrence of the VL areas. The analysis of changes observed over three decades with 10-year intervals and the prediction of the LU/LC and LST for 2030 constitute an important contribution to the delineation of the dynamics of long LU/LC and LST records. These innovative results may have an important impact on policymaking fostering environmental sustainability, such as the control and management of urban expansion of Mashhad in connection with UHI.

TI  - Quantifying the Effects of Green-Town Development on Land Surface Temperatures (LST) (A Case Study at Karizland (Karizboom), Yazd, Iran)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Several earth science investigations depend heavily on knowing the surface energy budget and determining surface temperature. The primary factor affecting the energy balance in the surface physical processes of the planet is the land surface temperature (LST). Even in the case of small-scale green areas like local parks, plants have a significant impact on the climate of cities. The goal of this study was to estimate the construction-related impacts of the Karizland green town (green belt) on the LST of its surroundings over time, for the years 2013 (before construction began), 2015, 2020 and 2022 (after construction was completed). LST values and hot spot analyses were employed for thermal condition evaluation purposes on Landsat-8 satellite images, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) indices were used for examining the vegetation change. The results showed that after the establishment of the green town, the mean NDVI and FVC grew by 275% and 950%, respectively, compared to the initial period, which resulted in the addition of approximately 208.35 ha of green space to the study area. In this regard, the results showed that after these changes, compared to the first period, the mean LST decreased by 8%. In addition, the area of the class of hotspot analysis with less than 90% confidence increased by 9%. The results illustrated that almost 20% of the data in the LST range was below 55 degrees C in 2013, near 57 degrees C in 2015, and around 51 degrees C in 2020 and 2022. The results also showed a negative relationship between the distance from the established settlement and the values of NDVI and FVC in 2022 of 91% and 89% and in 2020 of 67% and 69%, respectively. Every year, LST has had a significant negative relationship with the NDVI and FVC of that year and a positive relationship with the LST of the following years, such that the correlation decreases in later years. In order to control LST and the temperature surrounding cities, this research strongly advises managers to develop these green towns.

TI  - Behavior of Adult <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> in Kinshasa, DRC, and the Implications for Control
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Yellow fever and chikungunya outbreaks-and a few dengue cases-have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in recent years. However, little is known about the ecology and behavior of the adult disease vector species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, in DRC. Preliminary studies showed important differences in Aedes behavior in DRC and Latin-American sites. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the host-seeking and resting behaviors of female Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, and their densities in four communes of Kinshasa (Kalamu, Lingwala, Mont Ngafula and Ndjili). Two cross-sectional surveys were carried out, one in the dry season (July 2019) and one in the rainy season (February 2020). We used three different adult vector collection methods: BG-Sentinel 2, BG-GAT, and prokopack. Both Aedes species were clearly exophagic, exophilic, and sought breeding sites outdoors. The adult house index for Ae. aegypti exceeded 55% in all communes except Lingwala, where it was only 27%. The Adult Breteau Index (ABI) for Ae. aegypti was 190.77 mosquitoes per 100 houses inspected in the rainy season and 6.03 in the dry season. For Ae. albopictus, the ABI was 11.79 and 3.52 in the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. Aedes aegypti showed unimodal host-seeking activity between 6 h and 21 h. The exophagic and exophilic behaviors of both species point to the need to target adult mosquitoes outdoors when implementing vector control.

TI  - A General Paradigm for Retrieving Soil Moisture and Surface Temperature from Passive Microwave Remote Sensing Data Based on Artificial Intelligence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) and land surface temperature (LST) are entangled, and the retrieval of one of them requires a priori specification of the other one. Due to insufficient observational information, retrieval of LST and SM from passive microwave remote sensing data is often ill-posed, and the retrieval accuracy needs to be improved. In this study, a novel fully-coupled paradigm is developed to robustly retrieve SM and LST from passive microwave data, which integrates deep learning, physical methods, and statistical methods. The key condition of the general paradigm proposed by us is that the output parameters of deep learning can be uniquely determined by the input parameters theoretically through a certain mathematical equation. Firstly, the physical method is deduced based on the energy radiation balance equation. The nine unknowns require the brightness temperatures of nine channels to construct nine equations, and the solutions of the physical method equations are obtained by model simulation. Based on the derivation of the physical method, the solution of the statistical method is constructed using multi-source data. Secondly, the solutions of physical and statistical methods constitute the training and test data of deep learning, which is used to obtain the solution curve of physical and statistical methods. The retrieval accuracy of LST and SM is greatly improved by smartly utilizing the mutual prior knowledge of SM and LST and cross iterative optimization calculations. Finally, validation indicates that the mean absolute error of the retrieved SM and LST data are 0.027 m(3)/m(3) and 1.38 K, respectively, at an incidence angle of 0-65 degrees. A model-data-knowledge-driven and deep learning method can overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods and provide a paradigm for retrieval of other geophysical variables. The proposed paradigm not only has physical meaning, but also makes deep learning physically interpretable, which is a milestone in the retrieval of geophysical remote sensing parameters based on artificial intelligence technology.

TI  - Aboveground biomass stock and change estimation in Amazon rainforest using airborne light detection and ranging, multispectral data, and machine learning algorithms
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing an efficient method to accurately estimate aboveground biomass in tropical forests is critical to monitoring the carbon stock and implementing policies to reduce emissions caused by deforestation. Thus, the objective of the present study was to estimate aboveground biomass in areas of the Amazonian Forest with selective logging, using the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) machine learning algorithms, using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and these combined with OLI/Landsat 8 variables, as well as mapping the biomass for the years 2014 and 2017, allowing one to analyze its dynamics between the years of analysis. The RF and SVM algorithms obtained the lowest error values in all datasets. The association of the variables increased the RF performance. Analyzing the dynamics of biomass, it was observed that the oldest exploration units (2006, 2007, and 2008) have lower biomass stocks. The highest biomass losses in 2017 came from units operated between 2012 and 2013 (the most recent record). Thus, with the method used in this study, it was possible to infer that the machine learning algorithms were efficient in estimating the biomass, emphasizing the RF and the SVM.

TI  - Upper-Ocean Circulation and Tropical Atlantic Interannual Modes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of tropical Atlantic Ocean variability modes in the variability of the upper-ocean circulation has been investigated. For this purpose, we use three oceanic reanalyses, an interannual forced-ocean simulation, and satel-lite data for the period 1982-2018. We have explored the changes in the main surface and subsurface ocean currents during the emergence of Atlantic meridional mode (AMM), Atlantic zonal mode (AZM), and AMM-AZM connection. The de-veloping phase of the AMM is associated with a boreal spring intensification of North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) and a reinforced summer Eastern Equatorial Undercurrent (EEUC) and north South Equatorial Current (nSEC). During the decaying phase, the reduction of the wind forcing and zonal sea surface height gradient produces a weakening of sur-face circulation. For the connected AMM-AZM, in addition to the intensified NECC, EEUC, and nSEC in spring, an anomalous north-equatorial wind curl excites an oceanic Rossby wave (RW) that is boundary-reflected into an equatorial Kelvin wave (KW). The KW reverses the thermocline slope, weakening the nSEC and EUC in boreal summer and au-tumn, respectively. During the developing spring phase of the AZM, the nSEC is considerably reduced with no consistent impact at subsurface levels. During the autumn decaying phase, the upwelling RW-reflected mechanism is activated, modi-fying the zonal pressure gradient that intensifies the nSEC. The NECC is reduced in boreal spring-summer. Our results re-veal a robust alteration of the upper-ocean circulation during AMM, AZM, and AMM-AZM, highlighting the decisive role of ocean waves in connecting the tropical and equatorial ocean transport.

TI  - Remote-Sensing Method for Monitoring Suspended-Sediment Concentration on the Middle-Mississippi and Lower-Missouri Rivers
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY WATER RESEARCH & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment transport, erosion, and deposition are primary drivers of river geomorphic processes and ecological services. Suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) is an important parameter for evaluating these processes and is accordingly of significant interest to engineers, scientists, and water resource managers. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) previously operated nine daily SSC gauging stations along the Mississippi River, with operating dates ranging from 1974 to 2018. Currently, there are no USGS gauging stations reporting daily SSC values along the Mississippi River. For this study, regression models were developed to compute the SSC along the Middle-Mississippi River (MMR) and Lower-Missouri River (LMOR) using publicly and freely available Landsat imagery. Surface reflectance data from Landsat satellites were used with USGS-measured SSC to develop regression models for three different Landsat sensors (Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 4-5 TM). Previous models published for predicting SSC in the MMR and LMOR from Landsat images have a linear-regression form and have provided invalid negative values when extrapolated outside of the dataset used for development. The objectives of this study were to develop reflectance-SSC regression models using a power-function form and demonstrate their extrapolation performance using multiple novel applications in the MMR basin. The reflectance-SSC regression models were applied to the following conditions: 1) mixing at the Mississippi and Missouri River confluence, 2) point-source pollution, and 3) SSC changes along the entire MMR reach for a range of discharges. The regression models were also used to develop sediment rating curves for the four largest tributaries of the MMR.

TI  - Land Consumption Classification Using Sentinel 1 Data: A Systematic Review
T2  - LAND
M3  - Review
AB  - The development of remote sensing technology has redefined the approaches to the Earth's surface monitoring. The Copernicus Programme promoted by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU), through the launch of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 and the multispectral Sentinel-2 satellites, has provided a valuable contribution to monitoring the Earth's surface. There are several review articles on the land use/land cover (LULC) matter using Sentinel images, but it lacks a methodical and extensive review in the specific field of land consumption monitoring, concerning the application of SAR images, in particular Sentinel-1 images. In this paper, we explored the potential of Sentinel-1 images to estimate land consumption using mathematical modeling, focusing on innovative approaches. Therefore, this research was structured into three principal steps: (1) searching for appropriate studies, (2) collecting information required from each paper, and (3) discussing and comparing the accuracy of the existing methods to evaluate land consumption and their applied conditions using Sentinel-1 Images. Current research has demonstrated that Sentinel-1 data has the potential for land consumption monitoring around the world, as shown by most of the studies reviewed: the most promising approaches are presented and analyzed.

TI  - Distinct Hydrologic Pathways Regulate Perennial Surface Water Dynamics in a Hyperarid Basin
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In water-stressed hyperarid basins, questions mount over the impacts of anthropogenic groundwater extraction and climate-driven perturbations on groundwater-surface water interactions and the resilience of ecosystem-critical surface water. Coupling groundwater with surface water observations from Sentinel-2 data provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate surface water connectivity with local aquifers following intense precipitation events in arid basins. Surface water area and groundwater level data were analyzed for trends following precipitation, including peak lag time, post-peak recession rates, and changes in hydraulic gradients. Results indicate variable connectivity following large precipitation events between surface water change and groundwater level fluctuations in the upgradient freshwater aquifer, whereas the downgradient brine-to-brackish area of the aquifer indicated virtually no connectivity with the aquifer. Comparison between precipitation and surface water response indicate distinct responses based on the physical relationship of the surface water body with the brine-to-brackish area of the aquifer. Lumped parameter modeling of surface water inundation also constrains the possible hydrologic dynamics of the post-precipitation response. While modeled influx to surface water seems primarily controlled by watershed hydraulics rather than direct hydraulic connectivity of the aquifers, the relationship between surface water and adjacent groundwater levels coupled with surface water area indicates that local aquifers are primarily connected to the surface water bodies through discharge via subsurface infiltration. Modeling results imply that the existence of brine-adjacent surface water in arid basins relies on upgradient discharge from freshwater aquifers. Our results further support that marginal surface water systems can serve as a critical recharge mechanism to local aquifers.Plain Language Summary Surface water is important for desert ecosystems, but the future of surface water remains uncertain because of climate change and human consumption. Understanding how surface water responds to precipitation and interacts with groundwater is useful for better predicting future water availability. Advancements in the quality of satellite imagery provide an opportunity to combine satellite data with rain gauge and water level data to investigate the connection of surface water to rainfall patterns and groundwater. Observations from flooding behavior show two different types of surface water. Both types can be categorized by proximity to the brine that exists in the aquifer underlying the basin floor: transitional pools occur at the edge of the transition to brine while terminal lagoon systems occur in the brackish groundwater zone. Calculations indicate that the two groups have different inflow and outflow mechanisms that occur over varying timescales. These mechanisms indicate that intense rainfall events will lead to increased inundation over longer periods of time for transitional surface water bodies. However, despite rapid rates of recession, terminal pools will also experience prolonged inundation above background levels for up to a year after large rainfall events because of increased spring discharge from rainfall-driven recharge to groundwater.

TI  - The relationship between sleep duration and health among Pacific adolescents within New Zealand: Findings from the Pacific Islands families study
T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sleep insufficiency is bi-directionally associated with adverse behavioural, physical and mental health outcomes in paediatric populations. However, little is known about the degree of sleep insufficiency and its effect on Pacific adolescents' wellbeing.Methods: A cross-sectional study of 14-year old Pacific adolescents nested within a longitudinal birth cohort was conducted. Self-reported sleep duration was related to sentinel physical, mental, and risk taking behaviour measures in crude and adjusted logistic regression models. Complete case and multiple imputed analyses were conducted.Results: 916 Pacific adolescents were eligible, with a mean age of 14.2 years. Valid sleep data were available from 828 (90.4%) participants, with only 220 (26.6%) meeting the recommended amount of sleep. Insufficient sleep duration was associated with significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms and risk taking behaviours. In multiple imputed analyses, increased body mass index was also significantly related.Conclusions: Sleep insufficiency is ubiquitous among Pacific adolescents and associated with negative impacts on their health and wellbeing.Implications for public health: Insufficient sleep duration is amenable to change. Bespoke, culturally responsive public health strategies that draw attention to the importance of positive sleep practices are needed. Particularly, among adolescents who are at risk of experiencing the greatest burden of insufficient sleep.

TI  - Detection of water deficit conditions in different soils by comparative analysis of standard precipitation index and normalized difference vegetation index
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of water deficit conditions in different soils of Prakasam district, Andhra Pradesh, India was assessed in consecutive two seasons of 2017-18 to 2019-20 cropping seasons using combined indicators developed from Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Historical rainfall data during the study period of 56 administrative units were analyzed by using R software and derived three-month SPI. The MODIS satellite data from 2007 to 2020 was downloaded out of which the first ten years' data was used as mean monthly NDVI and the remaining period data was used to derive the anomaly index for the specific month. MODIS satellite data was downloaded, using LST and NDVI, and MSI values were calculated. The NDVI anomaly was derived using MODIS data to study the onset and intensity of water deficit conditions. Results indicated that SPI values gradually increased from the start of the Kharif season, reached their maximum during the August and September months, and decreased gradually with high variation among the mandals. The NDVI anomaly values were highest in October and December the for Kharif and Rabi seasons, respectively. The correlation coefficient between NDVI anomaly and SPI reveals that 79% and 61% of the variation were observed in light and heavy textured soils. The SPI values of -0.5 and -0.75; the NDVI anomaly values of -1.0 and -1.5 and SMI values of 0.28 and 0.26 were established as the thresholds for the onset of water deficit conditions in light and heavy textured soils, respectively. Overall, results suggest that the combined use of SMI, SPI, and NDVI anomaly is capable to provide a near-real-time indicator for water deficit conditions in light and heavy texture soils. Yield reduction was higher in lighttextured soils ranging from 6.1 to 34.5%. These results can further be used in devising tactics for the effective mitigation of drought.

TI  - New Remote Sensing Data on the Potential Presence of Permafrost in the Deosai Plateau in the Himalayan Portion of Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the presence of permafrost layer and its potential variation in the last three decades will be examined through the multitemporal analysis of satellite data in the area of the Deosai Plateau (Northern Pakistan). In the area, only global maps on the potential presence of permafrost layer are known. The results are based on the evaluation of variation of the number and water levels of the small lakes, and the changes of the extensions of the wetlands. The adopted methodology is based on the use of spectral indices and visual interpretation of a time-series data of Landsat images in the range 1990-2019, and on the processing of radar data from Sentinel 1 satellites, adopting new methods to extract the vertical displacement. The main findings are: (i) a high temporal dynamic of the number and surface areas of small lakes, and (ii) the evidence of a subduction in a wetland area (Black Hole), coherent with its extension, and suggesting the potential presence of a permafrost layer slowly degrading. This analysis can play a useful role on the management of the Deosai National Park (DNP), adopting careful measures for the human activities inside the park.

TI  - Predicting Earthquake-Induced Landslides by Using a Stochastic Modeling Approach: A Case Study of the 2001 El Salvador Coseismic Landslides
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In January and February 2001, El Salvador was hit by two strong earthquakes that triggered thousands of landslides, causing 1259 fatalities and extensive damage. The analysis of aerial and SPOT-4 satellite images allowed us to map 6491 coseismic landslides, mainly debris slides and flows that occurred in volcanic epiclastites and pyroclastites. Four different multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models were produced using different predictors and landslide inventories which contain slope failures triggered by an extreme rainfall event in 2009 and those induced by the earthquakes of 2001. In a predictive analysis, three validation scenarios were employed: the first and the second included 25% and 95% of the landslides, respectively, while the third was based on a k-fold spatial cross-validation. The results of our analysis revealed that: (i) the MARS algorithm provides reliable predictions of coseismic landslides; (ii) a better ability to predict coseismic slope failures was observed when including susceptibility to rainfall-triggered landslides as an independent variable; (iii) the best accuracy is achieved by models trained with both preparatory and trigger variables; (iv) an incomplete inventory of coseismic slope failures built just after the earthquake event can be used to identify potential locations of yet unreported landslides.

TI  - Improving Selection for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Among Patients With Melanoma
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Refining eligibility guidelines may identify more appropriate patients to undergo useful medical procedures.OBJECTIVE To improve cost-effectiveness in selecting patients with melanoma for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This hybrid prognostic study/decision analytical model was conducted among patients with melanoma who were eligible for SLNB at 2 melanoma centers from Australia and the US from 2000 to 2014. Participants consisted of 2 cohorts of patients with melanoma undergoing SLNB and a cohort of eligible patients without SLNB. Individualized probabilities of SLNB positivity generated by a patient-centered methodology (PCM) were compared with those generated by conventional multiple logistic regression analysis investigating 12 prognostic factors. Prognostic accuracy was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for each methodology and by matched-pair analyses.INTERVENTIONS Triaging appropriate patients to undergo SLNB.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Total number of SLNBs performed (giving total cost) vs number of SLNB-positive outcomes (a measure of effectiveness) was evaluated. Improved cost-effectiveness through judicious patient selection was interpreted as increased numbers of SLNB-positive outcomes achieved, decreased numbers of SLNBs performed, or both outcomes simultaneously.RESULTS Among 7331 patients with melanoma, SLNB outcomes were assessed in 3640 Australian patients (2212 males [60.8%]; 2447 aged >50 years [67.2%]) and 1342 US patients (774 males [57.7%]; 885 aged >50 years [66.0%]); 2349 patients eligible for SLNB who did not undergo the procedure were included in the simulation. PCM-generated probabilities achieved an AUROC of 0.803 in predicting SLNB positivity in the Australian cohort and 0.826 in the US cohort, higher than corresponding AUROCs generated by conventional logistic regression analysis. In simulation, adopting many SLNB-positive probabilities as minimally acceptable patient-selection criteria resulted in fewer procedures performed or increased the expected numbers of positive SLNBs. A minimally acceptable PCM-generated probability of 8.7% elicited the same number of SLNBs as historically performed (3640 SLNBs), with 1066 positive SLNBs (29.3%), constituting an improvement of 287 additional positive SLNBs compared with 779 actual positive SLNBs (36.8% improvement). In contrast, adopting a 23.7% PCM-generated minimum cutoff probability resulted in performing 1825 SLNBs, or 1815 fewer SLNBs than the actual experience (49.9%). It resulted in the same expected number of positive results (779 SLNBs), for a 42.7% positivity rate.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This prognostic study/decision analytical model found that the PCM approach outperformed conventional multiple logistic regression analysis in predicting which patients would have positive results on SLNB. These findings suggest that systematically producing and exploiting more accurate SLNB-positivity probabilities could improve the selection of patients with melanoma for SLNB compared with using established guidelines, thus improving the cost-effectiveness of the selection process. Eligibility guidelines to undergo SLNB should include a context-tailored minimum cutoff probability.

TI  - Integrating Active and Passive Remote Sensing Data for Mapping Soil Salinity Using Machine Learning and Feature Selection Approaches in Arid Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The prevention of soil salinization and managing agricultural irrigation depend greatly on accurately estimating soil salinity. Although the long-standing laboratory method of measuring salinity composition is accurate for determining soil salinity parameters, its use is frequently constrained by the high expense and difficulty of long-term in situ measurement. Soil salinity in the northern Nile Delta of Egypt severely affects agriculture sustainability and food security in Egypt. Understanding the spatial distribution of soil salinity is a critical factor for agricultural development and management in drylands. This research aims to improve soil salinity prediction by using a combined data collection method consisting of Sentinel-1 C radar data and Sentinel-2 optical data acquired simultaneously via integrated radar and optical sensor variables. The modelling approach focuses on feature selection strategies and regression learning. Feature selection approaches that include the filter, wrapper, and embedded methods were used with 47 selected variables depending on a genetic algorithm to scrutinize whether regions of the spectrum from optical indices and SAR texture choose the optimum combinations of selected variables. The sub-setting variables resulting from each feature selection method were used to train the regression learners' random forest (RF), linear regression (LR), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector regression (SVR). Combining the BPNN feature selection method with the RF regression learner better predicted soil salinity (RME 0.000246; sub-setting variables = 18). Integrating different remote sensing data and machine learning provides an opportunity to develop a robust prediction approach to predict soil salinity in drylands. This research evaluated the performances of various machine learning models, overcame the limitations of conventional techniques, and optimized the variable input combinations. This research can assist farmers in soil-salinization-affected areas in better managing planting procedures and enhancing the sustainability of their lands.

TI  - Improvement in crop mapping from satellite image time series by effectively supervising deep neural networks
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning methods have achieved promising results in crop mapping using satellite image time series. A challenge still remains on how to better learn discriminative feature representations to detect crop types when the model is applied to unseen data. To address this challenge and reveal the importance of proper supervision of deep neural networks in improving performance, we propose to supervise intermediate layers of a designed 3D Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) by employing two middle supervision methods: Cross-entropy loss Middle Supervision (CE-MidS) and a novel middle supervision method, namely Supervised Contrastive loss Middle Supervision (SupCon-MidS). This method pulls together features belonging to the same class in embedding space, while pushing apart features from different classes. We demonstrate that SupCon-MidS enhances feature discrimination and clustering throughout the network, thereby improving the network performance. In addition, we employ two output supervision methods, namely F1 loss and Intersection Over Union (IOU) loss. Our experiments on identifying corn, soybean, and the class Other from Landsat image time series in the U.S. corn belt show that the best set-up of our method, namely IOU+SupCon-MidS, is able to outperform the state-of-the-art methods by mIOU scores of 3.5% and 0.5% on average when testing its accuracy across a different year (local test) and different regions (spatial test), respectively. Further, adding SupCon-MidS to the output supervision methods improves mIOU scores by 1.2% and 7.6% on average in local and spatial tests, respectively. We conclude that proper supervision of deep neural networks plays a significant role in improving crop mapping performance.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The 80-kilometer-long Vembanad Lake in Kerala, India, is a Ramsar site. Eutrophication is deteriorating its water quality and threatening its biodiversity. In this study, satellite imageries of Sentinel 2A and Landsat 8 OLI were utilized to determine its water quality. Various data sets of the water quality parameters viz. pH, Electrical conductivity, TSS, TDS, BOD, DO, chloride etc. are analyzed and interpreted. Regression models were developed on the parameters taken up for water quality analysis. The empirical R2 values of the developed models evidenced the accuracy of the developed mdoels. The findings show that remote sensing images are reliable for analyzing surface water quality characteristics. The comparative analysis of the model developed illustrated the effectiveness of using the imaging systems mentioned above for water quality index estimation through remote sensing.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigated the quality of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data to measure surface displacements in upstate New York, an area with dense vegetation, snowy winters, and strong seasonal signals. We used data from the German Space Agency's TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X satellites (X-band, 3.1 cm radar wavelength) as well as the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellite (C-band, 5.6 cm radar wavelength); both datasets covered a similar to 3-year time period from 2018 to 2021. Using persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI), we were able to observe several deforming features in the region with sub-centimeter/year deformation rates. We also examined a version of the X-band data that we spatially averaged to the same pixel size as the Sentinel-1 imagery in order to separate out the effects of wavelength and pixel size on PSI accuracy and coverage. Overall, the largest number of stable PS points was found in the full-resolution X-band data, which was followed by the C-band data and then by the downsampled X-band data. Our analysis also included a subset of snow-free imagery so that we could assess the effect that snow-covered images had on the distribution and accuracy of PS points and the resulting time series. This analysis revealed that PS populations increased by 50-60% for the snow-free data when compared with analyses using the full datasets. The average deformation rates inferred from the time series generated using only snow-free images were nearly identical to those estimated from the full time series. We assessed the accuracy of the inferred rates through comparisons between the results of different datasets and with limited ground survey data. We found that all of the inferred deformation rates from each of the datasets agreed with in situ measurements in an area of known ground subsidence above an underground salt mine in Lansing, NY. The S1 datasets, however, had higher levels of noise.

TI  - Determination of Accurate Dynamic Topography for the Baltic Sea Using Satellite Altimetry and a Marine Geoid Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate determination of dynamic topography (DT) is expected to quantify a realistic sea surface with respect to its vertical datum and in identifying sub-mesoscale features of ocean dynamics. This study explores a method that derives DT by using satellite altimetry (SA) in conjunction with a high-resolution marine geoid model. To assess the method, DT was computed using along-track SA from Sentinel- 3A (S3A), Sentinel-3B (S3B), and Jason-3 (JA3), then compared with DT derived from a tide-gauge-corrected hydrodynamic model (HDM) for the period 2017-2019 over the Baltic Sea. Comparison of SA-derived DT and corrected HDM showed average discrepancies in the range of +/- 20 cm, with root mean square errors of 9 cm (for S3B) and 6 cm (for S3A and JA6) and a standard deviation between 2 and 16 cm. Inter-comparisons between data sources and multi-mission SA over the Baltic Sea also potentially identified certain persistent and semi-persistent problematic areas that are either associated with deficiencies in the geoid, tide gauge, HDM, and SA or a combination of all of these. In addition, it was observed that SA data have the potential to show a more realistic (detailed) variation of DT compared to HDM, which tended to generate only a smooth (low-pass) surface and underestimate DT.

TI  - Mapping the Lymphatic Drainage Pattern of Esophageal Cancer with Near-Infrared Fluorescent Imaging during Robotic Assisted Minimally Invasive Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy (RAMIE)-First Results of the Prospective ESOMAP Feasibility Trial
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary While the sentinel lymph node concept is routinely applied in other surgical fields, no established and valid modality for lymph node mapping for esophageal cancer surgery currently exists. Near-infrared light fluorescence (NIR) using indocyanine green (ICG) has been recently proven to be a safe technology for peritumoral injection and consecutive lymph node mapping in small cohorts. The aim of this study was to identify the lymphatic drainage pattern of esophageal cancer during robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) and to correlate the intraoperative images with the histopathological dissemination of lymphatic metastases. n = 20 patients were included in the study, and feasibility and safety for the application of NIR using ICG during robotic-assisted minimally invasive RAMIE were shown. We conclude that RAMIE can be safely combined with NIR to detect lymph node metastases. Further analyses in our center will focus on the ICG-positive tissue as well as quantification and long-term follow-up data. While the sentinel lymph node concept is routinely applied in other surgical fields, no established and valid modality for lymph node mapping for esophageal cancer surgery currently exists. Near-infrared light fluorescence (NIR) using indocyanine green (ICG) has been recently proven to be a safe technology for peritumoral injection and consecutive lymph node mapping in small surgical cohorts, mostly without the usage of robotic technology. The aim of this study was to identify the lymphatic drainage pattern of esophageal cancer during highly standardized RAMIE and to correlate the intraoperative images with the histopathological dissemination of lymphatic metastases. Patients with clinically advanced stage squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus undergoing a RAMIE at our Center of Excellence for Surgery of the Upper Gastrointestinal Tract were prospectively included in this study. Patients were admitted on the day prior to surgery, and an additional EGD with endoscopic injection of the ICG solution around the tumor was performed. Intraoperative imaging procedures were performed using the Stryker 1688 or the FIREFLY fluorescence imaging system, and resected lymph nodes were sent to pathology. A total of 20 patients were included in the study, and feasibility and safety for the application of NIR using ICG during RAMIE were shown. NIR imaging to detect lymph node metastases can be safely performed during RAMIE. Further analyses in our center will focus on pathological analyses of ICG-positive tissue and quantification using artificial intelligence tools with a correlation of long-term follow-up data.

TI  - Upstream River Erosion vis-a-vis Sediments Variability in Hugli Estuary, India: A Geospatial Approach
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data shows that the Bhagirathi-Hugli River's riverbank has faced severe erosion during the last decades (1990 to 2020), with the middle stretch of the river being more prone to erosion. This huge sediment load derived from upstream erosion is coming to the estuary. The suspended sediment concentration dynamics of the Hugli estuary were calculated using in-situ data and remote sensing reflectance by establishing a linear regression. A continuous huge sediment load is found in the estuarine water. The sediment concentration was higher pre-monsoon than post-monsoon as the region is highly influenced by monsoonal rainfall and runoff. The sediment concentration was also higher in the estuary's southwestern section than in the northern part. The impact of this high sediment load contributes to the deposition. This depositional area assessment was performed using an object-based classification approach called Support Vector Machine utilizing Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix to create cluster textural indices. Despite the impact of continuous sea level rise in the estuary, the result shows that effective island and Chars areas have increased in the past decade due to the upstream erosion-driven sediments.

TI  - Temporal Synchrony in Satellite-Derived Ocean Parameters in the Inner Sea of Chiloe, Northern Patagonia, Chile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial synchrony occurs when geographically separated time series exhibit correlated temporal variability. Studies of synchrony between different environmental variables within marine ecosystems worldwide have highlighted the extent of system responses to exogenous large-scale forcing. However, these spatial connections remain largely unstudied in marine systems, particularly complex coastlines, where a paucity of field observations precludes the analysis of time series. Here, we used time-frequency analyses based on wavelet and wavelet coherence (WC) analysis to quantify the synchrony (co-variations) between environmental time series derived from MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) in the topographically complex inner sea of Chiloe (ISC, 41-44 degrees S) for the 2003-2022 period. We find that the strength of the synchrony between chlorophyll a (Chla) and turbid river plumes (for which we use remote sensing reflectance at 645 nm, Rrs(645)) varies between the northern and southern areas of the ISC; higher synchrony, measured as the WC between these variables, is observed along the northern basin where water and particle exchanges with the Pacific Ocean are reduced. The WC analysis showed higher synchrony between these variables, with dominant periodicities of 0.5 and 1 year resulting from the hydrological regime of the freshwater input in the area that persisted throughout the 2004-2018 period. Our results suggest that the strong and significant spatial synchrony at the regional scale is likely related to the phases of large-scale climatic oscillations, as inferred through the partial wavelet coherence analysis. Potential mechanisms driving spatial synchrony are discussed in the context of climate and oceanographic regimes in the area.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Floating Macroalgae via Adaptive Thresholding Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Data with 10 m Spatial Resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive floating macroalgae have drifted from the East China Sea to Japan's offshore area, and field observation cannot sufficiently grasp their extensive spatial and temporal changes. High-spatial-resolution satellite data, which contain multiple spectral bands, have advanced remote sensing analysis. Several indexes for recognizing vegetation in satellite images, namely, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and floating algae index (FAI), are useful for detecting floating macroalgae. Thresholds are defined to separate macroalgae-containing image pixels from other pixels, and adaptive thresholding increases the reliability of image segmentation. This study proposes adaptive thresholding using Sentinel-2 satellite data with a 10 m spatial resolution. We compare the abilities of Otsu's, exclusion, and standard deviation methods to define the floating macroalgae detection thresholds of NDVI, NDWI, and FAI images. This comparison determines the most advantageous method for the automatic detection of floating macroalgae. Finally, the spatial coverage of floating macroalgae and the reproducible combination needed for the automatic detection of floating macroalgae in Kagoshima, Japan, are examined.

TI  - Longitudinal changes in the prevalence of adult asthma: An epidemiological survey among Japanese salaried employees and their dependents using healthcare insurance claim from 1999 to 2019
T2  - ALLERGOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Information on changes in asthma prevalence and the treatment status for asthma is used as basic information for taking medical and administrative measures against asthma. However, this information among adults is relatively limited.Methods: To elucidate changes in the prevalence of asthma and treatment status over time among Japanese adults, health insurance claim data from some health insurance societies covering salaried employees and their dependents were studied longitudinally. Claim data from FY1999 to 2007 were obtained from two health insurance societies, and data from FY 2011 to 2019 were obtained from three different health insurance societies, and changes in standardized asthma prevalence among subjects aged 20-59 years, proportion of asthma patients prescribed ICS, leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), and LABA, and the mean number of acute asthma exacerbations per year were analyzed. Results: The prevalence of asthma increased from 1.6% in 1999 to 3.0% in 2007 and 2.9% in 2011 to 4.6% in 2019. Increased trends in asthma prevalence from 2011 to 2019 were more noticeable in subjects in their 50s than those in their 20s for both sexes. The number of emergency visits related to asthma was 1.5 per year in 1999, which decreased to 0.8 per year in 2019. The proportion of people prescribed all antiasthma medications (ICS, LTRA, and LABA) increased over time.Conclusions: The prevalence of adult asthma among Japanese salaried employees and their dependents has increased over the last 20 years, suggesting more attention should be paid to the prevention of this disease in adults.

TI  - The Detection of Nitrogen Saturation for Real-Time Fertilization Management within a Grassland Ecosystem
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Unfettered agricultural activities have severely degraded vast areas of grasslands over the last decade. To rehabilitate and restore the productivity in affected grasslands, rangeland management practices still institute vast nitrogen-based fertilization regimes. However, excessive fertilization can often have damaging environmental effects. Over-fertilization can lead to nitrogen saturation. Although early indicators of nitrogen saturation have been documented, research detailing the near-real-time nitrogen saturation status of grasslands is required to better facilitate management protocols and optimize biomass production within degraded grasslands. Hence, the aim of this study was to discriminate nitrogen-saturated tropical grasses grown under a diverse fertilization treatment trial, using Worldview-3 satellite imagery and decision tree techniques. To accomplish this, nitrogen-saturated plots were first identified through specific physiological-based criteria. Thereafter, Worldview-3 satellite imagery (400-1040 nm) and decision tree techniques were applied to discriminate between nitrogen-saturated and -unsaturated grassland plots. The results showed net nitrate (NO3--N) concentrations and net pH levels to be significantly different (a = 0.05) between saturated and non-saturated plots. Moreover, the random forest model (overall accuracy of 91%) demonstrated a greater ability to classify saturated plots as opposed to the classification and regression tree method (overall accuracy of 79%). The most important variables for classifying saturated plots were identified as: the Red-Edge (705-745 nm), Coastal (400-450 nm), Near-Infrared 3 (838-950 nm), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index 3 (NDVI3). These results provide a framework to assist rangeland managers in identifying grasslands within the initial stages of nitrogen saturation. This will enable fertilization treatments to be adjusted in near-real-time according to ecosystem demand and thereby maintain the health and longevity of Southern African grasslands.

TI  - Aerosol Variability at Coastal Bhola Island (Bangladesh), an IGP Outflow Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol optical depth (AOD) and angstrom ngstrom parameters are recognised to be pivotal factors in understanding the status of ambient aerosol concentrations over a certain place and depend not only on the local but also on large-scale atmospheric dynamics. Aerosol climatology was undertaken across coastal Bhola Island for 7 years (2014-2021), using data from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). This study provides a protracted scrutiny of daily, monthly, seasonal and interannual variations of the AOD and angstrom ngstrom parameters for Bhola. The observed columnar AOD was analysed to offer a hitherto unknown temporal picture of trends in aerosol pollution over Bhola. During the study period (2014-2021), the AOD value increased from 2015-2019 to 2020-2021. The AOD value was >= 0.70 except for 2014-2015 and 2019-2020. The seasonal mean AOD over Bhola was > 0.3, highest in January and February (winter) and lowest in July (monsoon). Coarse-mode fractions during winter and fine-mode fractions during rest, corroborate the seasonal pattern of AODs and a (angstrom ngstrom wavelength exponent). The average a was found to be[ 1 during the inter-annual comparison, implying the ubiety and predominance of fine-mode aerosol. The average alpha' (second order angstrom ngstrom exponent) value was positive, with an overall cumulative count of 90% of the data having positive alpha' validating the pre-eminence of fine-mode aerosols. The beta (angstrom ngstrom turbidity coefficient) value proportionally varied with respect to AOD, whereas it was inversely proportional to the alpha at a broader wavelength. The average beta varied between 0.2 and 0.4. The aerosols detected over the Bhola are of metropolitan/industrial, maritime, biomass combustion and dust origins, with proportionate inputs varying in various seasons. The current study data will be used for future investigations of Bhola's aerosols, pollution load, climate and atmospheric environment. Thus, this study is important as it facilitates the baseline data for policymakers and model simulation for pollution load and climate change analysis.

TI  - Drug Resistance Molecular Markers of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and Severity of Malaria in Febrile Children in the Sentinel Site for Malaria Surveillance of Melen in Gabon: Additional Data from the Plasmodium Diversity Network African Network
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between the frequency of artemisinin-based combination (ACT) drug resistance molecular markers and clinical forms of P. falciparum malaria and parasitemia. A cross-sectional study was carried out between January and April 2014 at the Operational Clinical Research Unit of Melen in febrile children aged 12 to 240 months with a Plasmodium sp. infection. A total of 3 mL of peripheral blood collected from an EDTA tube was used for leukocyte depletion. DNA mutation detection was performed by next generation sequencing (NGS). A total of 1075 patients were screened for malaria. Among them, 384 had a Plasmodium infection. P. falciparum mono-infection was found in 98.9% of the patients. Pfcrt-326T mutation was found in all isolates, while 37.9% had Pfmdr2-484I mutant allele. The highest median parasite densities were found in patients infected by parasites carrying the CVIET haplotype of the Pfcrt gene. The different genetic profiles found here, and their variations according to clinical and biological signs of severe malaria, are additional arguments for the surveillance of P. falciparum strains.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon Stock Prediction: Fate under 2050 Climate Scenarios, the Case of Eastern Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil Organic carbon (SOC) is vital to the soil's ecosystem functioning as well as improving soil fertility. Slight variation in C in the soil has significant potential to be either a source of CO2 in the atmosphere or a sink to be stored in the form of soil organic matter. However, modeling SOC spatiotemporal changes was challenging due to lack of data to represent the high spatial heterogeneity in soil properties. Less expensive techniques, digital soil mapping (DSM) combined with space-for-time substitution (SFTS), were applied to predict the present and projected SOC stock for temperature and rainfall projections under different climate scenarios represented by the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5). The relationship between environmental covariates (n = 16) and measured SOC stock (148 samples) was developed using a random forest model. Then, the temporal changes in SOC stock over the baseline were developed for the top 30 cm soil depth of the selected districts (Chiro Zuria, Kuni, Gemechis and Mieso) of West Hararghe Zone at 30 m resolution. The model validation using the random sample of 20% of the data showed that the model explained 44% of the variance (R-2) with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.96, a mean error (ME) of 0.16, and a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.88. Temperature was the most important predictor factor influencing the spatial distribution of SOC stock. An overall net gain of SOC stock over the present C stock was expected in the study area by 2050. The gain in areas with the lower baseline SOC stock counterbalanced the loss in areas with the higher baseline stock. The changes in the SOC stock depended on land use land cover (LULC), soil type, and agro-ecological zones. By 2050, cropland is supposed to lose its SOC stock under all RCPs; therefore, appropriate decisions are crucial to compensate for the loss of C.

TI  - Creation of a Walloon Pasture Monitoring Platform Based on Machine Learning Models and Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing data and the implementation of machine learning (ML) algorithms is growing in pasture management. In this study, ML models predicting the available compressed sward height (CSH) in Walloon pastures based on Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and meteorological data were developed to be integrated into a decision support system (DSS). Given the area covered (>4000 km(2) of pastures of 100 m(2) pixels), the consequent challenge of computation time and power requirements was overcome by the development of a platform predicting CSH throughout Wallonia. Four grazing seasons were covered in the current study (between April and October from 2018 to 2021, the mean predicted CSH per parcel per date ranged from 48.6 to 67.2 mm, and the coefficient of variation from 0 to 312%, suggesting a strong heterogeneity of variability of CSH between parcels. Further exploration included the number of predictions expected per grazing season and the search for temporal and spatial patterns and consistency. The second challenge tackled is the poor data availability for concurrent acquisition, which was overcome through the inclusion of up to 4-day-old data to fill data gaps up to the present time point. For this gap filling methodology, relevancy decreased as the time window width increased, although data with 4-day time lag values represented less than 4% of the total data. Overall, two models stood out, and further studies should either be based on the random forest model if they need prediction quality or on the cubist model if they need continuity. Further studies should focus on developing the DSS and on the conversion of CSH to actual forage allowance.

TI  - Assessing the National Representativeness of Estimates of Antimicrobial-Resistant Urogenital <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> in US Men, Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project, 2008-2018
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The percentage of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) isolates with resistance or elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations to antimicrobials has steadily increased. Current estimates are based on the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), a sentinel surveillance study of male GC in the United States. This analysis seeks to assess for adjustment before treating aggregated GISP estimates as nationally representative of all reported male urogenital infections.Methods: We used multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) to compute national estimates of the proportion of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) (defined as exceeding minimum inhibitory concentration thresholds) in male GC using data from 2008 to 2018 GISP and case reports. Sensitivity analyses investigated the impact of analysis assumptions and unmeasured variables. We additionally produced estimates of 2018 AMR GC cases among US men.Results: National estimates were consistent with unweighted estimates. The estimated proportion of incident AMR GC infections in men with urogenital GC in 2018 was 51.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.1%-52.9%), equating to an estimated 366,300 incident AMR GC infections in US men aged 15 to 39 years. Estimates of AMR for tested antimicrobials in male GC infections in 2018 ranged from 0.16% (95% CI, 0.08%-0.24%) for ceftriaxone to 29.9% (95% CI, 28.6%-31.1%) for ciprofloxacin. Sensitivity analyses revealed that unmeasured data on sex of sex partners could substantially impact weighted estimates.Conclusions: Antimicrobial resistance among reported incident male urogenital GC infections remains rare for ceftriaxone, the current standard of care. Aggregated GISP data are generally representative of men in the US who are reported with urogenital gonorrhea.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Improved WCM Technique for Soil Moisture Retrieval with Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The water cycle around the globe is significantly impacted by the moisture in the soil. However, finding a quick and practical model to cope with the enormous amount of data is a difficult issue for remote sensing practitioners. The traditional methods of measuring soil moisture are inefficient at large sizes, which can be replaced by remote sensing techniques for obtaining soil moisture. While determining the soil moisture, the low return frequency of satellites and the lack of images pose a severe challenge to the current remote sensing techniques. Therefore, this paper suggested a novel technique for Soil Moisture Retrieval. In the initial phase, image acquisition is made. Then, VI indexes (NDVI, GLAI, Green NDVI (GNDVI), and WDRVI features) are derived. Further, an improved Water Cloud Model (WCM) is deployed as a vegetation impact rectification scheme. Finally, soil moisture retrieval is determined by the hybrid model combining Deep Max Out Network (DMN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) schemes, whose outputs are then passed on to enhanced score level fusion that offers final results. According to the results, the RMSE of the Hybrid Classifier (Bi-GRU and DMN) method was lower (0.9565) than the RMSE of the Hybrid Classifier methods. The ME values of the HC (Bi-GRU and DMN) were also lower (0.728697) than those of the HC methods without the vegetation index, the HC methods without the presence of water clouds, and the HC methods with traditional water clouds. In comparison to HC (Bi-GRU and DMN), the HC method without vegetation index has a lower error of 0.8219 than the HC method with standard water cloud and the HC method without water cloud.

TI  - Accelerated Glacier Area Loss in the Zhetysu (Dzhungar) Alatau Range (Tien Shan) for the Period of 1956-2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An updated glacier inventory is important for understanding the current glacier dynamics in the conditions of actual accelerating glacier retreat observed around the world. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the glaciation areas of the Zhetysu Alatau Range (Tien Shan) for 1956-2016 using well-established semiautomatic methods based on the band ratios. The total glacier area decreased by 49 +/- 2.8% or by 399 +/- 11.2 km(2) from 813.6 +/- 22.8 km(2) to 414.6 +/- 11.6 km(2) during 1956-2016, while the number of glaciers increased from 985 to 813. Similar rates of area change characterized the periods 1956-2001, 2001-2012, 2012-2016, and 2001-2016: -296.2 +/- 8.3 (-0.8% a(-1)), -63.7 +/- 1.8 (-1.1% a(-1)), -39.1 +/- 1.1 (-2.2% a(-1)) and -102.8 +/- 2.9 (-1.3% a(-1)) km(2), respectively. The mean glacier size decreased from 0.57 km(2) in 2001 to 0.51 km(2) in 2016. Most glaciation areas of the Zhetysu Alatau faced north (north, northwest, and northeast), covered 390.35 +/- 11 km(2), and were located in altitudes between 3000 and 4000 m.a.s.l. With shrinkage rates of about -0.8% and -1.3% a(-1) for the periods of 1956-2001 and 2001-2016, our results show that study area has the highest shrinkage rate compared to other glacierized areas of Central Asian mountains, including Altai, Pamir, and even the inner ranges of Tien Shan. It was found that a significant increase in temperature (0.12 degrees C/10 years) plays a main role in the state of glaciers.

TI  - Epidemiology of Lyme Borreliosis in France in Primary Care and Hospital Settings, 2010-2019
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a growing public health concern requiring accurate and comprehensive epidemiological knowledge to inform health care interventions. This study compared the epidemiology of LB in primary care and hospital settings, using for the first time in France three sources of data, and highlighted specific populations at higher risk of developing LB.Methods: This study analyzed data from general practitioner networks (i.e., Sentinel network, Electronic Medical Records [EMR]) and the national hospital discharge database to describe the LB epidemiology from 2010 to 2019.Results: The average annual incidence rates of LB in primary care increased from 42.3 cases/100,000 population in 2010-2012 to 83.0/100,000 in 2017-2019 for the Sentinel Network and 42.7/100,000 to 74.6/100,000 for the EMR, following a marked rise in 2016. The annual hospitalization rate remained stable from 2012 to 2019 fluctuating between 1.6 and 1.8 hospitalizations/100,000. Women were more likely to present with LB in primary care setting compared with men (male-to-female incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.92), whereas men were predominant among hospitalizations (IRR = 1.4), with the largest discordance among adolescents aged 10-14 years (IRR = 1.8) and adults aged 80 years and older (IRR = 2.5). In 2017-2019, the average annual incidence rate peaked among persons aged 60-69 years in primary care (>125/100,000) and aged 70-79 years among hospitalized patients (3.4/100,000). A second peak occurred in children aged 0-4 or 5-9 years depending on sources. Incidence rates in Limousin and the north-eastern regions were the highest for both primary care and hospital settings.Conclusions: Analyses showed disparities in the evolution of incidence, sex-specific incidence rates, and predominant age groups between primary care and hospital settings that merit further exploration.

TI  - Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Esophageal Cancer: Current and Future
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been widely used to treat superficial esophageal cancer. The advantages of esophageal ESD include a high en bloc resection rate and accurate pathological diagnosis. It enables local resection of the primary tumor and accurate identification of the risk factors for lymph node metastasis, including depth, vascular invasion, and types of invasion. Even in cases with clinical T1b-SM cancer, ESD and additional treatment can achieve radical cure, depending on the risk of lymph node metastasis. Esophageal ESD will be increasingly vital in minimally invasive and effective esophageal cancer treatment. This article describes the current status and prospects of esophageal ESD.

TI  - Using Landsat Image Series to Identify and Characterize Persistent Oceanographic Structures in a Dynamic Marine Protected Area (North of San Jorge Gulf, Argentinian Patagonia)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal oceanographic processes, like up- and downwelling, topographic fronts, etc., have consequences in biological communities. In some cases, these processes show up as surface structures observable in satellite imagery at different scales. In this work, we focus on the persistent structures observed in the coastal marine protected area of Parque Interjurisdiccional Marino-Costero Patagonia Austral (PIMCPA), one of the most relevant areas of the Argentine coast in terms of biodiversity and productivity. Using 80 Landsat-8 30 m-resolution images from the years 2017-2021, more than 20 structures were identified in the PIMCPA that appear consistently across seasons in approximately the same areas. We focus on four of them, those that are persistent and of medium scale, whose dimensions do not extend in most cases more than 10 km from their region of generation, and describe their location and shape in detail, and analyze their dependence on forcing variables such as tides, wind, bathymetry, and seasonality. Tidal currents prove to be the most significant variable in the formation and evolution of the structures described, above wind or seasonal stratification, which play only a secondary role.

TI  - InSAR-Based Early Warning Monitoring Framework to Assess Aquifer Deterioration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquifer surveillance is key to understanding the dynamics of groundwater reservoirs. Attention should be focused on developing strategies to monitor and mitigate the adverse consequences of overexploitation. In this context, ground surface deformation monitoring allows us to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater levels, determine the recharge times of the aquifers, and calibrate the hydrological models. This study proposes a methodology for implementing advanced multitemporal differential interferometry (InSAR) techniques for water withdrawal surveillance and early warning assessment. For this, large open-access images were used, a total of 145 SAR images from the Sentinel 1 C-band satellite provided by the Copernicus mission of the European Space Agency. InSAR processing was carried out with an algorithm based on parallel computing technology implemented in cloud infrastructure, optimizing complex workflows and processing times. The surveillance period records 6-years of satellite observation from September 2016 to December 2021 over the city of Chillan (Chile), an area exposed to urban development and intensive agriculture, where similar to 80 wells are located. The groundwater flow path spans from the Andes Mountain range to the Pacific Ocean, crossing the Itata river basin in the Chilean central valley. InSAR validation measurements were carried out by comparing the results with the values of continuous GNSS stations available in the area of interest. The performance analysis is based on spatial analysis, time series, meteorological stations data, and static level measurements, as well as hydrogeological structure. The results indicate seasonal variations in winter and summer, which corresponds to the recovery and drawdown periods with velocities > -10 mm/year, and an aquifer deterioration trend of up to 60 mm registered in the satellite SAR observation period. Our results show an efficient tool to monitor aquifer conditions, including irreversible consolidation and storage capacity loss, allowing timely decision making to avoid harmful exploitation.

TI  - Analysis of Spectral Separability for Detecting Burned Areas Using Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS Images under Different Biomes in Brazil and Portugal
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is one of the natural agents with the greatest impact on the terrestrial ecosystem and plays an important ecological role in a large part of the terrestrial surface. Remote sensing is an important technique applied in mapping and monitoring changes in forest landscapes affected by fires. This study presents a spectral separability analysis for the detection of burned areas using Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS images in the context of fires that occurred in different biomes of Brazil (dry ecosystem) and Portugal (temperate forest). The research is based on a fusion of spectral indices and automatic classification algorithms scientifically proven to be effective with as little human interaction as possible. The separability index (M) and the Reed-Xiaoli automatic anomaly detection classifier (RXD) allowed the evaluation of the spectral separability and the thematic accuracy of the burned areas for the different spectral indices tested (Burn Area Index (BAI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Mid-Infrared Burn Index (MIRBI), Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2), Normalized Burned Index (NBI), and Normalized Burn Ratio Thermal (NBRT)). The analysis parameters were based on spatial dispersion with validation data, commission error (CE), omission error (OE), and the Sorensen-Dice coefficient (DC). The results indicated that the indices based exclusively on the SWIR1 and SWIR2 bands showed a high degree of separability and were more suitable for detecting burned areas, although it was observed that the characteristics of the soil affected the performance of the indices. The classification method based on bitemporal anomalous changes using the RXD anomaly proved to be effective in increasing the burned area in terms of temporal alteration and performing unsupervised detection without relying on the ground truth. On the other hand, the main limitations of RXD were observed in non-abrupt changes, which is very common in fires with low spectral signal, especially in the context of using Landsat-8 images with a 16-day revisit period. The results obtained in this work were able to provide critical information for fire mapping algorithms and for an accurate post-fire spatial estimation in dry ecosystems and temperate forests. The study presents a new comparative approach to classify burned areas in dry ecosystems and temperate forests with the least possible human interference, thus helping investigations when there is little available data on fires in addition to favoring a reduction in fieldwork and gross errors in the classification of burned areas.

TI  - Genomic Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in Healthcare Workers: A Critical Sentinel Group for Monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 Variant Shift
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 genome surveillance is important for monitoring risk groups and health workers as well as data on new cases and mortality rate due to COVID-19. We characterized the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants from May 2021 to April 2022 in the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil, and evaluated the similarity between variants present in the population and healthcare workers (HCW). A total of 5291 sequenced genomes demonstrated the circulation of 55 strains and four variants of concern (Alpha, Delta, Gamma and Omicron-sublineages BA.1 and BA.2). The number of cases was relatively low in May 2021, but the number of deaths was higher with the Gamma variant. There was a significant increase in both numbers between December 2021 and February 2022, peaking in mid-January 2022, when the Omicron variant dominated. After May 2021, two distinct variant groups (Delta and Omicron) were observed, equally distributed among the five Santa Catarina mesoregions. Moreover, from November 2021 to February 2022, similar variant profiles between HCW and the general population were observed, and a quicker shift from Delta to Omicron in HCW than in the general population. This demonstrates the importance of HCW as a sentinel group for monitoring disease trends in the general population.

TI  - Simulation of Space Weathering on Asteroid Spectra through Hydrogen Ion Irradiation of Meteorites
T2  - PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Space weathering can be defined as the combination of physical and chemical changes that occur in material exposed to an interplanetary environment on the surface of airless bodies. This process results in alterations in material spectroscopic features. Eventually, it can lead to misinterpretation of remotely sensed data in the visible-near-infrared wavelength range. This study simulates the solar wind effect on asteroid spectra through low-energy 1 keV H+ irradiation of meteorite pressed-powder samples under three fluences, 2 x 10(17), 5 x 10(17), and 1 x 10(18) H+ cm(-2), and evaluates changes associated with reflectance spectra. The meteorites subjected to the study are Bjurbole (L/LL4), Avanhandava (H4), and Luotolax (howardite). The most prominent changes in all three meteorites are (1) a decrease of 550 nm reflectance, (2) reddening in the 1 mu m region, and (3) a monotonous decrease in absorption band strengths in Bjurbole. No significant changes were observed in the 2 mu m region. The results imply that at short timescales (10(2)-10(3) yr), radiation damage as amorphization and vesicle formation caused by low-energy solar wind is the dominant space weathering factor in all three meteorite compositions, causing spectral changes predominantly in the 1 mu m region.

TI  - Response of Guobu Slope Displacement to Rainfall and Reservoir Water Level with Time-Series InSAR and Wavelet Analysis
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoir bank landslides are a frequent phenomenon, and the stability of these landslides is affected by two essential factors: rainfall and reservoir level changes. Studying the response patterns of reservoir bank landslide movements to these variables is crucial in preventing their occurrence and mitigating their effects. To this end, this study employed 103 European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus Sentinel-1 images and the SBAS-InSAR (small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar) technique to obtain a time series of the Guobu slope deformation from September 2015 to December 2019. The Guobu slope showed significant toppling damage. The satellite line of sight (LOS) detected a maximum subsidence rate of -447 mm/y (the negative sign indicates movement away from the satellite, i.e., subsidence) in the upper section of the slope. Subsequently, three wavelet tools were used to quantitatively analyze the effect of rainfall and reservoir water level on the deformation of the Guobu slope. The results demonstrate a positive correlation between rainfall and the deformation of the Guobu slope. Moreover, the deformation lags behind the rainfall by approximately 70 days. In contrast, the reservoir water level and the deformation of the Guobu slope exhibit an inverse relationship. The deformation of the leading edge of the slope body lags behind the reservoir level by approximately 19 days, while the middle and upper sections of the slope body, which have the most significant rate of variability, lag by about 80 days. Among these factors, rainfall plays a dominant role in the deformation of the Guobu slope, while reservoir levels play a synergistic role. The findings of this study highlight the importance of monitoring and understanding the impact of changes in rainfall and reservoir water levels on the stability of reservoir bank landslides. This understanding is crucial in preventing the occurrence of such landslides and minimizing their impact. The use of remote sensing techniques, together with wavelet analysis, enables the accurate and timely monitoring of the deformation of the Guobu slope, providing valuable insights for disaster warnings and disaster prevention and reduction efforts.

TI  - Satellite Data Potentialities in Solid Waste Landfill Monitoring: Review and Case Studies
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing can represent an important instrument for monitoring landfills and their evolution over time. In general, remote sensing can offer a global and rapid view of the Earth's surface. Thanks to a wide variety of heterogeneous sensors, it can provide high-level information, making it a useful technology for many applications. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a review of relevant methods based on remote sensing for landfill identification and monitoring. The methods found in the literature make use of measurements acquired from both multi-spectral and radar sensors and exploit vegetation indexes, land surface temperature, and backscatter information, either separately or in combination. Moreover, additional information can be provided by atmospheric sounders able to detect gas emissions (e.g., methane) and hyperspectral sensors. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the full potential of Earth observation data for landfill monitoring, this article also provides applications of the main procedures presented to selected test sites. These applications highlight the potentialities of satellite-borne sensors for improving the detection and delimitation of landfills and enhancing the evaluation of waste disposal effects on environmental health. The results revealed that a single-sensor-based analysis can provide significant information on the landfill evolution. However, a data fusion approach that incorporates data acquired from heterogeneous sensors, including visible/near infrared, thermal infrared, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), can result in a more effective instrument to fully support the monitoring of landfills and their effect on the surrounding area. In particular, the results show that a synergistic use of multispectral indexes, land surface temperature, and the backscatter coefficient retrieved from SAR sensors can improve the sensitivity to changes in the spatial geometry of the considered site.

TI  - A Review of Deep-Learning Methods for Change Detection in Multispectral Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing is a tool of interest for a large variety of applications. It is becoming increasingly more useful with the growing amount of available remote sensing data. However, the large amount of data also leads to a need for improved automated analysis. Deep learning is a natural candidate for solving this need. Change detection in remote sensing is a rapidly evolving area of interest that is relevant for a number of fields. Recent years have seen a large number of publications and progress, even though the challenge is far from solved. This review focuses on deep learning applied to the task of change detection in multispectral remote-sensing images. It provides an overview of open datasets designed for change detection as well as a discussion of selected models developed for this task-including supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised. Furthermore, the challenges and trends in the field are reviewed, and possible future developments are considered.

TI  - Mapping CO2 Emissions Using SNPP/VIIRS Nighttime Light and Vegetation Index in the Korean Peninsula
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As climate change problem has recently become serious, studies are being conducted to identify carbon dioxide (CO2) emission dynamics based on satellite data to reduce emissions. It is also very important to analyze spatial patterns by estimating and mapping CO2 emissions dynamic. Therefore, in this study, CO2 emissions in the Korean Peninsula from 2013 to 2020 were estimated and mapped. To spatially estimate and map emissions, we use the enhanced vegetation index adjusted nighttime light index, an index that combines nighttime light (NTL) and vegetation index, to map both areas where NTL is observed and areas where NTL is not observed. In order to spatially estimate and map CO2 emissions, the total annual emissions of the Korean Peninsula were calculated, resulting in an increase of 11% from 2013 to 2017 and a decrease of 13% from 2017 to 2020. As a result of the mapping, it was confirmed that the spatial pattern of CO2 emissions in the Korean Peninsula were concentrated in urban areas. After being divided into 17 regions, which included the downtown area, the metropolitan area accounted for roughly 40% of CO2 emissions in the Korean Peninsula. The region that exhibited the most significant change from 2013 to 2020 was Sejong City, showing a 96% increase.

TI  - The concept of the Hausa nation from an ethnolinguistic perspective
T2  - STUDIES IN ETHNICITY AND NATIONALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper investigates the concept of the Hausa nation from a linguistic perspective. Using ethnolinguistic methodology, which enables the study of the relationship between language and culture, it focuses on the encoding of the NATION (as well as the similar concept HOMELAND) in the Hausa language. Phrases, words, and expressions demonstrate how the idea is perceived by the community and how the concept is reflected in the 'linguistic worldview'. Attention is paid to the terms that are cultural keywords, petrified phrases and proverbs that manifest the patterns of national identification. The paper concludes that the concept of 'nation' in Hausa is encoded with reference to the national community, which has no state of its own. According to the manner in which it is conceived, two ethnolinguistic profiles of the homeland can be identified: one motivated by ethnic (language) identity; the other by state (Nigerian) identity.

TI  - Investigation of urology intraoperative events leading to root cause analysis at national VA medical centers
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Adverse events in urologic procedures are poorly studied. This study analyzes the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Root Cause Analysis (RCA) data for patient safety adverse events during urologic procedures performed in a VHA operating room (OR). Materials and methods: The VHA National Center for Patient Safety RCA database was queried for fiscal years 2015-2019 using urologic terms including vasectomy, prostatectomy, nephrectomy, cystectomy, cystoscopy, lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, urethral, TURBT, etc. RCAs for events outside a VHA OR were excluded. Cases were categorized based on type of event. Results: Sixty-eight RCAs were identified for 319,713 urologic procedures. The most common pattern identified was equipment or instrument issue, including brokenscopes or smoking light cords, with 22 cases. Eighteen RCAs involved a sentinel event, including 12 retained surgical items (RSI) (surgical sponge, retained guidewire) and 6 wrong site surgeries (WSS) (incorrect laterality, wrong procedure) representing a serious safety event rate of 1 in 17,762 procedures. In addition, 8 RCAs pertained to medical or anesthesia events (incorrect dosing, postoperative myocardial infarction), 7 to pathology errors (missing or mislabeled specimen), 4 to incorrect patient information or consent, and 4 to surgical complications (hemorrhage, duodenal injury). In 2 cases there was inappropriate work up. One case caused a delay in treatment, one case had an incorrect count, and one case identified lack of credentialing.Conclusions: RCAs of patient safety adverse events occurring during urologic OR procedures highlight the need for targeted quality improvement projects to prevent WSS events, prevent RSI events, and maintain properly functioning equipment.

TI  - The category of the transcendental in the Ukrainian postmodern novel
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The forms of artistic embodiment of aspects of the category of the transcendent in the texts of Ukrainian postmodernists are the focus of this article which are studied through the analysis of the characters' worldview, the identification of dominants and meanings of human existence, and the correlation of the vision of the category of the transcendent in the novels with modern spiritual concepts. The most striking authorial concepts of the transcendental in Ukrainian postmodern prose refer to the relationship between the human and divine planes of existence, the mechanisms of transforming inspiration into a literary text, the irrational nature of creativity, the concept of reincarnation, ritual as a way of accessing the realm of the transcendental and the understanding of & DLANGBRAC;nothing & drangbrac; concept.

TI  - Identifying Spatial Variation of Carbon Stock in a Warm Temperate Forest in Central Japan Using Sentinel-2 and Digital Elevation Model Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of carbon stocks in natural and plantation forests is a prerequisite for the realization of carbon peaking and neutrality. In this study, the potential of optical Sentinel-2A data and a digital elevation model (DEM) to estimate the spatial variation of carbon stocks was investigated in a mountainous warm temperate region in central Japan. Four types of image preprocessing techniques and datasets were used: spectral reflectance, DEM-based topography indices, vegetation indices, and spectral band-based textures. A random forest model combined with 103 field plots as well as remote sensing image parameters was applied to predict and map the 2160 ha University of Tokyo Chiba Forest. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the factors driving the spatial distribution of forest carbon stocks. Our study shows that the Sentinel-2A data in combination with topography indices, vegetation indices, and shortwave-infrared (SWIR)-band-based textures resulted in the highest estimation accuracy. The spatial distribution of carbon stocks was successfully mapped, and stand-age- and forest-type-level variations were identified. The SWIR-2-band and topography indices were the most important variables for modeling, while the forest stand age and curvature were the most important determinants of the spatial distribution of carbon stock density. These findings will contribute to more accurate mapping of carbon stocks and improved quantification in different forest types and stand ages.

TI  - Assessing the Accuracy of PRISMA Standard Reflectance Products in Globally Distributed Aquatic Sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - PRISMA is the Italian Space Agency's first proof-of-concept hyperspectral mission launched in March 2019. The present work aims to evaluate the accuracy of PRISMA's standard Level 2d (L2d) products in visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral regions over water bodies. For this assessment, an analytical comparison was performed with in situ water reflectance available through the ocean color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC). In total, 109 cloud-free images over 20 inland and coastal water sites worldwide were available for the match-up analysis, covering a period of three years. The quality of L2d products was further evaluated as a function of ancillary parameters, such as the trophic state of the water, aerosol optical depth (AOD), observation and illumination geometry, and the distance from the coastline (DC). The results showed significant levels of uncertainty in the L2d reflectance products, with median symmetric accuracies (MdSA) varying from 33% in the green to more than 100% in the blue and NIR bands, with higher median uncertainties in oligotrophic waters (MdSA of 85% for the entire spectral range) than in meso-eutrophic (MdSA of 46%) where spectral shapes were retained adequately. Slight variations in the statistical agreement were then noted depending on AOD values, observation and illumination geometry, and DC. Overall, the results indicate that water-specific atmospheric correction algorithms should be developed and tested to fully exploit PRISMA data as a precursor for future operational hyperspectral missions as the standard L2d products are mostly intended for terrestrial applications.

TI  - Remote Sensing Temporal Reconstruction of the Flooded Area in "Tablas de Daimiel" Inland Wetland 2000-2021
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tablas de Daimiel National Park (TDNP) is a unique inland wetland located in the Mancha plain (Spain). It is recognized at the international level, and it is protected by different figures, such as Biosphere Reserve. However, this ecosystem is endangered due to aquifer overexploitation, and it is at risk of losing its protection figures. The objective of our study is to analyze the evolution of the flooded area between the year 2000 and 2021 by Landsat (5, 7 and 8) and Sentinel-2 images, and to assess the TDNP state through an anomaly analysis of the total water body surface. Several water indices were tested, but the NDWI index for Sentinel-2 (threshold -0.20), the MNDWI for Landsat-5 (threshold -0.15), and the MNDWI for Landsat-8 (threshold -0.25) showed the highest accuracy to calculate the flooded surface inside the protected area's limits. During the period 2015-2021, we compared the performance of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 and an R-2 value of 0.87 was obtained for this analysis, indicating a high correspondence between both sensors. Our results indicate a high variability of the flooded areas during the analyzed period with significant peaks, the most notorious in the second quarter of 2010. Minimum flooded areas were observed with negative precipitation index anomalies since fourth quarter of 2004 to fourth quarter of 2009. This period corresponds to a severe drought that affected this region and caused important deterioration. No significant correlation was observed between water surface anomalies and precipitation anomalies, and the significant correlation with flow and piezometric anomalies was moderate. This can be explained because of the complexity of water uses in this wetland, which includes illegal wells and the geological heterogeneity.

TI  - Using InSAR for Surface Deformation Monitoring and Active Layer Thickness Retrieval in the Heihe River Basin on the Northeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - In cold regions characterized by perennially frozen soil, climate warming has caused permafrost degradation, which is manifested by surface deformation and deepening of the active layer. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a common method to obtain large-scale surface deformation, especially in mountainous terrain where it is difficult to install a large number of monitoring sites. Here, we used Sentinel-1A SAR data acquired from March 2017 to March 2021 to monitor surface deformation and estimate active layer thickness (ALT) using two methods-temperature-based and soil moisture-based-in the permafrost regions of the Heihe River Basin on the northeast Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We find that the seasonal deformation amplitude ranges 10-60 mm, and the annual mean vertical deformation trend ranges from -40 to 30 mm/a. We verify the ALT estimates with observations and find that the method based on soil moisture has higher accuracy and is therefore more applicable in this particular study area. The ALT gradually decreases from the southeast to the northwest, ranging from 0.3 to 6.5 m, with an average value of 2.47 m. These results contribute to better quantifying the response of permafrost change and to understanding the spatial distribution of ALT on a large scale, serving as guidance for engineering and other applications.

TI  - Benthic Characterization of Mesophotic Communities Based on Optical Depths in the Southern Mexican Pacific Coast (Oaxaca)
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The distinction between shallow coral reefs and mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) has not been fully clarified yet. The original definition of MCEs, by depths of 30-150 m, fixes their bathymetrical limits and fails to accommodate environmental and biological variation. Recent studies have indicated that water transparency and light availability may explain why MCEs do not occur at fixed depths but vary among localities. This study aimed to evaluate the presence and distribution of MCEs, along the central coast of Oaxaca, through optical depths and the associated benthic community. Using MODIS-Aqua satellite data (Kd490), we estimated the mesophotic optical depths monthly (z10%, z1%, z0.1%), over the last four years. In addition, to characterize benthic community structure, we conducted underwater photo quadrat surveys at two locations on the southern Mexican Pacific coast from 10 to 55 m depth. Significant differences between depths and locations were found in benthic communities. Furthermore, the lower distribution of photosynthetic taxa was different between the two locations but indicative to the z10% and z1% in both cases. Those differences were associated with the upwelling season, which reduces, drastically and differentially, the light availability for benthic communities between the two locations and limits the development of MCEs on the central coast of Oaxaca.

TI  - Using Multispectral Images to Establish Land Categories
T2  - Grassroots Journal of Natural Resources
M3  - Article
AB  - At the present stage, the dominant means of obtaining information is space shooting, which is carried out from space carriers with the help of special shooting equipment, and makes it possible to obtain high-quality images covering a significant area of the earth's surface. Methods combining multi-criteria analysis and GIS technologies can be used to make appropriate environmental decisions. At the same time, an important component for all interested parties is obtaining the original information at the lowest cost. In this regard, this publication provides a methodology for constructing maps of land categories, which is based exclusively on a free basis. This methodology includes free and open FOSS software, space images of the Landsat 8 satellite, and multi-criteria analysis of space image processing. The procedure of the methodology includes the creation of a database based on available land management documents, cadastral plans and maps, satellite images, etc.; processing of the database using multi-criteria analysis; analysis of the results and decision-making. The database is created using QGIS software, and PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension is used for modeling and data storage. MultiSpec software was used to create multispectral images, perform satellite image classification and evaluation. Using a set of the above software products and Landsat 8 satellite images, a pilot project on an area of 615 km2 was carried out to determine the capabilities of this methodology for establishing land categories. It was established that the multispectral image of the combination of 6-5-2 channels best represents land categories. The accuracy of the classification is 96.2%, and the User Accuracy for arable land is almost 100%, for orchards 55%, and for and 61.3%.

TI  - Equine Gram-Negative Oral Microbiota: An Antimicrobial Resistances Watcher?
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Horses are considered as reservoirs of multidrug resistant bacteria that can be spread through the environment and possibly to humans. The aim of this study was to characterize the oral Gram-negative microbiota of healthy horses and evaluate their antimicrobial susceptibility profile in a One Health approach. For this purpose, samples were collected from the gingival margin of healthy horses, free of antimicrobial therapy, cultured in selective mediums, identified, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Fifty-five Gram-negative isolates were identified, with 89.5% being zoonotic and 62% affecting humans, which were also found commonly in the environment. Forty-eight isolates (96%) were MDR. The phenotypic resistance presented as higher to macrolides (81.8%), beta-lactams (55.4%), and quinolones (50%), and lower to sulfonamides (27.3%), tetracyclines, and amphenicols (both with 30.9%). In total, 51.5% of the isolates presented resistance to carbapenems. In addition to being the first report on the commensal oral microbiota of horses and respective susceptibility profile, this study highlights the horse as a valuable sentinel that can control the evolution and transmission of multidrug-resistant bacteria between the "One Health triad" since it is in contact with humans, other animals, and the environment, in different geographic locations.

TI  - A Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Technique Using Remote Sensors to Evaluate the Potential of Groundwater in the Arid Zone Basin of the Atacama Desert
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most notable problems in the Atacama desert is the low occurrence of rainfall, which leads to a shortage of surface and groundwater for different users in the region. Therefore, the task of carrying out new exploration studies of potential groundwater zones (GWPZs) is of vital importance for decision-makers in water resources. The main objective of this research is to determine potential sources of groundwater using a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making technique with remote sensors. A method of exploration using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) techniques applied to remote sensing data is provided. The AHP method allows calculating the influence of multiple factors, and along with the GIS environment, a map of groundwater exploitation potential can be produced. The results indicating GWPZs showed four classifications of groundwater potential. The distribution shows 15.02%, 23.93%, 59.80%, and 1.25% of the total area with high, moderate, low, and very low potential, respectively. The results were validated with existing wells in the study area, offering an acceptance of 86.9%. This reveals the effectiveness and accuracy of the AHP-based GIS approach as a strategy for analyzing groundwater potential in arid zones. Similarly, the tested high GWP areas are helpful for the development and management of water resources in the Caplina basin.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Network Maps Plant Communities in Semi-Natural Grasslands Using Multispectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-natural grasslands (SNGs) are an essential part of European cultural landscapes. They are an important habitat for many animal and plant species and offer a variety of ecological functions. Diverse plant communities have evolved over time depending on environmental and management factors in grasslands. These different plant communities offer multiple ecosystem services and also have an effect on the forage value of fodder for domestic livestock. However, with increasing intensification in agriculture and the loss of SNGs, the biodiversity of grasslands continues to decline. In this paper, we present a method to spatially classify plant communities in grasslands in order to identify and map plant communities and weed species that occur in a semi-natural meadow. For this, high-resolution multispectral remote sensing data were captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in regular intervals and classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN). As the study area, a heterogeneous semi-natural hay meadow with first- and second-growth vegetation was chosen. Botanical releves of fixed plots were used as ground truth and independent test data. Accuracies up to 88% on these independent test data were achieved, showing the great potential of the usage of CNNs for plant community mapping in high-resolution UAV data for ecological and agricultural applications.

TI  - A NEW GENERATION OF CLIMATE ACTIVISTS? TYPOLOGY AND SOME DETERMINANTS OF PARTICIPATION IN ?FRIDAYS FOR FUTURE? CLIMATE STRIKES AMONG CROATIAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
T2  - POLITICKA MISAO-CROATIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of empirical research that examined the forms of support and participation of Croatian high school students in the "School Strike for Climate Croatia" climate strikes, as well as some individual and contextual determinants of their attitudes and participation. The research was conducted using the online survey method in 2020 and 2021 on a convenient sample of fi-nal years of Croatian high school students (N=534). The results show that about 8% of the students were in some way actively connected with the strikes. Using the analysis of the main components, three types of student attitudes towards the protest and the protesters were determined: "protesters fighting for environ-mental protection", "protesters as universal activists" and "supportive protest-ers". In addition, multivariate analysis tested the effect of socio-demographic characteristics together with the constructs of perception of collective efficacy, environmental concern, ecological worldview, and attitudes about Greta Thun-berg as the initiator of the global Fridays for Future movement on established attitudinal structures. The determinants involved were shown to be statistically significant predictors, although not in the same way for each of the three atti-tudinal dimensions.

TI  - Analysis and Processing of the COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation Images of the 2022 Marche (Central Italy) Flood
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of SAR data for flood mapping is well established. However, the problem of the missed detection of rapidly evolving floods remains. Recently, the Italian Space Agency deployed the COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation (CSG) constellation, with an on-demand capability that makes it possible to reduce the number of missed floods. However, for on-demand SAR acquisitions, pre-flood images are generally not available, and change-detection methods, commonly adopted for flood mapping using SAR, cannot be applied. This study focused on the high-resolution CSG images of a flood that occurred in central Italy. An accurate analysis of the radar responses of the different targets included in the scenes observed by GSG was performed. Then, a methodology to detect floods using high-resolution single SAR images was developed. The methodology was based on image segmentation and fuzzy logic. Image segmentation allowed us to analyze homogeneous areas in the CSG images. Fuzzy logic was used to integrate the SAR data with ancillary information that was useful when change-detection methods could not be applied. A comparison with the maps produced by the Copernicus Emergency Service, using high-resolution optical images, demonstrated the reliability of the methodology.

TI  - Two-Way Generation of High-Resolution EO and SAR Images via Dual Distortion-Adaptive GANs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides an all-weather and all-time imaging platform, which is more reliable than electro-optical (EO) remote sensing imagery under extreme weather/lighting conditions. While many large-scale EO-based remote sensing datasets have been released for computer vision tasks, there are few publicly available SAR image datasets due to the high costs associated with acquisition and labeling. Recent works have applied deep learning methods for image translation between SAR and EO. However, the effectiveness of those techniques on high-resolution images has been hindered by a common limitation. Non-linear geometric distortions, induced by different imaging principles of optical and radar sensors, have caused insufficient pixel-wise correspondence between an EO-SAR patch pair. Such a phenomenon is not prominent in low-resolution EO-SAR datasets, e.g., SEN1-2, one of the most frequently used datasets, and thus has been seldom discussed. To address this issue, a new dataset SN6-SAROPT with sub-meter resolution is introduced, and a novel image translation algorithm designed to tackle geometric distortions adaptively is proposed in this paper. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithm, and the results have validated its superiority over other methods for both SAR to EO (S2E) and EO to SAR (E2S) tasks, especially for urban areas in high-resolution images.

T2  - Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Given their important roles in the regulation and storage functions for river flow and in the regional ecological environment and ecosystem services, natural lakes are essential for the ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin. We used the Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing data to analyze the area changes of Dongping Lake, Gyaring Lake, and Ngoring Lake, three representative large natural lakes in the Yellow River Basin from 1990 to 2020. We used the landscape ecology approach to study the morphological characteristics of lake shoreline and shoreland changes and the relationship between the landscape indices. The results showed that the main areas of Gyaring Lake and Ngoring Lake were mainly in the trend of expansion, while the main area of Dongping Lake significantly reduced during 1990-2000 and 2010-2020. The changes in the area of lake all occurred mainly near the lake inlet of the river. The shoreline morphology of Dongping Lake was more complex, with the fragmentation and aggregation of shoreland landscape significantly changed. The circularity ratio of Gyaring Lake gradually decreased with the expansion of the lake area, and the number of patches in its shoreland changed significantly. The fractal dimension index-mean of the shoreland of Ngoring Lake was relatively high, the complexity of its shoreline landscape was stronger, and the number of patches had increased significantly from 2000 to 2010. Meanwhile, there was a significant correlation between certain lake shoreline (shoreland) landscape indices. The changes in circularity ratio and shoreline development coefficient caused changes in the patch density of shoreland.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Annual Glacier Surface Flow Velocity Products for the European Alps, 2015-2021
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Documenting glacier surface flow velocity from a longer-term perspective is highly relevant to evaluate the past and current state of glaciers worldwide. For this purpose, satellite data are widely used to obtain region-wide coverage of glacier velocity data. Well-established image correlation methods allow for the automated measurement of glacier surface displacements from satellite data (optical and radar) acquired at different dates. Although computationally expensive, image correlation is nowadays relatively simple to implement and allows two-dimensional displacement measurements. Here, we present a data set of annual glacier surface flow velocity maps at the European Alps scale, covering the period 2015-2021 at a 50 m x 50 m resolution. This data set has been quantified by applying the normalized cross-correlation approach on Sentinel-2 optical data. Parameters of the cross-correlation method (e.g., window size, sampling resolution) have been optimized, and the results have been validated by comparing them with in situ data on monitored glaciers showing an RMSE of 10 m/yr. These data can be used to evaluate glacier dynamics and its spatial and temporal evolution (e.g., quantify mass fluxes or calving) or can be used as an input for model calibration/validation or for the early detection of regional hazards associated with glacier destabilization.

T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionInfluenza is an acute viral infection with significant morbidity and mortality. It occurs annually each winter, which is called seasonal influenza, and is preventable through safe vaccine. AimThe aim of this work is to know the epidemiological pattern of patients with seasonal influenza in Iraqi sentinel sites. MethodsA cross-sectional study was carried out on records of patients who attended four sentinel sites and registered to have influenza-like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), and laboratory investigated. ResultsThe total number of cases was 1124; 36.2% of them aged 19-39 years; 53.9% were female; 74.9% lived in urban areas; 64.3% diagnosed as ILI; and 35.7% as SARI; 15.9% had diabetes, 12.7% had heart disease, 4.8% had asthma, 3% had a chronic lung disease, and 2% had hematological disease; 94.6% did not get influenza vaccine. About COVID-19 vaccine, 69.4% were not vaccinated, 3.5% got only one dose, and 27.1% completed two doses. Only the SARI cases needed admission; among them, 95.7% were cured. 6.5% were diagnosed with influenza-A virus, 26.1% had COVID-19, and 67.5% were negative. Among those with influenza, 97.3% had H3N2 subtype and 2.7% had H1N1 pdm09. ConclusionsThe percentage of influenza virus in Iraq is relatively small. The age, classification of case (ILI or SARI), having diabetes, heart disease, or immunological disease, and taking COVID-19 vaccine have a significant association with influenza. RecommendationsIt is needed for similar sentinel sites in other health directorates and for rising health education about seasonal influenza and its vaccine.

TI  - Exploring Mission Design for Imaging Spectroscopy Retrievals for Land and Aquatic Ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval algorithms used for optical remote sensing satellite data to estimate Earth's geophysical properties have specific requirements for spatial resolution, temporal revisit, spectral range and resolution, and instrument signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance to meet biogeoscience objectives. Studies to estimate surface properties from hyperspectral data use a range of algorithms sensitive to various sources of spectroscopic uncertainty, which are in turn influenced by mission architecture choices. Retrieval algorithms vary across scientific fields and may be more or less sensitive to mission architecture choices that affect spectral, spatial, or temporal resolutions and spectrometer SNR. We used representative remote sensing algorithms across terrestrial and aquatic study domains to inform aspects of mission design that are most important for impacting accuracy in each scientific area. We simulated the propagation of uncertainties in the retrieval process including the effects of different instrument configuration choices. We found that retrieval accuracy and information content degrade consistently at >10 nm spectral resolution, >30 m spatial resolution, and >8-day revisit. In these studies, the noise reduction associated with lower spatial resolution improved accuracy vis a vis high spatial resolution measurements. The interplay between spatial resolution, temporal revisit, and SNR can be quantitatively assessed for imaging spectroscopy missions and used to identify key components of algorithm performance and mission observing criteria.

TI  - Investigation of a Dissipating Mesospheric Bore Using Airglow Imager and Direct Numerical Simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric gravity waves play an important role in driving the dynamics of the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere and the basic structure of this region is determined by momentum deposition of these waves. Mesospheric bores are a type of non-linear response that cause the amplification of gravity wave, due to trapping, that is characterized by a propagating step-like jump followed by undulating waves. They require a stable layer or duct to travel horizontally with little attenuation thereby capable of transporting wave energy and momentum over larger distances. We present a prominent bright undular bore event observed in the mesospheric O(S-1), O-2, and OH emission layers on 16 March 2021 over Germany. A striking feature of this observation is the capture of bore's rapid dissipation around the center of the imager's field of view. The vertical temperature profile obtained from the satellite data indicates the presence of temperature inversion layer which acted as a thermal duct for the bore propagation. In addition, we have performed idealized two dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) of Navier-Stokes equations under Boussinesq approximation. The DNS results reproduce many important characteristics of the observed airglow event like the nonlinear wave-steepening, number of trailing waves, and its dissipation by implementing a thermal duct and a wave-like perturbation. Furthermore, the DNS results also indicate that the duct width and amplitude of the initial perturbation have a considerable effect on the bore morphology.

TI  - SAR2NDVI: a pix2pix generative adversarial network for reconstructing field-level normalized difference vegetation index time series using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is essential for monitoring urban green space, forest cover, and crop growth from sowing to harvesting. High-resolution images from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites are available nowadays to get field-level phenological information at short intervals. However, cloud cover is one of the biggest hindrances in vegetation monitoring using NDVI, resulting in data gaps. To address this issue, we propose an NDVI gap-filling methodology to generate cloud-free NDVI time series from Sentinel-1 SAR data using the pix2pix generative adversarial network (GAN) model. Pix2pix GANs with generators based on U-Net and ResNet were designed, and the performance of the models was compared for both the VV and VH polarizations. The generalization capability of the models was studied using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and NDVI image pairs with different vegetation, field sizes, and shapes. Experimental results show that the generated synthetic NDVI images can effectively substitute the cloudy images for gap-filling. Compared to ResNet, the U-Net generator has given the best results with PSNR = 29.447 dB, RMSE = 0.055, and Pearson correlation coefficient ? = + 0.909 for VH polarization.

TI  - TransCropNet: a multichannel transformer with feature-level fusion for crop classification in agricultural smallholdings using Sentinel images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop classification in small and fragmented agricultural lands is a challenging task. The presence of cloud cover poses additional challenges when classical techniques using multispectral images are applied. Multispectral data augmented with SAR images is capable of solving this issue. The use of robust deep neural network classifiers can further improve the classification performance. We propose a multichannel attention-based deep learning model to fuse time-series SAR and a single scene multispectral data at the feature level and classify tropical crops grown in smallholdings at pixel level with high accuracy. The attention-based transformer neural network for the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data is evaluated for crop classification in the Cauvery delta zone. The model achieves an overall classification accuracy of 92.6% and a kappa score of 0.906. The source code is available in a GitHub repository at: https:// github.com/ajigeo/temporal-SAR-transformer.

TI  - Adverse Health Outcomes Following Hurricane Harvey: A Comparison of Remotely-Sensed and Self-Reported Flood Exposure Estimates
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed inundation may help to rapidly identify areas in need of aid during and following floods. Here we evaluate the utility of daily remotely sensed flood inundation measures and estimate their congruence with self-reported home flooding and health outcomes collected via the Texas Flood Registry (TFR) following Hurricane Harvey. Daily flood inundation for 14 days following the landfall of Hurricane Harvey was acquired from FloodScan. Flood exposure, including number of days flooded and flood depth was assigned to geocoded home addresses of TFR respondents (N = 18,920 from 47 counties). Discordance between remotely-sensed flooding and self-reported home flooding was measured. Modified Poisson regression models were implemented to estimate risk ratios (RRs) for adverse health outcomes following flood exposure, controlling for potential individual level confounders. Respondents whose home was in a flooded area based on remotely-sensed data were more likely to report injury (RR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.27-1.77), concentration problems (1.36, 95% CI: 1.25-1.49), skin rash (1.31, 95% CI: 1.15-1.48), illness (1.29, 95% CI: 1.17-1.43), headaches (1.09, 95% CI: 1.03-1.16), and runny nose (1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.11) compared to respondents whose home was not flooded. Effect sizes were larger when exposure was estimated using respondent-reported home flooding. Near-real time remote sensing-based flood products may help to prioritize areas in need of assistance when on the ground measures are not accessible.

TI  - Staffing rural emergency departments in Ontario: The who, what and where
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF RURAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The emergency department (ED) in rural communities is essential for providing care to patients with urgent medical issues and those unable to access primary care. Recent physician staffing shortages have put many EDs at risk of temporary closure. Our goal was to describe the demographics and practices of the rural physicians providing emergency medicine services across Ontario in order to inform health human resource planning.Methods: The ICES Physician database (IPDB) and Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) billing database from 2017 were used in this retrospective cohort study. Rural physician data were analysed for demographic, practice region and certification information. Sentinel billing codes (i.e., a billing code unique to a particular clinical service) were used to define 18 unique physician services.Results: A total of 1192 physicians from the IPDB met inclusion as rural generalist physicians out of a total of 14,443 family physicians in Ontario. From this physician population, a total of 620 physicians practised emergency medicine which accounted for 33% of their days worked on average. The majority of physicians practising emergency medicine were between the ages of 30 and 49 and in their first decade of practice. The most common services in addition to emergency medicine were clinic, hospital medicine, palliative care and mental health.Conclusion: This study provides insight into the practice patterns of rural physicians and the basis for better targeted physician workforce-forecasting models. A new approach to education and training pathways, recruitment and retention initiatives and rural health service delivery models is needed to ensure better health outcomes for our rural population.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Land Surface Temperature Dynamics in the Context of Global Change-A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) dynamics have been increasingly used to study various geophysical processes. This review provides an extensive overview of the applications of LST in the context of global change. By filtering a selection of relevant keywords, a total of 164 articles from 14 international journals published during the last two decades were analyzed based on study location, research topic, applied sensor, spatio-temporal resolution and scale and employed analysis methods. It was revealed that China and the USA were the most studied countries and those that had the most first author affiliations. The most prominent research topic was the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), while the research topics related to climate change were underrepresented. MODIS was by far the most used sensor system, followed by Landsat. A relatively small number of studies analyzed LST dynamics on a global or continental scale. The extensive use of MODIS highly determined the study periods: A majority of the studies started around the year 2000 and thus had a study period shorter than 25 years. The following suggestions were made to increase the utilization of LST time series in climate research: The prolongation of the time series by, e.g., using AVHRR LST, the better representation of LST under clouds, the comparison of LST to traditional climate change measures, such as air temperature and reanalysis variables, and the extension of the validation to heterogenous sites.

TI  - Selective Axillary Dissection after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients with Lymph-Node-Positive Breast Cancer (CLYP Study): The Radio-Guided Occult Lesion Localization Technique for Biopsy-Proven Metastatic Lymph Nodes
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: To help to refine the accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer (BC) patients with biopsy-proven nodal disease prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), a method of marking the biopsy-proven positive LN at diagnosis to enable its removal during surgery was proposed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the Radio-Guided Occult Lesion Localization (ROLL) technique of biopsy-proven metastatic LN in nodal staging after NACT among node-positive BC patients. (2) Methods: Patients with invasive BC and biopsy-proven axillary metastases receiving NACT were enrolled. A clip marker was placed on the sampled LN (clipped lymph node, CLN) before NACT. Before surgery, the ROLL procedure (radioactive tracer injection into CLN under ultrasound guidance) was performed, and the CLN was surgically resected. The correspondence between the CLNs and SLNs was evaluated. The pathologic findings of the CLNs and SLN(s) were compared with remaining axillary nodes at ALND to determine false negative rates (FNRs). (3) Results: Seventy-two patients were analyzed. Surgery successfully identified the CLN in 70/72 procedures (97.2%). For 60/72 patients who underwent ALND, the FNRs dropped from 19.35% for SLNB to 3.13% for CLN biopsy. (4) Conclusions: The ROLL procedure got CLNs is accurate in axillary nodal staging after NACT in node-positive BC patients at diagnosis.

TI  - Remote Sensing Inversion of Typical Offshore Water Quality Parameter Concentration Based on Improved SVR Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll a concentration and suspended matter concentration, as typical water quality parameters related to spectral characteristics, are essential for characterizing the degree of eutrophication in water bodies. They have become crucial indicators for water quality assessment of inland water bodies. The support vector regression model (SVR) is suitable for small samples, has excellent generalization ability, and has high prediction accuracy. Still, it has the problem of difficult selection of model parameters and quickly falling into local extremes. To solve this problem, a hybrid Differential Evolution-Grey Wolf Optimizer (DE-GWO) algorithm is introduced into the parameter selection process of the support vector regression model, and an improved SVR algorithm (DE-GWO-SVR) is proposed for the remote sensing inversion of chlorophyll a concentration and suspended sediment concentration in water bodies. In this paper, the spectral reflectance of the water surface and the chlorophyll a and broken matter concentration values were obtained by field measurements in the Tangdao Bay waters of Qingdao, Shandong Province. The inverse model between the concentration values of the two water quality parameters and the corresponding sensitive factors was established by first determining the sensitive factors based on the response of the spectral reflectance to the two water quality parameters and introducing the DE-GWO optimization algorithm into the parameter selection process of the SVR model. Finally, the accuracy of the model was verified using Sentinel II satellite remote sensing spectral data, and then the inverse accuracy of the two water quality parameters was obtained. The mean relative error (MRE) of the chlorophyll a prediction model built by the DE-GWO algorithm optimizing the SVR is 25.1%, and the mean relative error (MRE) of the suspended matter prediction model is 32.5%. The inversion results were all better than the other models (linear regression, SVR, and GWO-SVR model). When the best model, built from the measured water surface spectral data, was applied to the Sentinel II satellite data, the improved SVR model outperformed the other models in terms of mean relative error. The experimental results confirm that the DE-GWO-SVR algorithm is an effective method for remote sensing inversion of chlorophyll a and suspended matter concentrations in water bodies, which can provide a reference for remote sensing inversion of chlorophyll a and suspended matter concentrations in Chinese offshore waters and subsequent scientific management of waters.

TI  - Monitoring Grassland Growth Based on Consistency-Corrected Remote Sensing Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring grassland growth in large areas usually needs multiple images from different sensors or on different dates to cover the study area completely. Images from different sensors or on different dates need consistency correction to eliminate the sharp differences between images. The main contribution of this study is to promote a method for consistency correction of images on different days by constructing a linear regression equation of land cover types and the classification pixel mean. Taking a prefecture-level area in China as a test area, the consistency corrected images were applied for monitoring grassland growth. The results showed the following. First, compared with the normal correction equation constructed for two images, taking all features into account, the coefficient of determination of the equation corrected by the land cover types was improved, and the root mean square error was also significantly reduced. Secondly, the areas of consistency in the corrected image were improved compared with the original image, with an improvement rate of 21% for images from the same sensor and 25% for images from different sensors. The pixel average was much closer to the benchmark images, indicating that the corrected image was more consistent than the original image. Thirdly, when applied for monitoring grassland growth, consistency correction can solve the problem of misjudging grassland degradation. Grassland that was judged to be degraded using direct imagery, in fact, showed stable growth after consistency correction, and this type accounted for 7.33% of the regional grassland area. The seasonal characteristics of grass growth in the region were also obtained by monitoring the growth of grass in the region throughout the year. The application test showed that an effective image consistency correction method can improve the accuracy of grassland growth monitoring across a large area.

TI  - Recovery of Water Quality and Detection of Algal Blooms in Lake Villarrica through Landsat Satellite Images and Monitoring Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton is considered a strong predictor of the environmental quality of lakes, while Chlorophyll-a is an indicator of primary productivity. In this study, 25 LANDSAT images covering the 2014-2021 period were used to predict Chlorophyll-a in the Villarrica lacustrine system. A Chlorophyll-a recovery algorithm was calculated using two spectral indices (FAI and SABI). The indices that presented the best statistical indicators were the floating algal index (R-2 = 0.87) and surface algal bloom index (R-2 = 0.59). A multiparametric linear model for Chlorophyll-a estimation was constructed with the indices. Statistical indicators were used to validate the multiple linear regression model used to predict Chlorophyll-a by means of spectral indices, with the following results: a MBE of 0.136 mu g/L, RMSE of 0.055 mu g/L, and NRMSE of 0.019%. All results revealed the strength of the model. It is necessary to raise awareness among the population that carries out activities around the lake in order for them to take policy actions related to water resources in this Chilean lake. Furthermore, it is important to note that this study is the first to address the detection of algal blooms in this Chilean lake through remote sensing.

TI  - Estimation of Seagrass Beds Changes in the Barugaiya Village Waters over a Period of 5 Years 2019-2023.
T2  - Pakistan journal of biological sciences : PJBS
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - &lt;b&gt;Background and Objective:&lt;/b&gt; Barugaiya Village is one of the villages located in Selayar Islands Regency, South Sulawesi, which has seagrass beds that are spread almost evenly in its waters. Environmental changes are in the form of declining water quality and damage to coastal ecosystems, one of which is seagrass. Therefore, it is necessary to observe changes in the area of seagrass beds in the waters of Barugaiya Village so that it is known how much seagrass has actually been in the area in the last 5 years. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Observations were made from March to May, 2023 in the waters of Barugaiya Village, Selayar Islands Regency, South Sulawesi. The method used is seagrass classification using Sentinel-2A images corrected by the water column with the Lyzenga algorithm to reduce the effect of depth. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The distribution area of seagrass in Barugaiya Village for the 2019-2023 period was 111.03, 107.16, 103.81, 102.54 and 99.70 ha, respectively. Every year there is a decrease in seagrass area, the rate of decline is around 0.02% each year (1.27-3.87 ha). The change in area over the past 5 years has decreased by 0.11% (11.33 ha). &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Therefore, long-term monitoring of seagrass beds in the waters of Barugaiya Village which are experiencing a decline is needed so that effective management strategies can be identified.

TI  - Sentinel-1 InSAR observations and time-series analysis of co- and post-seismic deformation mechanisms of the 2021 Mw 5.8 Bandar Ganaveh Earthquake, Southern Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past two decades, because of the significant increase in the availability of differential interferometry from synthetic aperture radar and GPS data, spaceborne geodesy has been widely employed to determine the co-seismic displacement field of earthquakes. On April 18, 2021, a moderate earthquake (Mw 5.8) occurred east of Bandar Ganaveh, southern Iran, followed by intensive seismic activity and aftershocks of various magnitudes. We use two-pass D-InSAR and Small Baseline Inversion techniques via the LiCSBAS suite to study the co-seismic displacement and monitor the four-month post-seismic deformation of the Bandar Ganaveh earthquake, as well as constrain the fault geometry of the co-seismic faulting mechanism during the seismic sequence. Analyses show that the co- and post-seismic deformation are distributed in relatively shallow depths along with an NW-SE striking and NE dipping complex reverse/thrust fault branches of the Zagros Mountain Front Fault, complying with the main trend of the Zagros structures. The average cumulative displacements were obtained from -137.5 to +113.3 mm/yr in the SW and NE blocks of the Mountain Front Fault, respectively. The received maximum uplift amount is approximately consistent with the overall orogen-normal shortening component of the Arabian-Eurasian convergence in the Zagros region. No surface ruptures were associated with the seismic source; therefore, we propose a shallow blind thrust/reverse fault (depth similar to 10 km) connected to the deeper basal decollement fault within a complex tectonic zone, emphasizing the thin-skinned tectonics.

TI  - A GIS based study on channel dynamic and the impact on morphology of Subansiri River in the Lakhimpur district of Assam, India
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Channel migration or channel shift is a dynamic behavior of rivers, especially in the perennial rivers of the Himalayan system. Subansiri River well-known for its dynamic behaviour originates from Tibet and joins the River Brahmaputra at Assam. The present study tries to understand the changing nature of the river and morphological changes during the period of 1994 to 2020. Satellite images of Landsat-5 (TM) and Landsat-8 (OLI) with 30 m resolution was downloaded to detect the dynamism of the river for the same. A segment of the Subansiri River in the district seems to migrate towards the western side in an average of 7.33 km during the identified time interval. A maximum and minimum channel shift of 10 km and 4.48 km were measured, respectively, from the randomly selected cross-sections. Similarly, the maximum, minimum and average channel width were also measured 2.96 km, 0.30 km and 1.39 km in the year 1994 from the 12 random cross sections and the same were observed 4.35 km, 0.66 km and 2.09 km in the year 2020, respectively. The SI index for the same segment of the river was calculated as 1.7.96 and 1.1885 for the time interval. Being in the category of 1.50 < SI, the particular segment of the river can be considered as "meander river" in the year 1994. Similarly, the same can be considered as "winding river" in the year 2020, as it comes in the category of 1.05 < SI < 1.25.

TI  - Synergistic Use of Earth Observation Driven Techniques to Support the Implementation of Water Framework Directive in Europe: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The development of a sustainable water quality monitoring system at national scale remains a big challenge until today, acting as a hindrance for the efficient implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). This work provides valuable insights into the current state-of-the-art Earth Observation (EO) tools and services, proposing a synergistic use of innovative remote sensing technologies, in situ sensors, and databases, with the ultimate goal to support the European Member States in effective WFD implementation. The proposed approach is based on a recent research and scientific analysis for a six-year period (2017-2022) after reviewing 71 peer-reviewed articles in international journals coupled with the scientific results of 11 European-founded research projects related to EO and WFD. Special focus is placed on the EO data sources (spaceborne, in situ, etc.), the sensors in use, the observed water Quality Elements as well as on the computer science techniques (machine/deep learning, artificial intelligence, etc.). The combination of the different technologies can offer, among other things, low-cost monitoring, an increase in the monitored Quality Elements per water body, and a minimization of the percentage of water bodies with unknown ecological status.

TI  - The causes of early 2022 fires in Corrientes province
T2  - Ecologia Austral
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a natural grassland management tool, often used to eliminate the standing dead biomass and promote growth before the growing season. However, while there is a lack of data on the seasonal use of fire in the province of Corrientes, natural and induced fires in early 2022 affected over 10000 km2 at the peak of the growing season. This paper quantifies the extent of the fire-affected area in Corrientes during January and February 2022 and analyzes the contribution of natural and anthropogenic factors to the extent of the fire-affected area. We used the Google Earth Engine platform to identify and classify burnt areas using Sentinel satellite images, and applied simple and multiple regression analysis to investigate the contribution of natural and anthropogenic factors to the extent of the fire-affected area. Results show that 12% of Corrientes was affected by fire during the study period, with wetlands being the most affected land cover type. This study provides evidence of the relationship between natural and anthropogenic factors and the fires that affected Corrientes at the beginning of 2022. The results show that the reduction of water area and protected areas was positively and directly related to the extent of burnt areas, while the road network and livestock density were inversely and negatively related to the burned area size. Predicting fire patterns is essential to develop management policies to prevent or reduce the impact of future catastrophic events.

TI  - Potential of Optical Spaceborne Sensors for the Differentiation of Plastics in the Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastics are part of our everyday life, as they are versatile materials and can be produced inexpensively. Approximately 10 Gt of plastics have been produced to date, of which the majority have been accumulated in landfills or have been spread into the terrestrial and aquatic environment in an uncontrolled way. Once in the environment, plastic litter-in its large form or degraded into microplastics-causes several harms to a variety of species. Thus, the detection of plastic waste is a pressing research question in remote sensing. The majority of studies have used Sentinel-2 or WorldView-3 data and empirically explore the usefulness of the given spectral channels for the detection of plastic litter in the environment. On the other hand, laboratory infrared spectroscopy is an established technique for the differentiation of plastic types based on their type-specific absorption bands; the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing for mapping plastics in the environment has not yet been fully explored. In this study, reflectance spectra of the five most commonly used plastic types were used for spectral sensor simulations of ten selected multispectral and hyperspectral sensors. Their signals were classified in order to differentiate between the plastic types as would be measured in nature and to investigate sensor-specific spectral configurations neglecting spatial resolution limitations. Here, we show that most multispectral sensors are not able to differentiate between plastic types, while hyperspectral sensors are. To resolve absorption bands of plastics with multispectral sensors, the number, position, and width of the SWIR channels are decisive for a good classification of plastics. As ASTER and WorldView-3 had/have narrow SWIR channels that match with diagnostic absorption bands of plastics, they yielded outstanding results. Central wavelengths at 1141, 1217, 1697, and 1716 nm, in combination with narrow bandwidths of 10-20 nm, have the highest capability for plastic differentiation.

TI  - Biosecurity and Hygiene Procedures in Pig Farms: Effects of a Tailor-Made Approach as Monitored by Environmental Samples
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary This study describes the improvement of biosecurity and environmental hygiene procedures in 20 pig farms monitored during a 12-month period. A checklist was used to develop tailor-made plans, which also included personnel training on hygiene procedures. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the content in environmental samples, was used as an output biomarker. To gain an insight into the environmental samples, the presence of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli) was also investigated as sentinel microorganisms to monitor antibiotic resistance. After 12 months, the average biosecurity was improved, and ATP contents decreased. Despite this, only ESBL-E. coli prevalence was effectively decreased by hygiene procedures, and a challenging persistence of a high prevalence of LA-MRSA after cleaning emerged. Results suggest that a tailored approach and on-farm training are useful to improve the application of biosecurity measures, in particular those related to hygiene management in the professional zone. However, this should not reduce the attention to the presence of resistant bacteria in the pig barns, in particular for the risk of spreading these bacteria to humans in close contact with pigs, moving the attention to the healthcare of workers in a one-health approach.In livestock, the importance of hygiene management is gaining importance within the context of biosecurity. The aim of this study was to monitor the implementation of biosecurity and hygiene procedures in 20 swine herds over a 12-month period, as driven by tailor-made plans, including training on-farm. The measure of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) environmental contents was used as an output biomarker. The presence of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli) was also investigated as sentinels of antibiotic resistance. A significant biosecurity improvement (p = 0.006) and a reduction in the ATP content in the sanitised environment (p = 0.039) were observed. A cluster including 6/20 farms greatly improved both biosecurity and ATP contents, while the remaining 14/20 farms ameliorated them only slightly. Even if the ESBL-E. coli prevalence (30.0%) after the hygiene procedures significantly decreased, the prevalence of LA-MRSA (22.5%) was unaffected. Despite the promising results supporting the adoption of tailor-made biosecurity plans and the measure of environmental ATP as an output biomarker, the high LA-MRSA prevalence still detected at the end of the study underlines the importance of improving even more biosecurity and farm hygiene in a one-health approach aimed to preserve also the pig workers health.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine the coseismic influence of the 5 July 2019, M(W)7.1 Ridgecrest and the 24 June 2020 M(W)5.8 Owens Lake earthquakes on rockfall distributions in two undisturbed high-altitude areas of the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, USA. These events occurred within the geologically recent (<2 Mya) Walker Lane/eastern California shear zone. While both study areas are characterized as plutonic, the Owens Lake event largely affected terrain that was formerly glaciated and oversteepened while the Ridgecrest event affected non-glaciated terrain. Our inventory of rockfall locations was derived from analysis of Sentinel-2 images acquired just prior to and immediately after the events. This difference mapping approach using readily-available Sentinel-2 imagery allows for rapid rockfall and landslide mapping. GIS analysis shows that even though the total area assessed for both earthquakes was similar (similar to 1500 km(2)), the significantly lower magnitude Owens Lake event produced nearly twice as many (102) mappable rockslides as the significantly stronger Ridgecrest event (58), a difference likely due to slope oversteepening in the formerly glaciated area. Significant seismic amplification by topography and reactivation of preexisting failures was apparent for both areas. Inclusion of these factors may improve failure predictions and rockfall probability estimation.

AB  - After the global crisis of the recording industry, popular music has had to rethink itself to avoid perishing. Its alliance with transmedia business and- narrative-logic has been part of that transformation. Music video remains necessary for the multilateral and transmedia music promotion. Through these formats, users create and share content concerning the artist's visual universe, making it viral and results exponentially. This supposes the first form of expansion of music video in its transformation into the logic of di-gital ecology in a post-television era. However, the music video has another aspect of growth with its extension through the visual album where each music track corresponds with a visual track; it uses mechanisms that uni-fy the messages or references, for example, as repetitive visual motifs (the-matic motifs, similar images, locations, or characters). The visual album allows another way of promoting record works: before, they were sold through two/three singles; now, an attempt is made to extend the life span of records, generating consolidated worlds of meaning. This imaginary is achieved with unity and diversity through rhetorical figures of repetition or quotes from other cultural texts, composing storytelling for music per-sonae. Projects such as Beyonce's three visual albums (Beyonce, 2013; Le-monade, 2016, and Black is King, 2020), Dirty Computer by Janelle Monae, and El mal querer by Rosalia are examples of a new form of music albums, where the musical artist is resignified with these resources for a new con-cept of body and performance.

TI  - On the Nature of Caspian Clouds
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Caspian clouds (CCs) are formed between the southern coast of the Caspian Sea and the Alborz Mountains. The purpose of this study is to identify characteristics of CCs using aerosol, cloud, and meteorological data from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and ECMWF Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) during 2000-2020. During this period, we identified and investigated 636 days with CCs. The results indicated that the frequency (%) of these clouds was higher in the summer than in other seasons because synoptic system activity varies between hot and cold periods. The hot season with the beginning of high-pressure subtropical Azores activity and the formation of a stable atmosphere in northern Iran leads to more frequent occurrence of CCs. These clouds are mainly the low- and middle-level clouds in the region, e.g., stratus and altocumulus. CCs resulted in 13.9% of annual rainfall, and 55.9% and 18.7% of the summer and autumn rainfall, respectively, relative to total rainfall from all cloud types in the study region. In the multivariate regression analysis, CC precipitation exhibited a strong positive relationship with the cloud water path (CWP), cloud optical thickness (COT), and cloud effective radius (CER). A comparison of the mean and standard deviation of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and aerosol index (AI) for CC and non-CC days did not show a significant difference. Examination of the synoptic patterns showed that the main factors in the formation of CCs are the specific environmental conditions of the region and the orographic lift of stable air masses. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model indicated that the source of moisture for the formation of CCs was largely the Caspian Sea.

TI  - Unveiling Temperature Patterns in Tree Canopies across Diverse Heights and Types
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are some of the major ecosystems that help in mitigating the effects of climate change. Understanding the relation between the surface temperatures of different vegetation and trees and their heights is very crucial in understanding events such as wildfires. In this work, relationships between tree canopy temperature and canopy height with respect to vegetation types were extracted. The southern part of Sardinia Island, which has dense forests and is often affected by wildfires, was selected as the region of interest. PRISMA hyperspectral imagery has been used to map all the available vegetation types in the region of interest using the support vector machine classifier with an accuracy of >80% for all classes. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation's (GEDI) L2A Raster Canopy Top Height product provides canopy height measurements in spatially discrete footprints, and to overcome this issue of discontinuous sampling, Random Forest Regression was used on Sentinel-1 SAR data, Sentinel-2 multispectral data, and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) to estimate the canopy heights of various vegetation classes, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 2.9176 m and a coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.791. Finally, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and emissivity product provides ground surface temperature regardless of land use and land cover (LULC) types. LST measurements over tree canopies are considered as the tree canopy temperature. We estimated the relationship between the canopy temperature of five vegetation types (evergreen oak, olive, juniper, silicicole, riparian trees) and the corresponding canopy heights and vegetation types. The resulting scatter plots showed that lower tree canopy temperatures correspond with higher tree canopies with a correlation coefficient in the range of -0.4 to -0.5 for distinct types of vegetation.

TI  - Research on A Special Hyper-Pixel for SAR Radiometric Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objects presented in synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images are the products of the joint actions of ground objects and SAR sensors in specific geospatial contexts. With the accumulation of massive time-domain SAR data, scholars have the opportunity to better understand ground-object targets and sensor systems, providing some useful feedback for SAR-data processing. Aiming at normalized and low-cost SAR radiometric monitoring, this paper proposes a new hyper-pixel concept for handling multi-pixel ensembles of semantic ground targets. The special hyper-pixel in this study refers to low-rise single-family residential areas, and its radiation reference is highly stable in the time domain when the other dimensions are fixed. The stability of its radiometric data can reach the level of 0.3 dB (1s), as verified by the multi-temporal data from Sentinel-1. A comparison with tropical-rainforest data verified its availability for SAR radiometric monitoring, and possible radiation variations and radiation-intensity shifts in the Sentinel-1B SAR products ere experimentally monitored. In this paper, the effects of seasonal climate and of the relative geometrical states observed on the intensity of the hyper-pixel's radiation are investigated. This paper proposes a novel hyper-pixel concept for processing and interpreting SAR-image data. The proposed residential hyper-pixel is shown to be useful in multi-temporal-data observations for normalized radiometric monitoring and has the potential to be used for cross-calibration, in addition to other applications.

TI  - Development of a Spectral Index for the Detection of Yellow-Flowering Vegetation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Floral phenology as a special indicator of climate change and vegetation dynamics is drawing more attention. The long-term observations of flowering events collected at scattered ground sites have accumulated valuable priority on the understanding of floral phenology, but with insufficient investigation on the spatio-temporal dynamics at regional scale, which is mainly induced by the lack of effective ways to capture the pixel-based flower events from remote sensing images. The existing yellowness indices are constructed for rape (Brassica napus L.) with less suppression to the bright background and dark green vegetation, and further with inadequate consideration on physiological characteristics and the temporal spectral signature of investigated vegetation. In this paper, we examined rape and several other representative vegetation types to determine spectral features of yellow-flower period within the growing season, then selected the visible and near-infrared bands to construct a Novel Yellowness Index (NYI) with an enhancement on the physiological mechanism of plants. The proposed NYI were discussed on the variation of mathematical properties with representative instances, cross-compared with three typical yellowness indices-Ratio Yellowness Index (RYI), Normalized Difference Yellowness Index (NDYI), and Ashourloo Canola Index (ACI) -over various yellow-flowering vegetation species at multiple scales, and validated with ground observations of three available PhenoCam network stations and field phenological observations at Gorlitz, Sachsen, and Germany. In addition, we applied NYI to detect the rape field using Sentinel-2 image at Gorlitz with typical rape area as a case study. Results show that the proposed NYI exhibits the potential to capture yellow-flowering events with increased sensitivity to the variation of flower density, and reduction of noise introduced by bright background or dark green vegetation of multiple vegetation species at different scales. As the flower density increases from 33% to 78%, the relative differences of NYI captured can reach up to 74%, compared with other three indices which have the relative differences no more than 57%. The cross-comparison indicates NYI performs better with higher consistent with PhenoCam observation and Deutscher Wetterdienst phenological station than other yellowness indices in capturing the variation of yellow flower density. The case study of NYI application in the identification of rape field exhibits good accuracy with the overall accuracy up to 97.5%, the Kappa coefficient of 0.94, and F score of 0.96. Consequently, the satellite-derived yellowness index will be a potential means to investigate the flowering dynamics and planting range of yellow-flowering vegetation such as rape.

TI  - A Dual-Polarization Information-Guided Network for SAR Ship Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an advanced active microwave sensor widely used in marine surveillance. As part of typical marine surveillance missions, ship classification in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a significant task for the remote sensing community. However, fully utilizing polarization information to enhance SAR ship classification remains an unresolved issue. Thus, we proposed a dual-polarization information-guided network (DPIG-Net) to solve it. DPIG-Net utilizes available dual-polarization information from the Sentinel-1 SAR satellite to adaptively guide feature extraction and feature fusion. We first designed a novel polarization channel cross-attention framework (PCCAF) to model the correlations of different polarization information for feature extraction. Then, we established a novel dilated residual dense learning framework (DRDLF) to refine the polarization characteristics for feature fusion. The results on the open OpenSARShip dataset indicated DPIG-Net's state-of-the-art classification accuracy compared with eleven other competitive models, which showed the potential of DPIG-Net to promote effective and sufficient utilization of SAR polarization data in the future.

TI  - Estimating Reed Bed Cover in Hungarian Fish Ponds Using NDVI-Based Remote Sensing Technique
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In the EU, aquaculture ponds cover an area of 360,000 ha and are a crucial part of the rural landscape. As many ecosystem services (e.g., habitats for protected wildlife, nutrient cycling, etc.) are correlated with the proportion of reed beds relative to open-water areas, it is important in environmental studies to be able to accurately estimate the extent and the temporal dynamics of reed cover. Here, we propose a method for mapping reed cover in fish ponds from freely available Sentinel-2 imagery using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which we applied to Hungary, the third largest carp producer in the EU. The dynamics of reed cover in Hungarian fish ponds mapped using satellite imagery show a high degree of agreement with the ground-truth points, and when compared with data reported in the annual aquaculture reports for Hungary, it was found that the calculation of reed cover based on the NDVI-based approach was more consistent than the estimates provided in the report. We discuss possible applications of this remote sensing technique in estimating reed-like vegetation cover in fish ponds and the possible use of the results for climate change studies and ecosystem services assessment.

TI  - Disruptive Role of Vertical Land Motion in Future Assessments of Climate Change-Driven Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Hazards in the Chesapeake Bay
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Future projections of sea-level rise (SLR) used to assess coastal flooding hazards and exposure throughout the 21st century and devise risk mitigation efforts often lack an accurate estimate of coastal vertical land motion (VLM) rate, driven by anthropogenic or non-climate factors in addition to climatic factors. The Chesapeake Bay (CB) region of the United States is experiencing one of the fastest rates of relative sea-level rise on the Atlantic coast of the United States. This study uses a combination of space-borne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR) data sets, available National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) long-term tide gauge data, and SLR projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), AR6 WG1 to quantify the regional rate of relative SLR and future flooding hazards for the years 2030, 2050, and 2100. By the year 2100, the total inundated areas from SLR and subsidence are projected to be 454(316-549)-600(535-690) km(2) for Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 1-1.9 to 5-8.5, respectively, and 342(132-552)-627(526-735).... km(2) only from SLR. The effect of storm surges based on Hurricane Isabel can increase the inundated area to 849(832-867)-1,117(1,054-1,205) km(2) under different VLM and SLR scenarios. We suggest that accurate estimates of VLM rate, such as those obtained here, are essential to revise IPCC projections and obtain accurate maps of coastal flooding and inundation hazards. The results provided here inform policymakers when assessing hazards associated with global climate changes and local factors in CB, required for developing risk management and disaster resilience plans.Plain Language Summary The Chesapeake Bay (CB) region of the United States is experiencing one of the fastest rates of relative sea-level rise on the Atlantic coast of the United States. However, future projections of sea-level rise (SLR) used to assess coastal flooding hazards and exposure throughout the 21st century often lack an accurate estimate of changes in land elevation. This poses a significant challenge to present and future management efforts because vertical land motion (VLM) can cause underestimation/ overestimation of flooding risk to coastal communities. This work combines satellite data and in situ observations to measure VLM and assess 21st-century flooding hazards due to SLR, hurricane effect, and land elevation change in the CB. By the year 2100, the total inundated areas from SLR and subsidence are projected to be 454-600 km(2) for very low to very high greenhouse gas scenarios. The effect of storm surges associated with Hurricane Isabel can increase the inundated area to 849-1,117 km(2) under different SLR scenarios and VLM. The results provided here inform policymakers when assessing hazards associated with global climate changes and local factors.

TI  - Modeling TEC Maps Over China Using Particle Swarm Optimization Neural Networks and Long-Term Ground-Based GPS, COSMIC, and Fengyun Data
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new model for ionospheric total electron content (TEC) over China. The new model is developed using a hybrid method composed of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial neural network and long-term observations from 257 ground-based global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) stations and space-borne GNSS radio occultation systems (COSMIC and Fengyun) during the 14-year period of 2008-2021. The PSO algorithm is used to optimize the traditional back-propagation neural network (BP-NN) model by reducing the effects of the local minimum problem. The new model is validated using out-of-sample data, and its results are compared to the BP-NN, IRI-2016 model, and global ionospheric maps provided by the International GNSS Service. Results show that TEC predicted from the new model agrees better with the reference TEC than the BP-NN and IRI-2016 models. The improvements made by the new model over the BP-NN and IRI-2016 models in the equinox, summer, and winter seasons of the solar maximum year (2015) are 4%-20%/20%-36%, 9%-21%/26%-42%, and 6%-22%/21%-43%, respectively, and their corresponding results in the solar minimum year (2019) are 12%-24%/41%-59%, 9%-24%/28%-56%, and 10%-26%/53%-72%. Furthermore, the new model well captures the diurnal evolution, seasonal variation, and variations in the ionospheric TEC under different solar activity levels. It also well captures the mid-latitude summer nighttime anomaly over China, and the diurnal anomaly is more pronounced in the solar minimum year (2019) than in the solar maximum year (2015) in terms of the nighttime-to-noontime ratio and the range of months it lasts in a year.

TI  - Long-Term Dynamics of Forest Fires in Southern Siberia
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The research focus. Wildfire is a critical environmental disturbance affecting forest dynamics, succession, and the carbon cycle in Siberian forests. Forests of southern Siberia experienced an increase of fire rate. We analyzed spatial and temporal dynamics of burned area in the southern Central Siberian Mountains. We considered burning rate within different forest types: dark needle conifers (DNC) composed by Siberian pine, spruce and fir, light-needle composed by Scotch pine and larch, and mix wood (composed by birch, aspen and conifers). Methods. We used long-term (1982-2021) climatic variables from the ERA5-Land database. Satellite observations included MODIS wildfire data (2002-2021) and gravimetric (GRACE) data (2002-2021) for estimation soil moisture content. We analyzed the spatial distribution of burned areas considering dominant forest stands and terrain (elevation, slope aspect and steepness). Results. We found a significant decreasing trend in burned area. On average, about 978.7 +/- 447.5 thousand ha including 257.1 +/- 154.3 thousand ha of forests are disturbed by fire annually. Light coniferous forests are characterized by the highest degree of the fire disturbance (relative burned area, RBA, was ca. 0.83% per year); whereas DNC stands have the lowest RBA (ca. 0.15% per year). The spatial distribution of fires in light coniferous forests showed predominance of fires on the southern slopes comparing to northern slopes (by 15-20%). We found a decreasing logarithmic trend in burned area between plains and low mountains and high mountains due to lower forest fuel loads and increased amount of precipitation on higher elevations. We also observed lower RBA values (by 300-400%) on steep slopes for light coniferous forests and mixed forests comparing to gentle slopes due to lower available forest fuels. The long-term dynamics of burned area in the region was related to the variation of climatic variables, such as soil moisture (r(2) = 0.70, p < 0.01), moisture content (r(2) = 0.63, p < 0.01) and drought index (r(2) = 0.3, p < 0.05).

TI  - Can the MODIS Data Achieve the Downscaling of GOME-2 SIF? Validation of Data from China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) can accurately reflect the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation and information on the physiological status of vegetation, which is of great research significance and application value. However, the low resolution of the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence product of the inverse performance makes it difficult to perform fine-scale studies. Therefore, concerning the above problem, this study proposes a random-forest-based downscaling method based on random forest. We used MODIS reflectance data to analyze GOME-2 SIF data at 0.5 degrees resolution over the Chinese mainland in 2011 and created a monthly SIF product at 0.05 degrees resolution for the Chinese mainland through downscaling. Then we performed a veracity check on the downscaled SIF data, analyzed factors (land cover type, climate zone type, and DEM) that could affect its accuracy, and explored the feasibility of using MODIS data in future GOME-2 SIF downscaling studies. The results show that the downscaled SIF is in remarkable agreement with the GOME-2 SIF, with an improved spatial resolution from 0.5 degrees to 0.05 degrees, and that the structural and physiological information of the SIF is well represented in the downscaled SIF, which is essential for assessing global photosynthesis. In addition, in the region with grassland land cover type, temperate grassland climate region, alpine vegetation climate region of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, as well as the region with high altitude and complex terrain, the accuracy of using MODIS to downscale the GOME-2 SIF data is low.

TI  - Remote Monitoring of Crop Nitrogen Nutrition to Adjust Crop Models: A Review
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is a central issue to address regarding the nitrogen (N) uptake by crops, and can be improved by applying the correct dose of fertilizers at specific points in the fields according to the plants status. The N nutrition index (NNI) was developed to diagnose plant N status. However, its determination requires destructive, time-consuming measurements of plant N content (PNC) and plant dry matter (PDM). To overcome logistical and economic problems, it is necessary to assesses crop NNI rapidly and non-destructively. According to the literature which we reviewed, it, as well as PNC and PDM, can be estimated using vegetation indices obtained from remote sensing. While sensory techniques are useful for measuring PNC, crop growth models estimate crop N requirements. Research has indicated that the accuracy of the estimate is increased through the integration of remote sensing data to periodically update the model, considering the spatial variability in the plot. However, this combination of data presents some difficulties. On one hand, at the level of remote sensing is the identification of the most appropriate sensor for each situation, and on the other hand, at the level of crop growth models is the estimation of the needs of crops in the interest stages of growth. The methods used to couple remote sensing data with the needs of crops estimated by crop growth models must be very well calibrated, especially for the crop parameters and for the environment around this crop. Therefore, this paper reviews currently available information from Google Scholar and ScienceDirect to identify studies relevant to crops N nutrition status, to assess crop NNI through non-destructive methods, and to integrate the remote sensing data on crop models from which the cited articles were selected. Finally, we discuss further research on PNC determination via remote sensing and algorithms to help farmers with field application. Although some knowledge about this determination is still necessary, we can define three guidelines to aid in choosing a correct platform.

TI  - Underlying Mechanisms of Urban Green Areas' Influence on Residents' Health-A Case Study from Belgrade, Serbia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The positive impacts of urban forests on residents' health are widely acknowledged. However, the methods used to quantify and demonstrate this relation are still a focus of research. The aim of the paper is to examine the relationship between the size and quality of different urban green areas to residents' health based on the face-to-face survey and remote sensing data at 12 locations in Belgrade. The socio-economic and self-perceived health characteristics were analyzed. Based on green areas' size and pollution, municipalities were divided into "less green" and "green". Vegetation quality was assessed by Sentinel-2 vegetation indexes (VI). Results show that residents in less green and green municipalities differ in physical, social, and emotional health. The quality of green areas was inversely proportional to the amount of money spent on medications and the number of doctor's visits indicating potential mechanisms of the health benefits of green areas. The lack of facilities led to different appreciation among residents. Results suggest that the quality of green infrastructure is more important than the amount in promoting residents' health. Relating the characteristics of green areas to visitors proved to improve the correlation between residents' health and the quality of green areas.

TI  - Influence of stubble burning on air quality of Northern India: a case study of Indo-Gangetic plains of India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Stubble burning is an emerging environmental issue in Northern India, which has severe implications for the air quality of the region. Although stubble burning occurs twice during a year, first during April-May and again in October-November due to paddy burning, the effects are severe during October-November months. This is exacerbated by the role of meteorological parameters and presence of inversion conditions in the atmosphere. The deterioration in the atmospheric quality can be attributed to the emissions from stubble burning which can be perceived from the changes observed in land use land cover (LULC) pattern, fire events, and sources of aerosol and gaseous pollutants. In addition, wind speed and wind direction also play a role in changing the concentration of pollutants and particulate matter over a specified area. The present study has been carried out for the states of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and western Uttar Pradesh to study the influence of stubble burning on the aerosol load of this region of Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). In this study, the aerosol level, smoke plume characteristics, long-range transport of pollutants, and affected areas during October-November from year 2016 to 2020 were examined over the Indo-Gangetic Plains (Northern India) region by the satellite observations. By MODIS-FIRMS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Fire Information for Resource Management System) observations, it was revealed that there was an increase in stubble burning events with the highest number of events being observed during the year 2016 and then a decrease in the number of events in subsequent years from 2017 to 2020. MODIS observations revealed a strong AOD gradient from west to east. The prevailing north-westerly winds assist the spread of smoke plumes over Northern India during the peak burning season of October to November. The findings of this study might be used to expand on the atmospheric processes that occur over northern India during the post-monsoon season. The pollutant, smoke plume features, and impacted regions of biomass-burning aerosols in this region are critical for weather and climate research, especially given the rising trend in agricultural burning over the previous two decades.

TI  - Comparative Impact Analysis of Cyclone Ana in the Mozambique Channel Using Satellite Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - There is still insufficient information available for a streamlined impact assessment of tropical cyclones on coastal habitats, particularly in the Mozambique Channel. Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, along with socio-ecological parameters including mangrove forest health and population density, we modeled the extent of flooding and its impact following the 'severe tropical storm' Ana which occurred between the 20 January until 25 January over the Mozambique Channel. Focusing on regions hit by Ana, namely the Sofala and Zambezia regions and the Boeny and Melaky provinces in Mozambique and Madagascar, respectively, we adapted a model by the United Nations Platform for Space-Based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response (UN-SPIDER) to effectively assess storm impacts at a resolution of up to 10 m. Our results showed that in Mozambique, more than 195,977 people have been potentially affected by Ana, while in Madagascar this number was down to 79,003. The central region of Zambezia accounted for the majority of flooding occurrences, although the Boeny province accounted for most of the flooding as a proportion of its total area. The Sofala region of Mozambique displayed the highest-affected population and highest-affected urban area, with 108,400 exposed people. However, it was found that only a small proportion of affected areas in all regions of interest (ROIs) were urban areas, accounting for 1.4% of the flooded areas on average. Low mangrove normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) changes between before the 2021-2022 cyclone season were found throughout all ROIs, despite the appearance of degraded mangrove patches in the proximity of barren areas at a fine scale (<20 m). Finally, it was found that healthy mangrove forest ecosystems in the Mozambique Channel were effective in protecting highly populated areas from cyclonic events for up to 40 km, on average.

TI  - Role of sentinel lymph node drainage mapping for localization of contralateral lymph node metastasis in locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma - A prospective pilot study
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim/Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become the standard of care for nodal staging in early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as an alternative to elective neck dissection. However, the role of sentinel lymph node (SLN) and lymphatic drainage mapping with image-guided surgery has not been studied in locally advanced OSCC. Therefore, this study was undertaken to evaluate the role of lymphatic drainage mapping in the identification of contralateral cervical lymph node metastasis in locally advanced OSCC (Stage III-IVb). Materials and Methods: We have prospectively analyzed treatment-naive patients of locally advanced, lateralized OSCC (n = 20). All patients underwent SLN imaging using peritumoral injection 0.5-1.0 mCi of 99 mTc-Sulfur colloid (Filtered) and intraoperative identification of contralateral neck nodes using a handheld gamma probe (Crystal Photonics). Results: A total of 20 patients (18 males and 2 females) with a median age of 52.5 (33-70 years) were included. Ipsilateral SLN was localized in 18 (90%) patients. Bilateral cervical nodes were visualized only in 7 (35%) patients on lymphoscintigraphy (LSG). Out of the seven patients, 5 patients underwent bilateral neck dissection and 2 patients had unilateral neck dissection with LSG-guided exploration of contralateral cervical node and intraoperative frozen section examination. Six out of these seven patients had one or other risk factor for contralateral metastasis (patients had either primary in the tongue, involvement of floor of mouth, or tumor thickness >3.75 mm). On postoperative HPE, only 1/20 (5%) patient showed metastasis in the contralateral cervical lymph node. Conclusion: Correct identification of metastatic disease in contralateral neck directly influences clinical management, as it can reduce contralateral neck failure rate and limit the morbidity associated with unnecessary contralateral neck dissection, and it is also crucial in radiotherapy planning in locally advanced OSCC. In the current study, lymphatic drainage mapping showed a metastatic rate of 5% in the contralateral neck nodes in locally advanced, lateralized OSCC. However, the role of SLNB and lymphatic drainage mapping in this subgroup of OSCC needs to be studied in larger population to validate these findings.

TI  - Influence of hydrological state on trophic state in dam induced seasonally inundated flood plain wetland
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A Good many research works focused on investigating wetland habitat state and trophic state (TS) but as far the knowledge is concerned, very little attention was paid to the hy-drological state (HS) modelling of wetlands, and no such attention was paid on exploring the linkage between HS and TS. But it is very essential to explore the role of hydrological characters on TS in order to frame hydrological management strategies. Considering this, the present study intended to build HS models using image-driven hydrological compo-nents like water presence frequency, hydro-period, water depth; to estimate trophic state index (TSI) using field-driven water samples and, finally linking HS and TSI of the wetland. Successful results can open up a new approach to improve the strategies for water quality and ecological efficiency management. Machine learning models were applied for building the HS model and Carlson's TSI method was applied to explore water quality and ecolog-ical state. The ordinary least square regression was applied for linking HS and TSI. Results showed that hydrological modification and associated causes obliterated 32.32 km2 of wet-land between the pre-dam and post-dam periods. The support vector machine model was found as the best-suited HS model to all the applied models. TSI was found poor over a wider part of the wetland, especially over the hydrologically poor patches of the wetland. The hydrological worsening is a cause for the worsening of TS. So, it can be stated that managing hydrological components is a good way to manage TS.(c) 2023 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - On Surface Waves Generated by Extra-Tropical Cyclones-Part I: Multi-Satellite Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface waves generated by Extra-Tropical Cyclones (ETCs) can significantly affect shipping, fishing, offshore oil and gas production, and other marine activities. This paper presents the results of a satellite data-based investigation of wind waves generated by two North Atlantic ETCs. These ETCs were fast-moving systems, inhibiting resonance (synchronism) between the group velocity of the generated waves and the ETC translation velocity. In these cases, wave generation begins when the front boundary of the storm appears at a given ocean location point. Since developing waves are slow, they move backward relative to the storm, grow in time, and then leave the ETC stormy area through the rear sector. Multi-satellite observations confirm such a paradigm, revealing that the storm regions are filled with young developing wind waves, the most developed in the rear-right sector. As observed, the energy of these waves grew in time during the ETC life span. It is demonstrated that the extended-fetch concept (inherent for Tropical Cyclones) does not apply to ETC. Instead, by analogy, the concept of extended-duration wave growth is more relevant. Satellite observations confirmed the validity of duration-laws for waves generated by ETCs, and demonstrated that extended-fetch solutioncan be valid at time scales exceeding the lifespan of considered ETCs.

TI  - Machine Learning-Derived Inference of the Meridional Overturning Circulation From Satellite-Observable Variables in an Ocean State Estimate
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The oceanic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) plays a key role in the climate system, and monitoring its evolution is a scientific priority. Monitoring arrays have been established at several latitudes in the Atlantic Ocean, but other latitudes and oceans remain unmonitored for logistical reasons. This study explores the possibility of inferring the MOC from globally-available satellite measurements via machine learning (ML) techniques, using the ECCOV4 state estimate as a test bed. The methodological advantages of the present approach include the use purely of available satellite data, its applicability to multiple basins within a single ML framework, and the ML model simplicity (a feed-forward fully connected neural network (NN) with small number of neurons). The ML model exhibits high skill in MOC reconstruction in the Atlantic, Indo-Pacific, and Southern Oceans. The approach achieves a higher skill in predicting the model Southern Ocean abyssal MOC than has previously been achieved via a dynamically-based approach. The skill of the model is quantified as a function of latitude in each ocean basin, and of the time scale of MOC variability. We find that ocean bottom pressure generally has the highest reconstruction skill potential, followed by zonal wind stress. We additionally test which combinations of variables are optimal. Furthermore, ML interpretability techniques are used to show that high reconstruction skill in the Southern Ocean is mainly due to (NN processing of) bottom pressure variability at a few prominent bathymetric ridges. Finally, the potential for reconstructing MOC strength estimates from real satellite measurements is discussed.

TI  - A Pixel-Scale Measurement Method of Soil Moisture Using Ground-Penetrating Radar
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground validation of remote sensing soil moisture requires ground measurements corresponding to the pixel scale. To date, there is still a lack of simple, fast and reasonable methods for soil moisture measurement at pixel scale between point measurements and remote sensing observations. In this study, a measurement method of soil moisture using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) was proposed for pixel scale. We used a PulseEKKOTM PRO GPR system with 250 MHz antennas to measure soil moisture by Fixed Offset (FO) method in four 30 x 30 m(2) plots chosen from the desert steppe. This study used a random combination method to analyze soil moisture measurements acquired by different numbers of GPR survey lines. The results showed that two survey lines of GPR would be sufficient under confidence level of 90% with the relative error of 7%, and four survey lines of GPR would be eligible under confidence level of 95% with the relative error of 5% for each plot. GPR measurement can reproduce the spatial distribution of soil moisture with higher resolution and smaller error, especially when two and four survey lines are designed in cross shape and grid shape, respectively. The method was applied to ground validation for the soil moisture from Landsat 8, showing the advantages of stable relative errors, less contingency and reliable evaluation when compared to point measurements. This method is fast and convenient and not limited to a certain pixel, and thus largely benefits the scale matching of remote sensing results and field measurements in ground validation.

TI  - Development and validation of an electronic daily control score for asthma (e-DASTHMA): a real-world direct patient data study
T2  - LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Validated questionnaires are used to assess asthma control over the past 1-4 weeks from reporting. However, they do not adequately capture asthma control in patients with fluctuating symptoms. Using the Mobile Airways Sentinel Network for airway diseases (MASK-air) app, we developed and validated an electronic daily asthma control score (e-DASTHMA).Methods We used MASK-air data (freely available to users in 27 countries) to develop and assess different daily control scores for asthma. Data-driven control scores were developed based on asthma symptoms reported by a visual analogue scale (VAS) and self-reported asthma medication use. We included the daily monitoring data from all MASK-air users aged 16-90 years (or older than 13 years to 90 years in countries with a lower age of digital consent) who had used the app in at least 3 different calendar months and had reported at least 1 day of asthma medication use. For each score, we assessed construct validity, test-retest reliability, responsiveness, and accuracy. We used VASs on dyspnoea and work disturbance, EQ-5D-VAS, Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test (CARAT), CARAT asthma, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Allergy Specific (WPAI:AS) questionnaires as comparators. We performed an internal validation using MASK-air data from Jan 1 to Oct 12, 2022, and an external validation using a cohort of patients with physician-diagnosed asthma (the INSPIRERS cohort) who had had their diagnosis and control (Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] classification) of asthma ascertained by a physician.Findings We studied 135 635 days of MASK-air data from 1662 users from May 21, 2015, to Dec 31, 2021. The scores were strongly correlated with VAS dyspnoea (Spearman correlation coefficient range 0.68-0.82) and moderately correlated with work comparators and quality-of-life-related comparators (for WPAI:AS work, we observed Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.59-0.68). They also displayed high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients range 0.79-0.95) and moderate-to-high responsiveness (correlation coefficient range 0.69-0.79; effect size measures range 0.57-0.99 in the comparison with VAS dyspnoea). The best-performing score displayed a strong correlation with the effect of asthma on work and school activities in the INSPIRERS cohort (Spearman correlation coefficients 0.70; 95% CI 0.61-0.78) and good accuracy for the identification of patients with uncontrolled or partly controlled asthma according to GINA (area under the receiver operating curve 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.78).Interpretation e-DASTHMA is a good tool for the daily assessment of asthma control. This tool can be used as an endpoint in clinical trials as well as in clinical practice to assess fluctuations in asthma control and guide treatment optimisation.Funding None.Copyright (c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Estimation of Year of Construction of Bridges in Cambodia by Analyzing the Landsat Normalized Difference Water Index
T2  - INFRASTRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Inspection data can be used to comprehend and plan effective maintenance of bridges. In particular, the year of initial construction is one of the most important criteria for formulating maintenance plans, making budget allocations, and estimating soundness. In an initial survey of bridges in Cambodia, it was concluded that the year of construction of only 54% of 2439 bridges surveyed is known, with the remaining 46% remaining unknown. In this research, Landsat satellite data is used to estimate the year of construction of these bridges. Landsat provides spatial spectral reflectance information covering more than 30 years, and for longer bridges this can be used to estimate the year of construction by visual judgement. However, limited image resolution means this is not possible for shorter bridges. Instead, a method using the Landsat Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is used to estimate the year of construction. Three pixels are selected from Landsat image data in such a way that one lies on the current location of a bridge and two other reference pixels are placed on similar terrain at a certain distance perpendicular to the bridge axis. NDWI values are plotted over time for the three pixels and the difference in value between the bridge pixel and the two reference pixels is then compared. Before the bridge is constructed, all three pixels should have similar NDWI values, but after construction the value of the target bridge pixel should differ from the other two because the NDWI value of a bridge surface is different from that of the surrounding vegetation. By looking for this change, the year of construction of a bridge can be estimated. All the bridges in the Cambodian database are classified into three categories based on length (which affects their visibility in Landsat images) and year of construction is estimated. The results show that estimated year of construction has the same accuracy in all three categories.

TI  - Drought Monitoring and Forecasting across Turkey: A Contemporary Review
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - One of the critical consequences of climate change at both local and regional scales is a change in the patterns of extreme climate events such as droughts. Focusing on the different types of droughts, their quantifying indices, associated indicators, and sources of data (remote sensing (RS)/in situ measurements), this article reviewed the recent studies (from 2010 to 2022) that have explored drought features in Turkey. To this end, a total of 71 articles were selected from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. The selected papers were clustered into two categories: (i) drought monitoring studies and (ii) drought forecasting articles. Then, the representative papers were reviewed in detail regarding the implemented indices, models (techniques), case study area, and source of the indicators used to derive drought indices. The review results showed that most of the studies aimed at meteorological drought monitoring and forecasting. An increasing trend was also observed in the use of machine learning for short-term meteorological and hydrological drought prediction. On the other hand, the emerging RS technology and satellite-driven indicators were rarely used in the country. The review showed that there is room for more research on agricultural and hydrological drought monitoring, forecasting, and pattern detection in Turkey.

TI  - Decline of Late Spring and Summer Snow Cover in the Scottish Highlands from 1984 to 2022: A Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Late spring and summer snow cover, the remnants of winter and early spring snowfall, not only possess an intrinsic importance for montane flora and fauna, but also act as a sensitive indicator for climate change. The variability and potential trends in late spring and summer (snowmelt season) snow cover in mountain regions are often poorly documented. May to mid-September Landsat imagery from 1984 to 2022 was used to quantify changes in the snow-covered area of upland regions in the Scottish Highlands. There was substantial annual variability in the area of May to mid-September snow cover combined with a significant decline over the 39-year study period (p = 0.02). Long-term climate data used to show variability in May to mid-September snow cover was positively related to winter snowfall and negatively related to winter and April temperatures. The results from a long-running field survey counting the number of snow patches that survive until the following winter were used to check the veracity of the study. Further, accuracy was estimated through comparison with higher resolution Sentinel-2 imagery, giving a user and producer accuracy rate of 99.8% and 87%, respectively. Projected future warming will further diminish this scarce, valuable habitat, along with its associated plant communities, thus threatening the biodiversity and scenic value of the Scottish Highlands.

TI  - Underground Water Level Prediction in Remote Sensing Images Using Improved Hydro Index Value with Ensemble Classifier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The economic sustainability of aquifers across the world relies on accurate and rapid estimates of groundwater storage changes, but this becomes difficult due to the absence of in-situ groundwater surveys in most areas. By closing the water balance, hydrologic remote sensing measures offer a possible method for quantifying changes in groundwater storage. However, it is uncertain to what extent remote sensing data can provide an accurate assessment of these changes. Therefore, a new framework is implemented in this work for predicting the underground water level using remote sensing images. Generally, the water level is defined into five levels: Critical, Overexploited, Safe, Saline, and Semi-critical, based on water quantity. In this manuscript, the remote sensing images were acquired from remote sensing images. At first, Wiener filtering was employed for preprocessing. Secondly, the Vegetation Indexes (VI) (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), Infrared index (IRI), Radar Vegetation Index (RVI)), and statistical features (entropy, Root Mean Square (RMS), Skewness, and Kurtosis) were extracted from the preprocessed remote sensing images. Then, the extracted features were combined as a novel hydro index, which was fed to the Ensemble Classifier (EC): Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and improved Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) models for underground water level prediction in the remote sensing images. The obtained results prove the efficacy of the proposed framework by using different performance measures. The results shows that the False Positive Rate (FPR) of the proposed EC model is 0.0083, which is better than that of existing methods. On the other hand, the proposed EC model has a high accuracy of 0.90, which is superior to the existing traditional models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU).

TI  - Thermodynamic Contribution to Vortex Alignment and Rapid Intensification of Hurricane Sally (2020)
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - As a part of the Tropical Cyclone Rapid Intensification Project (TCRI), observations were made of the rapid intensification of Hurricane Sally (2020) as it passed over the Gulf of Mexico. High-altitude dropsondes and radar observations from NOAA's Gulfstream IV, radar observations from WP-3D aircraft, the WSR-88D ground radar network, satellite images, and satellite-detected lightning strikes are used to apply recently developed theoretical knowledge about tropical cyclone intensification. As observed in many other tropical cyclones, strong, bottom-heavy vertical mass flux profiles are correlated with low (but positive) values of low- to midlevel moist convective instability along with high column relative humidity. Such mass flux profiles produce rapid spinup at low levels and the environmental conditions giving rise to them are associated with an intense midlevel vortex. This low-level spinup underneath the midlevel vortex results in the vertical alignment of the vortex column, which is a key step in the rapid intensification process. In the case of Sally, the spinup of the low-level vortex resulted from vorticity stretching, while the spinup of the midlevel vortex at 6 km resulted from vorticity tilting produced by the interaction of convective ascent with moderate vertical shear.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The purpose of this study is to investigate the rapid intensification of Hurricane Sally as it was approaching the Florida Panhandle. We do that by analyzing an unprecedented dataset from the NOAA WP-3D and Gulfstream-IV aircraft, together with ground-based radar and satellite data. We find that both the dynamics (vorticity structure and evolution) and thermodynamics (instability index, saturation fraction, heating/mass flux profiles) need to be considered in diagnosing intensification processes. Further field projects with continuous high-altitude dropsondes and research are needed to see if these are applicable to other reformation events as well as genesis.

TI  - Estimation and Mapping Above-Ground Mangrove Carbon Stock Using Sentinel-2 Data Derived Vegetation Indices in Benoa Bay of Bali Province, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming, with the highest atmospheric concentration. Mangrove forests absorb CO2 three times higher than terrestrial forests and tropical rainforests. Moreover, mangrove forests can be a source of Indonesian income in the form of a blue economy. Therefore, an accurate method is needed to investigate mangrove carbon stock. The utilisation of remote sensing data with the results of the above-ground carbon (AGC) detection model of mangrove forests based on multispectral imaging and vegetation index can be a solution to obtain fast, cheap, and accurate information related to AGC estimation. This study aimed to investigate the best model for estimating the AGC of mangroves using Sentinel-2 imagery in Benoa Bay, Bali Province. The Random Forest (RF) method was used to classify the difference between mangrove and non-mangrove by treating several parameters. Furthermore, a semi-empirical approach was used to assess and map the AGC of mangroves. Allometric equations were used to calculate and produce AGC per species. Moreover, the model was built with linear regression equations for one variable x and multiple regression equations for more than one x variable. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used to assess the validation of the model results. The results of the mangrove forests area detected in the research location around 1,134.92 ha, with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 0.984 and a kappa coefficient of 0.961. This study highlights that the best model was the combination of IRECI and TRVI vegetation indices (RMSE: 11.09 Mg/ha) for a model based on red edge bands. Meanwhile, the best results from the model that does not use the red edge band were the combination of TRVI and DVI vegetation indices (RMSE: 13.63 Mg/ha). The use of red edge and NIR bands is highly recommended in building the AGC model of mangrove forests because they can increase the accuracy value. Thus, the results of this study are highly recommended in estimating the AGC of mangrove forests because it has been proven to increase the accuracy value of previous studies using optical images.

TI  - Medfly Population Suppression through Augmentative Release of an Introduced Parasitoid in an Irrigated Multi-Fruit Orchard of Central-Western Argentina
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Ceratitis capitata, commonly known as the Mediterranean fruit fly or medfly, is one of the most damaging invasive insect pests for fruit production and trade worldwide. Augmentative biological control (ABC) using parasitoids, insects whose larvae develop as parasites that eventually kill their hosts, is an eco-friendly strategy for medfly suppression and is used in several countries. This strategy relies on periodic releases of large numbers of mass reared parasitoids in an area where naturally occurring parasitoids are too few to control the target pest. ABC has been incorporated for 10 years into medfly suppression strategies in the irrigated fruit production valleys of San Juan province, northwestern Argentina, by the San Juan Fruit Fly Control and Eradication Program. In this study, we report the results of mass releases of the Southeast Asia-native parasitoid Diachasmimorpha longicaudata in a fruit farm from early summer (December) to mid-autumn (May) over two successive years. The effect of the released parasitoids on the suppression of the medfly population was evaluated based on captures of adult flies in food-baited traps, and the resultant levels of parasitism of fly larvae were assessed based on adult flies in sentinel fruit traps. Our results showed a substantial decrease in the medfly population on the parasitoid release farm. Therefore, ABC can be an effective tool for medfly control in San Juan. Biological control through the augmentative release of parasitoids is an important complementary tool that may be incorporated into other strategies for the eradication/eco-friendly control of pest fruit flies. However, not much information is available on the effectiveness of fruit fly parasitoids as biocontrol agents in semi-arid and temperate fruit-growing regions. Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of augmentative releases of the larval parasitoid Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) on Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (medfly) populations over two fruit seasons (2013 and 2014) on a 10 ha irrigated fruit farm in San Juan province, central-western Argentina. The parasitoids were mass reared on irradiated medfly larvae of the Vienna-8 temperature-sensitive lethal genetic sexing strain. About 1692 (+/- 108) parasitoids/ha were released per each of the 13 periods throughout each fruit season. Another similar farm was chosen as a control of non-parasitoid release. The numbers of captured adult flies in food-baited traps and of recovered fly puparia from sentinel fruits were considered the main variables to analyze the effect of parasitoid release on fly population suppression using a generalized least squares model. The results showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the medfly population on the parasitoid release farm when compared to the Control farm, demonstrating the effectiveness of augmentative biological control using this exotic parasitoid. Thus, D. longicaudata could be used in combination with other medfly suppression strategies in the fruit production valleys of San Juan.

TI  - DIET: Conditional independence testing with marginal dependence measures of residual information.
T2  - Proceedings of machine learning research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Conditional randomization tests (CRTs) assess whether a variable x is predictive of another variable y, having observed covariates z. CRTs require fitting a large number of predictive models, which is often computationally intractable. Existing solutions to reduce the cost of CRTs typically split the dataset into a train and test portion, or rely on heuristics for interactions, both of which lead to a loss in power. We propose the decoupled independence test (DIET), an algorithm that avoids both of these issues by leveraging marginal independence statistics to test conditional independence relationships. DIET tests the marginal independence of two random variables: Fx∣z(x∣z) and Fy∣z(y∣z) where F∣z(∣z) is a conditional cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the distribution p(∣z). These variables are termed "information residuals." We give sufficient conditions for DIET to achieve finite sample type-1 error control and power greater than the type-1 error rate. We then prove that when using the mutual information between the information residuals as a test statistic, DIET yields the most powerful conditionally valid test. Finally, we show DIET achieves higher power than other tractable CRTs on several synthetic and real benchmarks.

TI  - A Comparative Assessment of Multi-Source Generation of Digital Elevation Models for Fluvial Landscapes Characterization and Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Imaging and measuring the Earth's relief with sensors mounted upon unmanned aerial vehicles is an increasingly frequently used and promising method of remote sensing. In the context of fluvial geomorphology and its applications, e.g., landform mapping or flood modelling, the reliable representation of the land surface on digital elevation models is crucial. The main objective of the study was to assess and compare the accuracy of state-of-the-art remote sensing technologies in generating DEMs for riverscape characterization and fluvial monitoring applications. In particular, we were interested in DAP and LiDAR techniques comparison, and UAV applicability. We carried out field surveys, i.e., GNSS-RTK measurements, UAV and aircraft flights, on islands and sandbars within a nature reserve on a braided section of the Vistula River downstream from the city of Warsaw, Poland. We then processed the data into DSMs and DTMs based on four sources: ULS (laser scanning from UAV), UAV-DAP (digital aerial photogrammetry), ALS (airborne laser scanning), and satellite Pleiades imagery processed with DAP. The magnitudes of errors are represented by the cross-reference of values generated on DEMs with GNSS-RTK measurements. Results are presented for exposed sediment bars, riverine islands covered by low vegetation and shrubs, or covered by riparian forest. While the average absolute height error of the laser scanning DTMs oscillates around 8-11 cm for most surfaces, photogrammetric DTMs from UAV and satellite data gave errors averaging more than 30 cm. Airborne and UAV LiDAR measurements brought almost the perfect match. We showed that the UAV-based LiDAR sensors prove to be useful for geomorphological mapping, especially for geomorphic analysis of the river channel at a large scale, because they reach similar accuracies to ALS and better than DAP-based image processing.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Trend Analysis of Coastal Vegetation Using Metrics Derived from Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and modeling of coastal vegetation and wetland systems are considered major challenges, especially when considering environmental response to hazards, disturbances, and management activities. Remote sensing applications can provide alternatives and complementary approaches to the often costly and laborious field-based collection methods traditionally used for coastal ecosystem monitoring. New and improved sensors and data analysis techniques have become available, making remote sensing applications attractive for evaluation and potential use in monitoring coastal vegetation properties and ecosystem conditions and change. This study involves the extraction of vegetation metrics from airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and hyperspectral imagery (HSI) to quantify coastal dune vegetation characteristics and assesses landscape-level trends from those derived metrics. HSI- and LiDAR-derived elevation (digital elevation model) and vegetation metrics (canopy height model, leaf area index, and normalized difference vegetation index) were used in conjunction with per-pixel linear regression and hot spot analyses to evaluate hurricane-induced spatial and temporal changes in elevation and vegetation properties. These assessments showed areas with greatest decreases in vegetation metric values were associated with direct tropical storm energies and processes (i.e., overwashing events eroding beach and dune features), while those with the greatest increases in vegetation metric values were in areas where overwashed sediments were distributed. This study narrows existing gaps in dune vegetation data by advancing new methodologies to classify, quantify, and estimate critical coastal vegetation metrics. The tools and methods developed in this study will ultimately improve future estimates and predictions of nearshore dynamics and impacts from disturbance events.

TI  - Automatic Classification of Histopathology Images across Multiple Cancers Based on Heterogeneous Transfer Learning
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Current artificial intelligence (AI) in histopathology typically specializes on a single task, resulting in a heavy workload of collecting and labeling a sufficient number of images for each type of cancer. Heterogeneous transfer learning (HTL) is expected to alleviate the data bottlenecks and establish models with performance comparable to supervised learning (SL). Methods: An accurate source domain model was trained using 28,634 colorectal patches. Additionally, 1000 sentinel lymph node patches and 1008 breast patches were used to train two target domain models. The feature distribution difference between sentinel lymph node metastasis or breast cancer and CRC was reduced by heterogeneous domain adaptation, and the maximum mean difference between subdomains was used for knowledge transfer to achieve accurate classification across multiple cancers. Result: HTL on 1000 sentinel lymph node patches (L-HTL-1000) outperforms SL on 1000 sentinel lymph node patches (L-SL-1-1000) (average area under the curve (AUC) and standard deviation of L-HTL-1000 vs. L-SL-1-1000: 0.949 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.931 +/- 0.008, p value = 0.008). There is no significant difference between L-HTL-1000 and SL on 7104 patches (L-SL-2-7104) (0.949 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.948 +/- 0.008, p value = 0.742). Similar results are observed for breast cancer. B-HTL-1008 vs. B-SL-1-1008: 0.962 +/- 0.017 vs. 0.943 +/- 0.018, p value = 0.008; B-HTL-1008 vs. B-SL-2-5232: 0.962 +/- 0.017 vs. 0.951 +/- 0.023, p value = 0.148. Conclusions: HTL is capable of building accurate AI models for similar cancers using a small amount of data based on a large dataset for a certain type of cancer. HTL holds great promise for accelerating the development of AI in histopathology.

TI  - From single- to multi-modal remote sensing imagery interpretation: a survey and taxonomy
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Modality is a source or form of information. Through various modal information, humans can perceive the world from multiple perspectives. Simultaneously, the observation of remote sensing (RS) is multimodal. We observe the world macroscopically through panchromatic, Lidar, and other modal sensors. Multimodal observation of remote sensing has become an active area, which is beneficial for urban planning, monitoring, and other applications. Despite numerous advancements in this area, there has still not been a comprehensive assessment that provides a systematic overview with a unified evaluation. Accordingly, in this survey paper, we first highlight the key differences between single- and multimodal RS imagery interpretation, then use these differences to guide our research survey of multimodal RS imagery interpretation in a cascaded structure. Finally, some potential future research directions are explored and outlined. We hope that this survey will serve as a starting point for researchers to review state-of-the-art developments and work on multimodal research.

T2  - RESEARCH IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) of Qinghai Province, in the Tibetan Plateau of China, is the main source of the Yangtze, Yellow, and Lancang rivers, and is very significant to the security of freshwater resources for China and southeastern Asia. It is a critical ecological region of China for its ecological functions, and has been changed or even degraded in recent decades owing to climate change and human pressure. To effectively protect and restore the degraded ecosystems, the Chinese government initiated a series of ecological conservation projects in TRHR. It is essential to quantitatively assess ecosystem changes and their relationship to driving factors for indepth understanding of long-term changes of ecosystems and effects of ecological restoration policies and offer practical insights for ecological restoration. Here, land cover data has been interpreted with the series data of Landsat during 1990-2015. The patterns of different ecosystems and their developing process have been derived from land cover change. The results show that ecosystem types in TRHR include forest, grassland, cropland, wetland, artificial surface and barren land, accounting for 4.51%, 70.80%, 0.15%, 9.47%, 0.16% and 14.90%, respectively. Barren land converted to wetland was the significant ecosystem change from 1990 to 2015. Increases in temperature and precipitation and implementation of ecological rehabilitation helped maintain relatively stable ecosystem patterns. It is necessary to continue ecological projects to improve and/or maintain the ecosystems in TRHR because there is still a risk of land degradation under increasing climate change and human activity.

TI  - Radiation Dose Detection on FY-4B Satellite
T2  - AEROSPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The radiation damage effect is relatively serious during spacecraft operation in orbit. To know the real cumulative dose in orbit accurately, a radiation dose detector is carried on the FY-4B satellite. It comprises one electric control unit and three dose detectors, with a total of four payloads. Each dose detector includes five dose-monitoring points corresponding to different shielding thicknesses, which are mainly used for the measurement of the dose depth. Three dose detectors with the same function are installed in the X, Y and Z positions and can detect the total dose in different directions during the operation of the satellite. Each detector has the characteristics of small size, high integration and low power consumption. At present, the FY-4B satellite is in orbit. The detectors have been working normally since they were started up, and good preliminary detection results have been obtained. From the power-up of the detectors to April 2022, the maximum dose has reached 2.7 x 10(3) rad(Si). We conducted a preliminary analysis of the relationship between total dose and shielding thickness. In addition, the relationship between daily average dose and shielding thickness was further analyzed. These studies have application value for radiation protection design.

TI  - A Deep Learning-Based Approach to Predict Large-Scale Dynamics of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for the Monitoring of Vegetation Activities and Stresses Using Meteorological Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation activities and stresses are crucial for vegetation health assessment. Changes in an environment such as drought do not always result in vegetation drought stress as vegetation responses to the climate involve complex processes. Satellite-based vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) have been widely used to monitor vegetation activities. As satellites only carry information for understanding past and current vegetation conditions, there is a need to model vegetation dynamics to make future predictions. Although many other factors are related, we attempt to predict the vegetation activities and stresses via simulating NDVI, based on only meteorological data and using a deep learning method (bidirectional long short-term memory model, BiLSTM). The BiLSTM is a sequence processing model that can predict NDVI by establishing the relationship between meteorological variables and vegetation activities. Experimental results show that the predicted NDVI is consistent with the reference data (R-2 = 0.69 +/- 0.28). The best accuracy was achieved in the deciduous forest (R-2 = 0.87 +/- 0.16). The vegetation condition index (VCI) calculated from the BiLSTM-predicted NDVI also agreed with the satellite-based ones (R-2 = 0.70 +/- 0.28). Both the monitored and predicted VCI indicated an upward but insignificant trend of vegetation activity in the past decade and increased vegetation stresses in the early growing season over northern China. Based on meteorological data, the deep learning-based solution shows the potential for not only retrospective analysis, but also future prediction of vegetation activities and stresses under varied climate conditions as compared with remote sensing data.

TI  - Comparison of Global and Local Poisson Models for the Number of Recruitment Trees in Natural Forests
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The recruitment of natural forests is the key to stand growth and regeneration. Constructing theoretical models for recruitment trees is crucial for accurately quantifying stand growth and yield. To this end, the objective was to use relevant Poisson models to study the spatial relationships between the number of recruitment trees (NRTs) and driving factors, such as topography, stand, and remote sensing factors. Taking the Northeast China Liangshui Nature Reserve as the study area and 127 ecological public welfare forest plots based on grid sampling as study data, we constructed global models (Poisson regression (PR) and linear mixed Poisson regression (LMPR)) and local models (geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) and semiparametric GWPR (SGWPR)) to simulate the NRTs. The evaluation indicators were calculated to analyse four model fittings, predictive abilities, and spatial effects of residual analysis. The results show that local (GWPR and SGWPR) models have great advantages in all aspects. Compared with the GWPR model, the SGWPR model exhibited improved performance by considering whether coefficients have geographical variability for all independent variables. Therefore, the SGWPR model more accurately depicts the spatial distributions of NRTs than the other models.

TI  - An Improved YOLOv5 Method to Detect Tailings Ponds from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tailings ponds' failure and environmental pollution make tailings monitoring very important. Remote sensing technology can quickly and widely obtain ground information and has become one of the important means of tailings monitoring. However, the efficiency and accuracy of traditional remote sensing monitoring technology have difficulty meeting the management needs. At the same time, affected by factors such as the geographical environment and imaging conditions, tailings have various manifestations in remote sensing images, which all bring challenges to the accurate acquisition of tailings information in large areas. By improving You Only Look Once (YOLO) v5s, this study designs a deep learning-based framework for the large-scale extraction of tailings ponds information from the entire high-resolution remote sensing images. For the improved YOLOv5s, the Swin Transformer is integrated to build the Swin-T backbone, the Fusion Block of efficient Reparameterized Generalized Feature Pyramid Network (RepGFPN) in DAMO-YOLO is introduced to form the RepGFPN Neck, and the head is replaced with Decoupled Head. In addition, sample boosting strategy (SBS) and global non-maximum suppression (GNMS) are designed to improve the sample quality and suppress repeated detection frames in the entire image, respectively. The model test results based on entire Gaofen-6 (GF-6) high-resolution remote sensing images show that the F1 score of tailings ponds is significantly improved by 12.22% compared with YOLOv5, reaching 81.90%. On the basis of both employing SBS, the improved YOLOv5s boots the mAP@0.5 of YOLOv5s by 5.95%, reaching 92.15%. This study provides a solution for tailings ponds' monitoring and ecological environment management.

T2  - GEOTECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The transitional zone of the marginal seas of the Asia-Pacific region is a significant object for geological research, the large deposits of hydrocarbons (oil, gas, gas condensate, gas hydrates) have been discovered in the regions of the transition zone. The article gives an interpretation of the main gas-geochemical and geological tectonic regularities of the occurrence and distribution of methane and carbon dioxide fields of different types on the shelf of Sakhalin Island. A study of the gas-geochemical parameters of the emitted gases in the "continent-shelf" transit zone was carried out based on comparison of field studies and satellite observation data. The data of satellite observation of Sakhalin Island and its shelf are presented to identify the relationship between seismic events and changes in the level of methane concentration in the atmospheric air (in particular, on the example of the methane discharge regime of the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsky mud volcano). Remote sensing data are compared with the results of the field studies, and an assessment is made of the potential using satellite observation methods for studying the gas geochemical composition of the methane and carbon dioxide field. The results obtained can make it possible to refine the assessment of the emission of climatically active gases, and also bring the significant incentive to the development of the Russian Federation project "Far Eastern Marine Carbon Monitoring Plots Consortium."

TI  - Evaluation of the Role of Axillary Lymph Node Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology in Early Breast Cancer With or Without Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of axillary lymph nodes (AxLNs) is performed to diagnose nodal metastasis in patients with breast cancer. Although the sensitivity of ultrasound-guided FNAC for identifying AxLN metastasis is in the range of 36%-99%, whether sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) should be performed for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) patients with negative FNAC results is uncertain. This study aimed to determine the role of FNAC before NAC in the evaluation and management of AxLN in early breast cancer patients. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 3,810 clinically node-negative (a lymph node with no clinical metastasis without FNAC or radiological suspicion of metastasis with negative FNAC results) patients with breast cancer who underwent SLNB between 2008 and 2019. We compared the positivity rate of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) between patients who received and those who did not receive NAC with negative FNAC results or without FNAC and axillary recurrence rate in the neoadjuvant group with negative SLNB results. Results: In the non-neoadjuvant (primary surgery) group, the positivity rate of SLNs in patients with negative FNAC results was higher than that in patients without FNAC (33.2% vs. 12.9%; p < 0.001). However, the SLN positivity rate of patients with negative FNAC results (false-negative rate for FNAC) in the neoadjuvant group was lower than that in the primary surgery group (3.0% vs. 33.2%; p < 0.001). After a median follow-up of 3 years, one axillary nodal recurrence was observed, which was a case from the neoadjuvant non-FNAC group. None of the patients in the neoadjuvant group with negative FNAC results had axillary recurrence. Conclusion: The false-negative rate for FNAC in the primary surgery group was high; however, SLNB was the proper axillary staging procedure for NAC patients who have clinically suspicious AxLN metastases on radiologic examination but negative FNAC results.

TI  - AMFFNet: attention-guided multi-level feature fusion network for land cover classification of remote sensing images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the field of remote sensing, the classification of land cover is a pivotal and challenging issue. Standard models fail to capture global and semantic information in remote sensing images despite the fact that a convolutional neural network provides robust support for semantic segmentation. In addition, owing to disparities in semantic levels and spatial resolution, the simple fusion of low-level and high-level features may diminish the efficiency. To address these deficiencies, an attention-guided multi-level feature fusion network (AMFFNet) is proposed in this study. The proposed AMFFNet approach is designed as an encoder-decoder network with the inclusion of a multi-level feature fusion module (MFF) and a dual attention map module (DAM). A DAM models the semantic association of features from a spatial and channel perspective, and an MFF bridges the semantic and resolution gaps between high-level and low-level features. Furthermore, we propose a residual-based boundary refinement upsample module to further optimize the object boundaries. The experimental results indicate that the proposed strategy can considerably enhance the accuracy of land cover classification, achieving a mean intersection over union of 90.39% on the LandCover.ai dataset and 63.14% on the Gaofen Image Dataset with 15 categories (GID-15).

TI  - Assessing the Long-Term Hydrological Effects of Rapid Urbanization in Metropolitan Shanghai, China: The Finer the Landscape Classification, the More Accurate the Modeling?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization often leads to increase in surface runoff; its modelling is always the focus in the field of land use effect. One of the methodological issues is how to classify the landscape (land use/land cover) in the model. In this study, the long-term hydrological impact assessment (L-THIA) model was used to simulate the change of annual surface runoff during the rapid urbanization in Shanghai since 1965. Two landscape scenarios, based upon land uses and pervious/impervious surfaces, were compared, and the CN values were adjusted to validate the applicability of the two landscape scenarios. The results showed that there was almost no difference between the results based on the two landscape scenarios, and it was suggested that the simplified landscape scenario based upon pervious/impervious surfaces can be workable and efficient, while the land use scenario may not be necessary for the modelling considering its scale of interpretation of remote sensing data. It was found that there was a clear linear relationship between the percentage of impervious surfaces and surface runoff. For every 1% increase in impervious surface, runoff increased by 0.94%. In addition, the effect of precipitation on the modelling was also discussed, which indicated that with the increase in impervious surface percentage, the response of runoff change in both dry year and dry season was more sensitive.

TI  - Contributions from experimental geostatistical analyses for solving the cloud-cover problem in remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, in many fields and applications, such as mining engineering, environmental monitoring, soil science, natural resources and environmental topics, the potential of Remote Sensing have been exploited. Large amount of data, easy and fast accessibility, and time-space availability are the reasons of attractiveness of satellite data in many fields of geosciences. However, satellite images face the problems due to presence of shadows and clouds, which is a general and real challenge since the surface features are masked. In many cases, a dense cloud cover simply prevents any detailed study of the target area through Earth Observation techniques. Geostatistics is a science field properly developed to estimate the unknown values in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space; therefore, it can be a potential approach to solve cloud-cover issues in Remote Sensing investigations. This work applies the geostatistical tools over a sentinel-2 satellite image targeting land cover in Emilia Romagna (Italy). The three main spectrum bands (RGB-values) with 10-m spatial resolution have been selected as target variables. The objective is to estimate pixel values within an area which is covered by clouds. The spatial variability of pixels with available land cover information have been studied through the use of variogram tools. Different estimation neighborhoods have been tested for application of the Kriging interpolation method, in order to es-timate the RGB values below the cloud-covered area. The estimation has been performed, by controlling the properties of the estimator, the varying sizes and shapes of the neighborhood, the available number of RGB data used for estimation and the spatial distribution of pixels in the image. An image with close time period, without clouds, has been used to validate the results. Moreover, the estimation variance of RGB values for each pixel has been mapped. Results have shown the advantages and limitations of the proposed geostatistical method for the specific application of cloud-covered areas.

TI  - Feinting Repeats, Repeating Feints: The Developmental "Double Return" in Brahms and Sonata Theory Typology
T2  - JOURNAL OF MUSIC THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most prominent char ac ter is tics of Johannes Brahms's approach to sonata form is the return to the tonic at the start of the sec ond sec tion (or "rota tion") for a restate ment of the expo si tion's pri mary theme. Well-known exam ples include the fina les of the First and Third Symphonies, the open ing move ments of the G-minor Piano Quartet and Fourth Symphony, and the Tragic Overture. This com mon basic prin ci ple can nev er the less under pin a vari ety of for mal typol o gies. Ostensibly a three-part sonata form with devel op men tal dou ble return would be most likely labeled a sonata rondo (type 4 in Hepokoski and Darcy's sonata the ory), while a two-part design is so typ i cal of Brahms's prac tice that it has become known as a "Brahmsian defor ma tion" (expanded type 1). Yet numer ous cases exist in which nei ther read ing above is per mit ted-most nota bly, three-part sonata forms with devel op men tal dou ble return used as open ing move ments. In these cases sonata the ory is left clas si fy ing these designs as a con ven tional type 3 sonata with an expo si tional repeat feint. There are some seri ous prob lems, how ever, with this inter preta tion. First is the sheer num ber of pieces in which this dou ble return occurs; in fact, after 1878 Brahms is more likely to "feign" a repeat than to pro vide one. Second, how the pri mary theme returns is hardly ever iden ti cal to its open ing appear ance and can rarely be con fused with an expo si tion repeat (the op. 25 Quartet and Fourth Symphony are excep tions in this sense). Exploring these works, the author pro poses a new sub type of the type 3 sonata to clas sify Brahms's mature prac tice, called "type 34." Ultimately, though, these find ings may lead to ques tions regard ing the effi cacy of a clas si cally ori ented typol ogy confronted with late nineteenth-cen tury prac tice.

TI  - Impact of COVID lockdowns on spatio-temporal variability in land surface temperature and vegetation index
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In urban areas, industrial and human activities are the prime cause that exacerbates the heating effects, also called the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the proportion of vegetation (P-v) are indicators of measurement of the heating/urbanization effects. In the present work, we investigated the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown, i.e., restricted human activities. We used Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS (level 1) data to investigate spatial and temporal heterogeneity changes in these urbanization indicators during full and partial lockdown periods in 2020 and 2021, with 2019 as the base year. We have selected three cities in India's eastern coal mining belt, Bokaro, Dhanbad, and Ranchi, for the study. Results showed a significant decrease in LST values over all sites, with a maximum reduction over mining sites, i.e., Bokaro and Dhanbad. The LST value decreased by about 13-19% during the lockdown period. Vegetation indices (i.e., NDVI and P-v) showed a substantial increase of about 15% overall sites. With decreased LST values and increased NDVI values, these quantities' correlations became more negative during the lockdown period. More positive changes are noticed over mining sites than non/less mining sites. This indirectly indicates the reduction in the heat-absorbing particles in the environment and surface of these sites, a possible cause for the reduction in LST values substantially. Reduction in coal particles at the land and vegetation surface likely contributed to decreased LST and enhanced vegetation indices. To check the statistical significance of changes in the UHI indicators in the lockdown period, statistical tests (ANOVA and Tukey's test) are performed. Results indicate that most of the case changes have been significant. The study's finding suggests the lockdown's positive impact on the heating/UHI effects. It emphasizes the need for planned lockdowns as city mitigation strategies to overcome pollution and environmental issues.

TI  - Estimation of Tropical Cyclone Intensity Using Multi-Platform Remote Sensing and Deep Learning with Environmental Field Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate tropical cyclone (TC) intensity estimation is crucial for prediction and disaster prevention. Currently, significant progress has been achieved for the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in TC intensity estimation. However, many studies have overlooked the fact that the local convolution used by CNNs does not consider the global spatial relationships between pixels. Hence, they can only capture limited spatial contextual information. In addition, the special rotation invariance and symmetry structure of TC cannot be fully expressed by convolutional kernels alone. Therefore, this study proposes a new deep learning-based model for TC intensity estimation, which uses a combination of rotation equivariant convolution and Transformer to address the rotation invariance and symmetry structure of TC. Combining the two can allow capturing both local and global spatial contextual information, thereby achieving more accurate intensity estimation. Furthermore, we fused multi-platform satellite remote sensing data into the model to provide more information about the TC structure. At the same time, we integrate the physical environmental field information into the model, which can help capture the impact of these external factors on TC intensity and further improve the estimation accuracy. Finally, we use TCs from 2003 to 2015 to train our model and use 2016 and 2017 data as independent validation sets to verify our model. The overall root mean square error (RMSE) is 8.19 kt. For a subset of 482 samples (from the East Pacific and Atlantic) observed by aircraft reconnaissance, the root mean square error is 7.88 kt.

TI  - An Adaptive Feature Fusion Network with Superpixel Optimization for Crop Classification Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop-type mapping is the foundation of grain security and digital agricultural management. Accuracy, efficiency and large-scale scene consistency are required to perform crop classification from remote sensing images. Many current remote-sensing crop extraction methods based on deep learning cannot account for adaptation effects in large-scale, complex scenes. Therefore, this study proposes a novel adaptive feature-fusion network for crop classification using single-temporal Sentinel-2 images. The selective patch module implemented in the network can adaptively integrate the features of different patch sizes to assess complex scenes better. TabNet was used simultaneously to extract spectral information from the center pixels of the patches. Multitask learning was used to supervise the extraction process to improve the weight of the spectral characteristics while mitigating the negative impact of a small sample size. In the network, superpixel optimization was applied to post-process the classification results to improve the crop edges. By conducting the crop classification of peanut, rice, and corn based on Sentinel-2 images in 2022 in Henan Province, China, the novel method proposed in this paper was more accurate, indicated by an F1 score of 96.53%, than other mainstream methods. This indicates our model's potential for application in crop classification in large scenes.

AB  - The spatial distribution of cotton fields is primary information for national farm management, the agricultural economy and the textile industry. Therefore, accurate cotton information at the regional scale is required with a rapid increase due to the chance provided by the huge amounts of satellite images accumulated in recent decades. Research has started to introduce the phenology characteristics shown at special growth phases of cotton but frequently focuses on limited vegetation indices with less consideration on the whole growth period. In this paper, we investigated a set of phenological and time-series features with optimization depending on each feature permutation's importance and redundancy, followed by its performance evaluation through the cotton extraction using the Random Forest (RF) classifier. Three sets of 31 features are involved: (1) phenological features were determined by the biophysical and biochemical characteristics in the spectral space of cotton during each of its five distinctive phenological stages, which were identified from 2307 representative cotton samples using 21,237 Sentinel-2 images; (2) three typical vegetation indices were functionalized into time-series features by harmonic analysis; (3) three terrain factors were derived from the digital elevation model. Our analysis of feature determination revealed that the most valuable discriminators for cotton involve the boll opening stage and harmonic coefficients. Moreover, both qualitative and quantitative validation were performed to evaluate the retrieval of the optimized features-based cotton information. Visual examination of the map exhibited high spatial consistency and accurate delineation of the cotton field. Quantitative comparison indicates that classification of RF-coupled optimized features achieves improved overall accuracy 5.53% higher than that which works with either the limited vegetation indices. Compared with all 31 features, the optimized features realized greater identification accuracy while using only about half the number of features. Compared with test samples, the cotton map achieved an overall accuracy greater than 98% and a kappa more than 0.96. Further comparison of the cotton map area at the county-level showed a high level of consistency with the National Bureau of Statistics data from 2020, with R-2 over 0.96, RMSE no more than 14.62 Kha and RRMSE less than 17.78%.

TI  - The First Rock Glacier Inventory for the Greater Caucasus
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rock glaciers are an integral part of the periglacial environment. At the regional scale in the Greater Caucasus, there have been no comprehensive systematic efforts to assess the distribution of rock glaciers, although some individual parts of ranges have been mapped before. In this study we produce the first inventory of rock glaciers from the entire Greater Caucasus region-Russia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. A remote sensing survey was conducted using Geo-Information System (GIS) and Google Earth Pro software based on high-resolution satellite imagery-SPOT, Worldview, QuickBird, and IKONOS, based on data obtained during the period 2004-2021. Sentinel-2 imagery from the year 2020 was also used as a supplementary source. The ASTER GDEM (2011) was used to determine location, elevation, and slope for all rock glaciers. Using a manual approach to digitize rock glaciers, we discovered that the mountain range contains 1461 rock glaciers with a total area of 297.8 +/- 23.0 km(2). Visual inspection of the morphology suggests that 1018 rock glaciers with a total area of 199.6 +/- 15.9 km(2) (67% of the total rock glacier area) are active, while the remaining rock glaciers appear to be relict. The average maximum altitude of all rock glaciers is found at 3152 +/- 96 m above sea level (a.s.l.) while the mean and minimum altitude are 3009 +/- 91 m and 2882 +/- 87 m a.s.l., respectively. We find that the average minimum altitude of active rock glaciers is higher (2955 +/- 98 m a.s.l.) than in relict rock glaciers (2716 +/- 83 m a.s.l.). No clear difference is discernible between the surface slope of active (41.4 +/- 3 degrees) and relict (38.8 +/- 4 degrees) rock glaciers in the entire mountain region. This inventory provides a database for understanding the extent of permafrost in the Greater Caucasus and is an important basis for further research of geomorphology and palaeoglaciology in this region. The inventory will be submitted to the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) database and can be used for future studies.

TI  - Potential for Peatland Water Table Depth Monitoring Using Sentinel-1 SAR Backscatter: Case Study of Forsinard Flows, Scotland, UK
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatland restoration has become a common land-use management practice in recent years, with the water table depth (WTD) being one of the key monitoring elements, where it is used as a proxy for various ecosystem functions. Regular, uninterrupted, and spatially representative WTD data in situ can be difficult to collect, and therefore, remotely sensed data offer an attractive alternative for landscape-scale monitoring. In this study, we illustrate the application of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter for water table depth monitoring in near-natural and restored blanket bogs in the Flow Country of northern Scotland. Among the study sites, the near-natural peatlands presented the smallest fluctuations in the WTD (with depths typically between 0 and 15 cm) and had the most stable radar signal throughout the year (similar to 3 to 4 dB amplitude). Previously drained and afforested peatlands undergoing restoration management were found to have higher WTD fluctuations (depths up to 35 cm), which were also reflected in higher shifts in the radar backscatter (up to a similar to 6 dB difference within a year). Sites where more advanced restoration methods have been applied, however, were associated with shallower water table depths and smoother surfaces. Three models-simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and the random forest model-were evaluated for their potential to predict water table dynamics in peatlands using Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter. The random forest model was found to be the most suited, with the highest correlation scores, lowest RMSE values, and overall good temporal fit (R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 2.1 cm), and multiple linear regression came in a close second (R-2 = 0.59, RMSE = 4.5 cm). The impact of standing water, terrain ruggedness, and the ridge and furrow aspect on the model correlation scores was tested but found not to have a statistically significant influence. We propose that this approach, using Sentinel-1 and random forest models to predict the WTD, has strong potential and should be tested in a wider range of peatland sites.

TI  - MSFANet: Multiscale Fusion Attention Network for Road Segmentation of Multispectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of deep learning and remote sensing technologies in recent years, many semantic segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to road extraction. However, previous deep learning-based road extraction methods primarily used RGB imagery as an input and did not take advantage of the spectral information contained in hyperspectral imagery. These methods can produce discontinuous outputs caused by objects with similar spectral signatures to roads. In addition, the images obtained from different Earth remote sensing sensors may have different spatial resolutions, enhancing the difficulty of the joint analysis. This work proposes the Multiscale Fusion Attention Network (MSFANet) to overcome these problems. Compared to traditional road extraction frameworks, the proposed MSFANet fuses information from different spectra at multiple scales. In MSFANet, multispectral remote sensing data is used as an additional input to the network, in addition to RGB remote sensing data, to obtain richer spectral information. The Cross-source Feature Fusion Module (CFFM) is used to calibrate and fuse spectral features at different scales, reducing the impact of noise and redundant features from different inputs. The Multiscale Semantic Aggregation Decoder (MSAD) fuses multiscale features and global context information from the upsampling process layer by layer, reducing information loss during the multiscale feature fusion. The proposed MSFANet network was applied to the SpaceNet dataset and self-annotated images from Chongzhou, a representative city in China. Our MSFANet performs better over the baseline HRNet by a large margin of +6.38 IoU and +5.11 F1-score on the SpaceNet dataset, +3.61 IoU and +2.32 F1-score on the self-annotated dataset (Chongzhou dataset). Moreover, the effectiveness of MSFANet was also proven by comparative experiments with other studies.

TI  - Rural land cover mapping using short-term Sentinel-2 temporal composites and machine learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral sensors have been invaluable for land cover mapping. Nonetheless, cloud cover is frequent in many parts in the tropics, meaning that relying on single-date multispectral data can be problematic. The limited number of variables, i.e., only two, in conventional dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar data usually drives low classification accuracies. Researchers have explored an augmentation strategy that uses textural features, such as Haralick's Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix and/or decomposition features. However, this also does not produce an acceptable outcome. Another approach involves short-term temporal stacking. This masks out atmospheric disturbance and means every pixel has a single value representing the object. Our research explored this last approach to identify woody vegetation in a rural area of Indonesia from Sentinel-2 data. Ten machine learning algorithms were explored to investigate limitations and opportunities. We investigated algorithms capable of reporting variable importance to indicate crucial spectral bands. This study indicated that highly important spectra include red edge and short-wave infrared bands and to a lesser extent, the red band. Part of these bands were confirmed by the variable importance. The spectral similarity between bands 8 and 8A could be seen as a drawback when both bands are employed. Variable importance indicated a negative impact due to this similarity, suggesting that only one should be used in the classification. Overall, classification accuracy was generally high (over 96%), except in the case of the benchmark, i.e., classification and regression trees. Highest accuracy (97.6%) was provided by C5.0 model, although the difference from random forests (RFs) was negligible. The RF was favored as it produced a better estimate of timber plantations. A few algorithms were unable to separate woody vegetation types, including the popular support vector machine. Successful separation was mainly achieved by ensemble tree learners, such as RFs and the variants of extreme gradient boosting.

TI  - Efficient Deep Semantic Segmentation for Land Cover Classification Using Sentinel Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, different machine learning approaches, either conventional or more advanced, use input from different remote sensing imagery for land cover classification and associated decision making. However, most approaches rely heavily on time-consuming tasks to gather accurate annotation data. Furthermore, downloading and pre-processing remote sensing imagery used to be a difficult and time-consuming task that discouraged policy makers to create and use new land cover maps. We argue that by combining recent improvements in deep learning with the use of powerful cloud computing platforms for EO data processing, specifically the Google Earth Engine, we can greatly facilitate the task of land cover classification. For this reason, we modify an efficient semantic segmentation approach (U-TAE) for a satellite image time series to use, as input, a single multiband image composite corresponding to a specific time range. Our motivation is threefold: (a) to improve land cover classification performance and at the same time reduce complexity by using, as input, satellite image composites with reduced noise created using temporal median instead of the original noisy (due to clouds, calibration errors, etc.) images, (b) to assess performance when using as input different combinations of satellite data, including Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, spectral indices, and ALOS elevation data, and (c) to exploit channel attention instead of the temporal attention used in the original approach. We show that our proposed modification on U-TAE (mIoU: 57.25%) outperforms three other popular approaches, namely random forest (mIoU: 39.69%), U-Net (mIoU: 55.73%), and SegFormer (mIoU: 53.5%), while also using fewer training parameters. In addition, the evaluation reveals that proper selection of the input band combination is necessary for improved performance.

TI  - Mapping Specific Constituents of an Ochre-Coloured Watercourse Based on In Situ and Airborne Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - It is a well-known fact that water bodies are crucial for human life, ecosystems and biodiversity. Therefore, they are subject to regulatory monitoring in terms of water quality. However, land-use intensification, such as open-cast mining activities, can have a direct impact on water quality. Unfortunately, in situ measurements of water quality parameters are spatially limited, costly and time-consuming, which is why we proposed a combination of hyperspectral data, in situ data and simple regression models in this study to estimate and thus monitor various water quality parameters. We focused on the variables of total iron, ferrous iron, ferric iron, sulphate and chlorophyll-a. Unlike other studies, we used a combination of airborne hyperspectral and RGB data to ensure a very high spatial resolution of the data. To investigate the potential of our approach, we conducted simultaneous in situ measurements and airborne hyperspectral/RGB aircraft campaigns at different sites of the Spree River in Germany to monitor the impact of pyrite weathering on water bodies after open-cast mining activities. Appropriate regression models were developed to estimate the five variables mentioned above. The model with the best performance for each variable gave a coefficient of determination R-2 of 64% to 79%. This clearly shows the potential of airborne hyperspectral/RGB data for water quality monitoring. In further investigations, we focused on the use of machine learning techniques, as well as transferability to other water bodies. The approach presented here has great potential for the development of a monitoring method for the continuous monitoring of still waters and large watercourses, especially given the freely available space-based hyperspectral missions via EnMAP.

TI  - A Comparison of Machine Learning Models for Mapping Tree Species Using WorldView-2 Imagery in the Agroforestry Landscape of West Africa
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmland trees are a vital part of the local economy as trees are used by farmers for fuelwood as well as food, fodder, medicines, fibre, and building materials. As a result, mapping tree species is important for ecological, socio-economic, and natural resource management. The study evaluates very high-resolution remotely sensed WorldView-2 (WV-2) imagery for tree species classification in the agroforestry landscape of the Kano Close-Settled Zone (KCSZ), Northern Nigeria. Individual tree crowns extracted by geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) were used to remotely identify nine dominant tree species (Faidherbia albida, Anogeissus leiocarpus, Azadirachta indica, Diospyros mespiliformis, Mangifera indica, Parkia biglobosa, Piliostigma reticulatum, Tamarindus indica, and Vitellaria paradoxa) at the object level. For every tree object in the reference datasets, eight original spectral bands of the WV-2 image, their spectral statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, etc.), spatial, textural, and color-space (hue, saturation), and different spectral vegetation indices (VI) were used as predictor variables for the classification of tree species. Nine different machine learning methods were used for object-level tree species classification. These were Extra Gradient Boost (XGB), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Gradient Boosting (GB), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Logistic Regression (LR), Multi-layered Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The two top-performing models in terms of highest accuracies for individual tree species classification were found to be SVM (overall accuracy = 82.1% and Cohen's kappa = 0.79) and MLP (overall accuracy = 81.7% and Cohen's kappa = 0.79) with the lowest numbers of misclassified trees compared to other machine learning methods.

TI  - Assessing the performance of WRF ARW model in simulating heavy rainfall events over the Pune region: in support of operational applications
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the impact of the Planetary Boundary layer (PBL) on rainfall simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model during extreme rainfall event cases over an urban city. This is accomplished by producing a heavy rainfall event forecast using the WRF model with five varying PBL scenarios (ACM2, YSU, MYJ, QNSE, MYNN) but otherwise identical model configuration. The study examined the role of PBL in modulating rainfall characteristics by investigating the impacts of PBL on forecast skills with particular reference to rainfall. The PBL scheme plays a crucial role and can significantly alter the spatial pattern and magnitudes of rainfall simulated by the model. Results showed that the QNSE boundary layer scheme substantially improved the magnitudes and spatial pattern of rainfall simulated by the model. The model's ability was cross-checked with this setup to capture the other two heavy rainfall events over Pune city and was found satisfactory. The current model setup could capture the spatial distribution and the magnitude of rainfall compared with satellite data and observation over point locations. These findings are highly relevant to highlight the dependency of the model on parameterization schemes to forecast extreme rainfall events accurately.

TI  - Affecting of Nature and Human Activities on the Trend of Vegetation Health Indices in Dak Nong Province, Vietnam
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the effects of natural and human conditions on vegetation covers using VCI and TCI indices (the satellite-based Vegetation Health Indices (VHIs)) in Dak Nong province. Factors affecting the VHIs included in the analysis involve land use, soil, population, topography, distance to roads and surface water. The data analysis period is the dry season from 2000 to 2020. The trend of the VHIs' change in this study is analyzed using Sen's method with monitoring data from Modis. The effects of factors affecting the VHIs are based on logistic regression and discriminant analysis. The analysis results show that the VHIs are clear and show both increasing and decreasing trends. Based on logistic regression analysis, the influence of land use types on the trend of the VHIs in the direction of increasing from negative to positive will be from PdF, UnL, AnC, SpF, PtF, PeA and then to PdR. Corresponding to the soil will be from ACa, FRp, FRx, FRr, ACh, LVx, FLg and then to LVg. Based on the discriminant analysis method, it was found that there are only four primary factors affecting the trend of the VHIs in order of decreasing level of closure: population density, land use, soil and population growth rate and to the road. These results show that in places where labour resources are available, plants are interested in investment due to high profits, nutrient-rich soil and convenience for plant care; the VHIs tend to increase and vice versa. Compared with VCI, the trend of TCI tends to be sloping negative and more pessimistic. Through the coefficients of the logistic regression equation and the difference function, the TCI is more sensitive than the VCI when the independent variables change, especially for changes in population density and land use. Thus, TCI can be considered the preferred option for assessing vegetation health trends in the context of climate change.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Dynamics in Grasslands Using the Landsat Archive
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are an important biotope in Europe, not only because they are widespread, but also because they provide valuable ecosystem services. The ecological value of a grassland parcel is directly proportional to the number of uninterrupted years of grassland cover. However, the area of long-term grassland (i.e., grassland of 5 years or older) is decreasing, limiting its ability to provide ecosystem services. To prevent the further disappearance of long-term grasslands, Europe developed an agricultural policy instrument in 2003 to protect grasslands of 5 years or older. Nature policy instruments aim to protect grasslands that have existed for more than 10 years to support their high environmental value. However, there is currently no multi-annual information on the location and age of grasslands at a high spatial and temporal resolution, which makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the current grassland protection regulations. Multi-annual satellite-based land cover classification can provide a solution for grassland area and age monitoring, which we tested by producing a series of Landsat-based land cover classification maps from 2005 to 2019 for the region of Flanders, Belgium. Historical land cover classification maps proved useful for evaluating past and present planning and policy to ensure grassland conservation, linking spatial and temporal changes in the area of long-term grasslands with policy changes and landscape dynamics. We were able to locate grasslands that were grassland between 2005 and 2014 but were converted to arable land between 2015 and 2019, identify the year in which these grasslands were converted to arable land, and demonstrate regional differences in the conservation of long-term grassland aged 5-9 years and 10 years or more. Long-term grassland aged 10 years or more disappeared faster in urban than in rural areas in Flanders between 2014 and 2019. Our study shows that multi-annual high-resolution satellite imagery provides objective and quantitative information on long-term grassland to support climate, agricultural, environmental, and nature policies.

TI  - Comparing Global Sentinel-2 Land Cover Maps for Regional Species Distribution Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the spatial and temporal dynamics of species distributions is necessary for biodiversity conservation land-use planning decisions. Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning have allowed for high-resolution species distribution modeling that can inform landscape-level decision-making. Here we compare the performance of three popular Sentinel-2 (10-m) land cover maps, including dynamic world (DW), European land cover (ELC10), and world cover (WC), in predicting wild bee species richness over southern Norway. The proportion of grassland habitat within 250 m (derived from the land cover maps), along with temperature and distance to sandy soils, were used as predictors in both Bayesian regularized neural network and random forest models. Models using grassland habitat from DW performed best (RMSE = 2.8 +/- 0.03; average +/- standard deviation across models), followed by ELC10 (RMSE = 2.85 +/- 0.03) and WC (RMSE = 2.87 +/- 0.02). All satellite-derived maps outperformed a manually mapped Norwegian land cover dataset called AR5 (RMSE = 3.02 +/- 0.02). When validating the model predictions of bee species richness against citizen science data on solitary bee occurrences using generalized linear models, we found that ELC10 performed best (AIC = 2278 +/- 4), followed by WC (AIC = 2367 +/- 3), and DW (AIC = 2376 +/- 3). While the differences in RMSE we observed between models were small, they may be significant when such models are used to prioritize grassland patches within a landscape for conservation subsidies or management policies. Partial dependencies in our models showed that increasing the proportion of grassland habitat is positively associated with wild bee species richness, thereby justifying bee conservation schemes that aim to enhance semi-natural grassland habitat. Our results confirm the utility of satellite-derived land cover maps in supporting high-resolution species distribution modeling and suggest there is scope to monitor changes in species distributions over time given the dense time series provided by products such as DW.

TI  - Snow Metrics as Proxy to Assess Sarcoptic Mange in Wild Boar: Preliminary Results in Aosta Valley (Italy)
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The widespread diffusion of the wild boar on the Italian territory and its consistent use for hunting have created the possibility to conduct multiple studies on the pathologies afflicting this ungulate. Nevertheless, in the last two decades, only some pathologies such as classical and African Swine Fever, Tuberculosis, Brucellosis from Brucella suis have benefited from substantial public funding and the consequent great interest from the scientific world, while less attention was addressed to parasitic diseases including sarcoptic mange. Therefore, to fill this gap, the purpose of this study was to contribute to the knowledge of sarcoptic mange in the wild boar population in Aosta Valley in the Northwest of Italy, including sympatric species as foxes. Due to past field surveys, it has been possible to find a possible role of snow metrics in the spread of this pathogen. Even if there are only empirical evidence and the mechanism remain unknown remote sensing analysis considering snow metrics were performed to provide to veterinarians, foresters, biologists, and ecologists new tools to better understand wield board dynamics and join to ordinary tool an instrument to enhance management and planning strategies. The snow metrics (SM) were derived from USGS NASA Landsat 8 L2A retrieved from Theia CNES platform and processed in Orfeo Toolbox LIS extension package. The relationship between SM and the disease spread was tested per each Aosta Valley municipality obtaining LISA maps for each hunting season. The results have showed that this parasite is present in an endemic form even if with rather low prevalence values, equal to 1.2% in the season hunting season 2013/2014, and equal to 7.5% in the hunting season 2014/2015. Moreover, within simultaneous given values of SM, sarcoptic mange seem to find good conditions for spreading.

TI  - Axillary sentinel lymph node identification using superparamagnetic iron oxide versus radioisotope in early stage breast cancer: The UK SentiMag trial (SMART study).
T2  - The surgeon : journal of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Ireland
M3  - Multicenter Study
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an accurate and reliable method for staging the axilla in early breast cancer. The gold standard technique for localizing the sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the use of radioisotope with or without blue dye. However, this technique has its limitations. Various alternatives have been explored to overcome the disadvantages of the standard SLNB technique and superparamagnetic iron oxide mapping agents have garnered significant attention. The SMART study aims to compare the magnetic technique using the superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIO, Sienna+) to the radioisotope technique (Tc99) +/- blue dye, for SLN identification in patients with early breast cancer.METHODS: A prospective, multicenter study was done that recruited 109 clinically node-negative early-stage breast cancer patients from five centres in the United Kingdom (UK). The patients received radioisotope±blue dye injections, followed by intraoperative injection of magnetic tracer prior to SLNB. The sentinel node identification rate was compared between the magnetic and standard techniques to evaluate detection rate (per patient and per node), non-inferiority and concordance.RESULTS: Data was analysed for 107 patients. The per patient detection rate was 98.13% (105/107) when using the magnetic tracer and 92.26% (103/107) when using the standard technique. The nodal detection rate was 93.07% (188/202 nodes) when using the magnetic tracer and 96.53% (195/202) when using the standard technique. Of the 31 patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), all 31 (100%) were detected by both techniques.CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the magnetic technique is a feasible method for SLNB, with an identification rate that is not inferior to the standard technique. The magnetic technique offers a suitable alternative to the standard technique thereby avoiding the need for the complexities of nuclear medicine, the hazards of radiation and the anaphylaxis risk of blue dye.

TI  - HEALTH ASSESSMENT OF PAINTED TURTLES (<i>CHRYSEMYS PICTA</i>) IN A RESTORED WETLAND HABITAT IN NORTHWESTERN INDIANA, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater turtles are sensitive to environmental changes and can serve as sentinel species for ecosystem health assessments. The Efroymson Restoration at Kankakee Sands in northwestern Indiana, USA has been restored in the past 25 yr from primarily agricultural land to a mosaic of prairie and wetland habitats. Health assessments of 40 free-ranging painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) at Kankakee Sands were performed in May 2021 to evaluate overall health status, screen for infectious diseases, and obtain baseline clinical pathology values in this population. Assessment of each turtle included a physical examination, complete blood count, plasma biochemistry panel, blood lactate level, venous blood gas analysis, serum trace mineral panel, serum vitamin D3 level, and plasma protein electrophoresis. Oral and cloacal swabs were tested for adenoviruses, herpesviruses, frog virus 3, and Mycoplasmopsis species by PCR in 39 painted turtles. Four turtles were positive for adenovirus, which shared 100% homology to Sulawesi tortoise adenovirus. Two turtles were herpesvirus-positive with 100% homology to emydid herpesvirus 1. No Mycoplasmopsis spp. or frog virus 3 was detected. Female turtles had significantly higher manganese, prealbumin, uric acid, triglycerides, and ionized calcium levels, while male turtles had significantly higher cholesterol, glutamate dehydrogenase, and CO2 levels. These baseline data can be used for future research into freshwater turtle health in restored wetland habitats.

TI  - Sea Tide Influence on Ice Flow of David Drygalski's Ice Tongue Inferred from Geodetic GNSS Observations and SAR Offset Tracking Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - David Glacier and Drygalski Ice Tongue are massive glaciers in Victoria Land, Antarctica. The ice from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is drained through the former, and then discharged into the western Ross Sea through the latter. David Drygalski is the largest outlet glacier in Northern Victoria Land, floating kilometers out to sea. The floating and grounded part of the David Glacier are the main focus of this article. During the XXI Italian Antarctic Expedition (2005-2006), within the framework of the National Antarctic Research Programme (PNRA), two GNSS stations were installed at different points: the first close to the grounding line of David Glacier, and the second approximately 40 km downstream of the first one. Simultaneous data logging was performed by both GNSS stations for 24 days. In the latest data processing, the kinematic PPP technique was adopted to evaluate the dominant diurnal components and the very small semi-diurnal variations in ice motion induced by the ocean tide and the mean ice flow rates of both GNSS stations. Comparison of the GNSS time series with predicted ocean tide calculated from harmonic coefficients of the nearest tide gauge stations, installed at Cape Roberts and Mario Zucchelli Station, highlight different local response of the glacier to ocean tide, with a minor amplitude of vertical motion at a point partially anchored at the bedrock close to the grounding line. During low tide, the velocity of the ice flow reaches its daily maximum, in accordance with the direction of seawater outflow from the fjord into the ocean, while the greatest daily tidal excursion generates an increase in the horizontal ice flow velocity. With the aim to extend the analysis in spatial terms, five COSMO-SkyMED Stripmap scenes were processed. The comparison of the co-registered offset tracking rates, obtained from SAR images, with the GNSS estimation shows good agreement.

TI  - Impact of an Interprofessional Education Activity on Student Knowledge and Attitudes Regarding Patient Safety
T2  - PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to measure the impact of an interprofessional education (IPE) activity on student knowledge and attitudes regarding patient safety. Two 4 h IPE activities were designed to provide students with foundational information regarding patient safety. Interprofessional teams discussed the individual curricula and roles/responsibilities of each represented health profession. Teams then served on a mock committee tasked with completing a root cause analysis of a fictitious sentinel event. Students completed a pre/post-quiz and pre/post-attitudes survey to measure knowledge and attitudes. Five months later, students reconvened to serve on a second mock sentinel event committee. Students completed a post-activity survey after the second activity. Four hundred and seven students participated in the first activity, while two hundred and eighty participated in the second activity. Quiz score comparisons revealed improved knowledge, with post-quiz scores being significantly higher. Pre- and post-attitude survey comparisons indicated a significant improvement in participant attitudes towards interprofessional teamwork. Seventy-eight percent of students reported the IPE activity enhanced their ability to "engage other health professions students in shared patient-centered care". This IPE activity resulted in knowledge and attitude improvement related to patient safety.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purpose: This study aimed to establish the treated prevalence of Bipolar Disorder (BD) in serving members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) in light of a 2018 study of mental disorders in the ADF and Veteran population that found a surprisingly high 12-month prevalence rate.Method: A retrospective review of the Defence electronic Health System (DeHS) was conducted for the periods 2015-16 and 2016-17 of all eligible Defence personnel. Two psychiatrists then reviewed each record with an entry for BD to confirm whether a clinical diagnosis was present with measures to optimise inter-rater reliability.Results: 138 431 DeHS clinical records were searched, and 36 potential cases of BD were identified in the financial year 2015-16, of which 21 were confirmed to have a diagnosis of BD. Thirty-two potential cases of BD were found in the financial year (FY) 2016-17, of which 24 were confirmed to have a diagnosis of BD. The average 12-month prevalence of BD across FY 2015-16 and FY 2016-17 was 0.03% or 2.51 per 10 000.Conclusion: The prevalence of BD in serving members was considerably lower than in the 2018 study. Possible explanations for this finding are examined.

TI  - A Novel Atmospheric Correction for Turbid Water Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For the remote sensing of turbid waters, the atmospheric correction (AC) is a key issue. The "black pixel" assumption helps to solve the AC for turbid waters. It has proved to be inaccurate to regard all water pixels in the SWIR (Short Wave Infrared) band as black pixels. It is necessary to perform atmospheric correction in the visible bands after removing the radiation contributions of water in the SWIR band. Here, the modified ACZI (m-ACZI) algorithm was developed. The m-ACZI assumes the spatial homogeneity of aerosol types and employs the BPI (Black Pixel Index) and PIFs (Pseudo-Invariant Features) to identify the "black pixel". Then, the radiation contributions of waters in the SWIR band are removed to complete the atmospheric correction for turbid waters. The results showed that the m-ACZI had better performance than the SeaDAS (SeaWiFS Data Analysis System) -SWIR and the EXP (exponential extrapolation) algorithm in the visible band (sMAPE < 30.71%, RMSE < 0.0111 sr(-1)) and is similar to the DSF (Dark Spectrum Fitting) algorithm in floating algae waters. The m-ACZI algorithm is suitable for turbid inland waters.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Distribution of Fish Larvae in the Pearl River Estuary Based on Habitat Suitability Index Model
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China, where riverine and marine factors alternate in strength and weakness, is one of the most important fishing grounds in the South China Sea. The spatial-temporal distribution of fish larvae directly affects the stock density in the area. This study revealed the relationship between fish larvae and marine environmental factors in the PRE, through multisensor satellite remote sensing and fishing surveys, based on the Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) model. The spatial-temporal distribution of fish larvae has unique distribution characteristics under different seasons and has high consistency with the changes of monsoon and flow field, etc. The findings of this study can help researchers gain a good understanding of the movement of fish larvae in the PRE and promote better habitat conservation under a changing climate. The spawning grounds are important areas for the survival and reproduction of aquatic organisms and play an important role in the replenishment of fishery resources. The density of fish larvae in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) was analyzed to establish Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) based on marine environmental factors. Survey data and satellite remote sensing data, including sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity and chlorophyll a concentration, from 2014 to 2017 during April-September were analyzed. Results showed that the accuracy of the HSI model based on the larval density and environmental factors was more than 60%, and the distribution trend of HSI was consistent with the distribution trend of larval density. The HSI models constructed based on Arithmetic Mean Model (AMM), Geometric Mean Model (GMM) and Minimum Model (MINM) methods can better predict the spatial-temporal distribution of larvae in the PRE. Among them, the accuracy of the HSI model constructed by the AMM and GMM methods was the highest in April (71%) and September (93%); the accuracy of the HSI model constructed by the MINM method was the highest in June (70%), July (84%) and August (64%). In general, the areas with high HSI values are mainly distributed in the offshore waters of the PRE. The spatial-temporal distribution of larvae in the PRE was influenced by monsoon, Pearl River runoff, Guangdong coastal currents and the invasion of high-salinity seawater from the outer sea.

TI  - Classification of Land Cover in Complex Terrain Using Gaofen-3 SAR Ascending and Descending Orbit Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is an effective remote sensing data source for geographic surveys. However, accurate land cover mapping based on SAR image in areas of complex terrain has become a challenge due to serious geometric distortions and the inadequate separation ability of dual-polarization data. To address these issues, a new land cover mapping framework which is suitable for complex terrain is proposed based on Gaofen-3 data of ascending and descending orbits. Firstly, the geometric distortion area is determined according to the local incident angle, based on analysis of the SAR imaging mechanism, and the correct polarization information of the opposite track is used to compensate for the geometric distortion area, including layovers and shadows. Then, the dual orbital polarization characteristics (DOPC) and dual polarization radar vegetation index (DpRVI) of dual-pol SAR data are extracted, and the optimal feature combination is found by means of Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance analysis. Finally, the deep learning method 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) is applied to classify the compensated images. The proposed method was applied to a mountainous region of the Danjiangkou ecological protection area in China. The accuracy and reliability of the method were experimentally compared using the uncompensated images and the images without DpRVI. Quantitative evaluation revealed that the proposed method achieved better performance in complex terrain areas, with an overall accuracy (OA) score of 0.93, and a Kappa coefficient score of 0.92. Compared with the uncompensated image, OA increased by 5% and Kappa increased by 6%. Compared with the images without DpRVI, OA increased by 4% and Kappa increased by 5%. In summary, the results demonstrate the importance of ascending and descending orbit data to compensate geometric distortion and reveal the effectiveness of optimal feature combination including DpRVI. Its simple and effective polarization information compensation capability can broaden the promising application prospects of SAR images.

TI  - Study on the Spatial and Temporal Evolution of NDVI and Its Driving Mechanism Based on Geodetector and Hurst Indexes: A Case Study of the Tibet Autonomous Region
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) is located in the mid-latitude and high-cold regions, and the ecological environment in most areas is fragile. Studying its surface vegetation coverage can identify the ecosystem's development trends and provide a specific contribution to global environmental change. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can better reflect the coverage of surface vegetation. Therefore, based on remote sensing data with a resolution of 1 km(2), air temperature, precipitation, and other data in the same period in the study area from 1998 to 2019, this paper uses trend analysis, F-significance tests, the Hurst index, and the Geodetector model to obtain the spatial distribution, change characteristics, and evolution trends of the NDVI in the TAR in the past 22 years. At the same time, the quantitative relationship between natural and human factors and NDVI changes is also obtained. The study results show that the NDVI in the southern and southeastern parts of the TAR is higher, with mean values greater than 0.5 showing that vegetation cover is better. The NDVI in the western and northwestern parts of the TAR is lower, with mean values less than 0.3, indicating vegetation cover is worse. NDVI in the TAR showed an overall increasing trend from 1998 to 2019 but a decreasing trend in ridgelines, snow cover, and glacier-covered areas. The areas where NDVI values show a trend of increasing and then decreasing in the future account for 53.69% of the total area of the TAR. The most crucial factor affecting NDVI changes in the TAR is soil type, followed by influencing factors such as vegetation cover type, average annual air temperature, and average annual precipitation. The influence of natural elements is generally more significant than anthropogenic factors. The influencing factors have synergistic effects, and combining anthropogenic factors and other factors will show mutual enhancement and non-linear enhancement relationships. This study provides a theoretical basis for natural resource conservation, ecosystem restoration, and sustainable human development strategies in the TAR.

TI  - Study on the Variations in Water Storage in Lake Qinghai Based on Multi-Source Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Performing research on the variation in lake water on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) can give the area's ecological environmental preservation a scientific foundation. In this paper, we first created a high-precision dataset of lake water level variation every 10 days, from July 2002 to December 2022, using multi-source altimetry satellite SGDR data (Envisat RA-2, SARAL, Jason-1/2, and Sentinel-3A/3B SRAL), which integrated the methods of atmospheric path delay correction, waveform re-tracking, outlier detection, position reduction using a height difference model, and inter-satellite deviation adjustment. Then, using Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data, an averaged area series of Lake Qinghai (LQ) from September to November, each year from 2002 to 2019, was produced. The functional connection between the water level and the area was determined by fitting the water level-area series data, and the lake area time series, of LQ. Using the high-precision lake water level series, the fitted lake surface area time series, and the water storage variation equation, the water storage variation time series of LQ was thus calculated every 10 days, from July 2002 to December 2022. When the hydrological gauge data from the Xiashe station and data from the worldwide inland lake water level database are used as references, the standard deviations of the LQ water level time series are 0.0676 m and 0.1201 m, respectively. The results show that the water storage of LQ increases by 11.022 x 10(9) m(3) from July 2002 to December 2022, with a growth rate of 5.3766 x 10(8) m(3)/a. The growth rate from January 2005 to January 2015 is 4.4850 x 10(8) m(3)/a, and from January 2015 to December 2022, the growth rate is 8.9206 x 10(8) m(3)/a. Therefore, the increased rate of water storage in LQ over the last 8 years has been substantially higher than in the previous 10 years.

TI  - Extraction and Classification of Flood-Affected Areas Based on MRF and Deep Learning
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods can cause huge damage to society, the economy, and the environment. As a result, it is vital to determine the extent and type of land cover in flooded areas quickly and accurately in order to facilitate disaster relief and mitigation efforts. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an all-weather, 24 h data source used to extract information about flood inundations, and its primary aim is to extract water body information for flood monitoring. In this study, we have studied the backscattering characteristics of water and non-water, combined the threshold segmentation method with Markov random fields (MRF), and embedded simulated annealing (SA) in the process of image noise reduction, resulting in the development of a water extraction method KI-MRF-SA with high accuracy in classification and high automation. Furthermore, object-scale adaptive convolutional neural networks (OSA-CNN) are introduced for the classification of optical images before the flood in order to provide reference data for flood inundation analysis. The method proposed in this study consists of the following three steps: (1) The Kittler and Illingworth (KI) thresholding algorithm is used for the segmentation of SAR images in order to determine the initial flood inundation extent; (2) MRF and SA algorithms are employed as a means to optimize the initial flood inundation extent, and the results are combined across multiple polarizations by using an intersection operation to determine the final flood inundation extent; and (3) As part of the flood mapping process, land cover types before the flood are classified using OSA-CNN and combined with flood inundation extents. According to the experimental results, it is evident that the proposed KI-MRF-SA method is capable of distinguishing water from non-water with significantly higher accuracy (3-5% improvement in the overall accuracy) than conventional thresholding methods. Combined with the classification method of OSA-CNN proposed in our earlier research, the overall classification accuracy of flood-affected areas could reach 92.7%.

TI  - Identification of Urban Functional Areas and Urban Spatial Structure Analysis by Fusing Multi-Source Data Features: A Case Study of Zhengzhou, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification and delineation of urban functional zones (UFZs), which are the basic units of urban organisms, are crucial for understanding complex urban systems and the rational allocation and management of resources. Points of interest (POI) data are weak in identifying UFZs in areas with low building density and sparse data, whereas remote sensing data lack the necessary semantic information for functional zoning, and single-source data cannot perform a highly comprehensive characterization of complex UFZs. To address these issues, this study proposes a method for identifying UFZs by fusing multi-attribute features from multi-source data and introduces nighttime light and land surface temperature (LST) indicators as functional zoning references, taking the main urban area of Zhengzhou as an example. The experimental results show that the POI data with integrated three-level semantic information can characterize the semantic information of functional areas well, and the incorporation of multi-spectral, nighttime light, and LST data can further improve the recognition accuracy by approximately 10.1% compared with the POI single-source data. The final recognition accuracy and kappa coefficient reached 84.00% and 0.8162, respectively, indicating that the method is largely consistent with the actual situation and is feasible. The analysis showed that the main urban area of Zhengzhou as a whole is characterized by the coordinated development of single and mixed functional areas, in which a distinct residential-commercial-public complex is formed, and the urban functional areas on the block scale have diverse attributes. This study can provide a decision-making reference for the future development planning and management of Zhengzhou, China.

TI  - Analysis of Detailed Lake Variations and Associated Hydrologic Driving Factors in a Semi-Arid Ungauged Closed Watershed
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are key factors in maintaining ecosystems in semi-arid regions. However, due to data shortage, most studies used remote-sensing data and water-balance models to analyze lake variations in semi-arid ungauged closed watersheds, resulting in the oversimplified assessment of lake variations and their associated hydrologic processes. This study aimed to enhance the understanding of the mechanisms behind the water supplement and consumption of lakes and reveal the influences of hydrological processes on lake variations in such watersheds. Physically based and lake-oriented hydrologic modeling, remote-sensing technology, and results from previous studies were comprehensively integrated to achieve the research objective. The Hongjiannao (HJN) watershed in Northwest China was selected as the study area of this research. The calibration and validation results demonstrated that remote-sensing data and results from previous studies indeed guaranteed the accuracy of the lake-oriented model. Further hydrologic and statistical analyses revealed the linkage between lake variations and their associated hydrologic processes, and the mechanisms behind the linkage. Specifically, rainfall and snowmelt were found to be the most stable sources of HJN Lake, particularly in dry years. Due to the differences in recession rates, groundwater inflow was more stable than upstream inflow and inflow from the contributing area of HJN Lake. The correlations between hydrologic processes and the storage variation of HJN Lake varied significantly at daily and monthly time scales, which can be explained by the generation mechanisms of these processes. This study provided valuable guidance for water resources management and ecosystem protection in the HJN watershed and can be further applied for hydrologic simulations in other similar watersheds.

TI  - Coupling Coordination Degree of AOD and Air Pollutants in Shandong Province from 2015 to 2020
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to reveal the correlation between aerosols and pollution indicators, the MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) was used to investigate the distribution of AOD in 16 prefecture-level cities in Shandong Province from 2015 to 2020. This study quantitatively analyzed the coupling degree and the coupling coordination degree between AOD and pollution indicators based on the coupling coordination model. The results showed that: (1) The annual average AOD in Shandong Province showed a rapid downward trend with a mean value of 0.615. The seasonal AOD of Shandong Province and prefecture-level cities was characterized by spring and summer > autumn and winter. The distribution of AOD in Shandong Province showed a spatial pattern of high in the west and low in the east, and high in the surrounding area and low in the middle. The decreasing rate of AOD was high in the west and low in the east. (2) The annual average AOD and Air Quality Index (AQI) were in a highly coupled and coordinated state. Their spatial distribution pattern decreased from west to east. There were certain fluctuations with seasonal changes, with the largest fluctuation in winter. (3) Except for O-3, the overall coupling and coordination level between AOD and each pollutant was relatively high. The coupling coordination effect was as follows: C (PM2.5, AOD) and C (PM10, AOD) > C (NO2, AOD) > C (SO2, AOD), and C (CO, AOD) > C (O-3, AOD). Except for the O-3, its distribution was characterized by highs in the west and lows in the east. The degree of coupling between each pollution indicator and the seasonal average AOD was high. The study showed that there was a high degree of coupling and coordination between pollutant concentration indicators and AOD, and remote sensing AOD data can be used as an effective supplement to regional pollutant monitoring indicators.

TI  - Evaluation and Implication of the Policies towards China's Carbon Neutrality
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - China announced it will achieve a carbon emission peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 to fulfill its international obligations and mitigate climate risk. Related activities and polices were introduced in several sectors before this announcement. The performance and outcome of these activities provide necessary a priori knowledge for the designation and optimization of future policies. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation covering major sectors based on multisource data is proposed. The results show that although China is the largest CO2 emitter for the current stage, the increasing rate of carbon emissions has been significantly mitigated since the 2010s. This reduction in emissions can be accelerated by the carbon-trading scheme in pilot regions. As a substitution for fossil energy, there have been tens of thousands of increases in wind turbines and photovoltaic plants in the past decade. Additionally, an enhancement of the terrestrial carbon sink was detected by time-series remote sensing data. The results of this study demonstrate that China's carbon activities in the past decade have received reasonable outcomes, which will benefit the optimization of related government policies. The improved legislation and policies of China can strengthen the regulation of emissions while promoting the quantity and quality of carbon sinks. At the same time, the improvement of the carbon emissions trading mechanism, especially the establishment of a marketing regulation mechanism, can significantly motivate interest-related communities and industries to abort high-carbon emissions and ensure the implementation of carbon neutrality in the future.

TI  - Vegetation Greening Enhanced the Regional Terrestrial Carbon Uptake in the Dongting Lake Basin of China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystem carbon uptake is essential to achieving a regional carbon neutrality strategy, particularly in subtropical humid areas with dense vegetation. Due to the complex spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the carbon uptake of ecosystems, it is difficult to quantify the influence and contribution of different factors. With the aid of multisource remote sensing data, the spatiotemporal characteristics of carbon uptake and the impact of vegetation change were explored in the Dongting Lake Basin from 2001 to 2020. Based on the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small regional extent (CLUE-S) model, we simulated the land use of the basin under different development scenarios in 2030. Our results showed that the basin has demonstrated a significant greening trend in the last 20 years, with a multiyear average NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) of 0.60 and an increasing trend (y = 0.0048x - 9.069, R-2 = 0.89, p < 0.01). In this context, the multiyear mean of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was 314.95 g C center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1) and also showed a significant increasing trend (y = 1.8915x + 295.09, R-2 = 0.23, p < 0.05). Moreover, though the future carbon uptake might decrease because of the enhanced anthropogenic activities, the ecological conservation scenario might mitigate the reduction by 0.05 x 10(7) t. In conclusion, the greening trend enhanced the ecosystem carbon uptake in the Dongting lake basin. Considering the representativeness of the Dongting Lake Basin, the results of our study would provide useful clues for understanding the trend and pattern of terrestrial carbon uptake and for guiding the carbon neutrality strategy in the subtropical humid area.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon Prediction Using Sentinel-2 Data and Environmental Variables in a Karst Trough Valley Area of Southwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is closely linked to changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) content, which affects the terrestrial carbon cycle. Consequently, it is essential for carbon accounting and sustainable soil management to predict SOC content accurately. Although there has been an extensive utilization of optical remote sensing data and environmental factors to predict SOC content, few studies have explored their applicability in karst areas. Therefore, it remains unclear how SOC content can be accurately simulated in these areas. In this study, 160 soil samples, 8 environmental covariates and 14 optical remote sensing variables were used to build SOC content prediction models. Three machine learning models, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were applied for each of three land use classes, including the entire study area, as well as farmland and forest areas. The variables with the greatest influence were the optical remote sensing bands, derived indices, as well as precipitation and temperature for forest areas, and optical remote sensing band11 and Pop-density for farmland. The results from this study suggest that RF and XGBoost are superior to SVM in prediction accuracy. Additionally, the simulation accuracy of the RF model for the forest areas (R-2 = 0.32, RMSE = 6.81, MAE = 5.63) and of the XGBoost model for farmland areas (R-2 = 0.28, RMSE = 4.03, MAE = 3.27) was the greatest. The prediction model based on different land use types could obtain a higher simulation accuracy than that based on the whole study area. These findings provide new insights for the estimation of SOC content with high precision in karst areas.

TI  - Long-Term Changes in Water Body Area Dynamic and Driving Factors in the Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate monitoring of long-term spatial and temporal changes in open-surface water bodies offers important guidance for water resource security and management. In the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the monitoring of water body changes is especially critical due to the dense population and drastic climate change. Due to the complexity of the physical environment in which the water bodies are located, the advantages and disadvantages of various water body detection rules can vary in large-scale areas. In this paper, we use Landsat 5/7/8 data to extract the area of water bodies in the study area and analyze their spatial and temporal trends from 1984 to 2020 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We propose an improved water body extraction rule based on an existing multi-indicator water body algorithm that combines impervious surface data and digital elevation model data. In this study, the performance of the improved algorithm was cross-validated using seven other water body indicator algorithms, and the results showed the following: (1) the rule accurately retained information about the water body while minimizing the interference of shadows on the extracted water body. (2) On the annual scale from 1984 to 2020, the open-surface water body dataset extracted using this improved rule showed that the turning point for the area of each water body type was 2011, with an overall decreasing trend in area before 2011 and an increasing trend in area after 2011, with the exception of special years, such as 1998. (3) The driving mechanism analysis showed that, overall, precipitation was positively correlated with the water body area and temperature was negatively correlated with the water body area. Additionally, human activities can have an impact on surface water dynamics. The key influencing factors are diverse for each water body type; it was found that seasonal water bodies were correlated with precipitation and paddy fields and permanent water bodies were correlated with temperature and urban construction. The accurate monitoring of the spatial and temporal dynamics of open-surface water performed in this study can shed light on the sustainable development of water resources and the environment.

TI  - Adaptive Local Cross-Channel Vector Pooling Attention Module for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Adding an attention module to the deep convolution semantic segmentation network has significantly enhanced the network performance. However, the existing channel attention module focusing on the channel dimension neglects the spatial relationship, causing location noise to transmit to the decoder. In addition, the spatial attention module exemplified by self-attention has a high training cost and challenges in execution efficiency, making it unsuitable to handle large-scale remote sensing data. We propose an efficient vector pooling attention (VPA) module for building the channel and spatial location relationship. The module can locate spatial information better by performing a unique vector average pooling in the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the feature maps. Furthermore, it can also learn the weights directly by using the adaptive local cross-channel interaction. Multiple weight learning ablation studies and comparison experiments with the classical attention modules were conducted by connecting the VPA module to a modified DeepLabV3 network using ResNet50 as the encoder. The results show that the mIoU of our network with the addition of an adaptive local cross-channel interaction VPA module increases by 3% compared to the standard network on the MO-CSSSD. The VPA-based semantic segmentation network can significantly improve precision efficiency compared with other conventional attention networks. Furthermore, the results on the WHU Building dataset present an improvement in IoU and F1-score by 1.69% and 0.97%, respectively. Our network raises the mIoU by 1.24% on the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset. The VPA module can also significantly improve the network's performance on small target segmentation.

TI  - Exploring the Relationships between Land Surface Temperature and Its Influencing Factors Using Multisource Spatial Big Data: A Case Study in Beijing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A better understanding of the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and its influencing factors is important to the livable, healthy, and sustainable development of cities. In this study, we focused on the potential effect of human daily activities on LST from a short-term perspective. Beijing was selected as a case city, and Weibo check-in data were employed to measure the intensity of human daily activities. MODIS data were analyzed and used for urban LST measurement. We adopted spatial autocorrelation analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, and spatial autoregressive model to explore the influence mechanism of LST, and the study was performed at both the pixel scale and subdistrict scale. The results show that there is a significant and positive spatial autocorrelation between LSTs, and urban landscape components are strong explainers of LST. A significant and positive effect of human daily activities on LST is captured at night, and this effect can last and accumulate over a few hours. The variables of land use functions and building forms show varying impacts on LST from daytime to nighttime. Moreover, the comparison between results at different scales indicates that the relationships between LST and some explainers are sensitive to the study scale. The current study enriches the literature on LST and offers meaningful and practical suggestions for the monitoring, early warning, and management of urban thermal environment with remote sensing technology and spatial big data sources.

TI  - Soil Moisture Inversion Based on Data Augmentation Method Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important land environment characteristic that connects agriculture, ecology, and hydrology. Surface soil moisture (SSM) prediction can be used to plan irrigation, monitor water quality, manage water resources, and estimate agricultural production. Multi-source remote sensing is a crucial tool for assessing SSM in agricultural areas. The field-measured SSM sample data are required in model building and accuracy assessment of SSM inversion using remote sensing data. When the SSM samples are insufficient, the SSM inversion accuracy is severely affected. An SSM inversion method suitable for a small sample size was proposed. The alpha approximation method was employed to expand the measured SSM samples to offer more training data for SSM inversion models. Then, feature parameters were extracted from Sentinel-1 microwave and Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data, and optimized using three methods, which were Pearson correlation analysis, random forest (RF), and principal component analysis. Then, three common machine learning models suitable for small sample training, which were RF, support vector regression, and genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network, were built to retrieve SSM. Comparison experiments were carried out between various feature optimization methods and machine learning models. The experimental results showed that after sample augmentation, SSM inversion accuracy was enhanced, and the combination of utilizing RF for feature screening and RF for SSM inversion had a higher accuracy, with a coefficient of determination of 0.7256, a root mean square error of 0.0539 cm(3)/cm(3), and a mean absolute error of 0.0422 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The proposed method was finally used to invert the regional SSM of the study area. The inversion results indicated that the proposed method had good performance in regional applications with a small sample size.

TI  - Microstructure and Mechanical Property Evolution of Robotic Friction Stir-Welded Al-Li Alloys
T2  - CRYSTALS
M3  - Article
AB  - 2198 aluminum-lithium alloy was friction stir-welded with a KUKA Robot integrated with a compact friction stir-welding head with a rotation speed of 800 rpm at different welding speeds. The real-time tool force in the three directions of Fx, Fy and Fz was measured with a load sensor. Mechanical properties and microstructure evolution were investigated systematically. The results showed that Fz force increased from 3.2 kN to 8.5 kN as welding speed increased from 50 mm/min to 500 mm/min. Ultimate tensile strength of 383 MPa, 88% of base metal, was obtained when the welding speed was 100 mm/min. The nugget zone consisted of refined grains with an average size of 4 mu m. TEM investigation demonstrates that T1 precipitation predominated in the base metal and disappeared in the nugget zone, as a small amount of delta' was retained. The W-shape hardness profile in all weldments and higher welding speed lead to a higher hardness value.

TI  - Combination of InSAR with a Depression Angle Model for 3D Deformation Monitoring in Mining Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current three-dimensional (3D) deformation monitoring methods, based on the single line-of-sight (LOS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology, are constructed by combining the deformation characteristics of mining subsidence basins, which are incompletely suitable in the edge area of the subsidence basin and some large deformation gradient mines with surface uplift in the LOS direction.The 3D deformation monitoring method of InSAR combined with the surface displacement vector depression angle model (InSAR+ depression angle model) is proposed to obtain more detailed and accurate deformation information of the entire basin. This method first establishes a surface displacement vector depression angle model based on the probability integral method (PIM). The magnitude of the surface displacement vector-owing to the spatial relationship between the LOS direction and the surface displacement vector-is obtained because the horizontal movement direction field and the displacement vector depression angle field of the mining area determine the 3D directions of the surface displacement vector. Then, the PIM model is used to obtain the settlement information of the central area with a large deformation gradient. A complete subsidence basin of the mining area is received by combining the proposed method and the PIM. A total of 35 Sentinel-1A data from 31 March 2018 to 13 May 2019 and the leveling data were used to apply and analyze the accuracy of this method. The experimental results show that this method can obtain more accurate information on surface subsidence around the mining area. Moreover, the overall settlement is more consistent with the actual situation, and the monitoring ability is significantly improved compared with the InSAR and PIM.

T2  - NANOETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ethics of technology is not as effective as it should. Despite decades of ethical discussion, development and use of new technologies continues apace without much regard to those discussions. Economic and other forces are too powerful. More focus needs to be placed on the values that underpin social attitudes to technology. By seriously looking at Indigenous thought and comparing it with the typical Western way of seeing the world, we can gain a better understanding of our own views. The Indigenous Filipino worldview provides us with a platform for assessing our own core values and suggests modifications to those values. It also indicates ways for broadening and altering the focus of the ethics of technology to make it more effective in helping us to use technologies in ways more conducive to human well-being.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns of Land Surface Phenology from 2001 to 2021 in the Agricultural Pastoral Ecotone of Northern China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is one of the most sensitive indicators to understanding terrestrial ecosystem status and change. However, few studies have been conducted to reveal vegetation phenology variation characteristics over the past two decades, especially under the background of the global warming hiatus since 1998. The agricultural pastoral ecotone of northern China (APENC) is an ideal place to analyze land surface phenology (LSP) variation. Therefore, the spatiotemporal patterns of LSP were quantitatively analyzed at regional, basin and pixel scales based on time-series MODIS NDVI data (2001-2021). Results showed that: (i) The start of the growing season (SOS) occurred in 105-141 Julian days, the end of the growing season (EOS) was between 257 and 281 Julian days and the length of the growing season (LOS) varied from 130 to 172 days. The later SOS was mainly distributed in croplands and typical grassland areas, while the early SOS was observed in forests and sandy vegetation coverage areas. The early EOS occurred in typical grasslands, and the later EOS was concentrated in the southeast boundary. The magnitude of the SOS and LOS fluctuation was less than EOS. (ii) The SOS and EOS exhibited overall insignificant advanced and delayed trends at a rate of 0.09 days.yr(-1) and 0.12 days.yr(-1), respectively, and the LOS displayed an insignificant extended trend at a rate of 0.26 days.yr(-1) at a regional scale. The trends of phenological metrics were consistent with the APENC in the Yellow River and Haihe River Basins. The shortened trend of LOS occurred due to the delayed SOS and advanced EOS in the Songliao River and Continental Basins. (iii) The SOS variation gradually changed from an advanced trend to a delayed trend from a southwest to northeast direction in cropland and grassland ecosystems, whereas an opposite trend was found for EOS. The LOS exhibited a significant extended trend due to the significant advanced and delayed trend of SOS and EOS at p < 0.01 in forest ecosystems. This work provides a critical reference for the vegetation phenology dynamic research of semi-arid and semi-humid regions.

TI  - Representativeness of Two Global Gridded Precipitation Data Sets in the Intensity of Surface Short-Term Precipitation over China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the representativeness of two widely used next-generation global satellite precipitation estimates data for short-term precipitation over China, namely the satellite data from the Climate Prediction Center morphing (CMORPH) and the satellite data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. These two satellite precipitation data sets were compared with the hourly liquid in-situ precipitation from China national surface stations from 2016 to 2020. The results showed that the GPM precipitation data has better representativeness of surface short-term precipitation than that of the CMORPH data, and these two quantitative precipitation estimate (QPE) data sets underestimated extreme precipitation. Moreover, we analyzed the influence of the error between two QPE data sets and the in-situ precipitation on the classification of short-term precipitation intensity. China uses 8.1-16 mm/h as the definition of heavy precipitation, but the accuracy of the satellite QPE product was different due to the different lowest threshold of heavy rain (more than 8.1 mm/h or more than 16 mm/h). Increasing the threshold value of the QPE data for short-term strong precipitation resulted in lower accuracy for detecting such events, but higher accuracy for detecting moderate intensity rainfall. When studying short-term strong precipitation over China using precipitation grade, selecting an appropriate threshold was important to ensure accurate judgments. Additionally, it is important to account for errors caused by QPE data, which can significantly affect the accuracy of precipitation grading.

TI  - Fluoroscopic Intraoperative Breast Neoplasm and Node Detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative localization is necessary for nonpalpable breast lesions. A novel procedure, fluoroscopic intraoperative neoplasm and node detection (FIND), obviates the preoperative painful and potentially expensive localization by using intraoperative visualization of the standard clip placed during diagnostic biopsy. We hypothesized FIND would improve negative margin rates.STUDY DESIGN: This is an IRB-approved retrospective study (September 2016 to March 2021). Electronic chart review identified breast and axillary node procedures using wire localization (WL) or FIND. Primary outcome was margin status. Secondary outcomes included re-excision rate, specimen weight, surgery time, and axillary node localization rate.RESULTS: We identified 459 patients, of whom 116 (25.3%) underwent FIND and 343 (74.7%) WL. Of these, 68.1% of FIND and 72.0% of WL procedures were for malignant lesions. Final margin positivity was 5.1% (4 of 79) for FIND and 16.6% (41 of 247) for WL (p = 0.008). This difference lost statistical significance on multivariable logistic regression (p = 0.652). Re-excision rates were 7.6% and 14.6% for FIND and WL (p = 0.125), with an equivalent mean specimen weight (p = 0.502), and mean surgery time of 177.5 +/- 81.7 and 157.1 +/- 66.8 minutes, respectively (mean +/- SD; p = 0.022). FIND identified all (29 of 29) targeted axillary nodes, and WL identified only 80.1% (21 of 26) (p = 0.019).CONCLUSIONS: FIND has lower positive margin rates and a trend towards lower re-excision rates compared with WL, proving its value in localizing nonpalpable breast lesions. It also offers accurate localization of axillary nodes, valuable in the era of targeted axillary dissection. It is a method of visual localization, using a skill and equipment surgeons already have, and saves patients and medical systems an additional schedule-disruptive, painful procedure, especially valuable when using novel localization devices is cost-prohibitive.

TI  - Design of Long-Distance Wide-Spectrum Condensing System with Large Aperture Fresnel Lens
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To meet the requirements for using an optical fiber spectrometer to detect weak signals over long distances and across a wide spectrum, and considering the sensitivity of the spectrometer, a large aperture optical system is needed so that sufficient optical signals can be obtained. In addition, the aperture of the receiving surface of the optical fiber bundle is small, making it difficult for the lens to match the numerical aperture of the optical fiber bundle. Therefore, the focal spot size and convergence angle should be as small as possible to efficiently couple optical signals into the optical fiber bundle and improve energy utilization efficiency. The traditional design of an optical system based on imaging optics increases the weight and volume of the system, ultimately affecting the overall performance of system. Therefore, determining the size of the spot and angle of beam convergence is crucial for improving the system's light energy utilization efficiency.Methods A large aperture Fresnel lens condensing system is designed based on a hybrid design method of imaging and non-imaging optics. The system consists of a 1.1-m-diameter Fresnel lens, a beam homogenizer, a total reflection collimator, and a relay lens group. The receiving surface is a fiber bundle with a diameter of 2 mm and a numerical aperture of 0.22. The problem of traditional large aperture lenses large volume and weight is solved using large aperture Fresnel lenses. To achieve uniform energy distribution and reduce the convergence angle of the light bundle, the rear group of non-imaging optical elements, composed of a beam homogenizer and a total reflection collimator, are designed to reduce the spherical and chromatic aberrations of large aperture Fresnel lenses. The relay lens group also controls the beam divergence angle and spot size, allowing the optical signal to be efficiently coupled into the optical fiber and improving the light energy utilization efficiency of the system.Results and Discussions First, a large aperture Fresnel lens condensing system based on imaging and non- imaging optics is designed (Fig. 2). Subsequently, the optical device is modeled and designed using the ZEMAX software, and the overall parameters of the condensing system are achieved (Table 1). The optical system model is established in ZEMAX software to verify the focusing performance of the Fresnel lens condensing system, and simulation results are obtained (Fig. 8). The light energy utilization efficiency of the condensing system is 6.5% according to ray tracing, and the light energy utilization efficiency of the condensing system with a rear group is five times that of the system without a rear group. In addition, the experimental system is built based on the condensing system s design results (Fig. 9). The experimental light energy utilization efficiency of the condensing system is 3.8%, which is lower than the simulation results. This is because the experimental device parameters and spectral power distribution of the light source are inconsistent with the theoretical simulation. In contrast, the light energy utilization efficiency of the Fresnel lens condensing system without the rear group is only 1.8%. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the rear group system based on the hybrid design method of imaging and non-imaging optics can effectively improve the light energy utilization efficiency of the Fresnel lens condensing system.Conclusions In this study, based on the hybrid theory of imaging and non-imaging optics, the large aperture Fresnel lens condensing system is examined, and the design scheme of the rear group system composed of a beam homogenizer, total reflection collimator, and relay lens group is devised. Through the simulation and optimization by ZEMAX software, a theoretical light energy utilization efficiency of 6.5% is obtained for the system. The experimental system is built based on the design results. The light energy utilization efficiency of the Fresnel lens condensing system with the rear group is 3.8%, which is 2.1 times that of the system without the rear group. Given that the experimental device parameters are not completely consistent with the theoretical simulation parameters, the experimental result is essentially reasonable. The theoretical simulation and experimental test prove that the rear group can reduce the influence of aberration, and control the spot size and the convergence angle. The hybrid design method efficiently couples the optical signal into the optical fiber bundle, allowing for the detection of weak signals over long distances and across a wide spectrum.

TI  - Comparison of Satellite Imagery for Identifying Seagrass Distribution Using a Machine Learning Algorithm on the Eastern Coast of South Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass is an essential component of coastal ecosystems because of its capability to absorb blue carbon, and its involvement in sustaining marine biodiversity. In this study, support vector machine (SVM) technologies with corrected satellite imagery data, were applied to identify the distribution of seagrasses. Observations of seagrasses from satellite imagery were obtained using GeoEye-1, Sentinel-2 MSI level 1C, and Landsat-8 OLI satellite imagery. The satellite imagery from Google Earth has been obtained at a very high resolution, and was to be used within both the training and testing of a classification method. The optical satellite imagery must be processed for image classification, throughout which radiometric correction, sunglint, and water column adjustments were applied. We restricted the scope of the study area to a maximum depth of 10 m due to the fact that light does not penetrate beyond this level. When classifying the distribution of seagrasses present in the research region, the recently developed SVM technique achieved overall accuracy values of up to 92% (GeoEye-1), 88% (Sentinel-2 MSI level 1C), and 83% (Landsat-8 OLI), respectively. The results of the overall accuracy values are also used to evaluate classification models.

TI  - TOWARDS A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE: Need for Posthuman Ethics in the Anthropocene Era
T2  - JOURNAL OF DHARMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ethics, which constitutes principles that guide human conduct, deserves particular attention in this era of the Anthropocene, when human actions greatly influence ecology. Renaissance humans have hegemonised humanistic ethics of living and interacting with the world since the Enlightenment. While exalting human exceptionalism, humanism has relegated all other forms of existence to a subservient taxonomy, categorising them as raw material for human empowerment. The self-exalted autonomous subject, homo sapiens, faces the threat of extinction in the wake of unprecedented and violent ecological reactions. The exponential growth of the agency of intelligent machines also calls to question the autonomous human agency propagated by humanism. A paradigm shift is the moment's need; this paper suggests posthuman ethics as an alternative. The new worldview, post-humanism, places the homo sapiens in relation to the rest of the universe. Philosophical post-humanism, proposed by Francesca Ferrando, foregrounds posthuman ethics that are post-humanistic, post-anthropocentric, and post-dualistic. They form a roadmap towards a sustainable future.

TI  - Urban Green Space Analysis and its Effect on the Surface Urban Heat Island Phenomenon in Denpasar City, Bali
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Urbanization process in Indonesia's big cities causes adverse environmental impacts such as climate change and land cover change. Urban climate change causes the warming of urban areas compared to rural areas; it is called Urban Heat Island phenomenon. Loss of vegetation due to urban development is one of several causes that contribute to urban heat islands. This study examines the availability of green spaces and their effects on the surface urban heat island in Denpasar city. This study used the spatial approach for Urban Green space mapping with digitizing methods. Landsat 8's thermal band is used for land surface temperature mapping and to conduct a spatial pattern analysis of the SUHI phenomena. The Global Moran's Index and Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) were used to determine the correlation between urban green space and SUHI. The study result shows that Denpasar City's urban green space area covers 28.22 km2. That's equal to 22.1% of the Denpasar City Administrative area. Denpasar Selatan district has the largest urban green space cover, with 14.19 km2 covered, or 50.27% of all the green space in Denpasar City. The majority of Denpasar is affected by UHI occurrences, except the northern region of North Denpasar and the southern region of South Denpasar. The maximum UHI level reaches 4-5 degrees C, located on the east side of South Denpasar, especially in the Sanur coastal area. According to the spatial pattern study, the association between urban green space and SUHI only exists on the north side of Denpasar. The correlation between low-SUHI intensity clusters and high cover of green space is shown in the same area. However, the association between High-UHI intensity and low green space cover has not significantly happened. It indicated that other factors besides green space could affect the land surface temperature.

TI  - Evaluating the Losses and Recovery of GPP in the Subtropical Mangrove Forest Directly Attacked by Tropical Cyclone: Case Study in Hainan Island
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The gross primary production (GPP) of the mangrove ecosystem determines the upper limit of the scale of its "blue carbon" sink. Tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the most important extreme events that threaten the subtropical mangrove ecosystem and have a serious impact on mangrove ecosystem GPP. However, there are somewhat insufficient scientific findings on regional-scale mangrove ecosystem GPP responding to large-scale weather events such as TCs. Therefore, we selected the subtropical Hainan Island mangrove ecosystem, where more than two TCs pass through per year, as the research area; selected direct-attack TCs as the research object; and took the mangrove vegetation photosynthesis light-use efficiency model established based on the eddy covariance observation data as the tool to evaluate the loss and recovery of mangrove ecosystem GPP after TCs attacked at a regional scale. We found that the TC impacted the mangrove ecosystem GPP through the photosynthetic area and rate, and the recovery of the rate occurred prior to the recovery of the area; the loss of mangrove ecosystem GPP is inversely proportional to the distance to the center of the TC and the distance to the coastline; and the canopy height, diameter at breast height, and aspect where the tree stands significantly influence the response of the mangrove ecosystem GPP to TCs. However, the response varies for different mangrove community compositions, soil conditions, and planting densities as well as different frequencies and intensities of TCs, and they should be analyzed in detail. This study is expected to provide technical and data support for the protection of blue carbon in a subtropical island mangrove ecosystem in response to extreme events and post-disaster recovery.

TI  - Prevalence of HCV Antibody and its Associated Factors: A Study from Sentinel Hospitals in China
T2  - BIOMEDICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The prevalence and related factors of serum anti-HCV in different regions and hospitals have not been studied extensively in China. We used routine screening data to determine the prevalence of HCV antibody in hospital patients, evaluate the epidemic trend of hepatitis C and formulate screening strategies.Methods Patient information and HCV antibody testing results were collected from January 2017 to December 2019 in 77 HCV sentinel hospitals in China. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the characteristics and associations.Results HCV antibody prevalence rates were distinct among patients in different departments, with a range of 0.33%-6.93%. Patients who were admitted to the liver disease-related departments (aOR = 10.76; 95% CI, 10.27-11.28), Internal Medicine (aOR = 2.87; 95% CI, 2.75-3.00), and Department of Surgery (aOR = 1.95; 95% CI, 1.87-2.04), were more likely to be tested for HCV antibody positive. HCV antibody prevalence was associated with patients aged 45 years and older (aOR = 2.74; 95% CI, 2.69-2.80), testing in infetious disease hospitals (aOR = 2.33; 95% CI, 2.26-2.40) and secondary hospitals (aOR = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.69-1.75). Patients in sentinel hospitals of the Northeast (aOR = 12.75; 95% CI, 12.40-13.11), the Central (aOR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.61-1.70), and the West (aOR = 1.78; 95% CI, 1.73-1.83) China had higher HCV prevalence than those who were in the Eastern coastal area.Conclusion Those who were over 45 years old and saw doctors for liver diseases, and invasive diagnosis and treatment should be referred to HCV antibody testing.

TI  - Estimation of Fv/Fm in Spring Wheat Using UAV-Based Multispectral and RGB Imagery with Multiple Machine Learning Methods
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) is a widely used indicator of photosynthetic health in plants. Remote sensing of Fv/Fm using MS (multispectral) and RGB imagery has the potential to enable high-throughput screening of plant health in agricultural and ecological applications. This study aimed to estimate Fv/Fm in spring wheat at an experimental base in Hanghou County, Inner Mongolia, from 2020 to 2021. RGB and MS images were obtained at the wheat flowering stage using a Da-Jiang Phantom 4 multispectral drone. A total of 51 vegetation indices were constructed, and the measured Fv/Fm of wheat on the ground was obtained simultaneously using a Handy PEA plant efficiency analyzer. The performance of 26 machine learning algorithms for estimating Fv/Fm using RGB and multispectral imagery was compared. The findings revealed that a majority of the multispectral vegetation indices and approximately half of the RGB vegetation indices demonstrated a strong correlation with Fv/Fm, as evidenced by an absolute correlation coefficient greater than 0.75. The Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) was the optimal estimation model for RGB, with the important features being RGBVI and ExR. The Huber model was the optimal estimation model for MS, with the important feature being MSAVI2. The Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) was the optimal estimation model for the combination (RGB + MS), with the important features being SIPI, ExR, and VEG. The highest accuracy was achieved using the ARD model for estimating Fv/Fm with RGB + MS vegetation indices on the test sets (Test set MAE = 0.019, MSE = 0.001, RMSE = 0.024, R-2 = 0.925, RMSLE = 0.014, MAPE = 0.026). The combined analysis suggests that extracting vegetation indices (SIPI, ExR, and VEG) from RGB and MS remote images by UAV as input variables of the model and using the ARD model can significantly improve the accuracy of Fv/Fm estimation at flowering stage. This approach provides new technical support for rapid and accurate monitoring of Fv/Fm in spring wheat in the Hetao Irrigation District.

TI  - An Innovative Approach for Effective Removal of Thin Clouds in Optical Images Using Convolutional Matting Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are the major source of clutter in optical remote sensing (RS) images. Approximately 60% of the Earth's surface is covered by clouds, with the equatorial and Tibetan Plateau regions being the most affected. Although the implementation of techniques for cloud removal can significantly improve the efficiency of remote sensing imagery, its use is severely restricted due to the poor timeliness of time-series cloud removal techniques and the distortion-prone nature of single-frame cloud removal techniques. To thoroughly remove thin clouds from remote sensing imagery, we propose the Saliency Cloud Matting Convolutional Neural Network (SCM-CNN) from an image fusion perspective. This network can automatically balance multiple loss functions, extract the cloud opacity and cloud top reflectance intensity from cloudy remote sensing images, and recover ground surface information under thin cloud cover through inverse operations. The SCM-CNN was trained on simulated samples and validated on both simulated samples and Sentinel-2 images, achieving average peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNRs) of 30.04 and 25.32, respectively. Comparative studies demonstrate that the SCM-CNN model is more effective in performing cloud removal on individual remote sensing images, is robust, and can recover ground surface information under thin cloud cover without compromising the original image. The method proposed in this article can be widely promoted in regions with year-round cloud cover, providing data support for geological hazard, vegetation, and frozen area studies, among others.

TI  - Effects of Snow Cover on Spring Vegetation Phenology Vary With Temperature Gradient Across the Pan-Arctic
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive and complex changes in spring vegetation phenology have occurred in the Pan-Arctic over the last several decades. However, the role of snow cover at the start of the growing season (SOS) under different climatic conditions remains unclear. Therefore, we compare the effects of four snow indicators on SOS from 1982 to 2015 based on long-term remote sensing data and found that snow cover end date (SCED) is the main snow indicator affecting SOS, with SOS advancing 0.56 days for each 1-day advance in SCED, explaining 12%-90% of SOS variability in 63% of the Pan-Arctic region. The results also demonstrate that SCED is the dominant factor on SOS in 13% of the Pan-Arctic region and the effects of SCED on SOS vary with temperature gradient rather than precipitation gradient. In cold areas, the positive effect of SCED on SOS diminished with increasing temperature, while in warm areas, the positive effect of SCED on SOS increased with increasing temperature. As the climate warms, the impact of SCED on SOS is expected to weaken in cold areas and increase in warm areas. The findings have crucial implications for understanding future vegetation phenological responses to climate change across the Pan-Arctic.The Pan-Arctic is undergoing dramatic environmental changes. Changes in spring vegetation phenology, one of the most critical climate-induced changes, have not always followed the global advancement trends. The role of changing snow cover in a considerable amount of variation in spring vegetation phenology under various climatic conditions is still not clear. Based on long-term remote sensing datasets, we find that snow cover influenced 63% of Pan-Arctic terrestrial spring vegetation phenology, with a 1-day advance in snowmelt followed by a 0.56-day advance in spring vegetation phenology. The effect of snowmelt on spring vegetation phenology varies by area and is related to the temperature rather than precipitation. There are different modes of the impact of snowmelt on spring vegetation phenology in cold and warm areas. The impact of early snowmelt on spring vegetation phenology is expected to diminish in cold areas and increase in warm areas as the climate warms across the Pan-Arctic. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the future vegetation status of the Pan-Arctic ecosystem in the context of climate change.

TI  - Blend with the Sea Surface Temperature from Different Satellites and Their Comparison in the Southeast Pacific Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - The daily sea surface temperature (SST) data from three kinds of different satellites of GMI, GOES and MODIS were applied to do the blend in the Southeast Pacific Ocean throughout the whole year of 2020. The coverage rates of the SST of the blend result were improved highly and more stable throughout the whole year, compared with the result of the single satellite of GMI, GOES, and MODIS. The yearly average coverage rates of GMI, GOES, MODIS, and blend were 43%, 48%, 30%, and 76%, and their corresponding yearly average standard deviation (SD) were 4%, 6%, 7%, and 4%, respectively. All the coverage rates of these three satellites were low from April to September. The valid observation days calculated in the whole year over every grid were used to represent the spatial distribution patterns of the coverage rates. The spatial distribution patterns of coverage rates from GOES and MODIS were similar that their valid observation days were higher in the northwest area and lower in the south area, and those of GMI was contrary to the former two. The ranges of valid observation day was from GOES, GMI, and MODIS were 0-364, 6-254, and 9-231d, respectively. After the blend, all the observation day of every grid in the research region was enhanced (103-366 d). Especially the near shore and south area, and the minimum valid observation day increased largely from the single digits to hundreds digit.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Fusion of 10-Min Aerosol Optical Depth Products with the GEO-LEO Satellite Joint Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) satellite-derived AOD possesses huge advantages for monitoring atmospheric aerosol with high frequency; however, the data missing existing in the satellite-derived AOD products dramatically limits this expected advantage due to cloud obscuration and aerosol retrieval algorithm. In recent years, numerous AOD fusion algorithms have been proposed, while these algorithms are mostly developed to blend daily AOD products derived from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and generally neglect discrepancies from different categories of products. Therefore, a spatiotemporal fusion framework based on the Bayesian maximum entropy theorem, blending GEO with LEO satellite observations and incorporating data discrepancies (GL-BME), is developed to complementarily recover the Advanced Himawari-8 Imager (AHI) AOD products over East Asia. The results show that GL-BME significantly improves the average spatial completeness of AOD from 20.3% to 67.6% with ensured reliability, and the accuracy of merged AODs nearly maintains that of original AHI AODs. Moreover, a comparison of the monthly aerosol spatial distribution between the merged and original AHI AODs is conducted to evaluate the performance and significance of GL-BME, which indicates that GL-BME could further restore the real atmospheric aerosol situation to a certain extent on the basis of dramatic spatial coverage improvement.

TI  - Application of Freeform Surface in Aberration Compensation of Femtosecond Laser Filamentation System
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective High-power ultrafast femtosecond laser will form a unique plasma channel at the beam focus due to the nonlinear effect when propagating in a transparent optical medium, namely, filamentation. Filamentation can be used as the excitation source of the fluorescence spectrum for detecting material components, which is of great application value in monitoring atmospheric pollutants. However, when the optical system is used to remotely focus a femtosecond laser into a filament, the aberration in the system can lead to the irregular shape of the focused light spot, as well as a larger radius and poorer quality. As a result, filamentation intensity is weakened, and the detection sensitivity of the system is reduced, which is not conducive to remote detection of atmospheric pollutants with a low concentration. Therefore, determining how to effectively reduce the aberration of the femtosecond laser filamentation system and improve the quality of the focused light spot is essential for enhancing the filamentation intensity and the detection sensitivity of the system.Methods On the basis of the strong aberration compensation ability of the optical freeform surface, we propose a method introducing a transmission freeform surface phase plate into the femtosecond laser filamentation system to compensate for the system aberration. Firstly, by simulating and analyzing the aberration characteristics of the original system in the optical design software, we design the compensation freeform surface phase plate to reduce some main aberrations and overall wave-front aberrations. The results of the optimal design show that the system aberration is significantly reduced, and the light spot has a more regular shape and a smaller size. Then, we investigate the manufacturability of the designed freeform surface phase plate by tolerance analysis and manufacture the phase plate by single-point diamond turning successfully. Finally, we adjust the femtosecond laser filamentation system with a freeform surface phase plate and carry out the laser filamentation experiment. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the freeform surface phase plate, with the shape regularity of the focused light spot improved and its radius significantly reduced, and filamentation intensity of femtosecond laser filamentation system is greatly enhanced.Results and Discussions Firstly, a freeform surface phase plate is optimized in CODE V to compensate for the aberration of the femtosecond laser filamentation system when the laser is focused at 10 m. The shape of the focused light spot is more regular, and its radius is reduced after optimization (Fig. 7), which means the main aberration of the system, astigmatism in the X direction, and the overall wave- front aberration are greatly decreased ( Fig. 8). Secondly, after the tolerance analysis of the designed freeform surface phase plate (Fig. 9), the phase plate is manufactured by single-point diamond turning. Then, the horizontal and vertical surface shapes of the phase plate are scanned by ZYGO's profilometer, and manufacturing errors in both directions can be achieved ( Fig. 11). These errors can be converted into curvature radius changes to analyze the influence on the compensation results ( Fig. 12). According to the analysis results, the performance of aberration compensation in experiments are predicted. The phase plate is installed in the original system to study the aberration compensation experimentally. The light spot images in the experiment show that the shape regularity of the compensated light spot is effectively improved, and its radius is significantly reduced (Fig. 15). However, due to the manufacturing error of the phase plate surface, the actual radius of the compensated light spot is larger than the simulation result, and the focusing position moves forward ( Fig. 16), which confirms the previous prediction results. Finally, ultrasonic signals are used to characterize the filament intensity before and after compensation. The results show that the filamentation intensity after compensation is 56 times higher than that before compensation (Fig. 17).Conclusions In this paper, the transmissive freeform surface phase plate is used to compensate for the astigmatic aberration mainly existing in the femtosecond laser filamentation system. After the optimal design, the aberration in the system has been effectively compensated. The tolerance analysis of the design results, including surface shape and assembly and adjustment tolerance, is carried out, and the device is manufactured. The manufactured freeform surface is set into the system according to the design to verify its aberration compensation effect in the experiment. The light spot shape during focusing is more regular, and the RMS radius of the light spot at the focusing position is less than 0. 5 mm when the femtosecond laser propagates linearly. Moreover, the ultrasonic signal intensity, which is utilized to characterize the filamentation intensity, is 56 times higher than the case when femtosecond laser propagates nonlinearly. Therefore, it is feasible to use optical freeform surfaces to compensate for the aberration in the femtosecond laser filamentation system, which is of great practical value for enhancing the filamentation intensity of femtosecond laser filamentation system at a long distance and improving its remote sensing detection sensitivity.

TI  - Proof and Application of Discriminating Ocean Oil Spills and Seawater Based on Polarization Ratio Using Quad-Polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on the proof and application of discriminating between oil spills and seawater (including the "look-alikes", named low wind areas) based on the polarization ratio. A new relative polarization ratio (PRr) method is proposed, which is based on the difference between the scattering mechanism and the dielectric constant for oil spills compared to that of seawater. The case study found that (1) PRr numerically amplifies the contrast between oil spills and seawater, reduces the difference between low wind areas and ordinary seawater, and exhibits better details of the image; (2) the threshold method based on Euclidean distance can obtain the highest classification overall accuracy within the allowable error range, and can be widely used in the study of different incidence angles and environmental conditions; and (3) the identification of oil spills and seawater by the proposed methods can largely avoid the misjudgment of low wind areas as oil spills. Considering visual interpretation as the reference 'ground truth', the overall classification accuracy of all cases is more than 95%; only the edge of the diffuse thin oil slick and oil-water mixture is difficult to identify. This method can serve as an effective supplement to existing oil spill detection methods.

TI  - Tibetan zenith wet delay model with refined vertical correction
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tibet presents significant elevation changes, thus leading to extraordinary tropospheric conditions. This eventually forms complicated and diverse delays in satellite data (such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observations), particularly for the wet component. Such delays cause non-negligible errors in microwave-dependent techniques. As infrastructure development progresses, GNSS applications (such as real-time kinematic and unmanned aerial vehicles) require a reliable tropospheric model that works not only on the surface but also over broader operating heights to pre-correct delays. However, the existing models, even the widely used global pressure and temperature 3 (GPT3) model, exhibit low performance in Tibet due to insufficient spatiotemporal resolution and limited vertical correction capability. We thereby proposed a refined Tibetan zenith wet delay (ZWD) model (TZ) established using pressure-level ERA5 datasets with a horizontal resolution of 0.25 degrees released by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The core of the TZ is the optimized vertical correction, i.e., the cubic polynomial with two more parameters than the commonly used exponential function, whose underlying parameters are determined by a least-squares function refined up to semidiurnal harmonics. TZ achieves ZWD estimates for an arbitrary time and height in the Tibetan region with the above structure. ERA5- and radiosonde-derived ZWDs validated the TZ performance. Validation results show that the TZ model achieved a lower bias and root-mean-square error than the GPT3 model, regardless of the surface or other height layers. It demonstrates that the TZ performs better in Tibet than the widely adopted GPT3. The required MATLAB scripts and coefficient matrix of the TZ are available at https://zenodo.org/ record/7063960.

TI  - Quantifying the effects of 2D/3D urban landscape patterns on land surface temperature: A perspective from cities of different sizes
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous development of urbanization, two-dimensional (2D) landscape pattern is insufficient to explain the complex urban thermal phenomenon, while three-dimensional (3D) urban composition directly af-fects the process of surface energy exchange and becomes an important influencing factor in regard to land surface temperature (LST). There have been some studies on the relationship between 2D/3D urban patterns and LST, however, there are relatively few studies on the effects of 2D/3D urban landscape on LST in cities of different sizes. In this research, the relationship of 2D/3D urban patterns and LST in three cities (Beijing, Shi-jiazhuang and Cangzhou) of different sizes were analyzed by using the boosted regression tree model. The results were as follows: 1) With the increase in city size, LST gradually increased in summer and decreased in winter. 2) The larger the size of the city was, the greater the number of factors that significantly affected LST (p < 0.05). 3) In spring, summer and autumn, volume of tree (TV), mean tree height (MTH) and the largest patch index of impervious surface (LPI_IS) had a high relative influence, and the average total relative influences of these three metrics were 80.08%, 78.99% and 45.14%, respectively. 4)There was a significant negative correlation between TV and LST, a positive correlation between LPI_IS and LST and a combination of positive and negative corre-lations between MTH and LST. The study of the effects of 2D and 3D urban morphology on LST could help urban planners and managers create more scientific urban planning and development management measures to miti-gate urban thermal environment problems.

TI  - Prevalence of HCV Antibody and its Associated Factors: A Study from Sentinel Hospitals in China
T2  - BIOMEDICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The prevalence and related factors of serum anti-HCV in different regions and hospitals have not been studied extensively in China. We used routine screening data to determine the prevalence of HCV antibody in hospital patients, evaluate the epidemic trend of hepatitis C and formulate screening strategies.Methods Patient information and HCV antibody testing results were collected from January 2017 to December 2019 in 77 HCV sentinel hospitals in China. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the characteristics and associations.Results HCV antibody prevalence rates were distinct among patients in different departments, with a range of 0.33%-6.93%. Patients who were admitted to the liver disease-related departments (aOR = 10.76; 95% CI, 10.27-11.28), Internal Medicine (aOR = 2.87; 95% CI, 2.75-3.00), and Department of Surgery (aOR = 1.95; 95% CI, 1.87-2.04), were more likely to be tested for HCV antibody positive. HCV antibody prevalence was associated with patients aged 45 years and older (aOR = 2.74; 95% CI, 2.69-2.80), testing in infetious disease hospitals (aOR = 2.33; 95% CI, 2.26-2.40) and secondary hospitals (aOR = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.69-1.75). Patients in sentinel hospitals of the Northeast (aOR = 12.75; 95% CI, 12.40-13.11), the Central (aOR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.61-1.70), and the West (aOR = 1.78; 95% CI, 1.73-1.83) China had higher HCV prevalence than those who were in the Eastern coastal area.Conclusion Those who were over 45 years old and saw doctors for liver diseases, and invasive diagnosis and treatment should be referred to HCV antibody testing.

TI  - Monitoring and Forecasting Green Tide in the Yellow Sea Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a semi-automatic green tide extraction method based on the NDVI to extract Yellow Sea green tides from 2008 to 2022 using remote sensing (RS) images from multiple satellites: GF-1, Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS, HJ-1A/B, HY-1C, and MODIS. The results of the accuracy assessment based on three indicators: Precision, Recall, and F1-score, showed that our extraction method can be applied to the images of most satellites and different environments. We traced the source of the Yellow Sea green tide to Jiangsu Subei shoal and the southeastern Yellow Sea and earliest advanced the tracing time to early April. The Gompertz and Logistic growth curve models were selected to predict and monitor the extent and duration of the Yellow Sea green tide, and uncertainty for the predicted growth curve was estimated. The prediction for 2022 was that its start and dissipation dates were expected to be June 1 and August 15, respectively, and the accumulative cover area was expected to be approximately 1190.90-1191.21 km(2).

TI  - Incorporation of Fused Remote Sensing Imagery to Enhance Soil Organic Carbon Spatial Prediction in an Agricultural Area in Yellow River Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To overcome spatial, spectral and temporal constraints of different remote sensing products, data fusion is a good technique to improve the prediction capability of soil prediction models. However, few studies have analyzed the effects of image fusion on digital soil mapping (DSM) models. This research fused multispectral (MS) and panchromatic Landsat 8 (L8) bands, and MS Sentinel 2 (S2) and panchromatic L8 bands using the Brovey, Intensity-Hue-Saturation and Gram-Schmidt methods in an agricultural area in Yellow River Basin, China. To analyze the effects of image fusion on DSM models, various SOC prediction models derived from remote sensing image datasets were established by the random forest method. Soil salinity indices and spectral reflectance from all the remote sensing data had relatively strong negative correlations with SOC, and vegetation indices and water indices from all the remote sensing data had relatively strong positive correlations with SOC. Soil moisture and vegetation were the main controlling factors of the SOC spatial pattern in the study area. More spectral indices derived from pansharpened L8 and fused S2-L8 images by all three image fusion methods had stronger relationships with SOC compared with those from MS L8 and MS S2, respectively. All the SOC models established by pansharpened L8 and fused S2-L8 images had higher prediction accuracy than those established by MS L8 and MS S2, respectively. The fusion between S2 and L8 bands had stronger effects on enhancing the prediction accuracy of SOC models compared with the fusion between panchromatic and MS L8 bands. It is concluded that digital soil mapping and image fusion can be utilized to increase the prediction performance of SOC spatial prediction models.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Variation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration and Its Relationship with Vegetation Landscape Patterns in Typical Economic Zones, China from 2000 to 2020
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the temporal and spatial variation of PM2.5 concentration and its relationship with the vegetation landscape pattern in China's three typical economic zones, which is of great significance for regional PM2.5 pollution control and atmospheric environmental protection. In this study, pixel binary model, Getis-Ord G(i)* analysis, Theil-Sen Median analysis, Mann-Kendall significance test, Pearson correlation analysis and multiple correlation analysis were used to explore the spatial cluster and spatio-temporal variation of PM2.5 and its correlation with the vegetation landscape index in the three economic zones of China on the basis of PM2.5 concentration data and MODIS NDVI data set. The results show that PM2.5 in the Bohai economic Rim are mainly dominated by the expansion of hot spots and the reduction of cold spots from 2000 to 2020. The proportion of cold spots and hot spots in the Yangtze River Delta showed insignificant changes. Both cold and hot spots in the Pearl River Delta had expanded. PM2.5 showed a downward trend in the three major economic zones from 2000 to 2020, and the magnitude of increasing rate are higher in the Pearl River Delta, followed by the Yangtze River Delta and Bohai economic Rim. From 2000 to 2020, PM2.5 exhibited a downward trend in the context of all vegetation coverage grades, and PM2.5 had most significantly improved with in extremely low vegetation coverage in the three economic zones. On the landscape scale, PM2.5 were mostly correlated with aggregation index in the Bohai Economic Rim, largest patch index in the Yangtze River Delta and Shannon's diversity in the Pearl River Delta, respectively. Under the context of different vegetation coverage level, PM2.5 showed highest correlation with aggregation index in the Bohai Economic Rim, landscape shape index in the Yangtze River Delta and percent of landscape in the Pearl River Delta, respectively. PM2.5 showed significant differences with vegetation landscape indices in the three economic zones. The combined effect of multiple vegetation landscape pattern indices on PM2.5 was stronger than that of single vegetation landscape pattern index. Above results indicated that the spatial cluster of PM2.5 in the three major economic zones had changed, and PM2.5 showed a decreasing trend in the three economic zones during the study period. The relationship between PM2.5 and vegetation landscape indices exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity in the three economic zones.

AB  - Leaf water content (LWC) is very important in the growth of vegetation. LWC and leaf spectra change when the leaves are under pest stress; exploring the change mechanism between LWC, leaf spectra, and pest stress can lay the foundation for pest detection. In this study, we measured the LWC and leaf spectra of moso bamboo leaves under different damage levels, used the Pearson-Lasso method to screen the features, and established a multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest regression (RFR) model to estimate the LWC. We analyzed the relationship between LWC and spectral features of moso bamboo leaves under Pantana phyllostachysae Chao (PPC) stress and their changes. The results showed that: (1) the LWC showed a decreasing trend as the pest level increased. (2) The spectra changed substantially when the leaves were under pest stress. (3) The number and significance of response features associated with the LWC were diverse under different damage levels. (4) The estimation of LWC under different damage levels differed significantly. LWC, leaf spectra, response features, and the model estimation effect were diverse under different damage levels. The correlation between LWC and features was higher for healthy leaves than for damaged and off-year leaves. The two models were more effective in estimating the LWC of healthy leaves but less effective for damaged and off-year leaves. This study provides theoretical support for the prediction of PPC stress and lays the foundation for remote sensing monitoring.

TI  - NDVI-Based Vegetation Dynamics and Response to Climate Changes and Human Activities in Guizhou Province, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Guizhou Province is a typical representative karst region in China, with poverty and a fragile ecology, and knowledge of vegetation dynamics and its response to climate changes and human activities can provide basic information for ecological environmental resource management. Based on MOD13Q1 NDVI remote sensing products and meteorological data, spatial-temporal variations of NDVI in Guizhou Province from 2000 to 2021 were investigated using trend analysis, a coefficient of variation and the Hurst index. Simultaneously, the response to climate change and human activities was also explored using partial correlation and residual analysis. It was concluded that, firstly, the regional average NDVI in Guizhou Province displays a significant improving trend, with a rate of 0.056/10a from 2000 to 2021. NDVI in Guizhou Province displays notable spatial heterogeneity, with high values mainly concentrated in forests and woody savanna regions in eastern and northwestern Guizhou and low values distributed in croplands and rapid urban expansion regions in western and central Guizhou. In addition, the overall spatial distribution of NDVI displays an upward trend, and the area of extreme and light significant improvement accounts for 81.0% of Guizhou total area. Secondly, the NDVI variation in Guizhou Province is relatively stable and the area of lower-to-moderate fluctuation accounts for 90.1% of Guizhou total area; meanwhile, the future trend of NDVI variation in Guizhou is largely sustainable. Thirdly, the NDVI variations in Guizhou are more strongly influenced by air temperature than precipitation; meanwhile, compared to climatic factors, human activities have a stronger impact on vegetation dynamics in Guizhou Province. Fourthly, the trend, stability, sustainability and relationship with climatic factors and human activities of NDVI variations are varied among different vegetation types. These results will provide valuable information for ecosystem restoration and environment protection in Guizhou Province.

TI  - Accuracy of pixel-based classification: application of different algorithms to landscapes of Western Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Scenarios for monitoring land cover on a large scale, involving large volumes of data, are becoming more prevalent in remote sensing applications. The accuracy of algorithms is important for environmental monitoring and assessments. Because they performed equally well throughout the various research regions and required little human involvement during the categorization process, they appear to be resilient and accurate for automated, big area change monitoring. Malekshahi City is one of the important and at the same time critical areas in terms of land use change and forest area reduction in Ilam Province. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the accuracy of nine different methods for identifying land use types in Malekshahi City located in Western Iran. Results revealed that the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm with back-propagation algorithms could reach the highest accuracy and efficiency among the other methods with kappa coefficient and overall accuracy of approximately 0.94 and 96.5, respectively. Then, with an overall accuracy of about 91.35 and 90.0, respectively, the methods of Mahalanobis distance (MD) and minimum distance to mean (MDM) were introduced as the next priority to categorize land use. Further investigation of the classified land use showed that good results can be provided about the area of the land use classes of the region by applying the ANN algorithm due to high accuracy. According to those results, it can be concluded that this method is the best algorithm to extract land use maps in Malekshahi City because of high accuracy.

TI  - Effects of Directional Wave Spectra on the Modeling of Ocean Radar Backscatter at Various Azimuth Angles by a Modified Two-Scale Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the ocean backscatter at various azimuth angles is critical to the radar detection of the ocean environment. In this study, the modified two-scale model (TSM), which introduces a correction term in the conventional TSM, is improved based on the empirical model, CMOD5.n. Then, the influences of different directional wave spectra on the prediction of azimuthal behavior of ocean radar backscatter are investigated by comparing the simulated results with CMOD5.n and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) measurements. The results show that the overall performance of the single spectra of D, A, E, and H18 and the composite spectra of AH18 and AEH18 in predicting ocean backscatter are different at different wind speeds and incidence angles. Generally, the AH18 spectrum has better performance at low and moderate wind speeds, while the A spectrum works better at high wind speed. Nevertheless, the wave spectra have little effect on the prediction of the azimuthal fluctuation of scattering, which is highly dependent on the directional spreading function. The relative patterns of azimuthal undulation produced by different spreading functions are rather different at different wind speeds, but similar under different incidence angles. The Gaussian spreading function generally has better performance in predicting the azimuthal fluctuation of scattering.

TI  - Application of Synthetic DINCAE-BME Spatiotemporal Interpolation Framework to Reconstruct Chlorophyll-a from Satellite Observations in the Arabian Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is an indicator of phytoplankton pigment, which is associated with the health of marine ecosystems. A commonly used method for the determination of Chl-a is satellite remote sensing. However, due to cloud cover, sun glint and other issues, remote sensing data for Chl-a are always missing in large areas. We reconstructed the Chl-a data from MODIS and VIIRS in the Arabian Sea within the geographical range of 12-28 degrees N and 56-76 degrees E from 2020 to 2021 by combining the Data Interpolating Convolutional Auto-Encoder (DINCAE) and the Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) methods, which we named the DINCAE-BME framework. The hold-out validation method was used to assess the DINCAE-BME method's performance. The root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and the mean-absolute-error (MAE) values for the hold-out cross-validation result obtained by the DINCAE-BME were 1.8824 mg m(-3) and 0.4682 mg m(-3), respectively; compared with in situ Chl-a data, the RMSE and MAE values for the DINCAE-BME-generated Chl-a product were 0.6196 mg m(-3) and 0.3461 mg m(-3), respectively. Moreover, DINCAE-BME exhibited better performance than the DINEOF and DINCAE methods. The spatial distribution of the Chl-a product showed that Chl-a values in the coastal region were the highest and the Chl-a values in the deep-sea regions were stable, while the Chl-a values in February and March were higher than in other months. Lastly, this study demonstrated the feasibility of combining the BME method and DINCAE.

TI  - Image Super-resolution Methods for FY-3E X-EUVI 195 Å Solar Images
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar eruptions and the solar wind are sources of space weather disturbances, and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) observations are widely used to research solar activity and space weather forecasts. Fengyun-3E is equipped with the Solar X-ray and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager, which can observe EUV imaging data. Limited by the lower resolution, however, we research super-resolution techniques to improve the data quality. Traditional image interpolation methods have limited expressive ability, while deep-learning methods can learn to reconstruct high-quality images through training on paired data sets. There is a wide variety of super-resolution models. We try these three representative models: Real-ESRGAN combined with generative adversarial networks, residual channel-attention networks (RCAN) based on channel attention, and SwinIR, based on self-attention. Instruments on different satellites differ in observation time, angle, and resolution, so we selected Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) 193 angstrom images with similar wavelengths as a reference and used a feature-based method for image registration to eliminate slight deformations to build training data sets. Finally, we compare the above methods in their evaluation metrics and visual quality. RCAN has the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity evaluation. Real-ESRGAN model is the best in the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity index, and its results visually show that it has more highly detailed textures. The corrected super-resolution results can complement the SDO/AIA data to provide solar EUV images with a higher temporal resolution for space weather forecasting and solar physics research.

TI  - Landslide Identification in Human-Modified Alpine and Canyon Area of the Niulan River Basin Based on SBAS-InSAR and Optical Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide identification in alpine and canyon areas is difficult due to the terrain limitations. The main objective of this research was to explore the method of combining small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR), multi-temporal optical images and field surveys to identify potential landslides in the human-modified alpine and canyon area of the Niulan River in southwestern China based on terrain visibility analysis. The visibility of the terrain is analyzed using the different incident and heading angles of the Sentinel satellite's ascending and descending orbits. Based on the SAR image data of Sentinel-1A satellites from 2016 to 2019, the SBAS-InSAR method was used to identify landslides, and then multi-temporal optical images were used to facilitate landslide identification. Field surveys were carried out to verify the identification accuracy. A total of 28 landslides were identified, including 13 indicated by SBAS-InSAR, 8 by optical imaging and 7 by field investigation. Many landslides were induced by the impoundment and fluctuation of reservoir water. The comparison and verification of typical landslide monitoring data and reservoir water fluctuations revealed that a sudden drop of reservoir water had a great influence on landslide stability. These research results can facilitate a comprehensive understanding of landslide distribution in the reservoir area and guide the follow-up landslide risk management.

TI  - Monitoring and Assessing of Biodiversity in China Based on Multispectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity is the basis of human survival. Affected by the environment and climate change, the decrease in global biodiversity is becoming increasingly serious. Therefore, the study of regional biodiversity has great significance in protecting endangered species' habitat, planning and utilising the regional resources reasonably. Three dynamic habitat indices (DHI) of cumulative, minimum and difference were constructed by datasets of NDVI, EVI, FPAR, LAI and GPP of multispectral remote sensing vegetation products from 2002 to 2018. The multiple regression analysis was used to study (1) the applicability of DHIs constructed by different multispectral remote sensing indices (NDVI, EVI, FPAR, LAI and GPP); (2)the complementarity of species diversity expressed by cumulative, minimum and difference DHI models; (3)the impact of climate change on biodiversity in China; (4) the ability of cumulative, minimum and difference DHIs to express species richness. The research shows that (1) there is a strong correlation between corresponding DHIs based on the same MODIS multispectral vegetation indices (correlation coefficient from 0. 77 to 0. 98), so they can substitute for each other; There is a certain correlation among these three DHIs, while they cannot replace each other. (2)Compared with DHIs constructed by NDVI, EVI, FPAR and LAI product data, GPP-DHIs have the strongest ability to monitor biodiversity in China and have a good correlation with species richness (correlation coefficient from 0.32 to 0.84). (3) Continuous climate change will affect the total productivity of vegetation significantly in the large region, and extreme climate has little impact on the large region; Evapotranspiration has a more significant impact on the total productivity of vegetation in large - scale regions than temperature, and precipitation. (4) Environmental change has the greatest impact on amphibian species richness, followed by birds and mammals. (5) The cumulative DHI and minimum DHI in China gradually increase from the northwest inland to the southeast coastal area. The minimum DHI in the northwest, north China, high altitude area, high latitudes, and northwest desert areas are very small, which indicate the ecological environment in the southeast coastal area is more suitable for biological survival, and the harsh environment affects biodiversity seriously. The difference in DHI shows a higher spatial pattern in Northeast and North China, and a lower spatial pattern in Central and South China, which indicates that the living environment of species in Northeast and North China changed greatly, and the living environment of species in Central and South China was relatively stable.

TI  - Centroid Extraction of Laser Spots Captured by Infrared Detectors Combining Laser Footprint Images and Detector Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On-orbit geometric calibration of satellite-borne laser based on infrared detectors is the key tool to ensure the elevation measurement accuracy, and the accuracy of on-orbit geometric calibration is directly determined by laser spots captured by detectors. Mathematical methods, such as gray-scale barycenter, are widely applied for centroid extraction of spots captured by infrared detectors and completely depend on the energy values at points measured by detectors, which have low precision and are greatly affected by the consistency of the detectors and other factors at present. Based on the above question, considering the consistency between the real laser footprint shape and spot captured by detectors, a centroid extraction method of laser spots captured by infrared detectors combining laser footprint images and detector observation data is proposed for making up this defect to some extent. First, the self-adaptive "two-step method" is used to denoise footprint images hierarchically to obtain the real shape of footprints for constraining the spots captured by detectors, and then the centroids of spots are extracted by using the energy-weighted barycenter method based on regional blocks. In the experiment, Gaofen-7 (GF-7) satellite is taken as the research object, and the proposed method, as well as the other six methods, are used for the centroid extraction of laser spots captured by detectors, the calculation of calibration parameters based on the single-beam and dual-beam laser calibration models, the positioning of laser footprints, and cross verification. According to the results, the plane accuracy of centroid extraction using the proposed method is as follows: 0.34 grids for Beam 1 and 0.33 grids for Beam 2. In addition, on flat terrain, the elevation accuracy of Beam 1 and Beam 2 in 2021 is 5.2 cm and 5.0 cm, respectively, 0.6 cm and 4.2 cm higher than those in the most accurate one among other methods; the elevation accuracy in 2020 is 23.3 cm and 7.1 cm, respectively, 7.7 cm and 2.7 cm higher than those in the most accurate one among other methods. On slopes and gentle slopes, the method proposed is also superior to other methods. Since the change of pointing angle caused by satellite jitter, atmosphere, etc., between different years, the accuracy drops when laser footprints of 2020 are located using the parameters of 2021. In summary, under different terrains and years, the results fully demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method, which has more significant advantages than other traditional methods.

TI  - Dynamics of Forest Vegetation in an Urban Agglomeration Based on Landsat Remote Sensing Data for the Period 1990-2022: A Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the vegetation cover in urban agglomerations has been changing very rapidly due to technogenic influence. Satellite images play a huge role in studying the dynamics of forest vegetation. Special programs are used to process satellite images. The purpose of the study is to analyze forest vegetation within the territory of the Tomsk agglomeration based on Landsat remote sensing data for the period from 1990 to 2022. The novelty of the study is explained by the development of a unique program code for the analysis of Landsat satellite data on the previously unexplored territory of the Tomsk agglomeration with the prospect of moving to the scale of the entire state in the future. In this study, the authors present an algorithm implemented in Python to quantify the change in the area of vegetation in an urban agglomeration using Landsat multispectral data. The tool allows you to read space images, calculate spectral indices (NDVI, UI, NDWI), and perform statistical processing of interpretation results. The created tool was applied to study the dynamics of vegetation within the Tomsk urban agglomeration during the period 1990-2022. Key findings and conclusions: (1) The non-forest areas increased from 1990 to 1999 and from 2013 to 2022. It is very likely that this is due to the deterioration of the standard of living in the country during these periods. The first time interval corresponds to the post-Soviet period and the devastation in the economy in the 1990s. The second period corresponds to the implementation and strengthening of sanctions pressure on the Russian Federation. (2) The area of territories inhabited by people has been steadily falling since 1990. This is due to the destruction of collective agriculture in the Russian Federation and the outflow of the population from the surrounding rural settlements to Tomsk and Seversk.

TI  - Runoff Response to Climate in Two River Basins Supplied by Small Glacier Meltwater in Southern and Northern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has experienced amplified warming in recent decades, causing glaciers to melt and affecting river runoff. It is well established that the southern and northern areas of the TP have responded to climate changes differently, with the north dominated by a westerly climate and the south by the Indian monsoon. While there are more glaciers in the TP than in any other region outside the polar areas, most of these glaciers are tiny, and only a limited number of them have been monitored to study mass balance and downward runoff. This study used the mass balance measured at two glaciers along with in situ and satellite data to drive a hydrological model called the Alpine Runoff Predictor that includes glacier melt to simulate glacial melting and the accompanying hydrological processes of the two glacierized basins, analyze their contributions to the river runoffs, and investigate their responses to local climate changes. The results show that the glacier meltwater in both river basins showed an increasing trend, with values of 0.001 x 10(8) m(3) a(-1) in the Kyanjing River basin and 0.0095 x 10(8) m(3) a(-1) in the Tuole River basin. However, their multi-year average contributions to the runoff were 12.5% and 5.6%, respectively. In contrast to the Tuole River basin, where runoff is increasing (0.0617 x 10(8) m(3) a(-1)), the Kyanjing River basin has decreasing runoff (-0.0216 x 10(8) m(3) a(-1)) as a result of decreasing precipitation. This result highlights the dominant role played by precipitation changes in the two basins under study, which are characterized by small glacier meltwater contributions.

TI  - DSM Extraction Based on Gaofen-6 Satellite High-Resolution Cross-Track Images with Wide Field of View
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital Surface Model (DSM) is a three-dimensional model presenting the elevation of the Earth's surface, which can be obtained by the along-track or cross-track stereo images of optical satellites. This paper investigates the DSM extraction method using Gaofen-6 (GF-6) high-resolution (HR) cross-track images with a wide field of view (WFV). To guarantee the elevation accuracy, the relationship between the intersection angle and the overlap of the cross-track images was analyzed. Cross-track images with 20-40% overlaps could be selected to conduct DSM extraction. First, the rational function model (RFM) based on error compensation was used to realize the accurate orientation of the image. Then, the disparity map was generated based on the semi-global block matching (SGBM) algorithm with epipolar constraint. Finally, the DSM was generated by forward intersection. The GF-6 HR cross-track images with about 30% overlap located in Taian, Shandong Province, China, were used for DSM extraction. The results show that the mountainous surface elevation features were retained completely, and the details, such as houses and roads, were presented in valleys and urban areas. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the extracted DSM could reach 6.303 m, 12.879 m, 14.929 m, and 19.043 m in valley, ridge, urban, and peak areas, respectively. The results indicate that the GF-6 HR cross-track images with a certain overlap can be used to extract a DSM to enhance its application in land cover monitoring.

TI  - Detection of Plastic Greenhouses by Using Deep Learning Model for Aerial Orthoimages
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The remotely sensed data, such as satellite imagery and aerial photos, can be used to extract and detect some objects in the image through image interpretation and processing techniques. Significantly, the possibility for utilizing digital map updating and land monitoring has been increased through automatic object detection since spatial resolution of remotely sensed data has improved and technologies about deep learning have been developed. In this paper, we tried to extract plastic greenhouses into aerial orthophotos by using fully convolutional densely connected convolutional network (FC-DenseNet), one of the representative deep learning models for semantic segmentation. Then, a quantitative analysis of extraction results had performed. Using the farm map of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs in Korea, training data was generated by labeling plastic greenhouses into Damyang and Miryang areas. And then, FC-DenseNet was trained through a training dataset. To apply the deep learning model in the remotely sensed imagery, instance norm, which can maintain the spectral characteristics of bands, was used as normalization. In addition, optimal weights for each band were determined by adding attention modules in the deep learning model. In the experiments, it was found that a deep learning model can extract plastic greenhouses. These results can be applied to digital map updating of Farm-map and landcover maps.

TI  - Silicon Calcium Fertilizer Application and Foliar Spraying with Silicon Fertilizer Decreases Cadmium Uptake and Translocation in Rice Grown in Polluted Soil
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice cultivated in Cd-polluted acidic paddy soil poses important health risks in China. Decreasing Cd accumulation in rice is important for food safety and human health. Early rice cultivar ZY-819 and late rice cultivar XWX-13 with low Cd-accumulation potentials, and early rice cultivar LY-996 and late rice cultivar YZX with high Cd-accumulation potentials, were grown in mildly polluted double-cropping paddy fields (Cd content 0.3-0.6 mg kg(-1)). The effects of adding biochar (10 t ha(-2)), lime (1500 kg ha(-2)), and silicon-calcium fertilizer (SC; 2250 kg ha(-2)) and foliar spraying with silicon fertilizer solution (Si; 1500 g ha(-2)) on Cd uptake and transport in rice, were assessed in plot experiments. The soil amendments and foliar spraying decreased the Cd content of brown rice from the high Cd-accumulation potential cultivars. The soil amendments decreased the Cd content of LY-996 and YZX brown rice by 25.24-32.40% and 32.99-44.16%, respectively, and SC decreased the Cd content most. Foliar spraying with Si decreased the Cd content of LY-996 and YZC brown rice by 23.79% and 26.40%, respectively. When soil amendments and foliar spraying were combined, the Cd content of brown rice was decreased most by the SC-Si treatment. Compared with the control, the SC-Si treatment decreased the Cd content of LY-996, ZY-819, YZX, and XWX-13 brown rice by 45.63%, 35.67%, 52.79%, and 32.03%, respectively. Soil amendments can effectively decrease Cd uptake by rice roots and Cd migration from roots to shoots. Compared with the control, the soil amendments increased the soil pH and decreased Cd availability. The strongest effects were for the lime and SC treatments. Foliar spraying with Si can effectively decrease Cd translocation through stems and leaves to brown rice. Applying SC fertilizer and foliar spraying with Si is the best method for decreasing the Cd content of rice grown in mildly Cd-polluted paddy fields.

TI  - Diverse changes in shipping emissions around the Western Pacific ports under the coeffect of the epidemic and fuel oil policy
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Western Pacific Ocean (the WPO), as one of the busiest shipping areas in the world, holds a complex water traffic net-work. In 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) low-sulfur fuel regulations were implemented globally, while the COVID-19 outbreak influenced shipping activities together. This study aimed to assess the combined impact of epidemics and low-sulfur fuel policies on ship emissions, as well as their environmental effects on the WPO. The ship emis-sion model based on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data was applied to analyze the monthly emission variations during 2018-2020. It was found that the epidemic had obvious diverse influences on the coastal ports in the WPO. Overall, shipping emissions declined by 15 %-30 % in the first half of 2020 compared with those in 2019 due to the COVID-19 lock -down, whereas they rebounded in the second half as a result of trade recovery. The pollutants discharged per unit of cargo by ships rose after the large-range lockdown. China's multiphase domestic emission control areas (DECAs) and the IMO global low-sulfur fuel regulation have greatly reduced SO2 emissions from ships and caused them to "bypass and come back" to save fuel costs around emission control areas from 2018 to 2020. Based on satellite data and land-based measure-ments, it was found that the air quality over sea water and coastal cities has shown a positive response to changes in ship -emitted NOx and SO2. Our results reveal that changes in shipping emissions during typical periods, depending on their niches in the complex port traffic network, call for further efforts for cleaner fuel oils, optimized ECA and ship lane coordination in the future. Shipping related air pollutions during the later economic recovery also needs to be addressed after international scale standing-by events.

TI  - Exploiting JECAM Database for Agriculture Land Cover Classification of Antsirabe Site Using Sentinel 2 Imagery with Deep Learning
T2  - TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Zero hunger, the goal 2 of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), can only be achieved when food is available, affordable and accessible to the people. Food insecurity, a phenomenon where either or all of these ingredients for zero hunger are absent, remains a critical global issue that warrants coordinated strategies at regional scale; most especially for crop farming which serves as the major source of food for most humans. Therefore, efficient Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification is a pivotal tool in the development of apposite strategies for combating food insecurity. Open satellite missions like Sentinel 2 offer a cost effective way for acquiring regional imagery dataset for LULC classification; however, the relevance of such dataset is dependent on the quality of ground truth data from which the imagery dataset is created. Qualitative ground truth data are usually obtained through ground surveys which come at extra costs, warranting the need for elaborate community ground truth geo-database constructed from joint ground surveys. Such database is absent in the tropical belt that is mostly made up of developing countries where higher impacts of food insecurity are experienced. This remained the case, until recently when JECAM (Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring) database was developed for six countries in the tropical belt. JECAM database is an elaborate geo-database that consists of 27,074 agricultural LULC polygons (20,257 crops and 6,817 non crops). In this study, we built three deep learning models for agricultural LULC classification using the entire 13 bands of the satellite imagery dataset. Class-based performance evaluation metrics were used to evaluate the performances of the deep learning models on test set. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model exhibited the highest capability for LULC class discrimination, followed by 2D-CNN (2 Dimension Convolution Neural Network) Autoencoder model, then the 2D-CNN model. In the future, we intend to exploit spectral indices and transfer learning paradigm to address class imbalance problem, which is inherent in the imagery dataset, for improved LULC class discrimination.

TI  - Impact of Urbanization on Groundwater and Surface Temperature Changes: A Case Study of Lahore City
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The over-exploitation of groundwater resources is a significant concern due to the potential risks associated with the depletion of this valuable freshwater source. Future planning must consider changes in groundwater availability and urban expansion which are critical for understanding urban growth patterns. This study aims to investigate the impact of land cover change on groundwater depletion. Further, the Land surface temperature (LST) analysis has been performed to find the spatial spread of urbanization and its impact on surface temperature. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data for groundwater storage monitoring and Landsat data for land cover and LST mapping have been used. The GRACE-based Groundwater Storage (GWS) anomaly has been correlated with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)-based precipitation data. The GWS is further cross validated with the groundwater monitoring stations in the study area and the correlation of 0.7 is found. The time series analysis of GWS and the land cover maps with a decadal interval from 1990 to 2020 has been developed to find the impact of groundwater change due to urbanization. The results demonstrate a rapid increase in groundwater depletion and urbanization rates over the past decade. The LST spatial pattern is increasing similarly with the study area's urban expansion, indicating the temperature rise due to urbanization. The study highlights the limitation of effective policies to regulate groundwater extraction in urban areas and the importance of proper planning to ensure the long-term sustainability of freshwater resources.

TI  - Assessment and Forecast of Shoreline Change Using Geo-Spatial Techniques in the Gulf of California
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In coastal regions, the combined effects of natural processes, human activity, and climate change have caused shoreline changes that may increase in the future. The assessment of these changes is essential for forecasting their future position for proper management. In this context, shoreline changes in the Gulf of California (GC), Mexico, have received little attention and no previous studies have addressed future forecasting. In this study, the researchers assessed the historical shoreline changes to forecast the long-term shoreline positions. To address this, shoreline data were obtained from Landsat satellite images for the years 1981, 1993, 2004, 2010, and 2020. The Net Shoreline Movement (NSM), Linear Regression Rate (LRR), End Point Rate (EPR), and Weighted Linear Regression (WLR) geo-spatial techniques were applied to estimate the shoreline change rate by using a Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) in the GIS environment. A Kalman filter model was used to forecast the position of the shoreline for the years 2030 and 2050. The results show that approximately 72% of the GC shoreline is undergoing steady erosion, and this trend is continuing in the future. This study has provided valuable and comprehensive baseline information on the state of the shoreline in the GC that can guide coastal engineers, coastal managers, and policymakers in Mexico to manage the risk. It also provides both long-term and large-scale continuous datasets that are essential for future studies focused on improving the shoreline forecast models.

TI  - Geological Controls and Prospectivity Mapping for Manganese Ore Deposits Using Predictive Modeling Comparison: An Integration of Outcrop and Remote Sensing Data, Sinai Microplate, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most controversial minerals in their origin and occurrence around the world is manganese deposits. The Abu Zenima area is rated one of the most economically important places where manganese ore deposits (Mn ODs) are located in the southwest Sinai microplate, Egypt. These deposits are confined with the Um Bogma Formation (UBF) and the reserves of this region are relatively small. In this study, optical and radar data are used in a new challenge as an attempt to reach the closest controls and setting of Mn ODs. Moreover, Frequency Ratio (FR) and Logistic Regression (LogR) predictive models are applied to integrate different geospatial thematic maps, to predict new potential resource zones for increasing the ranges of mining quarries. Landsat8 OLI, Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument and Radar (Sentinel-1B) data are combined for mapping Mn ODs locations and their relationship with geological structures and the surrounding rocks. Band ratio, Principal and Independent Component Analysis techniques and four classification algorithms were implemented to the optical' VNIR and SWIR bands. Unusually, the interferometric processing steps for Sentinel-1 data were made for understanding the tectonic features in the area. The FR and LogR models are validated during fieldwork with known Mn ODs locations. Results indicate that processed images are capable of differentiation of UBF which broadly distributed in the central and southern parts of the area. Mn ODs possibly formed by thermal events that attributed to paleo-volcanic events before the rift stage. The high accuracy of Log R model (0.902) suggests that high Mn ODs potential zones are identified within the intersected fault zones near granitic units. This integration is recommended for discriminating hydrothermally Mn ODs in other arid geographic regions.

TI  - Cloud shadow removal for optical satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An improved cloud shadow removal algorithm for high spatial resolution optical satellite data over land is presented. The method is based on the matched filter method, which consists of the calculation of a covariance matrix and the corresponding zero-reflectance matched filter vector and the computation of the shadow function. The new additions consist of the usage of an improved cloud shadow map and further evaluations performed on the shadow function. The performance of the cloud shadow removal algorithm incorporated in the software package Python-based atmospheric correction (PACO) is compared to the deshadowing algorithm in atmospheric correction on a set of 25 Sentinel-2 scenes distributed over the globe covering a wide variety of environments and climates. Furthermore, an evaluation of the relative ratio between clear and shadow pixels with and without deshadowing is performed. The visual, spectral, and statistical results show that the new additions performed on the deshadowing algorithm can improve the cloud shadow removal performance used so far.

TI  - Progressive Dynamic Registration Method for Tile Maps Based on Optimum Multi-Features
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Different tile maps may use different coordinate systems, and it is difficult to superimpose maps from different sources. In this regard, we propose a progressive dynamic registration (PDR) method based on optimum features extracted from images of tile map screenshots of a certain scale. Using this method, we can automatically register maps in roughly the same area from different sources without knowing the map project information. The better features among feature points and feature surfaces are selected for image registration based on the richness of the features in the map, and a new matching filter that combines the characteristics of the tile map and the features is proposed. In the progressive registration process during map zooming, the result of the adjacent scales are used as reference values for coarse registration. After experimental verification in different areas, the root mean square error of PDR is below 2.5 in different maps and is better than that of the registration method using feature points only. Moreover, the registration accuracies of remote sensing maps in all areas and vector maps in nonurban areas are better than that of the method based on coordinate system transformation. The calculation results of PDR can register not only the tile maps but also other nontiled vector or remote sensing data.

TI  - Sulfur dioxide may predominate in the adverse effects of ambient air pollutants on semen quality among the general population in Hefei, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have reported potential adverse effects of exposure to ambient air pollutants on semen quality in infertile men, but studies on the general population have been limited and inconsistent, and the pollutants that play a major role remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential association between exposure to six air pollut-ants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3 and CO) during different sperm development periods and semen quality among the general population, and to explore the interaction between different air pollutant exposures. We included 1515 semen samples collected from the Human Sperm Bank. We improved individuals' exposure level estimation by com-bining inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation with satellite remote sensing data. Multivariate linear regres -si on models, restricted cubic spline functions and double-pollutant models were used to assess the relationship between exposure to six air pollutants and sperm volume, concentration, total sperm number and sperm motility. A negative association was found between SO2 exposure and progressive motility and total motility during 0-90 lag days and 70-90 lag days, and SO2 exposure during 10-14 lag days adversely affected sperm concentration and total sperm number. Sensitive analyses for qualified sperm donors and the double-pollutant models obtained similar results. Additionally, there were nonlinear relationships between exposure to PM, NO2, O3, CO and a few semen parameters, with NO2 and O3 exposure above the threshold showing negative correlations with total motility and progressive motility, respectively. Our study suggested that SO2 may play a dominant role in the adverse effects of ambient air pollutants on semen quality in the general population by decreasing sperm motility, sperm concentration and total sperm number. Also, even SO2 exposure lower than the recommended standards of the World Health Organization (WHO) could still cause male reproductive toxicity, which deserves attention.

TI  - Identifying Driving Factors and Their Interacting Effects on Sources of Heavy Metal in Farmland Soils with Geodetector and Multi-source Data
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of heavy metal sources in farmland soils is essential for the rational health condition management and sustainable development of soil. Using source resolution results(source component spectrum and source contribution)of a positive matrix factorization(PMF)model, historical survey data, and time-series remote sensing data, integrating a geodetector(GD), an optimal parameters-based geographical detector(OPGD), a spatial association detector(SPADE), and an interactive detector for spatial associations(IDSA)model, this study explored the modifiable areal unit problem(MAUP) of spatial heterogeneity of soil heavy metal sources and identified the driving factors and their interacting effects on the spatial heterogeneity of soil heavy metal sources in categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The results showed that the spatial heterogeneity of soil heavy metal sources at small and medium scales was affected by the spatial scale, and the optional spatial unit was 0.08 km2 for detecting spatial heterogeneity of soil heavy metal sources in the study region. Considering spatial correlation and discretization level, the combination of the quantile method and discretization parameters with an interruption number of 10 could be implied to reduce the partitioning effects on continuous variables in the detection of spatial heterogeneity of soil heavy metal sources. Within categorical variables, strata(PD 0.12-0.48) controlled the spatial heterogeneity of soil heavy metal sources, the interaction between strata and watersheds explained 27.28%-60.61% of each source, and the high-risk areas of each source were distributed in the lower sinian system, upper cretaceous in strata, mining land in land use, and haplic acrisols in soil types. Within continuous variables, population (PSD 0.40-0.82) controlled the spatial variation in soil heavy metal sources, and the explanatory power of spatial combinations of continuous variables for each source ranged from 61.77% to 78.46%. The high-risk areas of each source were distributed in evapotranspiration (41.2-43 kg center dot m(-2)), distance from the river (315-398 m), enhanced vegetation index (0.796-0.995), and distance from the river (499-605 m). The results of this study provide a reference for the research of the drivers of heavy metal sources and their interactions in arable soils and provide an important scientific basis for the management of arable soil and its sustainable development in karst areas.

TI  - Deriving Sea Subsurface Temperature Fields From Satellite Remote Sensing Data Using a Generative Adversarial Network Model
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately inverting global and regional subsurface temperature (ST) by multisource satellite observations is a challenging but hot topic. This study proposes a new method to invert daily ST from the sea surface information in China's marginal seas based on generative adversarial network (GAN) model. The proposed GAN-based model can project the STs from sea surface information (SLA, SSTA, SST) with a high resolution of 1/12 degrees. A traditional regression-based model, Modular Ocean Data Assimilation System (MODAS), is set up same experiments for comparison. The results show that the averaged root mean square error results are less than 1.45 degrees C in the upper 200 m and the highest averaged R-2 of 0.97 at the 70 m level, which is better than that of MODAS. Errors analysis and typical oceanographic phenomena analysis results show the superiority of the proposed GAN-based model in this study. This study can provide high-precision daily ST data from sea surface information, which can be expanded to further studies on the interior ocean variation characteristics.

TI  - Streamflow Prediction in Poorly Gauged Watersheds in the United States Through Data-Driven Sparse Sensing
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many rivers and streams are ungauged or poorly gauged and predicting streamflow in such watersheds is challenging. Although streamflow signals result from processes with different frequencies, they can be "sparse" or have a "lower-dimensional" representation in a transformed feature space. In such cases, if this appropriate feature space can be identified from streamflow data in gauged watersheds by dimensionality reduction, streamflow in poorly gauged watersheds can be predicted with a few measurements taken. This study utilized this framework, named data-driven sparse sensing (DSS), to predict daily-scale streamflow in 543 watersheds across the contiguous United States. A tailored library of features was extracted from streamflow training data in watersheds within the same climatic region, and this feature space was used to reconstruct streamflow in poorly gauged watersheds and identify the optimal timings for measurement. Among different regions, streamflow in snowmelt-dominated and baseflow-dominated watersheds (e.g., Rocky Mountains) was more effectively predicted with fewer streamflow measurements taken. The prediction efficiency in some rainfall-dominated regions, for example, New England and the Pacific coast, increased significantly with an increasing number of measurements. The spatial variability of prediction efficiency can be attributed to the process-driven mechanisms and the dimensionality of watershed dynamics. Storage-dominated systems are lower-dimensional and more predictable than rainfall-dominated systems. Measurements taken during periods with large streamflow magnitudes and/or variances are more informative and lead to better predictions. This study demonstrates that DSS can be an especially useful technique to integrate ground-based measurements with remotely sensed data for streamflow prediction, sensor placement, and watershed classification.

TI  - Spatial Pattern Evolution and Driving Mechanism of Rural Settlements in Rapidly Urbanized Areas: A Case Study of Jiangning District in Nanjing City, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural settlement is an important part of studying the relationship between humans and land; it is highly significant in revealing the evolution, driving mechanism and reconstruction scheme of rural settlement pattern. In this paper, Jiangning District, a rapidly urbanized area, was selected as a typical case. Using remote sensing image data, the landscape pattern index, the rank-scale law, the local hot spot-detection model, and the geographical-detector were comprehensively used to analyze the rural settlements pattern evolution and driving mechanism in the rapidly urbanized areas. The results are as follows: (1) From 2010 to 2020, the number of rural settlements showed a trend of large-scale reduction, and the settlements scale system was relatively uniform in Jiangning. The settlements scale had the autocorrelation characteristics of spatial agglomeration, and the local hotspot agglomeration pattern was significant. (2) The spatial distribution of rural settlements in Jiangning showed an "agglomeration" pattern, and the settlements density showed a "multi-core" distribution characteristic. (3) The pattern of rural settlements in Jiangning was shaped by natural environmental factors such as topography, water system and cultivated land resources; economic social factors such as agricultural population, per capita GDP, distance from town, and policy and system were the leading factors that promoted the settlements' pattern evolution in Jiangning, and the interaction between the factors could enhance the interpretation of the settlements' pattern evolution. The research can provide a reference for optimizing the spatial layout of settlements in rapidly urbanized areas.

TI  - Detecting the Spatiotemporal Variation of Vegetation Phenology in Northeastern China Based on MODIS NDVI and Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Dataset
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is a crucial biological indicator for monitoring changes in terrestrial ecosystems and global climate. Currently, there are limitations in using traditional vegetation indices for phenology monitoring (e.g., greenness saturation in high-density vegetation areas). Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), a novel remote sensing product, has great potential in depicting seasonal vegetation dynamics across various regions with different vegetation covers and latitudes. In this study, based on the GOSIF and MODIS NDVI data from 2001 to 2020, we extracted vegetation phenological parameters in Northeastern China by using Double Logistic (D-L) fitting function and the dynamic threshold method. Then, we analyzed the discrepancy in phenological period and temporal trend derived from SIF and NDVI data at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Furthermore, we explored the response of vegetation phenology to climate change and the persistence of phenological trends (Hurst exponent) in Northeastern China. Generally, there is a significant difference in trends between SIF and NDVI, but with similar spatial patterns of phenology. However, the dates of key phenological parameters are distinct based on SIF and MODIS NDVI data. Specifically, the start of season (SOS) of SIF started later (about 10 days), and the end of season (EOS) ended earlier (about 36 days on average). In contrast, the fall attenuation of SIF showed a lag process compared to NDVI. This implies that the actual period of photosynthesis, that is, length of season (LOS), was shorter (by 46 days on average) than the greenness index. The position of peak (POP) is almost the same between them. The great difference in results from SIF and NDVI products indicated that the vegetation indexes seem to overestimate the time of vegetation photosynthesis in Northeastern China. The Hurst exponent identified that the future trend of SOS, EOS, and POP is dominated by weak inverse sustainability, indicating that the future trend may be opposite to the past. The future trend of LOSSIF and LOSNDVI are opposite; the former is dominated by weak inverse sustainability, and the latter is mainly weak positive sustainability. In addition, we speculate that the difference between SIF and NDVI phenology is closely related to their different responses to climate. The vegetation phenology estimated by SIF is mainly controlled by temperature, while NDVI is mainly controlled by precipitation and relative humidity. Different phenological periods based on SIF and NDVI showed inconsistent responses to pre-season climate. This may be the cause of the difference in the phenology of SIF and NDVI extraction. Our results imply that canopy structure-based vegetation indices overestimate the photosynthetic cycle, and the SIF product can better track the phenological changes. We conclude that the two data products provide a reference for monitoring the phenology of photosynthesis and vegetation greenness, and the results also have a certain significance for the response of plants to climate change.

TI  - Mapping the Age of Subtropical Secondary Forest Using Dense Landsat Time Series Data: An Ensemble Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying secondary forest age (SFA) is essential to evaluate the carbon processes of forest ecosystems at regional and global scales. However, the successional stages of secondary forests remain poorly understood due to low-frequency thematic maps. This study aimed to estimate SFA with higher frequency and more accuracy by using dense Landsat archives. The performances of four time-series change detection algorithms-moving average change detection (MACD), Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC), LandTrendr (LT), and Vegetation Change Tracker (VCT)-for detecting forest regrowth were first evaluated. An ensemble model was then developed to determine more accurate timings for forest regrowth based on the evaluation results. Finally, after converting the forest regrowth year to the SFA, the spatiotemporal and topographical distributions of the SFA were analyzed. The proposed ensemble model was validated in Jiangxi province, China, which is located in a subtropical region and has experienced drastic forest disturbances, artificial afforestation, and natural regeneration. The results showed that: (1) the developed ensemble model effectively determined forest regrowth time with significantly decreased omission and commission rates compared to the direct use of the four single algorithms; (2) the optimal ensemble model combining the independent algorithms obtained the final SFA for Jiangxi province with the lowest omission and commission rates in the spatial domain (14.06% and 24.71%) and the highest accuracy in the temporal domain (R-2 = 0.87 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 3.17 years); (3) the spatiotemporal and topographic distribution from 1 to 34 years in the 2021 SFA map was analyzed. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using change detection algorithms for estimating SFA at regional to national scales and provides a data foundation for forest ecosystem research.

TI  - Reconstructing Digital Terrain Models from ArcticDEM and WorldView-2 Imagery in Livengood, Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - ArcticDEM provides the public with an unprecedented opportunity to access very high-spatial resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) covering the pan-Arctic surfaces. As it is generated from stereo-pairs of optical satellite imagery, ArcticDEM represents a mixture of a digital surface model (DSM) over a non-ground areas and digital terrain model (DTM) at bare grounds. Reconstructing DTM from ArcticDEM is thus needed in studies requiring bare ground elevation, such as modeling hydrological processes, tracking surface change dynamics, and estimating vegetation canopy height and associated forest attributes. Here we proposed an automated approach for estimating DTM from ArcticDEM in two steps: (1) identifying ground pixels from WorldView-2 imagery using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with local refinement by morphological operation, and (2) generating a continuous DTM surface using ArcticDEMs at ground locations and spatial interpolation methods (ordinary kriging (OK) and natural neighbor (NN)). We evaluated our method at three forested study sites characterized by different canopy cover and topographic conditions in Livengood, Alaska, where airborne lidar data is available for validation. Our results demonstrate that (1) the proposed ground identification method can effectively identify ground pixels with much lower root mean square errors (RMSEs) (<0.35 m) to the reference data than the comparative state-of-the-art approaches; (2) NN performs more robustly in DTM interpolation than OK; (3) the DTMs generated from NN interpolation with GMM-based ground masks decrease the RMSEs of ArcticDEM to 0.648 m, 1.677 m, and 0.521 m for Site-1, Site-2, and Site-3, respectively. This study provides a viable means of deriving high-resolution DTM from ArcticDEM that will be of great value to studies focusing on the Arctic ecosystems, forest change dynamics, and earth surface processes.

TI  - Variation features of satellite infrared radiation time series associated with M<sub>s</sub> ≥7.0 earthquakes occurred in the Mid-Eastern Bayan Har block
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The M(s)8. 0 Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, the M(s)7. 0 Lushan earthquake in 2013, the M(s)7. 0 Jiuzhaigou earthquake in 2017, and the M(s)7. 4 Madoi earthquake in 2021 have occurred continuously in the Mid-Eastern Bayan Har block, which located in backland of the QinghaiTibetan plateau, since 2008. This research makes use of the TIR (Thermal Infrared Radiation) data inverted from the MODIS/Terra Sensor, taking advantage of the smooth method to derive the low-frequency information in the time series of the Brightness Temperature's average value from April 2004 to February 2022 ( nearly 18 years) in the Mid-Eastern Bayan Har block, analyzing the variation features of the TIR's low-frequency information before and after the M(s)8. 0 Wenchuan, M(s)7. 0 Lushan, M(s)7. 0 Jiuzhaigou, and M(s)7. 4 Madoi earthquakes. The research result shows that the infrared radiation changes before and after the four major earthquakes have the following common features: (1) The whole radiation value of the Mid-Eastern Bayan Har block keeps in the enhancement stage before these earthquakes and turns to the weakening stage after these earthquakes. This phenomenon is similar to the changes in the rock's stress loading and unloading experiment during the elastic stage, which indicates that the loading gives rise to the temperature's rising and the unloading leads to the temperature's decrease. (2) The radiation value all overpast the 2 times standard deviation a lot during the enhancement stage before these four major earthquakes. This anomaly phenomenon is indicative for the M(s >=)7. 0 earthquakes in the Mid-Eastern Bayan Har block. Based on these common features, a suitable technical scheme can be designed to track and judge the risk of large earthquakes in the Mid-Eastern Bayan Har block.

TI  - Impacts of Water Resources Management on Land Water Storage in the Lower Lancang River Basin: Insights from Multi-Mission Earth Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and heavy reservoir regulation in the lower Lancang River basin (LLRB) have caused significant impacts on terrestrial water storage (TWS) in several ways, including changes in surface water storage (SWS), soil moisture storage (SMS), and groundwater storage (GWS). Understanding these impacts is crucial for promoting comprehensive cooperation in managing and utilizing water resources within the basin. This study utilized multi-mission Earth observation (EO) datasets, i.e., gravimetry (GRACE/-FO), altimetry (Jason-2, Sentinel-3, and Cryosat-2), imagery (Sentinel-1/2), and microwave sensors (IMERG), as well as gauged meteorological, hydrological data and reanalysis products, to investigate the spatial-temporal variation of water resources in the LLRB. The study shows that the fluctuations in precipitation and the construction of reservoirs are the primary drivers of changes in the TWS anomaly (TWSA) in the region. Precipitation decreased significantly from 2010 to 2019 (-34.68 cm/yr), but the TWSA showed a significant increase (8.96 cm/yr) due to enhanced water storage capacity in the Xiaowan and Nuozhadu reservoirs. SWS and GWS were also analyzed, with SWS showing a decrease (-5.48 cm/yr) from 2010 to 2019 due to declining precipitation and increasing evaporation. GWS exhibited a steady rise (9.73 cm/yr) due to the maintenance of groundwater levels by the reservoirs. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of EO data for monitoring water resources at a regional scale.

TI  - Nonlinear Bias Correction of the FY-4A AGRI Infrared Radiance Data Based on the Random Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bias correction is a key prerequisite for radiance data assimilation. Directly assimilating the radiance observations generally involves large systematic biases affecting the numerical prediction accuracy. In this study, a nonlinear bias correction scheme with Random Forest (RF) technology is firstly proposed based on the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) channels 9-10 observations in the Weather Research and Forecasting Data Assimilation (WRFDA) system. Two different settings of the predictors are additionally designed and evaluated based on the performance of the RF model. It seems that an apparent scene temperature-dependent bias could be effectively resolved by the RF scheme when applying the RF method with newly added predictors. Results suggest that the proposed nonlinear scheme of RF performs better than the linear scheme does in terms of reducing the systematic biases. A more idealized error distribution of observation minus background (OMB) is found in the RF-based experiments that measure the nonlinear relationship between the OMB biases and the predictors when using the Gaussian distribution as the reference. Furthermore, the RF scheme shows a consistent improvement in bias correction with the potential to ameliorate the atmospheric variables of analyses.

TI  - A Method to Downscale MODIS Surface Reflectance Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface reflectance is an important indicator for the physical states of the Earth's surface. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance product at 500 m resolution (MOD09A1) includes seven spectral bands and has been widely used to derive many high-level parameter products, such as leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR). However, the MODIS surface reflectance product at 250 m resolution (MOD09Q1) is only available for the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, which greatly limits its applications. In this study, a downscaling reflectance convolutional neural network (DRCNN) is proposed to downscale the surface reflectance of the MOD09A1 product and derive 250 m surface reflectance in the blue, green, shortwave infrared (SWIR1, 1628-1652 nm) and shortwave infrared (SWIR2, 2105-2155 nm) bands for generating high-level parameter products at 250 m resolution. The surface reflectance of the MOD09A1 and MOD09Q1 products are preprocessed to obtain cloud-free continuous surface reflectance. Additionally, the surface reflectance in the blue, green, SWIR1 and SWIR2 bands from the preprocessed MOD09A1 product were upsampled to obtain surface reflectance in the corresponding bands at 1 km resolution. Then, a database was generated from the upsampled surface reflectance and the preprocessed MOD09A1 product over the On Line Validation Exercise (OLIVE) sites to train the DRCNN. The surface reflectance in the blue, green, SWIR1 and SWIR2 bands from the preprocessed MOD09A1 product and the surface reflectance in the red and NIR bands from the preprocessed MOD09Q1 product were entered into the trained DRCNN to obtain the surface reflectance in the blue, green, SWIR1 and SWIR2 bands at 250 m resolution. The downscaled surface reflectance from the DRCNN were compared with the surface reflectance from the MOD09A1 product and Landsat 7. The results show that the DRCNN can effectively downscale the surface reflectance of the MOD09A1 product to generate the surface reflectance at 250 m resolution.

TI  - Characterization of Three Surges of the Kyagar Glacier, Karakoram
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers experience periodic variations in flow velocity called surges, each of which influences the glacier's characteristics and the occurrence of downstream disasters (e.g., ice-dammed lake outburst floods). The Karakoram region contains many surging glaciers, yet there are few comprehensive studies of multiple surge cycles. In this work, Landsat, topographic map, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X, ITS_LIVE, and Sentinel-1 glacier velocity data were used to systematically analyze the characteristics of Kyagar Glacier since the 1970s. Three surging events were identified, with active phases in 1975-1978, 1995-1997, and 2014-2016. The timing of these surges was similar, with a cycle of 19-20 years, an active phase of 3-4 years, and a quiescent phase of 16-17 years. During the quiescent phase, a large amount of ice accumulates in the lower part of the accumulation zone, and the terminal of the tongue thins significantly. According to the most recent surge event (2014-2016), glacier flow accelerated suddenly in the active phase and reached a maximum velocity of 2 +/- 0.08 m d(-1). Then, the glacier terminal thickened sharply, the reservoir zone thinned by 12 +/- 0.2 m, and the terminal receiving zone thickened by 28 +/- 0.2 m. The glacier may have entered a quiescent phase after July 2016. The glacier surge causes a large amount of material to transfer from upstream to downstream, forming an ice dam and creating conditions for a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). At the termination of the active phase, the subglacial drainage channel became effective, triggering the GLOF. For a period of the quiescent phase, the glacier ablation intensifies and the GLOF repeats constantly. One surge caused 7-8 GLOFs, and then a continuous reduction in the ice dam elevation. Eventually, the ice dam disappeared, and the GLOF no longer continued before the next glacier-surging event.

TI  - Large-Scale Estimation of Hourly Surface Air Temperature Based on Observations from the FY-4A Geostationary Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially continuous surface air temperature (SAT) is of great significance for various research areas in geospatial communities, and it can be reconstructed by the SAT estimation models that integrate accurate point measurements of SAT at ground sites with wall-to-wall datasets derived from remotely sensed observations of spaceborne instruments. As land surface temperature (LST) strongly correlates with SAT, estimation models are typically developed with LST as a primary input. Geostationary satellites are capable of observing the Earth's surface across large-scale areas at very high frequencies. Compared to the substantial efforts to estimate SAT at daily or monthly scales using LST derived from MODIS, very limited studies have been performed to estimate SAT at high-temporal scales based on LST from geostationary satellites. Estimation models for hourly SAT based on the LST derived from FY-4A, the first geostationary satellite in China's new-generation meteorological observation mission, were developed for the first time in this study. The models were fully cross-validated for a very large-scale region with diverse geographic settings using random forest, and specified differently to explore the influence of time and location variables on model performance. Overall predictive performance of the models is about 1.65-2.08 K for sample-based cross-validation, and 2.22-2.70 K for site-based cross-validation. Incorporating time or location variables into the hourly models significantly improves predictive performance, which is also confirmed by the analysis of predictive errors at temporal scales and across sites. The best-performing model with an average RMSE of 2.22 K was utilized for reconstructing maps of SAT for each hour. The hourly models developed in this study have general implications for future studies on large-scale estimating of hourly SAT based on geostationary LST datasets.

TI  - Multi-Scale Encoding (MSE) Method with Spectral Shape Information (SSI) for Detecting Marine Oil-Gas Leakages
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technologies are suitable for detecting marine oil-gas leakages on a large scale. It is important to structure an accurate method for detecting marine oil-gas leakages in varied remote sensing images. However, traditional spectral indexes have limited applicability. Machine learning methods need plenty of training and testing samples to establish the optimized models, which is too rigorous for satellite images. Thus, we proposed a multi-scale encoding (MSE) method with spectral shape information (SSI) to detect the oil-gas leakages in multi-source remote sensing data. First, the spectral amplitude information (SAI) and SSI of the original spectra were encoded into a series of code words according to the scales. Then, the differential code words of the marine oil-gas leakage objects were extracted from the SAI and SSI code words. Finally, the pixels of the encoded hyperspectral image (HSI) and multispectral image (MSI) would be determined by the differential code words. Seven images captured by different platforms/sensors (Landsat 7, Landsat 8, MODIS, Sentinel 2, Zhuhai-1, and AVIRIS) were used to validate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results indicated that the MSE method with SSI was convergent and could detect the oil-gas leakages accurately in different images using a small set of samples.

TI  - Simulation of Diffuse Solar Radiation with Tree-Based Evolutionary Hybrid Models and Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Diffuse solar radiation (Rd) provides basic data for designing and optimizing solar energy systems. Owing to the notable unavailability in many regions of the world, R-d is traditionally estimated by models through other easily available meteorological factors. However, in the absence of ground weather station data, such models often need to be supplemented according to satellite remote sensing data. The performance of Himawari-7 satellite inversion of R-d was evaluated in the study, and hybrid models were established (XGBoost_DE, XGBoost_FPA, XGBoost_GOA, and XGBoost_GWO), so as to improve the satellite data and achieve a better utilization effect. The meteorological data of 14 R-d stations in mainland China from 2011 to 2015 were used. Four input combinations (L1-L4) and eight input combinations (S1-S8) of meteorological factors corresponding to satellite remote sensing data were used for model simulation, while two optimal combinations (S7 and S8) were selected for cross-station application. The results revealed that the accuracy of Himawari-7 satellite Rd data was low, with RMSE, R2, MAE, and MBE values of 2.498 MJ center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1), 0.617, 1.799 MJ center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1), and 0.323 MJ center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1), respectively. The performance of these coupled models based on satellite data was significantly improved. The RMSE and MAE values increased by 15.5% and 9.4%, respectively, while the R2 value decreased by 10.9 %. Compared with others based on satellite data, the XGBoost_GOA model exhibited optimal performance. The mean values of RMSE, R-2, and MAE were 1.63 MJ center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1), 0.76 and 1.21 MJ center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1), respectively. The XGBoost_GWO model exhibited optimal performance in the cross-station application, and the average RMSE value was reduced by 2.3-10.5% compared with the other models. The meteorological factors input by the models exhibited different levels of significance in different scenarios. Rd_s was the main meteorological parameter that affected the model based on satellite data, while RH exhibited a significant improvement in the XGBoost_FPA and XGBoost_GWO models based on ground weather stations data. Accordingly, the present authors believe that the XGBoost_GOA model has excellent ability for simulating Rd, while the XGBoost_GWO model allows for cross-station simulation of Rd from satellite data.

TI  - Mapping Forage Biomass and Quality of the Inner Mongolia Grasslands by Combining Field Measurements and Sentinel-2 Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands provide essential forage sources for global livestock production. Remote sensing approaches have been widely used to estimate the biomass production of grasslands from regional to global scales, but simultaneously mapping the forage biomass and quality metrics (e.g., crude fiber and crude protein) is still relatively lacking despite an increasing need for better livestock management. We conducted novel gradient grass-cutting experiments and measured hyperspectral reflectance, forage biomass, crude fiber per area (CFarea), and crude protein per area (CParea) across 19 temperate grassland sites in the Xilingol region, Inner Mongolia, China. Based on these measurements, we identified sensitive spectral bands, calculated nine potential spectral indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Red-Edge Inflection Point, Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index algorithm, Normalized Difference Red Edge Index, Nitrogen Reflectance Index, Normalized Greenness Index, Land Surface Water Index) and established Random Forest (RF) models that well predicted forage biomass (R-2 = 0.67, NRMSE = 12%), CFarea (R-2 = 0.59, NRMSE = 14%), and CParea (R-2 = 0.77, NRMSE = 10%). Among these nine indices, Land Surface Water Index (LSWI, calculated by R785-900 and R2100-2280) was identified to be the most important predictor and was then used to establish empirical power law models, showing comparable prediction accuracies (forage biomass, R-2 = 0.53; NRMSE = 14%; CFarea, R-2 = 0.40, NRMSE = 17%; CParea, R-2 = 0.72, NRMSE = 11%) in comparison to Random Forest models. Combining the empirical power law models with the LSWI calculated from Sentinel-2 observations, we further mapped the forage biomass and quality and estimated the livestock carrying capacity. The predicted forage biomass, CFarea, and CParea all showed a significant increase with higher mean annual precipitation, but showed no significant correlations with mean annual temperature. Compared with the estimates based on crude protein, the conventional approach solely based on forage biomass consistently overestimated livestock carrying capacity, especially in wetter areas. Our work provides an approach to simultaneously map the forage biomass and quality metrics and recommends a LSWI-based power law model for rapid and low-cost assessment of regional forage status to guide better livestock management.

TI  - Mapping and Influencing the Mechanism of CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions from Building Operations Integrated Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has led to rapid growth in energy consumption and CO2 emissions in the building sector. Building operation emissions (BCEs) are a major part of emissions in the building life cycle. Existing studies have attempted to estimate fine-scale BCEs using remote sensing data. However, there is still a lack of research on estimating long-term BCEs by integrating multi-source remote sensing data and applications in different regions. We selected the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration and the National Capital Region of Japan (NCRJ) as research areas for this study. We also built multiple linear regression (MLR) models between prefecture-level BCEs and multi-source remote sensing data. The prefecture-level BCEs were downscaled to grid scale at a 1 km(2) resolution. The estimation results verify the method's difference and accuracy at different development stages. The multi-scale BCEs showed a continuous growth trend in the BTH urban agglomeration and a significant downward trend in the NCRJ. The decrease in energy intensity and population density were the main factors contributing to the negative growth of BCEs, whereas GDP per capita and urban expansion significantly promoted it. Through our methods and analyses, we contribute to the study of estimating greenhouse gas emissions with remote sensing and exploring the environmental impact of urban growth.

TI  - An Optical Remote Sensing Image Matching Method Based on the Simple and Stable Feature Database
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has entered the era of big data due to the increase in the number of remote sensing satellites and imaging modes. This presents significant challenges for the processing of remote sensing systems and will result in extremely high real-time data processing requirements. The effective and reliable geometric positioning of remote sensing images is the foundation of remote sensing applications. In this paper, we propose an optical remote sensing image matching method based on a simple stable feature database. This method entails building the stable feature database, extracting local invariant features that are comparatively stable from remote sensing images using an iterative matching strategy, and storing useful information about the features. Without reference images, the feature database-based matching approach potentially saves storage space for reference data while increasing image processing speed. To evaluate the performance of the feature database matching method, we train the feature database with various local invariant feature algorithms on different time phases of Gaofen-2 (GF-2) images. Furthermore, we carried out matching comparison experiments with various satellite images to confirm the viability and stability of the feature database-based matching method. In comparison with direct matching using the classical feature algorithm, the feature database-based matching method in this paper can essentially improve the correct rate of feature point matching by more than 30% and reduce the matching time by more than 40%. This method improves the accuracy and timeliness of image matching, potentially solves the problem of large storage space occupied by the reference data, and has great potential for fast matching of optical remote sensing images.

TI  - Synchronous Retrieval of LAI and Cab from UAV Remote Sensing: Development of Optimal Estimation Inversion Framework
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) remote sensing provides the feasibility of high-throughput phenotype nondestructive acquisition at the field scale. However, accurate remote sensing of crop physicochemical parameters from UAV optical measurements still needs to be further studied. For this purpose, we put forward a crop phenotype inversion framework based on the optimal estimation (OE) theory in this paper, originating from UAV low-altitude hyperspectral/multispectral data. The newly developed unified linearized vector radiative transfer model (UNL-VRTM), combined with the classical PROSAIL model, is used as the forward model, and the forward model was verified by the wheat canopy reflectance data, collected using the FieldSpec Handheld in Qi County, Henan Province. To test the self-consistency of the OE-based framework, we conducted forward simulations for the UAV multispectral sensors (DJI P4 Multispectral) with different observation geometries and aerosol loadings, and a total of 801 sets of validation data were obtained. In addition, parameter sensitivity analysis and information content analysis were performed to determine the contribution of crop parameters to the UAV measurements. Results showed that: (1) the forward model has a strong coupling between vegetation canopy and atmosphere environment, and the modeling process is reasonable. (2) The OE-based inversion framework can make full use of the available radiometric spectral information and had good convergence and self-consistency. (3) The UAV multispectral observations can support the synchronous retrieval of LAI (leaf area index) and Cab (chlorophyll a and b content) based on the proposed algorithm. The proposed inversion framework is expected to be a new way for phenotypic parameter extraction of crops in field environments and had some potential and feasibility for UAV remote sensing.

TI  - The influence of axillary surgery and radiotherapeutic strategy on the risk of lymphedema and upper extremity dysfunction in early breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To explore the risk factors for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) and upper extremity dysfunction (UED) in patients with early breast cancer after modern comprehensive treatment and to compare the toxicity of different treatment strategies.Methods: From 2017 to 2020, a total of 1369 female patients with pT1-3N0-1M0 breast cancer who underwent adjuvant radiotherapy in our centre were retrospectively reviewed. BCRL and UED were identified by the Norman and QuickDASH questionnaires. The incidence, severity and risk factors for BCRL and UED were evaluated.Results: After a median follow-up of 25 months, a total of 249 patients developed BCRL; axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), increased number of dissected nodes, right-sided and hypofractionated radiotherapy con-taining RNI were found to be significant risk factors (all p values < 0.05). The sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)+ regional nodal irradiation (RNI) group had a significantly lower BCRL risk than the ALND + RNI group (10.8% vs. 32.5%, HR = 0.426, p = 0.020), while there was no significant difference between ALND vs. ALND + RNI or SLNB vs. SLNB + RNI. A total of 193 patients developed UED, and ALND (p = 0.02) was the only sig-nificant risk factor. The SLNB + RNI group had a significantly decreased risk of UED compared with the ALND + RNI group (7.5% vs. 23.9%, HR = 0.260, p = 0.001), and there was no significant difference between SLNB vs. SLNB + RNI or ALND vs. ALND + RNI.Conclusion: Aggressive ALND remains the primary risk factor for BCRL and UED while RNI does not. Thus, replacing ALND with tailored radiotherapy would be an effective preventive strategy in early breast cancer patients.

TI  - Image Quality Evaluation Method for Optical Remote Sensing Satellite Based on an Array of Point Sources
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground pixel resolution and modulation transfer function are two important parameters for image quality evaluation of high spatial resolution optical remote sensing satellites,which are of great significance in target recognition, image interpretation, and information extraction. We present an image quality evaluation method for remote sensor using an array of point sources,which takes the light,small,and automated reflected point source array as reference. Two image quality evaluation parameters of remote sensor ground pixel resolution and modulation transfer function can be obtained at the same time. The two-dimensional Gaussian model is used to describe the point spread characteristic of the optical remote sensing satellite imaging system. Selecting the 5x5 pixel values of each reflective point source remote sensing image into the point spread function model and use the least squares method to fit the two- dimensional Gaussian surface to obtain the image point coordinates. According to the ground pixel resolution detection principle and combined with the ground point source position measurement,the ground pixel resolution of the remote sensor is obtained. Based on the image point coordinates, all point source image data are positionally registered, and the image data after data rearrangement is fitted again with the twodimensional Gaussian surface to obtain oversampled,sub-pixel interpolated optical remote sensing satellite imaging system point spread function, and then obtain the system modulation transfer function. In the image quality evaluation test of ZY-3 satellite based on reflective point sources,a 4x4 reflective point source array with non-integer pixel intervals was concentrated on the calibration test site along the flight direction and the linear array direction. The distance between adjacent point sources is 10.25 pixels,and the distance between two point sources is 20.5 pixels. The point spread function of the optical remote sensing imaging system can be sub- pixel interpolated to 0.25 pixels,which can effectively overcome the sampling effect of the imaging system and suppress the influence of random noise. According to the principle of collinearity test,the sum of the centers of adjacent reflection point sources should be equal to the distance between the centers of phase reflection point sources. The test results show that the error of the collinearity test results between the optical remote sensing satellite detector linear array and the flight direction is less than 0.002 pixels. It shows that the extraction result of array point source image point has high precision and accuracy. The standard deviations of the ground pixel resolution detection results in the linear array direction and flight direction of optical remote sensing satellite detectors are 0.020 6 and 0.021 5,relative deviations are 6.4% and 6.1%,which shows that the point source image pixel extraction accuracy is high and the linear array detection element of the remote sensor has good rigidity and stability in a local area. Comparing the results of the on- orbit modulation transfer function detection of the ZY-3 satellite by the array point sources method and the double- edge method,the difference between the two methods in the flight direction and the linear array direction is 0.000 2 and 0.012 6. Compared with periodic targets,array point sources have the characteristics of light weight,miniaturization,and automation.In the process of quantitative detection of the ground pixel resolution of optical remote sensing satellites,the array point source method is not affected by the subjective factors of image interpreters and can suppress the influence of atmospheric and random noise. The array point source method is a two-dimensional modulation transfer function direct detection method according to the physical definition of modulation transfer function,which can intuitively describe the point spread characteristic of the photoelectric remote sensing imaging system. The array point sources can also be used as a reference target for the radiometric calibration of optical remote sensing satellites. The on- orbit radiometric calibration of remote sensors can be realized by setting up a multi- level point source array on the ground,combined with the measurement of atmospheric optical characteristic parameters. Therefore,the array point sources can comprehensively realize the image quality evaluation and radiometric calibration of optical remote sensing satellites.

TI  - Window-Based Filtering Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm of Fine-Scale Remote Sensing Images: A Case Using Sentinel-2 Data in Beijing Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite-based Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrieval algorithms are generally needed to construct Land Surface Reflectance (LSR) database. However, errors are unavoidable due to the surface complexity, especially for the short observation period and high-resolution images, such as Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data. To address this, reference day images are used instead of the LSR database. The surface is assumed to be Lambertian; however, the fact is that not all pixels meet it well. Therefore, we proposed a window-based AOD retrieval algorithm, which can ignore the unreliable/non-Lambertian pixels in a retrieval window based on two main filtering processes. Finally, using Sentinel-2 Band 1 (60 m), the AODs (120 m) of 134 reference images to 43 reference images were retrieved by this algorithm from 2017 to 2021 in Beijing region, China. The results show that the retrieved AOD with the proposed algorithm exhibits good agreement with the ground-based measured AOD (R > 0.97). The high-resolution AOD presents comparable spatial distributions to the Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm AOD (1 km) products. Moreover, the very little noise and very high spatial continuity of retrieval AOD imply that this algorithm could be ported to other algorithms as part of improving AOD quality.

TI  - Evaluating the Canopy Chlorophyll Density of Maize at the Whole Growth Stage Based on Multi-Scale UAV Image Feature Fusion and Machine Learning Methods
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize is one of the main grain reserve crops, which directly affects the food security of the country. It is extremely important to evaluate the growth status of maize in a timely and accurate manner. Canopy Chlorophyll Density (CCD) is closely related to crop health status. A timely and accurate estimation of CCD is helpful for managers to take measures to avoid yield loss. Thus, many methods have been developed to estimate CCD with remote sensing data. However, the relationship between the CCD and the features used in these CCD estimation methods at different growth stages is unclear. In addition, the CCD was directly estimated from remote sensing data in most previous studies. If the CCD can be accurately estimated from the estimation results of Leaf Chlorophyll Density (LCD) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) remains to be explored. In this study, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multivariable Linear Regression (MLR) were used to develop CCD, LCD, and LAI estimation models by integrating multiple features derived from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral images. Firstly, the performances of the RF, SVM, and MLR trained over spectral features (including vegetation indices and band reflectance; dataset I), texture features (dataset II), wavelet coefficient features (dataset III), and multiple features (dataset IV, including all the above datasets) were analyzed, respectively. Secondly, the CCDP was calculated from the estimated LCD and estimated LAI, and then the CCD was estimated based on multiple features and the CCDP was compared. The results show that the correlation between CCD and different features is significantly different at every growth stage. The RF model trained over dataset IV yielded the best performance for the estimation of LCD, LAI, and CCD (R-2 values were 0.91, 0.97, and 0.97, and RMSE values were 6.59 mu g/cm(2), 0.35, and 24.85 mu g/cm(2)). The CCD directly estimated from dataset IV is slightly closer to the ground truth CCD than the CCDP (R-2 = 0.96, RMSE = 26.85 mu g/cm(2)) calculated from LCD and LAI. The results indicated that the CCD of maize can be accurately estimated from multiple multispectral image features at the whole growth stage, and both CCD estimation strategies can be used to estimate the CCD accurately. This study provides a new reference for accurate CCD evaluation in precision agriculture.

TI  - Inversion of water quality by remote-sensing monitoring based on machine learning in complex freshwater environments
T2  - DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Small-area urban water areas play an important role in the human ecological environment and as a source of drinking water. Most such urban water bodies are long and narrow, so ordinary remote-sensing data sources are not suitable for monitoring. To address this problem, we use the four water-quality metrics of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, turbidity, and algal density as detected from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote-sensing images. We apply an improved least squares model to evaluate and invert the water quality in the complex freshwater environments of Longhu Lake, which is a tributary of the Yangtze River. These environments combine the polymor-phism characteristics of urban rivers. The results show that (1) the band-ratio model is appropri-ate to estimate the water-quality parameters, and inversion by band combination is more accurate than inversion with a single band. (2) Comparison of the unary linear function, polynomial func-tion, and exponential function with the least squares model shows that the latter produces the best inversion results and the smallest error. In addition, data from different periods are summed to verify the applicability of the model. The inversion results indicate that the elements responsible for polluting city rivers must be further explored by comparing point source pollution with non -point source pollution. The results show that the UAV multispectral estimation model based on the least squares method is accurate and stable and can provide strong support for water -qual-ity monitoring in small areas. This method has important practical significance for improving intelligent and automated water-monitoring technology.

TI  - A Dynamic Effective Class Balanced Approach for Remote Sensing Imagery Semantic Segmentation of Imbalanced Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The wide application and rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology have put higher requirements on remote sensing image segmentation methods. Because of its characteristics of large image size, large data volume, and complex segmentation background, not only are the traditional image segmentation methods difficult to apply effectively, but the image segmentation methods based on deep learning are faced with the problem of extremely unbalanced data between categories. In order to solve this problem, first of all, according to the existing effective sample theory, the effective sample calculation method in the context of semantic segmentation is firstly proposed in the highly unbalanced dataset. Then, a dynamic weighting method based on the effective sample concept is proposed, which can be applied to the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. Finally, the applicability of this method to different loss functions and different network structures is verified on the self-built Landsat8-OLI remote sensing image-based tri-classified forest fire burning area dataset and the LoveDA dataset, which is for land-cover semantic segmentation. It has been concluded that this weighting algorithm can enhance the minimal-class segmentation accuracy while ensuring that the overall segmentation performance in multi-class segmentation tasks is verified in two different semantic segmentation tasks, including the land use and land cover (LULC) and the forest fire burning area segmentation In addition, this proposed method significantly improves the recall of forest fire burning area segmentation by as much as about 30%, which is of great reference value for forest fire research based on remote sensing images.

TI  - Modeling of Scattering by Dense Random Media Consisting of Particle Clusters With DMRT Bicontinuous
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we developed the dense media radiative transfer (DMRT) model for random media with densely packed particle clusters. The dense media are computer-generated by applying the bicontinuous random media characterization. The microstructure of the media is controlled by two parameters: mean grain size <zeta > and aggregation parameter b. Phase matrices and extinction coefficients are computed with full-wave simulations. These are then substituted into radiative transfer (RT) equations to obtain backscattering coefficients of the dense media layer with particle clusters. The backscattering has a weaker frequency dependence (e.g., similar to 2.6 power for b = 0.4) than the Rayleigh scattering of fourth power. Backscattering results exhibit strong co-, cross-polarization (pol), and ratio of cross- to co-polarization. For applications to remote sensing of terrestrial snow at C-band, the results of DMRT simulations show that cross-polarization of snow volume scattering can be larger than that of soil surface scattering. Recently, this property of strong cross-polarization has become a useful satellite remote sensing technique for global retrieval of snow depth. Comparisons of DMRT results are made with ESA Satellite Sentinel 1 C-band data and ground-based radar observations. The calculated backscatter is in good agreement with radar measurements for both the co- and cross-polarization.

TI  - A New Method for Estimating Irrigation Water Use via Soil Moisture
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to obtain an accurate measure of irrigation water use is urgently needed in order to provide further scientific guidance for irrigation practices. This investigation took soil moisture and precipitation as the study objects and quantitatively analyzed their relationship by establishing four models: a linear model, a logarithmic model, a soil water balance model, and a similarity model. The results from building models on every site clearly revealed the relationship between soil moisture and precipitation and confirmed the feasibility of estimating irrigation water use when soil moisture data are known. Four models combined with soil moisture data were used to estimate irrigation water use. First, the 16 sites which monitor soil moisture conditions in Hebi City were identified as study objects, from which everyday meteorological data (temperature, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, sunshine duration) and soil moisture data from 2015 to 2020 (totaling six years) were collected. Second, the eligible data from the first four years in the date range were used to create four kinds of models (linear model, logarithmic model, soil water balance model, and similarity model) to estimate the amount of water input to the soil surface based on soil moisture. Third, the eligible data from the last two years in the established date range were used to verify the established models on every site and then judge the accuracy of the models. For example, for site 53990, the RMSE of the linear model, logarithmic model, soil water balance model, and similarity model was 10,547, 10,302, 8619, and 7524, respectively. The results demonstrate that the similarity model proposed in this study can express the quantitative relationship between soil moisture and precipitation more accurately than the other three models. Based on this conclusion, the eligible soil moisture data known in the specific site were ultimately used to estimate the irrigation water use in the field by the relationship expressed in the similarity model. Compared with the amount of irrigation water data recorded, the estimated irrigation water use yielded by the similarity model in this study was 18.11% smaller. In a future study, microwave satellite remote sensing of soil moisture data, such as SMAP and SMOS soil moisture data, will be used to evaluate the performance of estimated regional irrigation water use.

TI  - Effects of Atmospheric Correction on Remote Sensing Statistical Inference in an Aquatic Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction (AC) plays a critical role in the preprocessing of remote sensing images. Although AC is necessary for applications based on remote sensing inversion, it is not always required for those based on remote sensing classification. Recently, remote sensing statistical inference has been proposed for evaluating water quality. However, input data for these models have always been remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), which requires AC. This raises the question of whether AC is necessary for remote sensing statistical inference. We conducted a theoretical analysis and image validations by testing 24 water bodies observed by Landsat-8 and compared their spectral probability distributions (SPDs) calculated from R-rs before and after AC (using the ACOLITE model). Additionally, we tested and found that, if we use remote sensing inference as a tool to quantitatively infer statistical parameters of a specific waterbody, it is better to perform atmospheric correction. However, if the quantitative inference is applied to a large number of water bodies and high inference accuracy is not required, atmospheric correction may not be necessary, and a quick calculation based on the strong correlations between R-rs at the surface and sensor-observed reflectance can be used as a substitute.

TI  - Remote Sensing Inversion of Typical Water Quality Parameters of a Complex River Network: A Case Study of Qidong's Rivers
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing inversion of the water quality parameters of a complex river network in the absence of historical ground data is a difficult problem in the field of remote sensing. In this paper, a sub-regional inversion method for typical water quality parameters is presented for a complex river network using Gaofen-1 satellite data. Qidong's rivers were selected as the survey region, and different band combination models and datasets on different river sub-regions were used to perform the remote sensing inversion, which realized the inversion of the permanganate index (CODMn), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) in the rivers. The results show that all the coefficients of determination (R<^>2) of the inversion models are larger than 0.5, indicating an increase of about 0.4 when compared with the inversion method of the whole region, indicating good relevance. Water quality data and satellite data collected at different times were used for validation, which showed good results. On the basis of the water quality inversion, the key polluted areas were extracted in combination with on-site surveys to find the pollution source in order to verify the results of the inversion. The sub-region inversion method proposed in this paper can be used for the remote sensing inversion of the water quality parameters of complex river networks in the absence of historical ground data.

TI  - An Interferogram Re-Flattening Method for InSAR Based on Local Residual Fringe Removal and Adaptively Adjusted Windows
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - InSAR technology uses the geometry between antennas and targets to obtain DEM and deformation; therefore, accurate orbit information, which can provide reliable geometry, is the prerequisite for InSAR processing. However, the orbit information provided by some satellites may be inaccurate. Further, this inaccuracy will be reflected in the interferogram and will be difficult to remove, finally resulting in incorrect results. More importantly, it was found that the residual fringes caused by inaccurate orbit information vary unevenly throughout the whole image and cannot be completely removed by the existing refinement and re-flattening methods. Therefore, an interferogram re-flattening method based on local residual fringe removal and adaptively adjusted windows was proposed in this paper, with the aim being to remove the unevenly varying residual fringes. There are two innovative advantages of the proposed method. One advantage is that the method aims at the global inhomogeneity of residual fringes; the idea of combining local processing and residual fringe removal was proposed to ensure the residual fringes in the whole image can be removed. The other is that an adaptively adjusted local flattening window was designed to ensure that the residual fringes within the local window can be removed cleanly. Three sets of GaoFen-3 data and one pair of Sentinle-1A data were used for experiments. The re-flattening process shows that the local flattening and the adjustment of the local window are absolutely essential to the clean removal of time-varying and uneven residual fringes. The generated DEM and the estimated building heights are used to indirectly reflect the performance of re-flattening methods. The final results show that compared with mature refinement and re-flattening methods, the DEMs based on the proposed method are more accurate, which reflects that the proposed method has a better performance in the removal of time-varying and uneven residual fringes.

TI  - An Improved Approach of Winter Wheat Yield Estimation by Jointly Assimilating Remotely Sensed Leaf Area Index and Soil Moisture into the WOFOST Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The crop model data assimilation approach has been acknowledged as an effective tool for monitoring crop growth and estimating yield. However, the choice of assimilated variables and the mismatch in scale between remotely sensed observations and crop model-simulated state variables have various effects on the performance of yield estimation. This study aims to examine the accuracy of crop yield estimation through the joint assimilation of leaf area index (LAI) and soil moisture (SM) and to examine the scale effect between remotely sensed data and crop model simulations. To address these issues, we proposed an improved crop data-model assimilation (CDMA) framework, which integrates LAI and SM, as retrieved from remotely sensed data, into the World Food Studies (WOFOST) model using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approach for winter wheat yield estimation. The results showed that the yield estimation at a 10 m grid size outperformed that at a 500 m grid size, using the same assimilation strategy. Additionally, the winter wheat yield estimation accuracy was higher when using the bivariate data assimilation method (R-2 = 0.46, RMSE = 756 kg/ha) compared to the univariate method. In conclusion, our study highlights the advantages of joint assimilating LAI and SM for crop yield estimation and emphasizes the importance of finer spatial resolution in remotely sensed observations for crop yield estimation using the CDMA framework. The proposed approach would help to develop a high-accuracy crop yield monitoring system using optical and SAR retrieved parameters.

TI  - Uncovering the Depletion Patterns of Inland Water Bodies via Remote Sensing, Data Mining, and Statistical Analysis
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Addressing the issue of shrinking saline lakes around the globe has turned into one of the most pressing issues for sustainable water resource management. While it has been established that natural climate variability, human interference, climate change, or a combination of these factors can lead to the depletion of saline lakes, it is crucial to investigate each case and diagnose the potential causes of this devastating phenomenon. On that note, this study aims to promote a comprehensive analytical framework that can reveal any significant depletion patterns in lakes while analyzing the potential reasons behind these observed changes. The methodology used in this study is based on statistical analysis, data mining techniques, and remote sensing-based datasets. To achieve the objective of this study, Maharlou Lake has been selected to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework. The results revealed two types of depletion patterns in the lake's surface area: a sharp breaking point in 2007/2008 and a gradual negative trend, which was more pronounced in dry seasons and less prominent in wet seasons. Furthermore, the analysis of hydro-climatic variables has indicated the presence of abrupt and gradual changes in these variables' time series, which could be interpreted as a signal that climate change and anthropogenic drought are changing the basin's status quo. Lastly, analyzing the statistically significant correlation between hydro-climatic variables and the lake's surface area showed the potential connection between the observed changing patterns. The results obtained from data mining models suggest that Maharlou Lake has undergone a morphological transformation and is currently adopting these new conditions. If preventive measures are not taken to revive Maharlou Lake, the tipping point might have been reached, and reviving the lake could be improbable, if not impossible.

TI  - Technical note: The CAMS greenhouse gas reanalysis from 2003 to 2020
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) has recently produced a greenhouse gas reanalysis (version egg4) that covers almost 2 decades from 2003 to 2020 and which will be extended in the future. This reanalysis dataset includes carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The reanalysis procedure combines model data with satellite data into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). This dataset has been carefully evaluated against independent observations to ensure validity and to point out deficiencies to the user. The greenhouse gas reanalysis can be used to examine the impact of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations on climate change (such as global and regional climate radiative forcing), assess intercontinental transport, and serve as boundary conditions for regional simulations, among other applications and scientific uses. The caveats associated with changes in assimilated observations and fixed underlying emissions are highlighted, as is their impact on the estimation of trends and annual growth rates of these long-lived greenhouse gases.

TI  - Estimating the effect of water shortage on olive trees by the combination of meteorological and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Relative soil water content (RSWC) is widely used to characterize the impact of water stress (WS) on vegetation. In bi-layer ecosystems, such as olive groves, this impact must be primarily estimated for the tree component, which, having greater rooting depth, responds more slowly to WS than understory grass. This complicates the application of methods for RSWC prediction, which must be properly adapted to consider the deeper soil layer influential on olive trees. The current study investigates the modification of a recently proposed RSWC simulation method based on a combination of meteorological and satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. The application of the method to an olive grove in Central Italy requires the estimation of both weather and NDVI contributions affecting solely olive trees, which is carried out through the use of appropriate data processing techniques. The RSWC estimates obtained reasonably reproduce the ground RSWC observations referred to the 1 m soil layer, which are representative of the WS affecting olive trees (r(2) = 0.795, RMSE = 0.15 and MBE = -0.09). The limits and prospects of this method are finally discussed with particular reference to the possible integration of the RSWC estimates within more complex ecosystem models.

TI  - Dynamics and Drivers of Land Use and Land Cover Change in the Upper Awash Basin, Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed the patterns and drivers of LULC dynamics in relation to the expansion of large-scale irrigated agriculture in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia from 1972 to 2016. Aerial photographs (1972), Landsat images (1980, 2000) and SPOT5 satellite images (2016) were analyzed using GIS tools to reveal LULC changes, and documentation, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were used to ascertain the biophysical and socioeconomic implications and drivers of these dynamics. The study revealed that cultivated and rural settlement land, and urban built-up areas had expanded at the expense of forestland, woodland, shrubland and grassland. While an increase in the production of cash crops had brought some benefits to smallholder farmers, such as access to irrigation and modern agricultural inputs and technologies, the unregulated conversion of natural vegetation to cultivated land resulted in a loss of biodiversity, deforestation, and reduction of pasture and firewood. We identified that significant LULC changes in the study area were caused by intersecting biophysical, economic, institutional, technological and demographic factors, which reinforced each other with varying magnitudes at different moments in time. These changes were underpinned by one key driver, that is, government agricultural policies that promoted investment in commercial agriculture for national and export markets. The study shows that understanding the complex interaction between the contributing factors and drivers of LULC change is crucial to inform decision-making and policies, in particular, by directing responses towards the underlying drivers of change rather than only the proximate causes.

TI  - Shoreline change detection along North Sebou-Moulay Bousselham, based on remote sensing analysis
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable management of the shoreline is crucial. Shoreline mapping is very essential to investigate the impact of the dynamic nature of the coastal area over a certain period. Coastal zone at the north Sebou estuary experience some issues as shoreline retreats as well as shoreline advancement in some locations. Shoreline mapping along the northern area of Sebou estuary was implemented by applying remote sensing technology to detect and analyze shoreline changes.Multi-temporal satellite images with different periods during the last 37 years (1984-2021) were used to detect changes as well as analyze shoreline change rates. Landsat images (Landsat 5-TM, Thematic Mapper TM, Landsat7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS) were corrected from geometric and radiometric perspectives, then classified by assigning six different classes for analyzing the evolution of the coastal zone from 1984 to 2021. To detect changes in both land use and land cover, the Support Vector Machine algorithm supervised classification was executed to classify the images. As a powerful statistical analysis tool, DSAS was used to assess the rate of shoreline change by EPR technique and to anticipate the required coastal protection measures along the coastline.The classification results show that agricultural land, bare land, and sand-dune beaches have decreased by -8.26%, -5.92%, and -4.53% respectively. On the other hand, statistical analysis of DSAS shows that the northern area of Sebou estuary experienced an average accretion rate of (+0.96 m/yr) while erosion rates achieved an average of (-1.04 m/yr). A drastic erosion was noticeable at the right side of the estuary with (-3.1 m/yr). The decision matrix by EPR method has been developed. It illustrates the evolution, risk level, and proposed decision at each sector along the shorelines during the preceding three decades. The final goal of this study is to support decision-makers in implementing preventive management techniques in the most vulnerable locations. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Understanding "Islandness"
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Islandness is a contested concept, not just between disciplines but also cultures, entangled with what islands, island studies, and island identity are understood to be. The purpose of this article is to explore some of these different meanings, without necessarily unifying or reconciling them, with the aim of keeping multiple understandings of islandness in creative tension. We begin by considering islandness as smallness, recognizing that though many entry points into island studies relate to size in some way, what constitutes small is dependent on both context and worldview. Next, we consider islandness as culture, and the concept of island identity, which is expressed in varied forms. Finally, we consider framings of islands as others, and the extent to which contemporary narratives linked to islands are really inherent to islands or not. Ultimately, we conclude that although there is much to be gained from appreciating differing understandings of islandness, these multiple meanings make it critical to reflect on context wherever the term is used, and exercise care in assigning attributes and outcomes to islandness.

TI  - Wetland mapping at 10 m resolution reveals fragmentation in southern Nigeria
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland ecosystems play key roles in global biogeochemical cycling, but their spatial extent and connectivity is often not well known. Here, we detect the spatial coverage and type of wetlands at 10 m resolution across southern Nigeria (total area: 147,094 km(2)), thought to be one of the most wetland-rich areas of Africa. We use Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery supported by 1500 control points for algorithm training and validation. We estimate that the swamps, marshes, mangroves, and shallow water wetlands of southern Nigeria cover 29,924 km(2) with 2% uncertainty of 460 km(2). We found larger mangrove and smaller marsh extent than suggested by earlier, coarser spatial resolution studies. Average continuous wetland patch areas were 120, 11, 55 and 13 km(2) for mangrove, marsh, swamp, and shallow water respectively. Our final map with 10 m pixels captures small patches of wetland which may not have been observed in earlier mapping exercises, with 20% of wetland patches being < 1 km(;)(2) these were clustered around urban centres, suggesting anthropogenic wetland fragmentation. Our approach fills a knowledge gap between very local (< 400 km(2)) studies reliant on field studies and aerial photos, and low resolution (> 250 m pixel dimensions) global wetland datasets and provides data critical for both improving land-surface climate models and for wetland conservation.

TI  - What is enlightened agriculture? A multi-normative approach to the nature and values of food production systems
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainable development of farming is an agenda with strong normative undertones, yet beyond the call to combine enhanced agricultural output with better environmental outcomes, this normativity is rarely unpacked or analysed with respect to different worldviews and value systems. The normative practices approach is a values-explicit framework for analysing the normativity of social practices; here it is applied to agriculture to provide a critique of sustainability. This helps to clarify the nature of farming and the breadth of sometimes incommensurable visions for its sustainable intensification. It also leads to a values-explicit concept of "enlightened agriculture", defined as models for agricultural systems that explicitly realise aesthetic, jural and moral benefits, possibly at some cost to economic productivity. While any implementation of this qualitative definition will be worldview-dependent, it appears that land-sparing approaches and the promotion of biodiversity per se are unlikely to qualify as enlightened farming, but farming with concern for the wellbeing of humans and non-humans probably does. The recognition that normative worldviews direct social practices implies that there will be profound diversity among visions of good farming, which technical and political proposals ought to account for. In the face of accelerating global change, this diversity may provide both resilience and fertile grounds for new context-sensitive and community-led initiatives.

TI  - Support for the size-mediated sensitivity hypothesis within a diverse carnivore community
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - 1. Carnivore community dynamics are governed by a complex set of often interacting biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors that are increasingly volatile as a result of global change. Understanding how these changing conditions influence carnivore communities is urgent because of the important role carnivores play within ecosystems at multiple trophic levels, and the conservation threats that many carnivores face globally.2. While a great deal of research attention has historically been focused on large carnivores within ecosystems, the size-mediated sensitivity hypothesis has recently been proposed where the smallest carnivore in a system is likely to be the most responsive to the diverse suite of ongoing environmental and anthropogenic changes within ecological communities.3. We deployed camera traps at 197 sites over 4 years to monitor a diverse suite of mammalian carnivores within the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina and then used a two-step occupancy modelling-structural equation modelling framework to investigate the relative support for four primary hypothesized drivers (interspecific competition/predation, habitat complexity, food availability and anthropogenic disturbance) on carnivore occurrence.4. We found that each of the 10 carnivores in our system responded differently to conditions associated with each of these four hypothesized drivers, but that small and medium-sized carnivores had a greater number of significant (p < 0.05) pathways by which these conditions were influencing occupancy relative to large carnivores. In particular, the smallest carnivore observed in our study was the only species for which we found support for each of the four hypothesized drivers influencing occupancy.5. Collectively, our study supports the size-mediated sensitivity hypothesis and suggests that small carnivores are ideal sentinel species for global change. We echo recent calls for adopting a middle-out approach to investigations into carnivore community dynamics by refocusing sustained monitoring and research efforts on smaller carnivores within systems.

TI  - Evaluation of Standardized MODIS-Terra Satellite-Derived Evapotranspiration Using Genetic Algorithm for Better Field Applicability in a Tropical River Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation at different spatial and temporal scales with a paucity of climatic parameters in a river basin is becoming a challenging task. Accurate estimation of ET is necessary for efficient water resource management and improving water efficiency at the field scale. Therefore, this study attempts to indirectly estimate actual ET from version 006 of MODIS-Terra product (MOD16A2.006), Sentinel-2A and Variable infiltration capacity (VIC-3L) model using survey information collected from a traditional paddy field in Kangsabati river basin. Further, this study is undertaken to standardize raw MODIS-Terra ET product (MOD16A2.06) using a genetic-based algorithm for better field applicability at local condition. The MODIS-standardized ET and ET estimated using different methods along with raw MODIS-Terra ET product were evaluated against observed ET estimated using globally recommended FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (PM) equation coupled with a crop coefficient. MODIS-Terra ET estimates were standardized using a genetic-based algorithm to enhance the efficacy of MODIS-Terra ET (MODIS-raw ET) for better field applicability. The result revealed that the genetic-based algorithm (MODIS-standardized ET) improved significantly with the NSE and RMSE from approximately - 0.03 to 0.86 and 13.89 to 2.56 (mm/8 day). Of various ET models Sentinel-2A ET performed best followed by MODIS-standardized ET, VIC-3L ET and MODIS-raw ET with R-2 = 0.92, NSE = 0.89, RMSE = 1.89 (mm/8 day), R-2 = 0.88, NSE = 0.86, RMSE = 2.47 (mm/8 day), R-2 = 0.77, NSE = 0.76, RMSE = 3.02 (mm/8 day) and R-2 = 0.41, NSE = - 0.03, RMSE = 7.31 (mm/8 day), respectively. The result showed that Sentinel 2A and MODIS-standardized-based ET can be used under data scarce conditions for better field applicability and water management practices.

TI  - Axillary management of breast cancer patients with isolated chest wall recurrence after mastectomy.
T2  - Annals of translational medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines on the axillary management of breast cancer patients with isolated chest wall recurrence after mastectomy are unclear. Though sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is possible and may be considered, there is limited data on its usefulness. We aimed to determine if axillary restaging surgery was required in this cohort of patients who developed operable isolated chest wall recurrences after mastectomy.Methods: Breast cancer patients treated at a tertiary institution from 1st September 2005 to 31st October 2017 and developed isolated chest wall invasive recurrences after mastectomy were retrospectively reviewed. We excluded patients with bilateral cancers, concurrent regional or distant metastases, patients without surgery for their chest wall recurrences and patients who were lost to follow-up. The demographics, pathological data and second recurrences were collected from a prospectively maintained database and compared between patients with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), SLNB and no axillary operation.Results: Of the 1,841 patients who underwent mastectomy, 26 (1.4%) patients developed isolated chest wall recurrences. Twenty two eligible patients were analysed. The mean age at diagnosis of the recurrence was 54.7 years (range, 37-84 years). 1, 2 and 19 patients had ALND, SLNB and no axillary operation respectively. On mean follow-up of 38.3 months, no axillary recurrences were noted.Conclusions: In breast cancer patients with isolated chest wall recurrences after mastectomy, axillary restaging surgery can be safely omitted with no increased axillary recurrences on medium term follow-up. This finding could refine existing guidelines in the management of the axilla for patients with chest wall recurrences after mastectomy.

TI  - Burning trees in frozen soil: Simulating fire, vegetation, soil, and hydrology in the boreal forests of Alaska
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Boreal ecosystems account for 29% of the world's total forested area and contain more carbon than any other terrestrial biome. Over the past 60 years, Alaska has warmed twice as rapidly as the contiguous U.S. and wildfire activity has increased, including the number of fires, area burned, and frequency of large wildfire seasons. These recent and rapid changes in climate and wildfire have implications for future vegetation composition, structure, and biomass in interior Alaska, given that the vegetation is highly dependent on active layer thickness, soil moisture, organic layer depth, and plant-available nutrients. Here we developed a new succession extension (DGS) of the LANDIS-II forest landscape model which integrates a vegetation dynamics model (NECN) with a soil carbon model (DAMM-McNiP), a hydrologic model (SHAW), and a deep soil profile permafrost model (GIPL) in a spatially-explicit framework. DGS Succession uses the algorithms in the NECN Succession extension of LANDIS-II to simulate growth, mortality and reproduction of vegetation but has three major improvements. First, the simple bucket model in NECN was replaced with a physically-based model (SHAW) that simulates energy and water fluxes (e.g. snow depth, evapotranspiration, soil moisture) at multiple levels in the canopy and soil. Second, the active, slow, and passive soil pools in NECN were replaced by seven soil pools that are measurable in the field, with carbon and nitrogen dynamics dictated by DAMM-McNiP. Finally, soil temperature and soil moisture are simulated only at one depth in NECN, but in DGS, soil temperature (and hence permafrost dynamics) are simulated at as many as 50 user-defined depths down to 4 m with SHAW and 75 m with GIPL. During the initial calibration phase, DGS was applied at three inventory sites at the Bonanza Creek Long Term Ecological Research area in Interior Alaska where climate forcings, species biomass, soil temperature, and/or soil moisture were available. For the landscape-scale simulations, DGS was run with the SCRPPLE fire extension of LANDIS-II under two scenarios of climate using a similar to 400,000 ha landscape that included the inventory sites. Across all three sites, DGS generally captured the variation in soil moisture and temperature across depths, seasons, and years reasonably well, though there were some discrepancies at each site. DGS had better agreement with field measurements of soil moisture and temperature than its predecessor NECN which produced unrealistically low soil moisture and unrealistically high seasonal fluctuations in soil temperature. At the landscape scale, ignitions, area burned, and soil temperature increased under climate change, as expected, while soil moisture was relatively unchanged across climate scenarios. Biomass tended to decline under climate change, which differs from other modeling studies in this region but is consistent with the browning trends observed from remote sensing data. Simulating climate, vegetation succession, hydrology, permafrost, carbon and nutrient cycling, and wildfire in an integrated, spatially-explicit framework like LANDIS-II will allow us to disentangle the drivers and ecosystem responses in this rapidly changing ecosystem, as well as other forested systems with complex hydrologic, biochemical, cryospheric, and vegetation feedbacks.

TI  - Dense urbanism and economic multi-centrism at third-millennium BC Lagash
T2  - ANTIQUITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of ancient Mesopotamian cities have long focused on their institutions. Here, instead, the authors draw on recent investigations at the third -millennium BC site of Lagash (modern Tell al-Hiba, Iraq) to explore urban density, economy and sustain ability at one of the largest ancient urban centres of the region. Drawing on excavation, environmental and remote-sensing data, the authors adopt a multi scalar approach, revealing dense urban occupation, with subdivision into distinct walled quarters, as well as evidence for multiple foci of intensive industrial production and the exploitation of a rich mosaic of surrounding micro-environments. The study emphasises how a combination of new field data and alternative research directions offers novel insights into early urbanism.

TI  - Estimates of the national burden of respiratory syncytial virus in Kenyan children aged under 5 years, 2010-2018
T2  - BMC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is among the leading childhood causes of viral pneumonia worldwide. Establishing RSV-associated morbidity and mortality is important in informing the development, delivery strategies, and evaluation of interventions.MethodsUsing data collected during 2010-2018 from base regions (population-based surveillance studies in western Kenya and the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance Study), we estimated age-specific rates of acute respiratory illness (ARI), severe acute respiratory illness (SARI-defined as hospitalization with cough or difficulty breathing with onset within the past 10 days), and SARI-associated deaths. We extrapolated the rates from the base regions to other regions of Kenya, while adjusting for risk factors of ARI and healthcare seeking behavior, and finally applied the proportions of RSV-positive cases identified from various sentinel and study facilities to the rates to obtain regional age-specific rates of RSV-associated outpatient and non-medically attended ARI and hospitalized SARI and severe ARI that was not hospitalized (non-hospitalized SARI). We applied age-specific RSV case fatality ratios to SARI to obtain estimates of RSV-associated in- and out-of-hospital deaths.ResultsAmong Kenyan children aged < 5 years, the estimated annual incidence of outpatient and non-medically attended RSV-associated ARI was 206 (95% credible interval, CI; 186-229) and 226 (95% CI; 204-252) per 1000 children, respectively. The estimated annual rates of hospitalized and non-hospitalized RSV-associated SARI were 349 (95% CI; 303-404) and 1077 (95% CI; 934-1247) per 100,000 children respectively. The estimated annual number of in- and out-of-hospital deaths associated with RSV infection in Kenya were 539 (95% CI; 420-779) and 1921 (95% CI; 1495-2774), respectively. Children aged < 6 months had the highest burden of RSV-associated severe disease: 2075 (95% CI; 1818-2394) and 44 (95% CI 25-71) cases per 100,000 children for hospitalized SARI and in-hospital deaths, respectively.ConclusionsOur findings suggest a substantial disease burden due to RSV infection, particularly among younger children. Prioritizing development and use of maternal vaccines and affordable long-lasting monoclonal antibodies could help reduce this burden.

TI  - Improving the accuracy of models to map alpine grassland above-ground biomass using Google earth engine
T2  - GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate modelling and mapping of alpine grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) are crucial for pastoral agriculture planning and management on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (QTP). This study assessed the effectiveness of four popular models (traditional multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and deep neural network (DNN)) with various input combinations (geospatial variables [GV], vegetation types [VT], field measurements [FM], meteorological variables [MV] and observation time [OT]) for AGB estimation based on a new framework for AGB modelling and mapping using Google Earth Engine. The results showed that the input feature of GV had a poor performance in AGB estimation (0.121 < R-2 < 0.591). FM improved the accuracy the most when incorporated with GV (0.815 < R-2 < 0.833). Although MV, VT and OT improved the accuracy (R-2) only by 0.112-0.216 with an importance rank order of MV > VT > OT for machine learning models, their outputs could be used to map AGB. Grass AGB was less accurately predicted than shrub AGB, but the pooling of both VTs improved estimation accuracy (R-2) by 0.171-0.269. The performance of the models followed the ranked order of DNN > ANN > SVM > MLR. DNN had the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.818) using all non-field measured variables (excluding FM) as the inputs, and it was successfully applied to a new dataset (not associated with the data used in the training and testing) with a R-2 of 0.676. This study presents an effective and operational framework for modelling and mapping grassland AGB. Accordingly, it provides the scientific foundations to determine of sustainable grazing carrying capacity in alpine grasslands.

TI  - Analysis of environmental factors impact on water transparency off southeastern Vietnam
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seawater transparency, one of the important parameters to evaluate the marine ecological environment and functions, can be measured using the Secchi disk depth (SDD). In this study, we use multi-source remote sensing data and other fused data from 2011 to 2020 to study the spatial distribution and variation of SDD off southeastern Vietnam. The monthly average of SDD in the study area has obvious seasonal variation characteristics and shows a double peak characteristic. An important observation is a significant decrease in transparency from July to September each year, which is far lower than other nearby seas. To study this low SDD phenomenon, the generalized additive model (GAM) is used to determine the main environmental factors. The response relationship between SDD and environmental factors on different time scales is explained through empirical mode decomposition (EMD) analysis experiments. The results show that the comprehensive explanation rate of the GAM model is 72.1%, and the main environmental factors affecting SDD all have non-linear response relationships with SDD. The contributions are ranked as sea surface salinity (SSS)> offshore current velocity (Cu)> wind direction (WD)> offshore Ekman transport (ETu)> sea surface temperature (SST)> mean direction of wind waves (MDWW). SDD is positively correlated with SSS and SST, and negatively correlated with Cu and ETu. SSS, Cu, ETu, and SST have a significant effect on SDD at interannual scales. Long-term changes in SDD are driven by SSS, Cu, WD, and SST. Generally, SSS has the most comprehensive impact on SDD. WD indirectly has a non-negligible impact on SDD by changing ocean dynamics processes.

TI  - Pre-fire measures of boreal forest structure and composition inform interpretation of post-fire spectral recovery rates
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire is a key driver of forest dynamics in boreal forests; however, the annual area burned in boreal forests is highly variable, with increasing wildfire activity documented over the past half century. Post-fire recovery has important implications for carbon balance, and for the wide range of ecosystem goods and services provisioned by the boreal forest. Monitoring post-fire recovery is challenging given the vast and often inaccessible areas impacted, coupled with the marked variability in post-fire conditions and recovery processes. Field assessments of recovery are constrained in space and time, whereas remotely sensed data are spatially explicit, cover large areas, and can retrospectively provide assessments of pre- and post-fire conditions and establish spectral recovery baselines. However, there is a need to link spectral measures of recovery to manifestations of post-fire forest recovery on the ground. Understanding how different forest characteristics influence spectral recovery is key to the successful application of spectral recovery metrics for forest management applications in different forest environments. Herein, using a synthesis of plot data for the North American boreal forest, we assess the influence of pre- and post-fire field-measured characteristics on spectral recovery rates, with a focus on stem density and composition in Canadian boreal forests. Plots that experienced rapid spectral recovery (as measured using Landsat-derived NBR time series data) were associated with a transition from conifer to broadleaf or were broadleaf pre-fire. Plots that experienced a decrease in stem density took significantly longer to spectrally recover than plots that experienced no change in stem density. Plots that had not yet spectrally recovered by the end of the time series were associated with higher elevations, drier sites, greater pre-fire basal area, and had the greatest change magnitude. Our results emphasize that recovery is a process that is highly variable and that knowledge of pre-fire condition is important for characterizing and interpreting measures of post-fire spectral recovery for forest management applications. Remotely sensed time series data are uniquely able to provide information on both pre- and post-fire condition. Our analysis of pre- and post-fire field measures provided novel insights regarding the influence of forest composition and changes in stem density on measures of post-fire spectral recovery in boreal forests.

TI  - Satellite-derived bathymetry combined with Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2 datasets using machine learning
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Most satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) methods developed thus far from passive remote sensing data have required in situ water depth, thus limiting their utility in areas with no in situ data. Recently, new Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) observations have shown great potential in providing high-precision a priori water depth benefits from range-resolved lidar. In this study, we propose a combined active and passive remote sensing SDB method using only satellite data. An adaptive ellipse DBSCAN (AE-DBSCAN) algorithm is introduced to derive a priori bathymetric data from ICESat-2 data to automatically adapt to the terrain change complexity, and then we use these a priori bathymetric data in Sentinel-2 images to help build a model between remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) and water depth. Three machine learning (ML) methods are then employed, and the performances compared with conventional empirical SDB models are presented. After that, the results using different Sentinel-2 Rrs band combinations and the effects with and without atmospheric correction on ML-based SDB are discussed. The results showed that our AE-DBSCAN method performs better than the standard DBSCAN method, and the ML-based SDB can achieve an overall RMSE of less than 1.5 m in St. Thomas better than the traditional SDB method. They also indicate that ML-based SDB can obtain a relatively high-precision water depth without atmospheric correction, which helps to improve processing efficiency by avoiding a complex atmospheric correction process.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Accurate and timely crop maps are crucial for monitoring agricultural production. Current supervised classification methods based on remote sensing rely heavily on ground-truth samples collected at a high cost, and the years without sampling highly limit classification accuracy. To address such a challenge, we proposed a time-migration method based on historical training samples collected in 2017, 2018 and 2020 to conduct supervised crop classification mapping in the target year (2021) with no ground samples. We chose Hailun City, Heilongjiang Province of northeastern China, as the study site; the major crops included corn, soybean, and rice. We reconstructed time series of Sentinel-2 data and selected spectro-temporal features to identify standard crop phenological curves. We calculated the similarity between reference and image spectra and designed label-matching rules to identify training samples through the dynamic time warping algorithm. We then used the historical samples to map the crop types of the target year. The results showed that the migration accuracy reached 95% for major crop. Using these samples as training data with a random forest to classify the target year, the overall accuracy reached 94.13%. The new sample time-migration method proposed in this study can efficiently migrate historical samples, greatly reducing the cost of ground-truth sampling.

AB  - Synergistic use of satellite data has an advantage over single-source data as optical, thermal, and microwave datasets. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy and focused mainly on the edge of the multisensory data over the stand-alone system due to primarily multi-dimension input. Crop classification and crop type mapping is the first step in the natural resource management theme, especially in agriculture. During the rainy season, accurate crop classification with crop-cultivar type mapping is the most challenging target to achieve using optical datasets. Therefore, the study's prime focus was to extract the temporal signature of rice crop types from multi-temporal SAR datasets and classify various rice crop types based on sowing timing in the dominant production zone of rice, the Jashore district of Bangladesh. Sentinel-1 datasets were used primarily for the rainy season from July to September 2018; in addition, Sentinel-2 data of October was used to understand the relationships among these datasets. The temporal signature of various types of rice and others features was interpreted. Besides, the correlation between Sentinel-1 backscatter with Sentinel-2 derived indices has been exercised to find out a comprehensive framework for selection of optical vegetation indices which may be used as a proxy of SAR or vice-versa. The classified image from Sentinel-2 has around 80% overall accuracy, and 0.71 value of kappa coefficient for rice crop type mapping was comparable to SAR (about 80% for late sown crop and slightly less for the other 2 classes); class accuracy of the rice crop is 88-90% using three-date dual-polarized data. The latter's advantage is early estimate availability during the initial crop phase when optical data is not available. Three types of rice were observed to be cultivated; these are early transplanted rice, late transplanted rice, and very late transplanted rice; among them, late transplanted rice covered a large area, and early transplanted rice covered lesser areas during the session. Sentinel-2 derived spectral indices have a higher correlation with very late rice crop type for VV backscatter than early (where the response in VH was significant probably after saturation in VV response due to matured crop) and late rice crop types. Understanding the micro and macro-scale crop structure from a multisource- remote-sensing perspective builds novelty in this research.

TI  - A pilot study of lymphoscintigraphy with tracer injection into the human brain
T2  - JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Many groups have reported lymphatic and glymphatic structures in animal and human brains, but tracer injection into the human brain to demonstrate real-time lymphatic drainage and mapping has not been described. We enrolled patients undergoing standard-of-care resection or stereotactic biopsy for suspected intracranial tumors. Patients received peritumoral injections of Tc-99m-tilmanocept followed by planar or tomographic imaging. Fourteen patients with suspected brain tumors were enrolled. One was excluded from analysis because of tracer leakage during injection. There was no drainage of Tc-99m-tilmanocept to regional lymph nodes in any of the patients. On average, after correcting for radioactive decay, 70.7% (95% CI: 59.9%, 81.6%) of the tracer in the injection site and 78.1% (95% CI: 71.1%, 85.1%) in the whole-head on the day of surgery remained the morning after, with variable radioactivity in the subarachnoid space. The retained fraction was much greater than expected based on the clearance rate from non-brain injection sites. In this pilot study, the lymphatic tracer Tc-99m-tilmanocept was injected into the brain parenchyma, and there was no drainage outside the brain to the cervical lymph nodes. Our work demonstrates an inefficiency of drainage from peritumoral brain parenchyma and highlights a therapeutic opportunity to improve immunosurveillance of the brain.

TI  - Understanding the natural expansion of white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa) in an ephemeral inlet based on geomorphological analysis and remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The interactions between local tides and river discharges are crucial in the processes related to the recruitment of mangrove propagules in estuarine systems. This investigation aimed to determine the causes of the recent natural recruitment and expansion of Laguncularia racemosa in mudflats within an ephemeral inlet in Mexico. We con-ducted a fluvial and coastal geomorphology assessment with spaceborne and UAV-based images. We deployed and recorded continuous data loggers in the estuarine system to assess water level and salinity. Depending on the available data, we used a combination of cloud-computing Google Earth Engine, UAV-Digital Surface Models, LiDAR, Google Earth images, and biophysical variables to monitor mangrove forests from 2005 to 2022. When the inlet is open, the estuarine system presents a full tidal range (similar to 1-1.5 m) with a strong salinity gradient (0-35 mS/cm), in contrast to the strong freshwater influence and minimal water level variability (<10 cm) that prevails for three months when the inlet is closed. Once the mouth of the river closes, there is considerable sediment accumulation, creating mudflat areas adjacent to the mangrove forests where Laguncularia racemosa propagules begin to establish under minimal water level variability and oligohaline conditions. After 16 years, the new forest expanded by 12.3 ha, presenting a very high density (10000 stems/ha), a considerable basal area (54-63 m(2)/ha), and a maximum canopy height of 15.8 m, which largely surpasses that of other semiarid Laguncularia racemosa forests within permanent open-inlet systems or even in ephemeral inlets with different hydrological conditions. Our study will help to understand the causes of natural Laguncularia racemosa recruitment in extremely dynamic systems.

TI  - Managing rain-fed uplands of cascaded tank village systems: What stakeholders really suggest?
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Achieving land degradation neutrality through sustainable land management requires stakeholder collaboration. Understanding of stakeholders' worldviews facilitates fostering stakeholder collaboration. Re- ported lack of stakeholder collaboration in CTVS-related conservation and development programs may be due to stakeholders' competing worldviews and marginalizing primary stakeholders' viewpoints.OBJECTIVE: This study systematically investigates stakeholders' worldviews on sustainable management of the rain-fed uplands of CTVS.METHODS: The Q-Methodology was used with a Q set of 54 land management activities. Twenty-seven re- spondents with different expertise were given a forced-choice distribution grid (Q-sorts): an 11-point scale (ranging from-5=least important I think to +5 most important I think) to rank the Q-Set. Using the principal component analysis with varimax rotation in Ken-Q Analysis Desktop Edition Q sorts were analyzed.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders' worldviews towards sustainable rain-fed uplands are four-fold (extension-driven approaches, community-driven approaches, solution-based approaches and punitive control ap- proaches), based on power and facilitation and irrespective of their social backgrounds. Many worldviews do not compete and can facilitate stakeholder collaboration, whereas the worldview that relies on coercion to achieve conservation behavior may be a potential bottleneck for stakeholder reconciliation.SIGNIFICANCE: This study has demonstrated how useful it is to utilize a systematic investigation to understand stakeholders' worldviews towards conservation solutions. As a result, it facilitates exploring challenges and opportunities by policymakers to facilitate cooperation between stakeholders while avoiding bottlenecks to achieve sustainable management of rain-fed uplands in CTVS.

TI  - Augmented reality games in linguistic education: model of cultural concepts in the linguistic worldview of philology students
T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The research aims to prove the effectiveness of introducing linguoculturology, sociolinguistics, ethnolinguistics, pragmastilistics and psycholinguistics using augmented reality tools into the learning process. For this, the method of quasi-experiment was used. The study involved 75 students studying the Kazakh language at the Department of Kazakh Linguistics at Al-Farabi Kazakh National University. They were offered to study the following disciplines: sociolinguistics, ethnolinguistics, linguoculturology, pragmastilistics, and psycholinguistics for one academic year. The results showed that students improved their Kazakhstan culture knowledge. The percentage of participants with a high knowledge level increased from 5 to 22%, with an average level - from 70 to 74%. The number of students with poor knowledge of cultural concepts decreased by 11%. This contributed to the improvement of students' expertise in culture, as well as in the language. The best descriptors of the proposed games were: "funny", "useful", "motivating", and "relevant". In the survey, 68 out of 75 students (90%) described the experience as "fun", 60 out of 75 students (80%) responded as "rewarding", and 57 out of 75 participants (76%) described the experience as "motivating". Thus, the integration of the games into the learning process had a positive impact on the development of philology students' linguistic and cognitive skills. The research results can eliminate theoretical and empirical gaps in the language teaching methodology. Similar studies can focus on a detailed analysis of other augmented reality or virtual reality games.

TI  - Analysis of the impact of expressway construction on soil moisture in road areas
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - To reveal the effect pattern of expressways on regional soil moisture, in this study, using trend analysis and buffer zone analysis methods, the data of VSWI (vegetation supply water index) in central Zhejiang Province from 2005 to 2016 were extracted from landsat7 satellite data using a single window algorithm, and spatial analysis was used to investigate the law of its differentiation. The results show that the multi-year average is 0.01879, between 0.01035-0.02774, showing a gentle decreasing trend, and there are obvious regional variations in space. We found that the impact of the new expressway and interchange on the VSWI in the buffer zone lasted for more than two years, and the VSWI increased in space farther away from the road, and this trend returned to normal at 8 km. Finally, the development patterns of the VSWI in the buffer zone of the newly established expressway and the interchange are approximately the same.

TI  - Application of different watershed units to debris flow susceptibility mapping: A case study of Northeast China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of this study was to compare two types of watershed units divided by the hydrological analysis method (HWUs) and mean curvature method (CWUs) for debris flow susceptibility mapping (DFSM) in Northeast China. Firstly, a debris flow inventory map consisting of 129 debris flows and 129 non-debris flows was randomly divided into a ratio of 70% and 30% for training and testing. Secondly, 13 influencing factors were selected and the correlations between these factors and the debris flows were determined by frequency ration analysis. Then, two types of watershed units (HWUs and CWUs) were divided and logistic regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), classification and regression tree (CART) and Bayesian network (BN) were selected as the evaluation models. Finally, the predictive capabilities of the models were verified using the predictive accuracy (ACC), the Kappa coefficient and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The mean AUC, ACC and Kappa of four models (LR, MLP, CART and BN) in the training stage were 0.977, 0.931, and 0.861, respectively, for the HWUs, while 0.961, 0.905, and 0.810, respectively, for the CWUs; in the testing stage, were 0.904, 0.818, and 0.635, respectively, for the HWUs, while 0.883, 0.800, and 0.601, respectively, for the CWUs, which showed that HWU model has a higher debris flow prediction performance compared with the CWU model. The CWU-based model can reflect the spatial distribution probability of debris flows in the study area overall and can be used as an alternative model.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of ginkgolide B-lyophilized nanoparticles after intravenous injection in rats using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
T2  - RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - RationaleGinkgolide B (GB) performs diverse pharmacological activities but has poor water solubility. The currently available GB injections have a short half-life and are lethal when injected rapidly. We prepared GB-lyophilized nanoparticles (GB-NPs) using a new nonsurfactant polysaccharide polymer, ZY-010, as its carrier to regulate the release of GB in vivo. Here, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GB-NPs after intravenous injection in rats was performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). MethodsThe samples were separated on an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C 18 column (2.1 x 50 mm, 1.85 mu m) maintained at 30 degrees C. The MS/MS transitions of GB and glibenclamide as the internal standard (IS) were set at m/z 423.1 -> 367.1 and m/z 492.1 -> 367.0, respectively. The standard curve of GB content was constructed, and the specificity, sensitivity, precision, and extraction recovery of LC-MS/MS analysis were assessed. The main PK parameters were analyzed using DAS (Drug And Statistics for Windows) software, version 2.0. ResultsThe retention time of GB and IS at elution was 2.77 and 4.75 min, respectively. An excellent linear response across the concentration range of 0.001-100 mu g/ml was achieved (r = 0.9997). The relative standard deviation value of precision was less than 10%. The total extraction recovery was above 80.76 +/- 2.08%. The main PK parameters for the GB-NPs were as follows: t(1/2) = 69.32 h, AUC((0 -> infinity)) = 188 312.97 +/- 143 312.41 mu g/L h, CL = 0.03 +/- 0.02 L/h/kg, and V = 0.09 +/- 0.05 L/kg. The t(1/2) of the GB-NPs was significantly longer than that of GB solution, and AUC((0 -> infinity)) of GB-NPs was about 1.4 times that of GB solution. The PK data demonstrated that the blood concentration of GB in rats conformed to a three-compartment model in both GB solution and GB-NPs. ConclusionA rapid and accurate LC-MS/MS method was established for the determination of GB-NPs in rats. GB-NPs exhibited a sustained-release behavior in vivo compared with GB solution.

TI  - Sea-level trend variability in the Mediterranean during the 1993-2019 period
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-level change is one of the most concerning climate change and global warming consequences, especially impacting coastal societies and environments. The spatial and temporal variability of sea level is neither linear nor globally uniform, especially in semi-enclosed basins such as the Mediterranean Sea, which is considered a hot spot regarding expected impacts related to climate change. This study investigates sea-level trends and their variability over the Mediterranean Sea from 1993 to 2019. We use gridded sea-level anomaly products from satellite altimetry for the total observed sea level, whereas ocean temperature and salinity profiles from reanalysis were used to compute the thermosteric and halosteric effects, respectively, and the steric component of the sea level. We perform a statistical change point detection to assess the spatial and temporal significance of each trend change. The linear trend provides a clear indication of the non-steric effects as the dominant drivers over the entire period at the Mediterranean Sea scale, except for the Levantine and Aegean sub-basins, where the steric component explains the majority of the sea-level trend. The main changes in sea-level trends are detected around 1997, 2006, 2010, and 2016, associated with Northern Ionian Gyre reversal episodes, which changed the thermohaline properties and water mass redistribution over the sub-basins.

TI  - Spectral saturation in the remote sensing of high-density vegetation traits: A systematic review of progress, challenges, and prospects
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The saturation of spectral reflectance within densely vegetated regions is a renowned challenge that has precluded the optimal use of broad-band remotely sensed data and its derivatives for vegetation monitoring. While several reviews on the remote sensing of biomass have been published to date, an attempt to document and better understand the spectral reflectance saturation of vegetation has largely remained elusive. This article provides a comprehensive bibliometric assessment of the spectral reflectance saturation problem. The review profiles historical developments and maps the current remote sensing landscape of high-density Aboveground biomass and Leaf Area Index, with emphasis on the physical principles, proxies and methodologies as well as exploring the challenges and opportunities thereof. The review showed a skewed distribution of research between the Global North and South as well as variability in signal saturation levels of sensors according to the type, structure, and species composition of vegetation. Signal saturation is also dependent on the type of sensor used with the wavelength position and polarisation playing a pivotal role. The review also showed frequent usage of SAR backscatter and Lidar-based sensors for large-scale mapping, particularly in forests as compared to optical sensors. The fusion of waveform lidar indices with other sensors provides unprecedented opportunities for solving signal saturation problems. While used at localised and laboratory scales, narrow-band vegetation indices from hyperspectral sensors also significantly improved high-density biomass estimation. It is concluded that despite improvements generally in sensor capabilities and algorithm development, there is no uniform method for improving biomass estimation in dense vegetation. This calls for further research on understanding the fundamental relationship between spectral reflectance measurements and vegetation type, leaf orientation, vertical and horizontal structural parameters in dense vegetated regions. The development of appropriate sensors, fusion of optical and microwave data and improvement of retrieval approaches that transcend vegetation types and their associated traits is critical.

TI  - Spatial analysis of particulate matter (PM10) using MODIS aerosol optical thickness observations and GIS over East Malaysia
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though there are expert monitoring and assessment stations in large cities, air quality monitoring and measurement have a high cost and face significant issues. Data on air pollution can be acquired from remote sensing satellites for large areas and at a reasonable expense to compensate for monitoring sta-tions on the ground. This research presented a method for retrieving PM10 from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) records. The study depends on a previously established equation to retrieve PM10 over Malaysia in September 2014. In Contrast Reduction Technique, we used Aerosol Robotic Network AERONET AOT to define the reference. The con-version factors, representing the relationship between AOT and PM10 satellite columns, were determined using a mathematical approach. The size and type of aerosol, relative humidity, and boundary layer height vary globally and seasonally, thus the AOT-PM10 relationship fluctuates spatially and temporally. The conversion factor was then applied to the MODIS image to predict the surface level of PM10 concen-trations in micrograms via cubic meter (lg/m3). Moreover, the achieved correlation coefficient R2 of cal-culated PM10 based on ground truth data was equal to 0.92. Based on the results obtained from the thematic maps, PM10 levels are significantly higher in specific cities such as Kuala Lumpur and Johor. Where PM10 ranged from (26.5 to 72) lg/m3, while AOT values were between (0.12 and 0.83). It raises concerns about the environmental health threats and their relationship to air quality in these regions as a research topic.(c) 2023 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Emerging phycotoxins in the Chilean coast: First localized detection of the neurotoxic cyclic imine Pinnatoxin-G in shellfish banks
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Pinnatoxins (PnTXs) produced by the cosmopolitan dinoflagellate Vulcanodinium rugosum are highly potent cyclic imines that represent a risk for seafood consumers, artisanal fisheries, and the local aquaculture industry. Among the eight known PnTXs, pinnatoxin-G (PnTX-G) is the most frequent toxin analog detected in shellfish. Despite PnTX-G is still not internationally regulated, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety established that a risk for human consumers may exist when the accumulation of PnTX-G in shellfish exceeds 23 mu g kg(-1). This study reports the first detection of these fast-acting lipophilic toxins in localized shellfish banks (Mytilus chilensis) from the Chilean coast. Among 32 sentinel sampling stations monthly monitored for phytotoxins detection and quantification between 2021 and 2022 along the southern Chilean coast (from 36 degrees 25 ' S to 54 degrees 57 ' S), PnTx-G was only detected in shellfish from the southernmost region of Magallanes in concentrations that ranged between 15 and 100 mu g kg(-1), highlighting the binational (Chile/Argentina) Beagle Channel as a 'hotspot'. As Chile is one of the major mussel producers worldwide, this result raises concern about the potential adverse effect of PnTXs for human health and point to the need of governmental actions for an enhanced monitoring of these emerging toxins. To date, the production of PnTXs has not yet been associated with any microalgae species in Chilean waters.

T2  - Scientific Reports
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in the Zemplinska Sirava water reservoir and adjacent tributaries in the Bodrog River Basin were investigated using a fish-parasite sentinel system. PCB concentrations were detected in various fish matrices (dorsal and abdominal muscles, liver and intestine) of the Wels catfish (Silurus glanis) and its intestinal cestode Glanitaenia osculata. PCB concentrations in the fish from the water reservoir, located closest to the chemical plant, the primary source of the PCB pollution, were the highest. The analysis of these contaminants in catfish matrices showed the highest concentrations in the abdominal muscle, followed by the dorsal muscle, liver and intestine. Concentrations of n-ary sumation PCBs exceeding the limits for food set by European regulations were measured in the muscle tissue of catfish at all sites, even in the Bodrog River, 60 km away from the primary source of contamination, posing a significant risk to humans in the Zemplin region. For the first time, the ability of cestode G. osculata to accumulate higher amounts of PCBs compared to fish matrices has been demonstrated. Due to the enormous ability of the parasites to accumulate PCBs, we recommend this approach for alternative biomonitoring of PCBs in contaminated aquatic environments.

TI  - Mapping Annual Cropping Pattern from Time-Series MODIS EVI Using Parameter-Tuned Random Forest Classifier
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring agriculture growth at different seasons (i.e., Rabi-winter crop, Zaid-summer crop, Kharif-monsoon crop) is an important requirement to understand annual cropping pattern dynamics for food security-related policy and strategy formulation. Cropping pattern is not uniform across a region and hence satellite observation of different time-period over a year is inevitable in such cases, but the associated big-data processing and accuracy requirements makes the problem more pertinent to study. Non-parametric machine learning (ML) algorithms have a higher ability to deal with such information extraction problem related to high-dimensional time-series satellite data, especially to infer multi-growth agriculture patterns. The current study aims to explore one of the popular ML algorithm, i.e., Random Forest (RF), along with two conventional supervised algorithms [i.e., Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM)] for annual cropping pattern mapping in Bihar State of India using MODIS time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The RF algorithm was tuned to test its sensitivity with diverse combinations of model parameters, training sample data, and input variables. Tuning options for training samples and input variables have provided a possibility to understand the optimality and infer important temporal periods to detect cropping patterns with less data. In addition, the analysis also revealed that though a high degree of collinearity (i.e., r >= 0.9) exists in time-series EVI data due to the presence of multiple growing and decaying phases of crop, it does not negatively affect the model performance. The blind random sample-based assessment reveals that RF excelled in accuracy (81.47%) over MLC (67.47%) and SAM (52.53%).

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on the Urban Thermal Environment of Edmonton, Canada
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on urban environments are addressed in many recent studies. However, limited research has been conducted to examine the impact of the pandemic on anthropogenic emissions over urban land use types, and their relation to socioeconomic characteristics. Anthropogenic heat, as the main contributor to the urban temperature, is changed by the sudden halt imposed by COVID-19 lockdowns. This study thus focuses on previously under-explored urban thermal environments by quantifying the impact of COVID-19 on urban thermal environments across different land-use types and related socioeconomic drivers in Edmonton, Canada. Using Landsat images, we quantified and mapped the spatial pattern of land surface temperature (LST) for business, industrial, and residential land use areas during both the pandemic lockdown and pre-pandemic periods in the study area. Results show that temperature declined in business and industrial areas and increased in residential areas during the pandemic lockdown. Canadian census and housing price data were then used to identify the potential drivers behind the LST anomaly of residential land use. The most important variables that affected LST during the lockdown were found to be median housing price, visible minority population, postsecondary degree, and median income. This study adds to the expanding body of literature about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing unique insights into the effect of lockdown on a city's thermal environments across different land use types and highlights critical issues of socioeconomic inequalities, which is useful for future heat mitigating and health equity-informed responses.

TI  - Dynamics of aerosol, humidity, and clouds in air masses travelling over Fennoscandian boreal forests
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Boreal forests cover vast areas of land in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, which are under amplified climate warming. The interactions between the forests and the atmosphere are known to generate a complex set of feedback processes. One feedback process, potentially producing a cooling effect, is associated with an increased reflectance of clouds due to aerosol-cloud interactions. Here, we investigate the effect that the boreal forest environment can have on cloud-related properties during the growing season. The site investigated was the SMEAR II station in Hyytiala, Finland. Air mass back trajectories were the basis of the analysis and were used to estimate the time each air mass had spent over land prior to its arrival at the station. This enabled tracking the changes occurring in originally marine air masses as they travelled across the forested land. Only air masses arriving from the northwestern sector were investigated, as these areas have a relatively uniform forest cover and relatively little anthropogenic interference. We connected the air mass analysis with comprehensive in situ and remote-sensing data sets covering up to 11 growing seasons. We found that the properties of air masses with short land transport times, thereby less influenced by the forest, differed from those exposed to the forest environment for a longer period. The fraction of air masses with cloud condensation nuclei concentrations (at 0.2 % supersaturation) above the median value of 180 cm(-3) of the analysed air masses increased from approximately 10 % to 80 % after 55 h of exposure to boreal forest, while the fraction of air masses with specific humidity above the median value of 5 g kg(-1) increased from roughly 25 % to 65 %. Signs of possible resulting changes in the cloud layer were also observed from satellite measurements. Lastly, precipitation frequency increased from the average of approximately 7 % to about 12 % after a threshold of 50 h of land transport. Most of the variables showed an increase with an increasing land transport time until approximately 50-55 h, after which a balance with little further variation seemed to have been reached. This appears to be the approximate timescale in which the forest-cloud interactions take effect and the air masses adjust to the local forest environment.

TI  - Remote sensing and climate services improve irrigation water management at farm scale in Western-Central India
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The enormous progress in weather and extended range predictions for the Indian monsoon over the last decade has not been translated to operationalized irrigation water management tools despite many agricultural advisories from operational agencies. The limited implementation is mainly due to the resolution mismatches of forecasts and decision needs and a lack of soil moisture monitoring networks. Sustained soil moisture monitoring suffers from the high cost to farmers in installing distributed sensors. Here we develop an irrigation water management tool for the farmers at farm scale, which starts with utilizing and merging a few available soil moisture sensors and L-band satellite observations of surface soil moisture using machine learning. Such derived soil moisture field is used as the initial condition with the multi-ensemble future rainfall for the following few weeks given the weather/extended range forecasts in a farm-scale ecohydrological model. This ecohydrological model is integrated with Monte-Carlo simulations within a stochastic optimization framework to minimize water use while not allowing the soil moisture to drop below a threshold level with a certain probability. The optimization results in water arrangement decisions 2 weeks in advance and water application decisions 1-7 days in advance. We also estimate the water storage capacity needed at farm scale for effective water utilization. We find that 20-45 % and 17-35 % water savings were achievable for Kharif and Rabi seasons, respectively, without losing any yield when applied to grape farms of Nashik, Maharashtra, India. The proposed framework is co-developed with the farmers and can be used in any region for any crops, since it is generalized and easy to transfer. This is an extension of our earlier work to an end-to-end system using satellite data for soil moisture.

TI  - Cropland fallow reduces agricultural water consumption by 303 million tons annually in Gansu Province, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-intensity utilization of global cropland causes water shortage and food crisis, which seriously affects the re-alization of SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 15 (life on land), and threatens the sus-tainable social, economic and ecological development. Cropland fallow can not only improve the quality of cropland and maintain ecosystem balance, but also have a significant water-saving effect. However, in most developing coun-tries, such as China, cropland fallow has not yet been widely promoted, and there are few reliable fallow cropland fallow identification methods, making it even more challenging to assess the water-saving effect. To remedy this def-icit, we propose a framework for mapping cropland fallow and evaluating its water savings. First, we used the Landsat series of data to interpret the annual land use/cover changes in Gansu Province, China from 1991 to 2020. Subse-quently, the spatial-temporal variation of cropland fallow in Gansu province (giving up farming for one to two years) was mapped. Finally, we evaluated the water-saving effect of cropland fallow using evapotranspiration, precip-itation, irrigation maps, and crop-related data, instead of actual water consumption. The results showed that the map-ping accuracy of fallow land in Gansu Province was 79.50 %, which was higher than that of most known fallow mapping studies. From 1993 to 2018, the average annual fallow rate in Gansu Province, China, was 10.86 %, which was ata low level in arid/semi-arid regions worldwide. More importantly, from 2003 to 2018, cropland fallow reduces annual water consumption of 303.26 million tons in Gansu Province, accounting for 3.44 % of agricultural water use in Gansu Province and equivalent to the annual water demand of 655,000 people in Gansu Province. Based on our re-search, we speculate that the increasing pilot projects of cropland fallow in China can bring significant water-saving effects and help achieve China's Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Lateral pelvic sentinel lymph node biopsy using indocyanine green fluorescence navigation: can it be a powerful supplement tool for predicting the status of lateral pelvic lymph nodes in advanced lower rectal cancer
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAn innovative instrument for laparoscopy using indocyanine green (ICG) allows easy detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in lateral pelvic lymph nodes (LPLNs). Here, we investigated the safety and efficacy of lateral pelvic SLN biopsy (SLNB) using ICG fluorescence navigation in advanced lower rectal cancer and evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of this technique to predict the status of LPLN.MethodsFrom April 1, 2017 to December 1, 2020, we conducted lateral pelvic SLNB using ICG fluorescence navigation during laparoscopic total mesorectal excision and lateral pelvic lymph node dissection (LLND) in 23 patients with advanced low rectal cancer who presented with LPLN but without LPLN enlargement. Data regarding clinical characteristics, surgical and pathological outcomes, lymph node findings, and postoperative complications were collected and analyzed.ResultsWe successfully performed the surgery using fluorescence navigation. One patient underwent bilateral LLND and 22 patients underwent unilateral LLND. The lateral pelvic SLN were clearly fluorescent before dissection in 21 patients. Lateral pelvic SLN metastasis was diagnosed in 3 patients and negative in 18 patients by frozen pathological examination. Among the 21 patients in whom lateral pelvic SLN was detected, the dissected lateral pelvic non-SLNs were all negative. All dissected LPLNs were negative in two patients without fluorescent lateral pelvic SLN.ConclusionThis study indicated that lateral pelvic SLNB using ICG fluorescence navigation shows promise as a safe and feasible procedure for advanced lower rectal cancer with good accuracy, and no false-negative cases were found. No metastasis in SLNB seemed to reflect all negative LPLN metastases, and this technique can replace preventive LLND for advanced lower rectal cancer.

TI  - Multiple factors induce temporal shifts in herbaceous plant leaf senescence dates on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant autumn phenology affects ecosystem carbon and water cycles. However, autumn phenological shifts of herbaceous plants and their primary regulators on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) remain uncertain because previous studies were mainly based on remote sensing data. Studies using ground autumn phenological data observed at many stations are very few. This study explored the primary drivers of temporal shifts in leaf senescence date (LSD) and assessed the relative importance of climatic factors and spring phenophases to LSD shifts using correlation analysis, general linear regression, and partial least squares regression based on 1685 phenological records at 27 stations on the QTP. Results showed that, preseason total precipitation (PRE) and minimum air temperature (Tmin) had higher correlation coefficients with LSD and displayed more extensive importance in predicting LSD than other factors. Despite larger influences, contributions of PRE and Tmin to LSD inter-annual variations were only 14.9% and 14.2%, respectively. In total, PRE and air temperatures (TEMs) just explained 38.0% of LSD temporal shifts. These results indicate that although PRE and TEMs are the major regulators of LSD, temporal shifts in LSD are controlled by multiple factors. Overall, climatic factors and spring phenology contributed 53.7% and 15.6% to LSD variations, respectively, which means that climate change obviously outweighed spring phenology in driving LSD shifts. Our study revealed a critical role of PRE in regulating LSD shifts directly or indirectly by enhancing the sensitivity of LSD to TEMs. Moreover, we found that the impacts of precipitation change were more prominent on LSD of sedges than those of grasses and forbs. Therefore, we suggest that accurate autumn phenological models for plants on the QTP should include multiple factors and incorporate the influences of precipitation. This study can also provide insight into QTP grassland management from the perspective of phenological responses to climate change.

TI  - Progress in the study of biomarkers for early prediction of systemic inflammatory response syndrome after percutaneous nephrolithotomy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Urolithiasis is a common and frequent disease in urology. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is preferred for the treatment of upper urinary tract stones and complicated renal stones >2 cm in diameter, but it has a higher rate of postoperative complications, especially infection, compared with other minimally invasive treatments for urinary stones. Complications associated with infection after percutaneous nephrolithotomy include transient fever, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and sepsis, which is considered one of the most common causes of perioperative death after percutaneous nephrolithotomy. In contrast, SIRS serves as a sentinel for sepsis, so early intervention of SIRS by biomarker identification can reduce the incidence of postoperative sepsis, which in turn reduces the length of stay and hospital costs for patients. In this paper, we summarize traditional inflammatory indicators, novel inflammatory indicators, composite inflammatory indicators and other biomarkers for early identification of systemic inflammatory response syndrome after percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

TI  - Benign effects of logging on aerial insectivorous bats in Southeast Asia revealed by remote sensing technologies
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1.Logging is the most widespread disturbance in tropical forests, altering ecological communities and functions. However, many species can persist in logged forests, particularly where disturbance is low. Despite a growing understanding of how logging affects wildlife, there remains little information for Southeast Asia's bats-in part due to major challenges in monitoring.2. We integrated remote sensing data from passive acoustic bat detectors with LiDAR-derived measures of forest structure from a human-modified landscape in Sabah, Borneo. Our appraisal of logging effects benefitted from a semi-automated classifier of bat calls that vastly speeds up the analysis of acoustic recording data. We recorded 105,576 bat passes from 21 phonic groups across a habitat disturbance gradient, comprising old-growth forest, repeatedly logged forest and tree plantations.3. We show that logging pressure (as depicted by changes to habitat quality, e.g. canopy height or shape) had negligible impact on the acoustic activity of bats. However, bat activity was higher in areas with a greater extent of high-biomass forest, as well as areas with greater topographical ruggedness. Logged forest supported higher levels of activity for several common bat phonic groups compared to old-growth forest. Across the landscape, plantations supported the lowest levels of bat activity, representing a threefold decrease compared to old-growth forest, and several species were not recorded in this habitat.4. We found different call groups demonstrated different responses to forest disturbance. Sheath-tailed bats (Emballonura spp.) were active across all habitat types and were the most resilient to logging. Edge/open foragers were more prevalent in highly forested and topographically rugged areas. Horseshoe and leaf-nosed bats (flutter clutter foragers) demonstrated idiosyncratic responses to logging but were consistently absent from plantations.5. Synthesis and applications. Logged forests can provide an important refuge for many common bat species in Southeast Asia, but do not capture the full breadth of forest-specialist species. Nevertheless, logged forests provide substantially better habitat for bats than tree plantations. While aerial insectivorous bats sampled via acoustic methods are poor indicators of forest disturbance overall, several species that respond predictably to logging could be targeted for biodiversity monitoring using acoustic and capture-based methods.

TI  - Integrating multi-sensor observations and rainfall-runoff inundation modeling for mapping flood extents over the Nile River basin: example from the 2020 flooding in Sudan
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the dynamics of flooding events is crucial to mitigate flood risks, particularly in developing nations like Sudan. This study combines multi-sensor approaches with Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) modeling to predict flood inundation extent over the Nile River Basin (NRB). Building upon the RRI model, we firstly simulated the streamflow over the Blue Nile basin and the White Nile basin. Our results show a good agreement between the observed and the simulated streamflow at both daily and monthly scales, e.g. NSE = 0.72 and R-2 = 0.85 for daily simulations at Khartoum station. Further, we compared the inundation extents from the RRI model with derived inundation maps from different satellite images (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and MODIS). The results indicate the potential to overcome the limitation of data scarcity in developing regions and hence provide a supportive assessment tool for flood risk maps in the NRB.

AB  - The ocean plays a central role in modulating the Earth's carbon cycle. Monitoring how the ocean carbon cycle is changing is fundamental to managing climate change. Satellite remote sensing is currently our best tool for viewing the ocean surface globally and systematically, at high spatial and temporal resolutions, and the past few decades have seen an exponential growth in studies utilising satellite data for ocean carbon research. Satellite -based observations must be combined with in-situ observations and models, to obtain a comprehensive view of ocean carbon pools and fluxes. To help prioritise future research in this area, a workshop was organised that assembled leading experts working on the topic, from around the world, including remote-sensing scientists, field scientists and modellers, with the goal to articulate a collective view of the current status of ocean carbon research, identify gaps in knowledge, and formulate a scientific roadmap for the next decade, with an emphasis on evaluating where satellite remote sensing may contribute. A total of 449 scientists and stakeholders partic-ipated (with balanced gender representation), from North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Sessions targeted both inorganic and organic pools of carbon in the ocean, in both dissolved and particulate form, as well as major fluxes of carbon between reservoirs (e.g., primary production) and at interfaces (e.g., air-sea and land-ocean). Extreme events, blue carbon and carbon budgeting were also key topics discussed. Emerging pri-orities identified include: expanding the networks and quality of in-situ observations; improved satellite re-trievals; improved uncertainty quantification; improved understanding of vertical distributions; integration with models; improved techniques to bridge spatial and temporal scales of the different data sources; and improved fundamental understanding of the ocean carbon cycle, and of the interactions among pools of carbon and light. We also report on priorities for the specific pools and fluxes studied, and highlight issues and concerns that arose during discussions, such as the need to consider the environmental impact of satellites or space activities; the role satellites can play in monitoring ocean carbon dioxide removal approaches; economic valuation of the satellite based information; to consider how satellites can contribute to monitoring cycles of other important climatically -relevant compounds and elements; to promote diversity and inclusivity in ocean carbon research; to bring together communities working on different aspects of planetary carbon; maximising use of international bodies; to follow an open science approach; to explore new and innovative ways to remotely monitor ocean carbon; and to harness quantum computing. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive scientific roadmap for the next decade on how satellite remote sensing could help monitor the ocean carbon cycle, and its links to the other domains, such as terrestrial and atmosphere.

TI  - Detecting tropical peatland degradation: Combining remote sensing and organic geochemistry
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands are important carbon stores that are vulnerable to drainage and conversion to agriculture. Protection and restoration of peatlands are increasingly recognised as key nature based solutions that can be implemented as part of climate change mitigation. Identification of peatland areas that are important for protection and restauration with regards to the state of their carbon stocks, are therefore vital for policy makers. In this paper we combined organic geochemical analysis by Rock-Eval (6) pyrolysis of peat collected from sites with different land management history and optical remote sensing products to assess if remotely sensed data could be used to predict peat conditions and carbon storage. The study used the North Selangor Peat Swamp forest, Malaysia, as the model system. Across the sampling sites the carbon stocks in the below ground peat was ca 12 times higher than the forest (median carbon stock held in ground vegetation 114.70 Mg ha(-1) and peat soil 1401.51 Mg ha(-1)). Peat core sub-samples and litter collected from Fire Affected, Disturbed Forest, and Managed Recovery locations (i.e. disturbed sites) had different decomposition profiles than Central Forest sites. The Rock-Eval pyrolysis of the upper peat profiles showed that surface peat layers at Fire Affected, Disturbed Forest, and Managed Recovery locations had lower immature organic matter index (I-index) values (average I-index range in upper section 0.15 to -0.06) and higher refractory organic matter index (R -index) (average R-index range in upper section 0.51 to 0.65) compared to Central Forest sites indicating enhanced decomposition of the surface peat. In the top 50 cm section of the peat profile, carbon stocks were negatively related to the normalised burns ratio (NBR) (a satellite derived parameter) (Spearman's rho = -0.664, S = 366, p-value = <0.05) while there was a positive relationship between the hydrogen index and the normalised burns ratio profile (Spearman's rho = 0.7, S = 66, p-value = <0.05) suggesting that this remotely sensed product is able to detect degradation of peat in the upper peat profile. We conclude that the NBR can be used to identify degraded peatland areas and to support identification of areas for conversation and restoration.

TI  - Differences in urban heat island and its driving factors between central and new urban areas of Wuhan, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) is one of the important effects of urbanization on built environment. Land surface temperature data was taken from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) to investigate the long-term spatiotemporal patterns of UHI in Wuhan during 2001 similar to 2018 and, the UHI intensity changes of built-up land in 13 administrative regions in Wuhan were analyzed. Furthermore, 34 spatial error models and 34 ordinary least squares models were established and compared. Spatial error models showed good fitting effect, which were used to determine the influence of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference building index (NDBI), and social-economic factors (population and nighttime light) on UHI intensity in central urban area and new urban area. The explanatory power changes of these four indicators during 2001 similar to 2018 were explored as well. The average UHI intensity in 2014 similar to 2018 has increased by about 0.45 degrees C compared to that in 2001 similar to 2005. NDBI is the most dominant factor contributing to the increase in temperature. The impact of NDVI on UHI intensity changes from negative to positive, and the impact of NDBI on UHI intensity in central urban area is weakened during 2001-2018. Social-economic factors have a greater impact on new urban area than on central urban area. These findings show the effects and the explanatory power changes of driving factors during 18 years, which can provide a better understanding of the formation and development of UHI and support for the future urban planning of Wuhan.

TI  - The physical exercise-induced oxidative<i>/</i>inflammatory response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells: Signaling cellular energetic stress situations
T2  - LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are a variety of specialized immune cells produced in the bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that work together to protect our bodies from harmful pathogens. From a metabolic point of view, these cells can serve as sentinel tissue source for distinguishing multiple types of whole-body physiological perturbations. The significant interaction of PBMCs with systemic physiology makes these cells an attractive target for several interventions such as physical exercise. Analyses of oxidative/inflammatory and metabolic markers of PBMCs obtained from unhealthy and healthy humans have been used in monitoring immune response in different exercise conditions. It is already a common consensus that regular practice of physical exercise, that is planned, structured, and repetitive, influences personal health by altering the metabolic state and the immune system. However, the role of distinct metabolic processes responsible for maintaining metabolic balance during physical exercise in PBMCs is not fully understood. Furthermore, a complete dose-response analysis between different exercise protocols and biomarkers capable of predicting physical performance needs to be better elucidated. The absence of published reviews on this topic compromises the understanding of the crosstalk between the metabolic adaptations of PBMCs and exercise-induced changes in the immune system. Given the above, this review highlights the main findings in the literature involving the responses of PBMCs in the inflammatory/oxidative stress induced by physical exercise. The present review also highlights how distinct phenotypes and functional diversity of PBMCs make these cells an accessible alternative for assessing exercise-induced metabolic adaptations.

TI  - Variations in aerosol optical characteristics from SKYNET measurements in Beijing
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosols have significant impacts on climate and environment, so the study on aerosol optical properties is of great scientific significance for climate change and atmospheric environment. The variations in column-integrated aerosol optical properties over Beijing were investigated from March 2016 to December 2019 based on the SKYNET data products. Higher values of AOD and AE found in summer indicate that it is important to pay more attention to fine particle pollution in summer. By fitting the AOD data of SKYNET with AERONET at same waveband, we found that monthly variations in aerosol optical depth estimated from SKYNET observation were mostly consistent with the AERONET data. Aerosols were divided into several modes according to optical characteristics, which deepen some insight into aerosol optical and radiative properties and revealed that the weak absorption aerosol dominated and contributed much to the radiation transport in Beijing. Data derived from the polarization lidar CALIPSO were combined with aerosol optical depth (AOD) from SKYNET and these results were consistent, which further identified the scientific of data. The random forest algorithm was used to interpolate the missing AOD500nm observations. The original results and the interpolation results were fitted with MODIS respectively, which proved that the random forest algorithm can supplement the missing results well. This work will be of great significance in addressing the impacts of aerosols on climate and environment, and will help reduce the uncertainty of the impacts of aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget. All work will provide scientific support for the prevention and control of specific pollution.

TI  - Unsupervised detection of InSAR time series patterns based on PCA and K-means clustering
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The need for implementing efficient value-adding tools able to optimise Earth Observation data usage, compels the scientific community to find innovative solutions for the downstream of Earth Observation information. In this paper we present an unsupervised and automated approach based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering to detect patterns of natural or anthropogenic ground deformation from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) Time Series. For our proof-of-concept, we focus on the Valle d'Aosta region (Northwest Italy) where mass wasting processes frequently occurs, interacting with human activities and in-frastructures. The large volumes of Sentinel-1 data produced allows for retrieving horizontal and vertical Time Series from multi-geometry data fusion of Line-of-Sight (LOS) InSAR measurements. The added benefit of combining ascending/descending InSAR data and interpolating displacements in time at different time steps is here explored prior to data dimensionality reduction and feature extraction through PCA. The retrieved principal components serve as a continuous solution for cluster membership indicators in the K-means clustering method, allowing to define spatially and temporally coherent displacement phenomena. The signal of the ground deformation clusters is then deconstructed into the underlying trend and seasonality components to enhance the interpretability of the classified satellite InSAR features. Using InSAR Time series data spanning 2014-2020, the proposed approach detects several slope movements and anthropogenic deformations with both linear and seasonal displacement behaviours. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of our transferable approach to the development of automated ground motion analysis systems.

TI  - An Adaptive Line-of-Sight (ALOS) Guidance Law for Path Following of Aircraft and Marine Craft
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This brief presents a novel nonlinear adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) guidance law for path following, compensating for drift forces due to wind, waves, and ocean currents. The ALOS guidance law is proven to have uniform semiglobal exponential stability (USGES) properties during straight-line path following at constant speed. The ALOS guidance law performs similar to the classical integral line-of-sight (ILOS) and adaptive ILOS guidance laws when the sideslip angle is nearly constant. The ALOS guidance law, however, has better tracking capabilities when compensating for rapidly varying sideslip caused by a time-varying disturbance. This is because the integral state of the ALOS guidance law is additive to the unknown sideslip angle (disturbance matching). In contrast, the ILOS guidance laws must compensate sideslip through a saturating arctangent function. The study also includes an input-to-state stable (ISS) reduced-order extended state observer for estimation of the line-of-sight (LOS) crab angle, known as the ELOS guidance law. The performance of the ALOS, ILOS, and ELOS guidance laws is compared by simulating rapid changes in the sideslip angle to stress the critical assumptions of the algorithms. Finally, a case study of the Remus 100 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) exposed to stochastic ocean currents is used to compare the performance of the ILOS, ALOS, and ELOS algorithms during normal operation.

TI  - Habitat selection of wintering cranes in typical wetlands in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River over the past 20 years, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The wetlands in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are the main overwintering and perching places for cranes. To examine the habitat selection mechanism of cranes in this area, two natural wetland reserves, Shengjin Lake and Poyang Lake, which are the main habitats of typical cranes, were selected as the study area. Using 20 years of Landsat satellite image data (between 1999 and 2019), the vegetation cover index was calculated from a pixel dichotomy model, and the landscape pattern index was obtained through Fragstats. The entropy method was adopted to determine the weight of the landscape index, and then, the habitat suitability index was calculated. Combined with the number of typical crane populations in the reserve, the selection mechanism of overwintering habitat of cranes was revealed. On the change of land-use type, the crane habitat of Shengjin Lake transferred more to non-crane habitat, and other land types increased, resulting in the decrease of crane habitat area. However, the change of crane habitat in Poyang Lake Reserve was small, so it can accommodate more cranes to overwintering here. In terms of vegetation coverage, most of the vegetation cover areas of Shengjin Lake were woodland near or far from the lake, but the woodland was not the habitat of cranes. Most of the vegetation-covered areas of Poyang Lake are grassland near the lake, which provide rest and foraging places for cranes. In the landscape pattern, the number of landscape patches in Shengjin Lake was large, the degree of landscape fragmentation was higher than that in Poyang Lake, the landscape complexity was higher, and the landscape diversity was simpler. This is not conducive to the maintenance of crane habitat, but also reduces the attractiveness of overwintering cranes, while the landscape suitability of crane habitat in Poyang Lake was higher than that in Shengjin Lake, and cranes were more likely to choose Poyang Lake as their overwintering habitat.

TI  - Measures of performance for sentinel lymph node biopsy in oro-oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeThe aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the reported sentinel lymph node detection rate (SDR), false-negative rate (FNR), and negative predictive value (NPV) as measures of performance of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) techniques based on the use of radio-colloids, in clinically neck-negative T1/2 oro-oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.MethodsStudies were stratified according to the SNB technique: (1) Tc-99m-nanocolloid planar lymphoscintigraphy with the use of intra-operative hand-held gamma-probe (L-G); (2) L-G with the additional contribution of pre-operative SPECT/CT (L-SPECT/CT-G); (3) L-G with the additional contribution of intra-operative blue dye or indocyanine green optical tracers (L-G-O); (4) L-SPECT/CT-G with the additional contribution of optical tracers (L-SPECT/CT-G-O). The SDRs were summarized accordingly. To summarize the FNRs and NPVs: (i) the index test (SNB) was based on histological evaluation of resected sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) performed on immunohistochemistry and step serial sectioning; (ii) the reference standards were the elective neck dissection or follow-up for tumor-free SNB.ResultsFrom a total of 3693 patients, the overall SDRs for the L-G, L-SPECT/CT-G, L-G-O, and L-SPECT/CT-G-O techniques were 98.2% (95% CI 97-99.1), 98.9% (95% CI 97.5-99.7), 97.4% (95% CI 95.3-98.9), and 98% (95% CI 95.8-99.2). From a total of 1634 patients, the overall FNRs for the L-G, L-SPECT/CT-G and L-G-O techniques were 8.5% (95% CI 3.4-15.5), 6.2% (95% CI 0.9-15.7), and 9.1% (95% CI 4.3-15.4); moreover, the overall NPVs were 93% (95% CI 90.5-94.9), 91.2% (95% CI 88.3-93.8), and 93.9% (95% CI 90.9-96.3), respectively. Promising initial findings emerged from L-SPECT/CT-G-O.ConclusionsThe superiority of SPECT/CT over planar methods has been reported for providing identification of SLNs by aberrant lymphatic drainage. The additional contribution of optical tracers (mainly represented by blue dye) to the radiocolloid-based techniques did not improve significantly the measures of performance.

TI  - Europe's southernmost interglacial refugia as sentinels for the local extinction of mountain conifers
T2  - REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Serrania de Ronda is an exceptional palaeoecological laboratory for studying the dynamics of vegetation over time, due to its strategic geographical location at a biogeographical crossroads and its proven historical legacy. Many of the mountains that form part of this territory are today practically deforested, such as Sierra Blanca, whose geographic location at the heart of the Serrania de Ronda means that it has enormous potential as a bio-geographical crossroads: the occasional presence of Abies pinsapo, Pinus pinaster and Quercus rotundifolia suggests that it was once covered by a mixed forest of conifers and broad-leaved trees. The lack of environmental research in Sierra Blanca has facilitated the installation of large quarries, which have led to its exclusion from the Sierra de las Nieves National Park, which was created in 2021. We applied the pedoanthracological methodology, which has enabled us to discover paleo-populations of A. pinsapo and Pinus sylvestris-type. The results confirm that co-niferous forests previously covered a much wider area during the Holocene. These findings reinforce the role of Sierra Blanca as a high-altitude refuge for conifers during the warm stages of the Holocene and as a sentinel for the local extinction of mountain conifers. This information could help improve its management and conservation. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A new dialogue on Yijing -the book of changes in a world of changes, instability, disequilibrium and turbulence
T2  - ASIAN PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a reinterpretation of the Chinese worldview on equilibrium/nonequilibrium and yin-yang in the context of science and draws the correlative aspects with irreversible thermodynamics and quantum reality, such as instability, nonlinearity, nonequilibrium, and temporality. The paper argues that Prigogine's expressions on dissipative structures and their role in thermodynamic systems far from equilibrium, complexity, and irreversibility resonate with the principles in Yijing. Instability, far-from-equilibrium, irreversibility, probability, bifurcation, and self-organisation are intrinsic properties of nature appearing at all levels. Information is the basis of all changes. The agency of change is the human with a consciousness interpreting the information existing in the probability space between heaven and earth. The paper outlines a modelling approach with the self-organising human in the centre between heaven and earth, representing living systems as discrete dynamical systems presented with binary yin-yang choices. The concepts of yin-yang and information causality are central to Yijing's understanding of change and are clarified in this paper.

TI  - Developing spin-up time framework for WRF extreme precipitation simulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the wide application of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in extreme precipitation simulations, there is a lack of consensus and clear guidance on identifying the suitable length of spin-up time. In this study, the WRF model was used to simulate the extreme precipitation events that happened on the 4 November 2015 at Alexandria of the Nile Delta. According to the observation from the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG), 21 spin-up time experiments of the 3-level-nested domain scenario and 21 spin-up time experiments of the 2-level-nested domain scenario were designed to explore the relationship between model required spin-up time and initial conditions. The simulation perfor-mances were evaluated by seven verification metrics and one overall performance score. Here we try to provide guidelines on how to determine the optimal spin-up time through satellite data without too many trial-and-error tests. An Optimal Spin-up Time Identifying (OSTI) framework with possible weather situations and spin-up time determining steps is proposed to help future work. It is found that the occurrences of disturbing weather events strengthen the influence of initial conditions on simulation outputs and increase model requirements for spin-up time lengths. Moreover, this framework is more useful for precipitation events with strong synoptic backgrounds because their simulation performances depend largely on the development of appropriate atmospheric circula-tions and physical equilibrium states in the model.

TI  - The nodal positivity rate in breast pCR patients with initially, clinically node-negative breast cancer after neoadjuvant systemic therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background The axillary lymph node positive (ypN+) rate in patients with clinically node-negative (cN0) breast cancer who have achieved breast pathologic complete response (bpCR) after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) is extremely low, and this population has the potential to be exempt from sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). However, an overview of the ypN+ rate in this population for different breast cancer subtypes is lacking.Objective To provide the pooled ypN+ rate in cN0 patients who achieved bpCR after NST in different breast cancer subtypes defined by hormone receptor (HR) status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status.Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in Embase and PubMed on July 20, 2022. Two authors independently selected studies that met the inclusion criteria and extracted all data. The pooled ypN+ rates for each subtype were calculated by a random-effects model using the Stata 16.0 metaprop command.Results The pooled analysis of 9609 cN0 patients who achieved bpCR showed that the ypN+ rate was lowest for the HR+/HER2+ (0%) subtype, followed by HR+/HER2- (5.1%), HR-/HER2+ (0.6%), and HR-/HER2- (0.3%). Additionally, 6571 cT(1)-T(2)N0 patients who achieved bpCR had a pooled ypN+ rate of 0.6%, and the ypN+ rates for different subtypes were as follows: HR+/HER2+ (1.7%), HR+/HER2- (2.7%), HR-/HER2+ (0.1%), and HR-/HER2- (0.8%).Conclusion Our results suggested that cN0 patients who achieve bpCR may be exempt from axillary surgery in the HR+/HER2-, HR+/HER2+, and HR-/HER2- subtypes because of the extremely low probability of residual axillary lymph node disease. However, the safety of omitting axillary surgery needs to be further confirmed by prospective studies.

TI  - Undetected language deficits in left or right hemisphere post-stroke patients
T2  - APPLIED NEUROPSYCHOLOGY-ADULT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Previous studies have reported that widely used tests for aphasia identification are unable to detect the subtle language deficits of left hemisphere brain damaged (LHBD) individuals. Similarly, the language disorders of individuals with right hemisphere brain damage (RHBD) usually remain undetected, due to the lack of any specialized test for the evaluation of their language processing skills. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the language deficits of 80 individuals suffering from the effects of either a LHBD or RHBD stroke, who were diagnosed as having no aphasia or language deficits based on the application of Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. Their language abilities were examined with the use of the Adults' Language Abilities Test, which explores morpho-syntactic and semantic phenomena of the Greek language in both the comprehension and production modalities. Results revealed that both groups of stroke survivors performed significantly worse compared to the group of healthy participants. Thus, it appears that the latent aphasia of LHBD and the language deficits of RHBD patients are likely to remain undetected and that patients are at risk of not receiving appropriate treatment if their language abilities are not evaluated by an effective and efficient battery of language tests.

TI  - B-esterase measurements and other blood related biomarkers in loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) as indicators of health status
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) has been selected as sentinel species by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) descriptor 10 in relation to marine litter. In this, and other protected species, there is a need to develop conservative pollution biomarkers equally informative of chemical exposures to those traditionally carried out in metabolic organs, such as the liver. With this aim, plasma from turtles undergoing rehabilitation at the Fundacio Oceanografic rescue centre (Arca del Mar) were selected and tested for B-esterase measurements. Hydrolysis rates of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and carboxylesterases (CEs) using four commercial substrates were undertaken on 191 plasma samples. Results indicated that acetylthiocholine was the most adequate substrate of cholinesterases and butyrate esters for CE measures. The correlation of these parameters with well-established blood biochemistry measurements was analysed. B-esterase measures in wild specimens were discussed in relation to age group, pathology on admission to the rescue centre and season; moreover, contrasts with long-term resident turtles were also made. Although this study provides baseline data on B-esterase measures in a large sample size for this species, more complementary information is still needed in terms of population genetics, chemical exposures, and in relation to other biochemical parameters before they can be confidently applied in wild specimens within the regulatory MSFD.

TI  - Short-term variability in plankton abundance on the inner shelf off Ubatuba, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction between biological and short-term physical processes affects plankton distribution and composition variability, with consequences for the entire ecosystem. Aspects of the plankton distribution at smaller scales have been understudied, mainly in coastal regions where highly variable conditions promote variations in the biophysical environment. This work aimed to investigate the short-term variations in the distribution of plankton along the inner shelf off Ubatuba, Brazil. We quantified the abundance and diversity of the main planktonic taxa (>100 mu m) and their spatiotemporal distribution in winter 2018 and summer 2019 using high-resolution sensors and a shadowgraphic imaging system at cross-shore and fixed stations (12 and 24 h). Summer-winter environmental contrast was evident in the water column stability and plankton abundance. In the summer, higher values of plankton abundance and diversity were obtained. Our results suggested that spatiotemporal variations related to wind-induced mixing and water mass intrusions lead to variabilities in plankton populations on a time scale of a few hours, vertically between depth layers and at spatial scales <2 km. This study contributes to the knowledge of the mechanisms of biophysical interactions and their spatiotemporal variation, which is crucial for assessing the effects of climate variability on plankton-mediated ecosystem services.

TI  - Machine learning-based spatial-temporal assessment and change transition analysis of wetlands: An application of Google Earth Engine in Sylhet, Bangladesh (1985-2022)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are crucial ecosystems as they enhance the quality of groundwater, protect from natural hazards, control erosion, and provide habitat to rare species of flora and fauna. Despite being valuable ecosystems, wetlands worldwide are decreasing in many regions, making mapping and monitoring of wetlands crucial. Largescale wetlands mapping is challenging but recent advancements in machine learning, time series earth observation data, and cloud computing have opened doors to new techniques to overcome such limitations. Through evaluating the effectiveness of different classification methods, this study provides a brief analysis of wetlands dynamics in Sylhet, Bangladesh. The analysis is carried out between 1985 and 2022 using Google Earth Engine, Landsat imagery, and several spectral indices. To obtain reliable results, four classification algorithms (Random Forest, Minimum Distance, Classification and Regression Trees, and Support Vector Machine) are evaluated. As a result, Random Forest proved to be the most efficient and accurate for wetlands mapping by producing 99% accuracy across all periods. Change detection shows a rapid decrease in the wetlands in Sylhet, which could have serious consequences to the aquatic and terrestrial species, water and soil quality, and wildlife population, if not addressed. Between 1985 and 2022, nearly 45% of the wetlands have been lost in the region due to shifting landuse patterns, especially the conversion of wetlands into vegetative land (-82,000 km2) as a result of increased agricultural practices in the region. Four critical regions (i.e., Derai, Sulla, Jamalganj, and Ajmiriganj) have undergone -80% reduction in wetlands, requiring prompt interventions for conservation and restoration of wetlands given their diverse services.

TI  - Ocean response offshore of Taiwan to super typhoon Nepartak (2016) based on multiple satellite and buoy observations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-satellite and buoy observation data were used to systematically analyze the ocean response offshore of Taiwan to Super Typhoon Nepartak in 2016. The satellite data showed that a high sea surface temperature combined with a thick warm water layer and deep mixed layer provided a good thermal environment for continuous intensification of the typhoon. Two high-resolution buoys (NTU1 and NTU2) moored 375 and 175 km offshore of southeastern Taiwan were used to clarify the typhoon-ocean interaction as the typhoon approached Taiwan. The ocean conditions were similar at the two buoys before the typhoon, and both buoys were on the left side of the typhoon track and suffered similar typhoon factors (e.g., typhoon intensity and translation speed) during its passage. However, the ocean response differed significantly at the two buoys. During the forced period, the entire upper ocean was cooled at NTU1. In contrast, there was a clear three-layer vertical structure at NTU2 consisting of cool surface and deep layers with a warmer layer between the two cool layers. These responses can be attributed to strong upwelling of a cold eddy at NTU1 and vertical mixing at NTU2. These results indicate that, under similar preexisting conditions and typhoon factors, the movement of ocean eddies under typhoon forcing is an unexpected mechanism that results in upwelling and thus needs to be considered when predicting changes in the ocean environment and typhoon intensity.

TI  - Inhibit or promote: The inverse-U-shape effect of greenspace on economic growth
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Discovering a nature-friendly economic growth pattern is a critical issue in the development of human society. This paper combines satellite remote sensing data and economic statistics of 1843 counties in China from 1999 to 2019 to identify the impact of greenspace on county-level economic growth. The findings are as follows: First, It is the cutting-edge evidence of an inverted U-shaped impact of greenspace on economic growth, with the in-flection point between 0.5 and 0.55. A higher level of greenspace positively impacts economic growth and vice inhibits, as long as it is below the inflection point. Second, economic growth requires a co-effort between con-struction and greenspace maintenance. On average, the greenspace level in Chinese counties falls below the inflection point. By bringing the average greenspace level to the inflection point, the average GDP of each county in China could increase by approximately 1.38 billion yuan, resulting in a per capita GDP increase of 342.13 yuan. Third, the impact of greenspace on the primary and tertiary industries is more significant. The results provide theoretical and empirical support for the win-win situation of environmental protection and economic growth.

TI  - Grounding Zone of Amery Ice Shelf, Antarctica, From Differential Synthetic-Aperture Radar Interferometry
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We employ a time series of Sentinel-1 differential radar interferometry data from 2018 to detect the variability in grounding line position of the Fisher, Mellor, and Lambert glaciers, which drain about 47 billion tons of ice per year from East Antarctica. We observe kilometer-scale tidal migration, two orders of magnitude larger than expected for ice flowing over a hard bed. The migration is not in phase with changes in oceanic tide. In two estuaries underlaid by subglacial channels, we observe two states of migration that switch on and off over time scales of several weeks. The range of vertical motion reveals a water column thickness of 2-20 cm. Such intrusions of seawater over wide grounding zones are not accounted for in physical models. Including them will add vigorous melting of grounded ice that will enhance the sensitivity of glaciers to ocean warming and increase projections of mass loss.

TI  - Glacier Surface Heatwaves Over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has warmed at a rate twice the global average and presents unique warming patterns in surface temperature changes. However, key characteristics of glacier surface heatwave duration and intensity over the TP during the present extreme warming period are still unknown. In this study, we show that surface temperatures in glacial regions of the TP (0.37 +/- 0.10 degrees C per decade) have increased faster than those in non-glacial areas (0.29 +/- 0.05 degrees C per decade) between 2001 and 2020. Moreover, the duration (5.3 +/- 3.2 days per decade) and cumulative intensity (24.9 +/- 16.3 days degrees C per decade) of glacier surface heatwaves have increased significantly during autumn. Our results demonstrate an elevation dependence to these key warming characteristics, which we also suggest are associated with extreme glacier mass loss. Here, we highlight potential threats to the sustainability of glacier water resources and increasing risk of glacier related hazards at the "roof of the world."

T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Impaired wound healing is a serious diabetes complication compromising patients' quality of life. However, the pathogenesis of diabetic wounds (DWs) remains incompletely understood. Human epidermal keratinocyte (HEK) is the sentinel cell that initiates healing processes after the epidermal integrity has been disrupted.Objective: This study aimed to investigate the functional roles of HEKs in wound healing and to identify candidate genes, signaling pathways and molecular signatures contributing to the DWs. Methods: HEKs were cultured in normal or high-glucose environment, followed by scratch, to mimic the microenvironment of normal wounds and DWs. Subsequently, we performed RNA sequencing and systematically analyzed the expression profiles by bioinformatics approaches. Results: High-glucose environment altered the keratinocyte transcriptome responses to wounding. In experimental model of DWs, we found that TNF, CYP24A1, NR4A3 and GGT1 were key overexpressed genes in keratinocytes and were implicated in multiple cellular responses. Further analysis showed that wounding in high-glucose environment activated G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, cAMP response elementbinding protein (CREB) signaling, and adrenomedullin signaling in keratinocytes, while dysregulated skin development and immune responses as compared to their counterpart in normal glucose settings.Conclusion: This simplified in-vitro model serves as a valuable tool to gain insights into the molecular basis of DWs and to facilitate establishment of personalized therapies in clinical practice (c) 2023 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

TI  - Machine learning model ensemble for predicting sugarcane yield through synergy of optical and SAR remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Pre-harvest estimate of sugarcane production is required by sugar mill officials for proper planning about intra or inter-regional trading of sugarcane if expected production is more or less than mill's crushable capacity. Integration of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing has shown to improve biomass prediction accuracy of a perennial crop like sugarcane, particularly when optical data is unavailable due to presence of clouds. This study aims at estimating sugarcane yield using optical data from Sentinel-2 and SAR data from Sentinel-1 at mill catchment level of four sugar mills in Gujarat and Maharashtra, India. A variety of machine learning (ML) algorithms, including those based on Bayesian inference, as well as ensemble methods like bagging or boosting, were utilized to predict biomass. Additionally, a specific type of ensemble technique known as model stacking was also employed for predicting cane biomass. Fusing optical and SAR based yield driving variables from different active growth phases of sugarcane in an ensemble modeling framework explained about 63-70% variations of pixel-level above ground biomass during model training and 44-60% during testing stage. Aggregation of pixel level sugarcane yield at micro-zone level (cluster of villages) showed good prediction accuracies in Gujarat (NRMSE of 18%) and Maharashtra (NRMSE of 32%) at least 1-2 months before harvesting.

TI  - Routine imaging guided by a 31-gene expression profile assay results in earlier detection of melanoma with decreased metastatic tumor burden compared to patients without surveillance imaging studies
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DERMATOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Patients with early-stage disease typically have a good prognosis, but still have a risk of recurrence, even with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). This study explores the utility of routine imaging to detect metastases in patients with negative SLNB but high-risk 31 gene expression profile (31-GEP) scores. We retrospectively identified melanoma patients with negative SLNBs. Patients with high-risk GEP results were placed in the experimental group and patients without GEP testing were placed in the control group. Among both cohorts, recurrent melanoma groups were identified. The tumor burden at the time of recurrence and the time to recurrence were compared between experimental group patients with routine imaging and control group patients without imaging schedules. We identified 327 control patients and 307 experimental patients, of which 14.1% versus 20.5% had melanoma recurrence, respectively. Of the patients with recurrent melanoma, those in the experimental group were older (65.75 versus 59.20), had higher Breslow depths (3.72 mm versus 3.31 mm), and had advanced tumor staging (89.5% versus 71.4% of patients presenting clinical stage >= II) compared to the control group at primary diagnosis. However, melanoma recurrence was detected earlier (25.50 months versus 35.35 months) in the experimental group at a lower overall tumor burden (73.10 mm versus 27.60 mm). A higher percentage of experimental patients started immunotherapy when offered (76.3% and 67.9%). Patients who received routine imaging after high-risk GEP test scores had an earlier recurrence diagnosis with lower tumor burden, leading to better clinical outcomes.

TI  - Extraction and mapping of shoreline changes along the Visakhapatnam-Kakinada coast using satellite imageries
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extraction of shorelines using satellite imagery is an eAective method because customary digitization is a long and hectic process. This study focuses on extracting and detecting shoreline changes from Landsat-8 imageries of the Visakhapatnam-Kakinada coast along the east coast of India using an object-based approach. An objectbased approach for the automatic detection of coastline from Landsat imagery using the Feature Extraction WorkCow by Maximum Likelihood is implemented by the maximum classiBcation method (MLC). The resulting vector polyline is smoothened for every 100 m using ArcGIS software. Delineation of multi-temporal satellite images was performed by visual interpretation from 2014 to 2019 to detect the shoreline changes. Different available techniques and methods are employed to observe shoreline changes. In addition to this, the shoreline information simulated by satellite remote sensing is in fair agreement with RTK GPS observations. The observed and remote sensing shoreline changes help to identify the areas of accretion and eroding zones over the long term. During this study, erosion and deposition changes were observed along RK beach, Rushikonda beach, Uppada beach, and Kakinada beach. The spatial variation rates were calculated using the statistical methods of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) during speciBc periods. The maximum observed shoreline accretion and erosion rates at Kakinada are 5.3 and -4.35 m/year indicates slight accretion. The maximum observed accretion and erosion rates at Uppada beach are 3.8 and -6.78 m/year, respectively indicating erosion. Similarly, atRKBeach the maximum observed shoreline accretion and erosion rates are 3.68 and -3.68 m/year, respectively indicating the beach is in a stable state. At Rushikonda beach, the maximum observed shoreline accretion and erosion rates are 2.24 and -3.04 m/year, respectively indicating erosion.

TI  - Structural evidences of active tectonics along Himalayan Frontal Thrust of northwest Himalaya: A case study along Kumia river section, Nainital, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study reports structural evidences of active tectonics along the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT) exposed in Kumia river section, Majhola Got, Uttarakhand, utilising remote sensing data, field investigations and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. The HFT makes the southernmost boundary of the northwest frontal Himalaya, against the piedmont zone of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Almost E-W trending and low angle (6 degrees-20 degrees) northerly dipping HFT plane with listric thrust geometry is exposed at the right bank of Kumia river section. Here, deformed grey-white sandstone and purple-red mudstone sequence of the Chinji/Ramnagar Formation of Lower Siwalik Subgroup override on the adjoining post-Siwalik/late Quaternary fluvial terrace deposits of piedmont zone of the Indo-Gangetic plain along the HFT plane, a direct evidence of active tectonics. A footwall sand sample of the terrace deposits collected similar to 1 m below the HFT plane at Kumia river section has yielded similar to 4.2 +/- 0.2 ka BP optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) date (GSI, OSL/TL Lab, Faridabad). It indicates reactivation of the HFT segment with major paleoseismic event after similar to 4 ka BP. In the Kumia river section, the HFT damage zone is characterised by wide (similar to 100 m) hanging wall brittle-ductile to brittle deformation and limited (1 m wide) footwall brittle deformation, a case of strain partitioning under same bulk compressive stress regime of the south directed HFT sheet. The thrust-related hanging wall damage zone is well differentiated into cataclastic/gouge, breccia and fractures sub-zones farther from HFT plane and shows small-scale slickensides/striations, cataclastic flow bands, south verging thrust duplexes and asymmetric shear/drag folds, obliteration/shattering of bedding planes, grain size refinement, secondary faults/fractures and brittle-ductile to brittle discrete shear zones. Slickensides/striations (16o plunge towards 010 degrees on 270 degrees/16 degrees N HFT plane, with reverse sense of movement towards 190 degrees) within the immediate hanging wall clayey cataclastic/gouge material along the main HFT plane suggests south-directed (towards 190 degrees) movement of the HFT sheet in the area. The petrographic study of the deformed Lower Siwalik rocks of the cataclastic/gouge sub-zone reveals mudstone flow bands, thin quartz-carbonate veins, micro-scale thrust related asymmetrical, shear/drag folds, micro-thrust duplexes, micro-faults, deformed clasts of sandstone and mudstone with secondary fractures and pressure shadow tail structure without recrystallisation, formed due to HFT related brittle-ductile deformation at moderate temperature and pressure. The seismotectonic setting of the narrow Kumaun Salient having very close disposition of parallel HFT, Main Boundary Thrust, Lugad Thrust and Belgaon Thrust within similar to 10 km width of the frontal Himalaya, along with sparse or negligible distribution of past seismic events around the area suggest locked nature of the active HFT segment in the present tectonic regime which accumulates tectonic energy to generate future large earthquake, a potential seismic threat in the region.

TI  - Skill and lead time of vegetation drought impact forecasts based on soil moisture observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and skilful forecasts of vegetation drought impacts should enable more proactive drought preparedness, management, and mitigation. Numerous previous studies found a temporal correlation between soil moisture and vegetation condition. However, a correlation across the full range of soil moisture and vegetation condition does not automatically translate into skill in forecasting infrequent events such as agricultural droughts. Here, we develop a threshold-or impact-based forecasting framework to assess early warning capability (EWC). We analysed the skill and lead time achieved using soil moisture observations at multiple depths as predictors of subsequent vegetation drought impacts inferred from MODIS satellite observations at 93 sites across the United States. Forecast thresholds were expressed in terms of seasonally-adjusted standardised anomalies (z-scores) to distinguish climate-related impacts from any seasonal vegetation cycle. Different combinations of soil moisture integration depth, satellite vegetation indices and threshold levels were tested. Near-Infrared Reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) yielded a marginally better EWC than other indicators of vegetation drought impact. The optimal soil moisture integration depth varied between land cover types, from 0 to 10 cm for cropping systems to 0-100 cm for grassland and savanna. The greatest skill improvements were achieved using similar z-score threshold values for the soil moisture trigger and vegetation impact, producing typical lead times of two to four weeks. Further research is recommended to combine the framework developed here with spatially continuous soil moisture analyses or forecasts available from remote sensing and land surface models.

TI  - Prediction of overwintering crane population in Poyang Lake wetland based on RS and regression Model, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reasonable prediction of the crane population that arrives at Poyang Lake Reserve for overwintering every year is of great significance to protect cranes and to provide data about reserve planning. In this paper, considering the time-lag effect of landscape index on crane population, the Landsat satellite images of Poyang Lake wetland in 19 winter periods from 2001 to 2019 were selected. The land-use types of the images were classified by support vector machine to acquire the landscape pattern index. In addition, the Pearson test was adopted to examine the correlation between crane population dynamics and landscape pattern index during overwintering. Finally, the regression model of the crane population was obtained by multivariate linear regression analysis. The results showed that the landscape index had a delayed impact on the crane population, which was significantly correlated with the crane population in the following five years. This effect on different crane population was disparate. The number of siberian cranes and white-naped crane populations showed a downward trend, while that of hooded cranes and common crane populations showed an upward trend. Furthermore, the landscape index affects the crane population to a certain extent, but the landscape pattern has diverse effects on different crane populations. It is suggested that corresponding protection measures be taken for different crane pop-ulations to provide a better habitat for cranes in Poyang Lake.

TI  - Accounting for surface reflectance spectral features in TROPOMI methane retrievals
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of methane (CH4) using the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5-P) satellite is key to monitor and quantify emissions globally. Overall, the S5-P methane data are of satisfying quality, demonstrated by the product validation with ground-based measurements from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). However, analysis of TROPOMI dry-air column mixing ratio (XCH4) data has pointed to a few false methane anomalies up to 20-40 ppb that can potentially be misinterpreted as enhancements due to strong emission sources. These artefacts are caused by spectral features of the underlying surfaces of specific materials (e.g. carbonate rocks), which are not well represented in the forward model of the retrieval algorithm. In this study we show that the observed anomalies are due to the surface model which describes the spectral dependence of the Lambertian albedo by a second-order polynomial in wavelength. By analysing the ECOSTRESS library that contains laboratory spectra for different types of surfaces, we find that a quadratic function might not be the most optimal representation of the surface reflectance spectral dependencies in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) range. Already the use of a third-order polynomial improves the methane data such that the anomalies disappear at several locations (e.g. Siberia, Australia and Algeria) without affecting the data quality elsewhere, and the quality of the fit significantly improves. We also found that the known bias in retrieved methane for low-albedo scenes slightly improves, but still, a posterior correction needs to be applied, leaving open the question about the root cause of the albedo bias. After applying the adjusted surface model globally, we perform the routine validation with TCCON and Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) data. GOSAT comparison does not significantly improve, while TCCON validation results show a small improvement in some stations of 2-4 ppb, up to a factor of 10 smaller than the artificial XCH4 enhancements. This reflects that TCCON stations are not close to any of the corrected artefacts, hinting at a limitation of the current validation approach of the S5-P XCH4 data product.

TI  - Un-Australian? White Australia's Visions of Identity and the Racialisation of the Pacific War
T2  - AUSTRALIAN HISTORICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This article investigates white Australia's racialisation of the Pacific War. Specifically, it focuses on contemporary disputes over racialised depictions of the conflict, and how such contentions figured in understandings of Australian identity. By looking at wartime newspaper and magazine articles, wartime propaganda, and the public responses to them, this article demonstrates the diversity and complexity of white Australia's racialisation of the Pacific War. Though the view of the Pacific War as a 'race war' was certainly common among white Australians, it was not universal. That said, most white Australians at the time, regardless of whether they supported the racialisation of the conflict, upheld a racialised worldview.

TI  - Evaluating land use/cover change associations with urban surface temperature <i>via</i> machine learning and spatial modeling: Past trends and future simulations in Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - While urbanization puts lots of pressure on green areas, the transition of green-to-grey surfaces under land use land cover change is directly related to increased land surface temperature-compromising livability and comfort in cities due to the heat island effect. In this context, we evaluate historical and future associations between land use land cover changes and land surface temperature in Dera Ghazi Khan-one of the top cities in Pakistan-using multi-temporal Landsat data over two decades (2002-2022). After assessing current land use changes and future predictions, their impact on land surface temperature and urban heat island effect is measured using machine learning via Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain, Artificial Neural Network and Cellular Automata. Significant changes in land use land cover were observed in the last two decades. The built-up area expanded greatly (874ha) while agriculture land (-687ha) and barren land (-253ha) show decreasing trend. The water bodies were found the lowest changes (57ha) and vegetation cover got the largest proportion in all the years. This green-grey conversion in the last two decades (8.7%) and prospect along the main corridors show the gravity of unplanned urban growth at the cost of vegetation and agricultural land (-6.8%). The land surface temperature and urban heat island effect shows a strong positive correlation between urbanization and vegetation removal. The simulation results presented in this study confirm that by 2032, the city will face a 5 degrees C high mean temperature based on historical patterns, which could potentially lead to more challenges associated with urban heat island if no appropriate measures are taken. It is expected that due to land cover changes by 2032, similar to 60% of urban and peri-urban areas will experience very hot to hot temperatures (> 31.5 degrees C). Our results provide baseline information to urban managers and planners to understand the increasing trends of land surface temperature in response to land cover changes. The study is important for urban resource management, sustainable development policies, and actions to mitigate the heat island effect. It will further asset the broader audience to understand the impact of land use land cover changes on the land surface temperature and urban heat island effect in the light of historic pattern and machine learning approach.

TI  - Improvements of PV receiver in laser wireless power transmission by non-imaging optics
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Laser Wireless Power Transmission (LWPT) systems have an extensive prospect in the field of wireless energy transmissions such as the space control on-orbit, spacecraft sensor networks, satellites to satellite communication and power transmission, ground to ground, ground to air, ground to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), etc. Previously, Concentrated Photovoltaics(CPV) has been used in solar energy as a solution to lower the size of the photovoltaics and yet increase efficiency. As is known laser beam spot normally presents a Gaussian distribution and laser somehow must match the size of the PV cell or array, that is how lens and concentrators are important to reshape and guide the laser beam towards the photovoltaics and in case of misalignment. The current research aims at improve the output performance of LWPT receiver by typical non-imaging optical device-Cross Compound Parabolic Concentrator (CCPC), which helps to improve the transmission of laser beam from different incident directions. Multi-field characteristics of the CPV module under laser power would be solved based on parameters from non-linear regression and experimental study. The multi-field performances of CPV module and single solar cell as the LWPT receivers have been compared. We have found that transmission distance d, divergence half-angle beta, rotation angle theta and misalignment distance dmis are most important parameters for multi-field performances and LWPT conversion. The current research provides important references for LWPT system design and optimizations.

TI  - Attributing a Causal Agent and Assessing the Severity of Non-Stand Replacing Disturbances in a Northern Hardwood Forest using Landsat-Derived Vegetation Indices
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-stand-replacing disturbances are major drivers of northern hardwood forest dynamics, but are more challenging to characterize using satellite imagery than stand-replacing events. This study proposes a hurdle approach in which disturbance causal agents are first attributed to permanent sample plots that were either partially harvested, had sustained damage from an ice storm or remained undisturbed during the observation period, reaching an overall accuracy of 82.9%. Ordinary least square regression was then used to develop disturbance-specific models to assess the severity of partial harvests and damage from ice storms, with r-squared values of 0.57 and 0.59, respectively. The disturbance-specific models included a different set of predictors, confirming the importance of attributing a causal agent to a disturbance before assessing its severity. The sequence of models was implemented regionally to produce severity maps for two disturbance events, revealing within-stand variability in the severity that could be useful for the planning of future silvicultural actions. Although the proposed models offer acceptable performance, more research is needed to include additional disturbance agents and develop models that better capture the small variations in the spectral reflectance caused by low-severity disturbances, especially in the case of low-intensity partial harvests.

TI  - Accurate estimates of land surface energy fluxes and irrigation requirements from UAV-based thermal and multispectral sensors
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The two-source energy balance model estimates canopy transpiration (Tr) and soil evaporation (E) traditionally from satellite partitions of remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) and the Priestley-Taylor equation (TSEB-PT) at seasonal time with limited accuracy. The high spatial-temporal resolution spectral data collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide valuable opportunity to estimate Tr and E precisely, improve the understanding of the seasonal and the diurnal cycle of evapotranspiration (ET), and timely detect agricultural drought. The UAV data vary in spatial resolution and the uncertainty imposed on the TSEB-PT outcome has thus far not being considered. To address these challenges and prospects, a new energy flux modelling framework based on TSEB-PT for high spatial resolution thermal and multispectral UAV data is proposed in this paper. Diurnal variations of LST in agricultural fields were recorded with a thermal infrared camera installed on an UAV during drought in 2018 and 2019. Observing potato as a test crop, LST, plant biophysical parameters derived from corresponding UAV multispectral data, and meteorological forcing variables were employed as input variables to TSEB-PT. All analyses were conducted at different pixelation of the UAV data to quantify the effect of spatial resolution on the performance. The 1 m spatial resolution produced the highest correlation between Tr modelled by TSEB-PT and measured by sap flow sensors (R2 = 0.80), which was comparable to the 0.06, 0.1, 0.5 and 2 m pixel sizes (R2 = 0.76-0.78) and markedly higher than the lower resolutions of 2 to 24 m (R2 = 0.30-0.72). Modelled Tr was highly and significantly correlated with measured leaf water potential (R2 = 0.81) and stomatal conductance (R2 = 0.74). The computed irrigation requirements (IRs) reflected the field irrigation treatments, ET and conventional irrigation practices in the area with high accuracy. It was also found that using a net primary production model with explicit representation of temperature influences made it possible to distinguish effects of drought vis-a-vis heat stress on crop productivity and water use efficiency. The results showed excellent model performance for retrieving Tr and ET dynamics under drought stress and proved that the proposed remote sensing based TSEB-PT framework at UAV scale is a promising tool for the investigation of plant drought stress and water demand; this is particularly relevant for local and regional irrigations scheduling.

TI  - Identification of illegally dumped plastic waste in a highly polluted river in Indonesia using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic waste monitoring technology based on Earth observation satellites is one approach that is currently under development in various studies. The complexity of land cover and the high human activity around rivers necessitate the development of studies that can improve the accuracy of monitoring plastic waste in river areas. This study aims to identify illegal dumping in a river area using the adjusted plastic index (API) and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data. Rancamanyar River has been selected as the research area; it is one of the tributaries of Citarum Indonesia and is an open lotic-simple form, oxbow lake type river. Our study is the first attempt to construct an API and random forest machine learning using Sentinel-2 to identify the illegal dumping of plastic waste. The algorithm development integrated the plastic index algorithm with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized buildup indices. For the validation process, the results of plastic waste image classification based on Pleiades satellite imagery and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry was used. The validation results show that the API succeeded in improving the accuracy of identifying plastic waste, which gave a better correlation in the r-value and p-value by + 0.287014 and + 3.76 x 10(-26) with Pleiades, and + 0.143131 and + 3.17 x 10(-10) with UAV.

TI  - Improving ozone simulations in Asia via multisource data assimilation:results from an observing system simulation experiment with GEMSgeostationary satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The applications of geostationary (GEO) satellite measurements at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) for monitoring and forecasting the alarming ozone pollution in Asia through data assimilation remain at the early stage. Here we investigate the benefit of multiple ozone observations from GEMS geostationary satellite, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite, and surface networks on summertime ozone simulations through individual or joint data assimilation, built on our previous observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) framework (Shu et al., 2022). We find that data assimilation improves the monitoring of exceedance, spatial patterns, and diurnal variations of surface ozone, with a regional mean negative bias reduction from 2.1 to 0.2-1.2 ppbv in ozone simulations as well as significant improvements of a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of by 5 %-69 % in most Asian countries. Furthermore, the joint assimilation of GEMS and surface observations performs the best. GEMS also brings direct added value for better reproducing ozone vertical distributions, especially in the middle to upper troposphere at low latitudes, but may mask the added value of LEO measurements, which are crucial to constrain surface and upper tropospheric ozone simulations when observations from other platforms are inadequate. Our study provides a valuable reference for ozone data assimilation as multisource observations become gradually available in the era of GEO satellites.

TI  - The effects of habitat heterogeneity, as measured by satellite image texture, on tropical forest bird distributions
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global biodiversity loss is most pronounced in the tropics. Monitoring of broad-scale patterns of habitat is essential for biodiversity conservation. Image texture measures derived from satellite data are proxies for habitat heterogeneity, but have not been tested in tropical forests. Our goal was to evaluate image texture to predict tropical forest bird distributions across Thailand for different guilds. We calculated a suite of texture measures from cumulative productivity (1-km fPAR-MODIS data) for Thailand's forests, and assessed how well texture measures predicted distributions of 86 tropical forest bird species in relation to body size, and nesting guild. Finally, we compared the predictive performance of combining (a) satellite image texture measures, (b) habitat composition, and (c) habitat fragmentation. We found that texture measures predicted occurrences of tropical forest birds well (AUC = 0.801 & PLUSMN; 0.063). Second-order homogeneity was the most predictive texture measure. Our models based on texture were significantly better for birds with larger body size (p < 0.05), but did not differ among nesting guilds (p > 0.05). Models that combined texture with habitat composition measures (AUC = 0.928 & PLUSMN; 0.038) outperformed models that combined fragmentation with habitat composition measures (AUC = 0.905 & PLUSMN; 0.047) (p < 0.05). The incorporation of texture, composition, and fragmentation variables significantly improved model accuracy over texture-only models (AUC = 0.801 & PLUSMN; 0.063 to AUC = 0.938 & PLUSMN; 0.034; p < 0.05). We suggest that texture measures are a valuable tool to predict bird distributions at broad scales in tropical forests.

TI  - Assessment of urban sprawls, amenities, and indifferences of LST and AOD in sub-urban area: a case study of Jammu
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Urbanization, particularly in peri-urban areas, often results in critically transforming the regional land use and land cover (LULC). The increased built-up in peri-urban areas affects the regional accessibility of residents of urban clusters to requisite amenities and severely affects the regional environment, as observed in the case of Jammu district situated in the foothills of the Indian Himalayas. The present study is aimed at assessing the rise of urban sprawls in Jammu district over the past two decades and how the urbanization has affected the lag in the number of amenities corresponding to the urban growth based on qualitative parameters. Further, a parameterization scheme is developed to assess the amenities quality. A comparison is made with Indore, a planned smart city, to assess the status of urbanization and residential quality based on an amenity index. The study also investigates the indifferences observed in some of the climate variables in the urban and sub-urban settings of the Jammu district. The investigation is conducted through a multi-ring buffer analysis approach utilizing the land use land cover (LULC) products based on Landsat 8/7 satellite imagery of 2002, 2013, and 2021. The indifferences in the settings are analyzed using MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) and land surface temperature (LST) products. The analysis leads to determination of critical urban parameters including the urban area, density, and growth rate, revealing significant urbanization at 25-27 km from the city center. Significant indifferences are observed in urban and sub-urban areas indicating higher rise in LST and AOD, particularly in the recent decade. These investigations provide critical information to urban and climate solution authorities for planning and management, particularly in critically endangered areas.

CP  - 22nd International Congress for Analytical Psychology

AB  - This essay addresses the key role of analytical psychology amid our changing world: to work towards an expansion of Humanity's worldview. In current times of utmost transformation, it becomes imperative that we embrace a total cosmovision, one that includes the 360 degrees of existence: not only the 180 diurnal degrees of ascent, light and order, yet also the descendent sphere, incorporating what is unconscious, nocturnal and mysterious. Integrating this lower realm in our psychic life, however, contrasts our Western worldview, in which these two domains are seemingly opposed and mutually excluding. Mythopoetic language, and the mythologems that manifest in different myths, provide the means of delving into the profound paradoxes at the core of the total cosmovision. Myths such as Ananuca (Chile), Osiris (Egypt), Dionysus (Greece) and Innana (Sumer), highlight the descending path, providing a symbolic narrative of an archetypical transformation or spin, a key moment of "turning on its own axis" that merges the realms of Life and Death, ascent and descent, birth and decay. To live this paradoxical and generative path of transformation, individuals must seek their personal myth not outside but within themselves, where springs the Suprasense.

AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a radiosensitive tumor and the role of radiotherapy in the management of this disease was newly defined in the recently published update of the S2k guideline on Merkel cell carcinoma of the Association of Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF). While adjuvant radiotherapy of the tumor bed is broadly recommended, irradiation of the regional nodal region can be performed in patients with negative sentinel lymph nodes and high-risk factors. In patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes, it is an alternative to completion lymphadenectomy. The standard dose for adjuvant radiotherapy remains 50 Gy.

TI  - Investigation of three-dimensional radiative transfer effects for UV-Vis satellite and ground-based observations of volcanic plumes
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate effects of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of volcanic plumes on the retrieval results of satellite and ground-based UV-Vis observations. For the analysis of such measurements, 1D scenarios are usually assumed (the atmospheric properties only depend on altitude). While 1D assumptions are well suited for the analysis of many atmospheric phenomena, they are usually less appropriate for narrow trace gas plumes. For UV-Vis satellite instruments with large ground pixel sizes like the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) or the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), 3D effects are of minor importance, but usually these observations are not sensitive to small volcanic plumes. In contrast, observations of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board Sentinel-5P have a much smaller ground pixel size (3.5 x 5.5 km(2)). Thus, on the one hand, TROPOMI can detect much smaller plumes than previous instruments. On the other hand, 3D effects become more important, because the TROPOMI ground pixel size is smaller than the height of the troposphere and also smaller than horizontal atmospheric photon path lengths in the UV-Vis spectral range.In this study we investigate the following 3D effects using Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations: (1) the light-mixing effect caused by horizontal photon paths, (2) the saturation effect for strong SO2 absorption, (3) geometric effects related to slant illumination and viewing angles and (4) plume side-effects related to slant illumination angles and photons reaching the sensor from the sides of volcanic plumes. The first two effects especially can lead to a strong and systematic underestimation of the true trace gas content if 1D retrievals are applied (more than 50 % for the light-mixing effect and up to 100 % for the saturation effect). Besides the atmospheric radiative transfer, the saturation effect also affects the spectral retrievals. Geometric effects have a weaker influence on the quantitative analyses but can lead to a spatial smearing of elevated plumes or even to virtual double plumes. Plume side-effects are small for short wavelengths but can become large for longer wavelengths (up to 100 % for slant viewing and illumination angles). For ground-based observations, most of the above-mentioned 3D effects are not important because of the narrow field of view (FOV) and the closer distance between the instrument and the volcanic plume. However, the light-mixing effect shows a similar strong dependence on the horizontal plume extension as for satellite observations and should be taken into account for the analysis of ground-based observations.

TI  - Recent Aqueous Activity on Mars Evidenced by Transverse Aeolian Ridges in the Zhurong Exploration Region of Utopia Planitia
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aqueous activities on Mars have gradually declined since the Noachian (>3.7 Ga). Although water can be stored in the subsurface during the latest epochs, geomorphological evidence is still limited. In this study, we used in situ imaging and spectral data acquired by China's Zhurong rover, as well as high-resolution remote-sensing data, to investigate the transverse aeolian ridges (TARs) in the Zhurong landing region of Utopia Planitia. A two-stage evolutionary scenario of the TARs is proposed and polygonal features with hydrated minerals are identified for the first time on the surface of Martian TARs. We discussed the possible formation mechanisms of the polygonal features, and proposed that they could be related to recent aqueous activity and atmosphere-surface water exchange on Mars, which sheds light on the hydrological cycle of Mars in current cold and dry climate.

TI  - Soil Moisture Observations From Shortwave Infrared Channels Reveal Tornado Tracks: A Case in 10-11 December 2021 Tornado Outbreak
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based post-tornado assessments have been widely used for the detection of tornado tracks, which heavily relies on the identification of vegetation changes through observations at visible and near-infrared channels. During the deadly 10-11 December 2021 tornado outbreak, a series of violent tornadoes first touched down over northeastern Arkansas, an area dominated by cropland with rare vegetation coverage in winter. Through the examination of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer multi-spectral observations, this study reveals significant scars on shortwave infrared channels over this region, but none are captured by visible and near-infrared channels. The dominant soil type is aquert (one of vertisols), whose high clay content well preserves the severe changes in soil structure during the tornado passage, when the topmost soil layer was removed and underlying soil with higher moisture content was exposed to the air. This study suggests a quick post-tornado assessment method over less vegetated area by using shortwave infrared channels.

TI  - Spatiotemporal features of the soil moisture across Northwest China using remote sensing data, reanalysis data, and global hydrological model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important factor affecting the change of land surface hydrological processes and the distribution of material and energy exchanges between the land and atmosphere and vegetation's temporal and spatial distributions, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. This paper focuses on soil moisture features across Northwest China, the core region of the Silk Road Economic Belt. Six soil moisture datasets from the period 1981-2020 were employed, which included ERA5 (the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Atmospheric Reanalysis 5), ESA-CCI (European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative), GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System), MERRA-2 (The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2), RSSSM (A Remote Sensing-based global 10-day resolution Surface Soil Moisture dataset), and SSM-Feng (Regional multimodal fusion of surface soil moisture data in China). The temporal and spatial variation of the linear trend and abrupt change characteristics at seasonal and annual scale were explored. The results are as follows: 1) ESA-CCI, GLDAS, and MERRA-2 showed a slow increase in annual soil moisture tendency at a rate of less than 0.001 m(3)/m(3)/year, while ERA5 and SSM-Feng showed a significant decreasing linear trend at a rate of 1.31 x 10(-4) m(3)/m(3)/year and 1.01 x 10(-4) m(3)/m(3)/year (p < 0.05), respectively. 2) In autumn and winter, only GLDAS and MERRA-2 showed significant increasing trends. In the growing season (i.e., from April to October), the soil moisture of ESA-CCI, GLDAS, and MERRA-2 significantly increased at the rates of 3.29 x 10(-4) m(3)/m(3)/year, 3.30 x 10(-4) m(3)/m(3)/year, and 6.64 x 10(-4) m(3)/m(3)/year (p < 0.05), respectively. 3) ERA5 and ESA-CCI have frequent abrupt changes in 1984, 1987, and 2006 for ERA5, 2010-2012 and 2019-2020 for ESA-CCI. 4) In terms of spatial variations, most datasets show that soil moisture has increased across most regions. The ERA5, ESA-CCI, GLDAS, MERRA-2, and SSM-Feng datasets show decreased soil moisture in the Tarim Basin. The conclusions of this study deepen the understanding of temporal and spatial variation in soil moisture in arid areas of Northwest China. Through these conclusions, a certain theoretical basis can be provided for the complex water cycle process in the arid region.

TI  - Estimating evapotranspiration and yield of wheat and maize croplands through a remote sensing-based model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) and yield over cropland is essential for water resources management and food security. Particularly the estimation at long-term and regional scales still needs to be investigated. In this study, a remotely sensed and water-carbon coupled model was combined with a process-based crop growth simulation method to simultaneously estimate ET and yield. The developed model was tested for two of the most important crops (wheat and maize) with years of observations. Leaf area index determined by various remote sensing indices and individually calibrated parameters for wheat and maize were considered to improve crop ET and gross primary production (GPP) estimates. The parameters well reflected different physiological properties that C4 maize has a smaller stomatal conductance coefficient and a larger sensitivity in response to initial light than C3 wheat. Comparing with 20 years of measurements, the root mean square error (RMSE) of ET and GPP for winter wheat was 0.57 mm d-1 and 1.65 g C m- 2 d-1, and for maize were 0.80 mm d-1 and 2.92 g C m- 2 d-1, respectively. Besides, crop growth simulation including biomass accumulation and allocation agreed well with the measurements. Coefficient of determination was mostly larger than 0.66, and RMSE of yield was 554.7 and 1346.6 kg hm-2 for wheat and maize, respectively. Finally, the spatiotemporal crop water productivity (WP) of winter wheat and summer maize in the North China Plain during 2001-2018 were quantified. The increased WP of winter wheat while the larger WP of maize than that of wheat were discovered. The developed model helps to examine regional crop ET and yield and provides critical information on agricultural water management.

TI  - Assessment of ensemble learning for object-based land cover mapping using multi-temporal Sentinel-1/2 images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate land cover mapping is challenging in Southeast Asia where cloud coverage is prevalent and landscape is heterogenous. Object-based mapping, multi-temporal images and combined use of optical and microwave data, provide abundant features in spectral, spatial, temporal, geometric and polarimetric dimensions. And random forest is usually employed due to robustness and efficiency in handling high-dimensional and noisy data. This study assesses whether feature selection and ensemble analysis, which are rarely adopted, yield improved result. Recursive feature elimination decreases original 568 features into a subset of 53 features, achieving the optimal combination of features. Ensemble analysis of random forest, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbors leads to an overall accuracy of 0.816. Comparison experiments demonstrated the merits of the multi-temporal, multi-source approach, feature elimination and ensemble analysis.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities in arid and semi-arid regions often confront harsher natural environments and severer industrial pollution. So these are frequently subjected to heavy air pollution, which has critical consequences for the health and production activities and well-being of local citizens. To curb the aggravation of air pollution, the Chinese government conducted an air pollution control action plan with unprecedented strength in September 2013. In this study, based on the fine-resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, combined meteorological and other auxiliary data, utilizing information entropy, backward trajectory, source analysis, and multi-layer perceptron methods, we comprehensively analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics and variations of AOD in typical arid and semi-arid areas megacities (Lanzhou and Urumqi) from 2010 to 2019, and further explore the potential pollution sources and nature and anthropic influences on AOD. The main results indicate that Lanzhou AOD remains higher than Urumqi in almost all different time windows, especially in the spring. Specifically, the AOD shows a single-peaked distributed trend on the monthly scale, but the peak occurred one month later in Lanzhou than in Urumqi. In the seasons, Lanzhou and Urumqi all show a trend that spring and winter AOD are higher than summer and fall. Lanzhou and Urumqi overall show a tortuous decreasing and then rebounded trend between 2010 and 2019, but the AOD variation in the Urumqi is more dramatic than in Lanzhou. The high AOD mainly concentrates in low altitude areas and there is a downward tendency of AOD in high-AOD areas, but an upward trend in low-AOD areas. The AOD intensity of change is higher in Lanzhou than in Urumqi, but Lanzhou has more concentration. The seasonal differences in backward trajectories are stronger in Lanzhou than in Urumqi, generally, Lanzhou's potential trajectory is mainly distributed in the Hexi Corridor, while Urumqi is along the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains urban cluster distribution. The potential source area of AOD has a significant seasonal variation, and the closer to the object, the greater the contribution. Generally, Lanzhou pollution is more sensitive to the atmosphere condition and has a wider source area than Urumqi. The AOD was influenced by a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors, but natural variables seem to be more dominant. The impact of natural factors in Urumqi and Lanzhou is statistically obtained up to 75.04% and 52.01% respectively.

TI  - Hermeneutic Labor: The Gendered Burden of Interpretation in Intimate Relationships between Women and Men
T2  - HYPATIA-A JOURNAL OF FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, feminist scholarship on emotional labor has proliferated. I identify a related but distinct form of care labor, hermeneutic labor. Hermeneutic labor is the burdensome activity of: understanding and coherently expressing one's own feelings, desires, intentions, and motivations; discerning those of others; and inventing solutions for relational issues arising from interpersonal tensions. I argue that hermeneutic labor disproportionately falls on women's shoulders in heteropatriarchal societies, especially in intimate relationships between women and men. I also suggest that some of the gendered burdens of emotional labor that feminist scholars point out would better be described as hermeneutic labor. Drawing on feminist philosophy as well as findings from social psychology and sociology, I argue that the exploitation of women's hermeneutic labor is a pervasive element of what Sandra Bartky calls the "micropolitics" of intimate relationships. The widespread expectation that women are relationship-maintenance experts, as well as the prevalence of a gendered demand-withdraw pattern of communication, leads an exploitative situation to appear natural or even desirable, even as it leads to women's dissatisfaction. This situation may be considered misogynistic in Kate Manne's sense, where misogyny is a property of social environments rather than a worldview.

TI  - Understanding Sentinel-1 backscatter response to sugarcane yield variability and waterlogging
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 observes the whole globe every 12 days (6 days when both satellites were operational) and provides a wealth of data relevant to agriculture. Sugarcane cultivators could potentially benefit from these data by using them to assist operational and management practices. However, first, thorough understanding is needed of Sentinel-1 backscatter and its behavior over sugarcane canopies. In this study, we aimed to improve understanding of how Sentinel-1 backscatter responds to sugarcane yield variability and waterlogging. In order to do so we focused on an irrigated sugarcane plantation in Xinavane, Mozambique. In the analysis presented, we assessed different polarizations, their ratio, and benchmarked them against optical indices and passive microwave observations in different seasons. With the help of a large sugarcane yield dataset, we analyzed how backscatter relates to sucrose yield variability in different seasons. We found VV backscatter related to the stalk development, the most important reservoir for sucrose accumulation. In addition, in a season with reported waterlogging, optical and radar observations showed a delay in sugarcane crop development. Further analysis showed the presence of water underneath the canopy caused an increase in all polarizations and the cross ratio (CR). The results imply that Sentinel-1 backscatter contains information on both waterlogging under the canopy as well as sucrose development in the stalk. By isolating and quantifying the impact of waterlogging on backscatter, it will be possible to further quantify sucrose development with backscatter observations and identify waterlogging simultaneously.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - As observed by remote sensing images in December 2013 and January 2014, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) bloom occurred on the south side of the Agulhas Current (38 degrees S-45 degrees S). The dynamic mechanisms of Chl-a bloom were studied by satellite remote sensing data, reanalysis data and Argo data. The periodic shedding of the Agulhas ring led to a significant eastward shift of the Agulhas retroflection from December 2013 to January 2014, without the obstruction of flowing complex eddies and with increased current flow. Then, the horizontal transfer of Chl-a occurred along the south side of the Agulhas Current (38 degrees S-45 degrees S). Nitrate concentrations reached 10-15 mu mol center dot L-1 on the south side of the Agulhas Current, where a deepened mixed layer and upwelling and the vertical transport of nutrients contributed to the Chl-a bloom. In addition, sufficient light and suitable precipitation provide good conditions for Chl-a bloom on the south side of the Agulhas Current.

TI  - The role of crop classification in detecting wheat yield variation for index-based agricultural insurance in arid and semiarid environments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of open-source and high-quality satellite data has facilitated market developments in the index insurance sector. So far, research and industry spheres have used administrative boundaries of units to estimate regional index values for insurance design. In areas with heterogeneous land use or land cover, however, these indices do not provide sufficient accuracy. This study analyzes potential accuracy gains from land-use classification that allow to design indices specifically for croplands and wheatlands. The validity of this approach is tested along conventional satellite-based products, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST), as well as indices that are not yet widely used in crop insurance industry, like the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI). The study covers 2060 yield observations from 152 districts across Central Asia and Mongolia with irrigated, mixed and rainfed wheat farming systems. The results show that the majority of these indices are suitable for detecting wheat yield variations in rainfed and mixed agricultural lands, although they remain ambiguous in irrigated lands. Land-use classification and designing indices based on croplands and wheatlands noticeably increases the relationship between indices and wheat yields in rainfed and mixed lands. Notably, the LAI and GCI out-perform other well-known indices. Overall, freely available satellite data could serve as a good source for establishing index insurance products in Central Asia and Mongolia. Nevertheless, a careful assessment and selection of index and land use classification remains essential.

TI  - Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on breast cancer surgery using the National Database of Japan
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Various countries have reported a decrease in breast cancer surgeries during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, inconsistent results have been reported in Japan. This study revealed changes in the number of surgeries during the pandemic using the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (NDB) from January 2015 to January 2021, where insurance claims data from Japan as a whole are comprehensively accumulated. The number of breast-conserving surgeries (BCS) without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) significantly decreased in July (- 846; 95% confidence interval (CI) - 1190 to - 502) and October 2020 (- 540; 95% CI - 861 to - 218). No decrease was observed for other types of surgery, BCS with ALND, and mastectomy with or without ALND. In the age-specific subgroup analysis, significant and transient reduction in BCS without ALND was observed in all age groups (0-49, 50-69, and >= 70 years). The number of BCS without ALND significantly decreased for a relatively short period in the early pandemic stages, suggesting reduced surgery for patients with a relatively low stage of cancer. Some patients with breast cancer might have been left untreated during the pandemic, and an unfavorable prognosis would be a concern.

TI  - Pest suppression potential varies across 10 bioenergy cropping systems
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Top-down suppression of herbivores is a fundamental ecological process and a critical service in agricultural landscapes. Adoption of bioenergy cropping systems is likely to become an increasingly important driver causing loss or gain of this service in coming decades. We measured natural pest suppression potential in ten model bioenergy crops in a long-term experimental array by deploying plasticine sentinel caterpillar mimics, which record imprints from predator attacks. Cropping systems included three intensive annual row crop systems and a range of simple perennial monocultures and more complex polycultures. We compared attack rates across the ten cropping systems and assessed differences over time within a growing season and between the ground level and canopy. We found strong differences in attack rates across cropping systems, usually with more attacks in perennial crops than annuals. However, outcomes varied in space and time, both within and among cropping systems. Birds and small mammals were responsible for most, and sometimes all, attacks in annual crops and were most important early in the season. Chewing arthropod attacks increased over the course of the growing season and were responsible for most attack events in perennial systems. In late summer there were almost no attacks in annual crop canopies, while attack rates in perennial canopies at the same time were quite high and were carried out almost entirely by chewing arthropods. Our results underscore the lack of trophic complexity in annual bioenergy cropping systems relative to perennials. They also illustrate the dramatic changes in predator activity and predation intensity that occur both seasonally and between the ground and plant canopy. Policies and practices that increase the footprint of annual crops for bioenergy are likely to cause a deficit in pest suppression services at local and landscape scales.

TI  - Dynamic emergent leaf area in tidal wetlands: Implications for satellite-derived regional and global blue carbon estimates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate highlights the importance of blue carbon in tidal wetlands in combating climate change. In this study, we highlight the uncertainty associated with leaf area index (LAI) estimations in tidal wetlands, specifically salt marshes, a key vegetation parameter for productivity models and Earth System Models (ESM). LAI, derived from satellite reflectance data, is linked to atmospheric carbon exchange and gross primary production (GPP) across vegetative ecosystems. However, estimating salt marsh LAI is challenging because canopy height and density vary across short distances, and tidal flooding alters the atmosphere-exposed leaf area, hereafter called emergent leaf area index (ELAI), at short time scales. Further, in tidal wetlands dominated by species such as Spartina alterniflora, canopy height and density vary across short distances. We present a novel approach for measuring spatiotemporal dynamics in tidal wetland ELAI. We modeled ELAI from vertical LAI profiles and created spatial estimates across tidal periods. We then linked ELAI with eddy covariance carbon (C) fluxes through footprint modeling and revealed correlations between emergent leaf area and C fluxes. Next, we demonstrated that ELAI can be readily estimated across 10-m spatial scales using Sentinel-2 satellite data, even during high tides (R2 = 0.89; NRMSE = 10%). Finally, we showed a common product, MODIS MYD15A2H, underestimated (20%) LAI during dry conditions but overestimated (7-93%) during high flooding. Dynamic ELAI could reduce uncertainties in satellite-derived global GPP products when developing blue carbon budgets for ecosystems threatened by accelerated sea level rise.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of the surface urban heat island (SUHI), air pollution and disease pattern: an applied study on the city of Granada (Spain)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - There is worldwide concern about how climate change -which involves rising temperatures- may increase the risk of contracting and developing diseases, reducing the quality of life. This study provides new research that takes into account parameters such as land surface temperature (LST), surface urban heat island (SUHI), urban hotspot (UHS), air pollution (SO2, NO2, CO, O-3 and aerosols), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference building index (NDBI) and the proportion of vegetation (PV) that allows evaluating environmental quality and establishes mitigation measures in future urban developments that could improve the quality of life of a given population. With the help of Sentinel 3 and 5P satellite images, we studied these variables in the context of Granada (Spain) during the year 2021 to assess how they may affect the risk of developing diseases (stomach, colorectal, lung, prostate and bladder cancer, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, liver disease and suicide). The results, corroborated by the statistical analysis using the Data Panel technique, indicate that the variables LST, SUHI and daytime UHS, NO2, SO2 and NDBI have important positive correlations above 99% (p value: 0.000) with an excess risk of developing these diseases. Hence, the importance of this study for the formulation of healthy policies in cities and future research that minimizes the excess risk of diseases.

TI  - Species-based aboveground mangrove carbon stock estimation using WorldView-2 image data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon stocks of a mangrove ecosystem depend to some extent on the diversity of its con-stituent species, which have different biophysical characteristics. The high-resolution remote sensing imagery from WorldView-2 (2 m pixel size) provides a data source for estimating above-ground mangrove carbon (mangrove AGC) stocks across species. This study was designed to (i) map mangrove species by applying the GEOBIA method, (ii) calculate mangrove AGC using species-specific allometric equations, and (iii) map the spatial distribution of mangrove AGC at the species level. It combined the species map from GEOBIA with carbon stock estimation by gen-erating a model based on the vegetation index (spectral transformation of several WorldView-2 bands) over the Clungup Mangrove Conservation (CMC) area in Malang, East Java, Indonesia. GEOBIA was used to classify mangrove species based on the homogeneous segments of each species depicted in the image, while the carbon stocks in the field were calculated using species -specific allometric equations. A regression function between the carbon stocks and the vegetation index value stored in each pixel was applied to the derived mangrove species map. The GEOBIA species mapping using the nearest neighbor algorithm identified six dominant species in the CMC area, namely Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora apiculata, Rhizophora mucronata, Sonneratia alba, and Nypa fruticans, with an 84% overall accuracy. Based on the regression analy-sis results, the vegetation index values varied across species. The mangrove AGC estimation and mapping at the species level produced favorable results, with a maximum accuracy of 54.94% for B. gymnorrhiza, 55.55% for C. tagal, 41.43% for R. apiculata, 51.38% for R. mucronata, and 54.87% for S. alba. Also, the range of the estimated carbon stocks differed for each species. This research contributes an innovative development by combining methods of mangrove species mapping with mangrove AGC estimation at the species level.

TI  - EZ-InSAR: An easy-to-use open-source toolbox for mapping ground surface deformation using satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a space-borne geodetic technique that can map ground displacement at millimetre accuracy. Via the new era for InSAR applications provided by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 SAR satellites, several open-source software packages exist for processing SAR data. These packages enable one to obtain high-quality ground deformation maps, but still require a deep understanding of InSAR theory and the related computational tools, especially when dealing with a large stack of images. Here we present an open-source toolbox, EZ-InSAR (easy-to-use InSAR), for a user-friendly implementation of InSAR displacement time series analysis with multi-temporal SAR images. EZ-InSAR integrates the three most popular and renowned open-source tools (i.e., ISCE, StaMPS, and MintPy), to generate interferograms and displacement time series by using these state-of-art algorithms within a seamless Graphical User Interface. EZ-InSAR reduces the user's workload by automatically downloading the Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and the digital elevation model data for the user's area of interest, and by streamlining preparation of input data stacks for the time series InSAR analysis. We illustrate the EZ-InSAR processing capabilities by mapping recent ground deformation at Campi Flegrei (> 100 mm center dot yr(-1)) and Long Valley (similar to 10 mm center dot yr(-1)) calderas with both Persistent Scatterer InSAR and Small-Baseline Subset approaches. We also validate the test results by comparing the InSAR displacements with Global Navigation Satellite System measurements at those volcanoes. Our tests indicate that the EZ-InSAR toolbox provided here can serve as a valuable contribution to the community for ground deformation monitoring and geohazard evaluation, as well as for disseminating bespoke InSAR observations for all.

TI  - Data driven analysis of atmospheric methane concentrations as function of geographic, land cover type and season
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decade we have witnessed a rapid, so far unexplained, increase in the emission of methane to the atmosphere and this increase could lead to an acceleration of the ongoing climate changes. The increase is likely to originate from agriculture, but oil and gas production as well as wetlands are also under suspicion. The best way to quantify the emission of methane and other greenhouse gasses to our atmosphere is by using space based remote sensing. Here, we analyse 3 years of measurements of the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of methane from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument on Sentinel-5P obtained with two different retrieval methods in order to evaluate the dependency on geographic, land cover type and season. The land cover types were obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and from the World Cover data product using observations from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions. The analysis reveals that while the highest methane concentrations are generally found over croplands, the lowest are generally found over shrublands, which is in agreement with expectations. It is more surprising that the analysis also reveals lower than average methane concentrations over wetlands as wetlands are generally thought to be a major source of methane emission. Until this discrepancy is resolved the methane concentration over wetlands from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument on Sentinel-5P should be handled with caution. It is also found that the annual methane cycle, as seen in the measured methane concentrations, for croplands, shrublands and savannas is delayed in Africa compared to Asia.

TI  - The Representation of Sea Salt Aerosols and Their Role in Polar Climate Within CMIP6
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural aerosols and their interactions with clouds remain an important uncertainty within climate models, especially at the poles. Here, we study the behavior of sea salt aerosols (SSaer) in the Arctic and Antarctic within 12 climate models from CMIP6. We investigate the driving factors that control SSaer abundances and show large differences based on the choice of the source function, and the representation of aerosol processes in the atmosphere. Close to the poles, the CMIP6 models do not match observed seasonal cycles of surface concentrations, likely due to the absence of wintertime SSaer sources such as blowing snow. Further away from the poles, simulated concentrations have the correct seasonality, but have a positive mean bias of up to one order of magnitude. SSaer optical depth is derived from the MODIS data and compared to modeled values, revealing good agreement, except for winter months. Better agreement for aerosol optical depth than surface concentration may indicate a need for improving the vertical distribution, the size distribution and/or hygroscopicity of modeled polar SSaer. Source functions used in CMIP6 emit very different numbers of small SSaer, potentially exacerbating cloud-aerosol interaction uncertainties in these remote regions. For future climate scenarios SSP126 and SSP585, we show that SSaer concentrations increase at both poles at the end of the 21st century, with more than two times mid-20th century values in the Arctic. The pre-industrial climate CMIP6 experiments suggest there is a large uncertainty in the polar radiative budget due to SSaer.Plain Language Summary Aerosols emitted from the ocean, such as sea salt particles (aerosols), are critical for the climate of polar regions. However, there is still uncertainty in their representation in climate models. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the representation of sea salt aerosols (SSaer) in the Arctic and Antarctic in a recent model inter-comparison initiative, and to assess the consequences for our understanding of present-day and future polar climate. We find that the models disagree between them and with observations from ground stations and from space. This suggests that the formulation of sea salt emissions in global models is not adapted for polar regions. With sea ice retreat, SSaer will most likely increase in the future, which makes addressing the current uncertainty an important next step for the scientific community.

TI  - GLONASS-NavIC Hybrid Operation from India Towards Seamless and Improved Performance
T2  - NATIONAL ACADEMY SCIENCE LETTERS-INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The fully operational GLObal'naya NAvigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema (GLONASS) is used in many civilian and military applications as an alternative to Global Positioning System. However, it is observed that the GLONASS constellation regularly provides inferior satellite geometry resulting in higher Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) values from various locations across the globe and fails to provide a seamless position solution in constrained visibility conditions. In such scenarios inclusion of the regional Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) signals together with GLONASS can mitigate the problems and provide uninterrupted improved position solution accuracy from India. This paper presents the possible solution to the problem by including NavIC with GLONASS within the NavIC service region. Using real-time satellite data collected from eastern India in open-sky and constrained visibility environments, it is observed that the NavIC + GLONASS hybrid operation always offers good satellite geometry with PDOP values less than 3, resulting in uninterrupted position solution in satellite visibility constrained situations even up to 20-30 degrees elevation, and improved position solution accuracy compared to GLONASS-only operation. GLONASS provides system independence while NavIC integration extends the benefits of improved satellite geometry and enhanced solution quality. The results of this study show the benefits of global-regional systems' integrated operation for India and the surrounding regions both for defense and civilian applications.

T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Remote sensing devices are keeping eyes on the earth surface to acquire information directly and quickly. A remote sensing image carries information about the biophysical materials of the million acres of land and hence identification and extraction of earth features from the remote sensing big data is the major application of remote sensing. In the present work Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data are used to extract water bodies in Prayagraj district, Uttar Pradesh, India. There are two problems observed in dealing with panchromatic band of Landsat-8 in the study area i.e., meet but don't mix and feature mixing. The meet but don't mix problem refers to the classification of water regions of two confluencing rivers into two different classes. On the other hand, feature mixing refers to the mixing of water regions with neighboring vegetation regions during classification. It is claimed in past research that the Near InfraRed (NIR) band is suitable for water enhancement as the other Land Use Land Cover (LULC) features are suppressed. So, the Panchromatic (PAN) band is fused with Infra-Red band using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The fused images are classified and it is observed that the aforesaid two problems are resolved and the overall classification accuracy is improved from 74.23% to 89.1% after fusion.

TI  - Simulating glacier mass balance and its contribution to runoff in Northern Sweden
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are one of the main sources of freshwater in cold regions. The glacier melting process can significantly impact the glacier mass balance (GMB) and contribute a large amount of runoff in cold regions. This study applied the recently developed semi-distributed glacio-hydrological conceptual model (FLEXG) to understand the glacier melting process and the effect of topography on GMB in the Torne River basin, northern Sweden. The study simulated glacier and snow accumulation and ablation, as well as runoff from the glacier and non-glacier areas of the basin using the FLEXG model for the time period 1989-2018. The FLEXG model considers the influence of topography on runoff generation, and in this study the basin was classified into 143 zones depending on elevation and aspect. In order to gain a comprehensive view of the performance of the FLEXG model, the classical lumped hydrological model HBV was used and compared with the FLEXG model in simulating total streamflow and peak runoff at the outlet of the basin. Our results revealed that the FLEXG model performed well in reproducing the streamflow (also better than the HBV model) with metric Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.80 and 0.71 for the calibration and validation periods, respectively. We also found that the FLEXG model performs better in peak runoff simulation than the HBV model. The FLEXG simulated snow cover area proportion agreed well with the MODIS satellite snow cover product (R2 = 0.60 and RMSE = 28%). The GMB in different elevation zones was simulated, and a downward trend was found for GMB changes during the study period because of climate change.

TI  - Are the C-band backscattering coefficient and interferometric coherence suitable substitutes of NDVI for the monitoring of the FAO-56 crop coefficient?
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationalizing the use of agricultural water is a key issue in semi-arid areas that face more and more water shortages while food security is already threatened by the increasing population. The FAO-56 approach has been developed to estimate the crop water requirement. It relies on an accurate estimation of the "basal crop coef-ficient" Kcb-act that has been shown to be closely related to NDVI. Nevertheless, optical data can be inoperant in case of persistent cloud cover. Within this context, the objective of this study is to assess the potentiality of the all-weather C-band Sentinel-1 radar observations available with 6-day revisit time at the field scale. To this end, the empirical relationships between Kcb-act, on one hand, and the interferometric coherence at VV (pVV) and VH (pVH) polarizations and the polarization ratio, on the other hand, were assessed on two wheat fields during two crop seasons and compared to the classical Kcb-act-NDVI method. It is demonstrated that while good statistical metrics are obviously obtained between Kcb-act and NDVI derived from Sentinel-2 (R = 0.77/0.88 and RMSE = 0.14/0.15 for Field 1/Field 2), close results are highlighted with radar data. The best metrics are found with pVV: R = 0.76 and 0.77 and RMSE = 0.18 and 0.28 for Field 1 and Field 2, respectively. Using the calibrated re-lationships on one season of Field 1, reasonable estimates of ETc-act was found on Field 1 (R = 0.70, RMSE = 0.75 mm/day and bias =-0.18 mm/days using Kcb-act-pVV). By contrast, a significant overestimations is high-lighted both with pVV (bias = 0.73 mm/day) and NDVI (bias = 1.46 mm/day) over Field 2. Interestingly, the Kcb-act-pVV relationship is more consistent in the estimation of ETc-act when changing from one plot to another. These outcomes open new perspectives for the estimation of ETc-act from radar data as a potential substitute of NDVI in case of persistent cloud cover.

TI  - The Role of Midlatitude Cyclones in the Emission, Transport, Production, and Removal of Aerosols in the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine the distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) across 27,707 northern hemisphere (NH) midlatitude cyclones for 2005-2018 using retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on the Aqua satellite. Cyclone-centered composites show AOD enhancements of 20%-45% relative to background conditions in the warm conveyor belt (WCB) airstream. Fine mode AOD accounts for 68% of this enhancement annually. Relative to background conditions, coarse mode AOD is enhanced by more than a factor of two near the center of the composite cyclone, co-located with high surface wind speeds. Within the WCB, MODIS AOD maximizes in spring, with a secondary maximum in summer. Cyclone-centered composites of AOD from the Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 Global Modeling Initiative (M2GMI) simulation reproduce the magnitude and seasonality of the MODIS AOD composites and enhancements. M2GMI simulations show that the AOD enhancement in the WCB is dominated by sulfate (37%) and organic aerosol (25%), with dust and sea salt each accounting for 15%. MODIS and M2GMI AOD are 60% larger in North Pacific WCBs compared to North Atlantic WCBs and show a strong relationship with anthropogenic pollution. We infer that NH midlatitude cyclones account for 355 Tg yr(-1) of sea salt aerosol emissions annually, or 60% of the 30-80?degrees N total. We find that deposition within WCBs is responsible for up to 35% of the total aerosol deposition over the NH ocean basins. Furthermore, the cloudy environment of WCBs leads to efficient secondary sulfate production.

TI  - Volcanic Emissions, Plume Dispersion, and Downwind Radiative Impacts Following Mount Etna Series of Eruptions of February 21-26, 2021
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - During the extended activity of Mount Etna volcano in February-April 2021, three distinct paroxysmal events took place from February 21 to 26, which were associated with a very uncommon transport of the injected upper-tropospheric plumes toward the north. Using a synergy of observations and modeling, we characterized the emissions and three-dimensional dispersion for these three plumes, monitored their downwind distribution and optical properties, and estimated their radiative impacts at selected locations. With a satellite-based source inversion, we estimate the emitted sulfur dioxide (SO2) mass at an integrated value of 55 kt and plumes injections at up to 12 km altitudes, which qualifies this series as an extreme event for Mount Etna. Then, we combine Lagrangian dispersion modeling, initialized with measured temporally resolved SO2 emission fluxes and altitudes, with satellite observations to track the dispersion of the three individual plumes. The transport toward the north allowed the height-resolved downwind monitoring of the plumes at selected observatories in France, Italy, and Israel, using LiDARs and photometric aerosol observations. Volcanic-specific aerosol optical depths (AODs) in the visible spectral range ranging from about 0.004 to 0.03 and local daily average shortwave radiative forcing (RF) ranging from about -0.2 to -1.2 W m(-2) (at the top of atmosphere) and from about -0.2 to -3.0 W m(-2) (at the surface) are found. The composition (possible presence of ash), AOD, and RF of the plume have a large inter-plume and intra-plume variability and thus depend strongly on the position of the sampled section of the plumes.

TI  - A cooperative scheme for late leaf spot estimation in peanut using UAV multispectral images
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Australia, peanuts are mainly grown in Queensland with tropical and subtropical climates. The most common foliar disease that poses a severe threat to quality peanut production is late leaf spot (LLS). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely investigated for various plant trait estimations. The existing works on UAV-based remote sensing have achieved promising results for crop disease estimation using a mean or a threshold value to represent the plot-level image data, but these methods might be insufficient to capture the distribution of pixels within a plot. This study proposes two new methods, namely measurement index (MI) and coefficient of variation (CV), for LLS disease estimation on peanuts. We first investigated the relationship between the UAV-based multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and the LLS disease scores at the late growth stages of peanuts. We then compared the performances of the proposed MI and CV-based methods with the threshold and mean-based methods for LLS disease estimation. The results showed that the MI-based method achieved the highest coefficient of determination and the lowest error for five of the six chosen VIs whereas the CV-based method performed the best for simple ratio (SR) index among the four methods. By considering the strengths and weaknesses of each method, we finally proposed a cooperative scheme based on the MI, the CV and the mean-based methods for automatic disease estimation, demonstrated by applying this scheme to the LLS estimation in peanuts.

TI  - Efficient CNN for high-resolution remote sensing imagery understanding
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The analysis of remote sensing data and the classification of images are complex problems because understanding spatial patterns and intricate geometric structures of the data from which meaningful interrelationship pixels are extracted is essential in the remote sensing community. CNN is one of the Machine Learning methods often used in Remote Sensing problems. However, high-resolution aerial view classification often leverages large-scale data with a huge number of parameters of the CNN model. A large number of parameters makes it hard to be applied to remote imaging peripherals because it requires high capacity of storage and memory. We propose a training framework to solve that problem that produces a model with minimum parameters without sacrificing accuracy. To this end, we train EfficientNet using Weighted Loss of INS to compensate imbalanced classes while keeping the upper layer frozen to preserve essential features deriving from transfer learning. Moreover, we utilize Sparse Regularization on the loss function to make the model focussing on the global object. Finally, as post-training, the trained model is pruned to reduce the number of parameters within the network. Using this method on the AID Dataset, the best results are achieved by EfficientNet-B0 with Freeze 2 Layer, INS Weighted Loss, Sparse regularization with lambda = 0.001, and Global Unstructured Conv2D Pruning with an accuracy of 96.81% on test data with total parameters of 2,463,501. This study proves that Weighted Loss and Sparse Regularization can help the model to improve accuracy while Pruning enhances efficiency by reducing the number of parameters by half without significantly lowering performance.

TI  - Perinatal antecedents of moderate and severe neonatal hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy: An Australian birth cohort study
T2  - AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNeonatal hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the most common cause of encephalopathy in the neonatal period and carries a high risk of mortality and long-term morbidity. AimThe aim of this study was to investigate key antecedents of moderate and severe HIE in a large contemporary birth cohort. MethodsA retrospective cohort study of births meeting criteria was conducted between 2016 and 2020 at the Mater Mothers' Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. This is a quaternary perinatal centre and Australia's largest maternity hospital. Univariate and multivariate Firth logistic regression were used to account for imbalanced frequency classes between non-HIE and HIE groups. Maternal variables and intrapartum factors were investigated for associations with neonatal moderate and severe HIE. ResultsOverall, 133 of 46 041 (0.29%) infants were diagnosed with HIE: 77 (0.17%) with mild HIE and 56 (0.12%) with moderate/severe HIE. Nulliparity, type 1 diabetes mellitus and maternal intensive care unit admission were associated with increased odds of moderate/severe HIE. Intrapartum risk factors included emergency caesarean birth, emergency caesarean for non-reassuring fetal status or failure to process, intrapartum haemorrhage and an intrapartum sentinel event (shoulder dystocia, cord prolapse, uterine rupture and placental abruption). Neonatal risk factors included male sex, late preterm gestation (35(+0)-36(+6) weeks), Apgar score less than four at 5 min, severe respiratory distress requiring ventilatory support and severe acidosis at birth. ConclusionsThis cohort study identified a series of potentially modifiable maternal and obstetric risk factors for HIE. Risk factors for HIE do not appear to have changed significantly with evolution in modern obstetric care.

TI  - Construction of a spatially gridded heat flux map based on airborne flux Measurements using remote sensing and machine learning methods
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Acquiring the relative truth values of land surface sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes at the regional scale is important for monitoring and simulating evapotranspiration at a global scale using satellite data or process-based models. However, it is difficult to directly obtain these values with fine spatial representation at regional scales using conventional ground-based measurement methods. Therefore, airborne measurements of turbulent flux are highly advantageous. By leveraging airborne measurements of H and LE fluxes collected in the Netherlands in August 2008, in this study we evaluated five machine learning methods for the construction of a regional gridded heat flux map, including artificial neural networks, boosted regression trees, random forest regression, deep neural networks, and support vector regression. The models were trained and tested using a dataset compiled from observations of H and LE, the digital elevation model, MODIS land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index, and albedo data for each flux footprint. The best performing model was used to construct a regional gridded heat flux map over a case region located in the center of the Netherlands. The results shown that the support vector regression performed better than other models, with R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 9.6W/m(2) for H, and R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 26.32W/m(2) for LE. The constructed heat flux maps achieved a relative prediction error of = 32.8% (R-2 > 0.71) for H and = 43.5% (R-2 > 0.53) for LE compared to aircraft measurements. The constructed heat flux maps were then aggregated for each land cover type, providing individual estimates of source strength (52< H< 66 W/m(2) and 108< LE< 218 W/m(2)) and spatial variability (52< sigma(H)< 66 W/m(2) and 108< sigma(LE)< 218 W/m(2)) with an ensemble precision of < 6% (1 sigma). Finally, the limitations and future prospects of the current study were summarized and discussed.

TI  - Monitoring and predicting the influences of land use/land cover change on cropland characteristics and drought severity using remote sensing techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Federal University of Technology at Akure (FUTA) in Nigeria is experiencing ongoing development that is leading to the replacement of agricultural and forestry land cover types. This study aimed to assess and predict changes in land use/land cover (LULC) types and their impact on crop characteristics in 17 plots of FUTA from 1991 to 2031. Crop characteristics were evaluated using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), vegetation condition index (VCI), watershed delineation, and spectral characteristics using Landsat imageries. The land change modeler in TerraSet software was used to predict future LULC scenarios. Results showed an increase in built-up areas (15%) and bare land areas (14%), but a reduction of 19% in light vegetation cover from 1991 to 2021. The predicted LULC map illustrated a decrease in light vegetation area (11%) and an increase in built-up area (19%) from 1991 to 2031. NDVI values denoting vegetation health and coverage extent, and NDWI & NDMI values indicating water stress in vegetation and soil showed that palm tree (Plot 1) had the highest average indices values (0.31, 0.34, and 0.06, respectively), while mixed cropping of cassava, cashew, and potatoes (Plot 6) had the lowest average indices values (0.23, 0.28, and-0.029 respectively). This indicates that Plot 1 (palm tree) had better vegetation health with higher green canopy coverage and lower water stress in vegetation and soil compared to Plot 6 (cassava, cashew, and mixed potato vegetation). Drought analysis (VCI) showed that light drought areas became severe drought areas during 2001-2021 in Plots 4 and 6. The reduction of green cover and growing built-up areas accelerated the increase in drought severity. This study advocates for sustainable land use management to manage water stress and drought at the field level.

TI  - Rising water-use efficiency in European grasslands is driven by increased primary production
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - European grasslands increase their water-use efficiency in summer through increased gross primary production and regulated transpiration, according to an analysis of three indices derived from remote sensing over the period 1995-2018Water-use efficiency is the amount of carbon assimilated per water used by an ecosystem and a key indicator of ecosystem functioning, but its variability in response to climate change and droughts is not thoroughly understood. Here, we investigated trends, drought response and drivers of three water-use efficiency indices from 1995-2018 in Europe with remote sensing data that considered long-term environmental effects. We show that inherent water-use efficiency decreased by -4.2% in Central Europe, exhibiting threatened ecosystem functioning. In European grasslands it increased by +24.2%, by regulated transpiration and increased carbon assimilation. Further, we highlight modulation of water-use efficiency drought response by hydro-climate and the importance of adaptive canopy conductance on ecosystem function. Our results imply that decoupling carbon assimilation from canopy conductance and efficient water management strategies could make the difference between threatened and well-coping ecosystems with ongoing climate change, and provide important insights for land surface model development.

TI  - Impacts of climate change on the wetlands in the arid region of Northwestern China over the past 2 decades
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has caused inland wetlands shrinkage and exacerbated problems, such as sustainable development and ecological security, for years. These issues are mainly pronounced in the inland arid area. The ecological environment's deterioration is especially severe in the drylands of the interior. However, dryland wetland changes and their response to climate are poorly understood. This study uses the K-means algorithm in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to classify two typical dryland wetlands (Ebinur and Bosten Lakes) for rapidly and accurately detecting dryland wetland changes. Moreover, it explores the long-term spatial-temporal variation in wetland distribution. In addition, it investigates the response of various lakes to climate change in northern and southern Xinjiang using wavelet analysis. The study's results showed that K-means clustering in the GEE platform has a high classification accuracy (Kappa > 0.8) in wetland classification, making it a feasible approach. The terminal lake wetland types, represented by the Ebinur Lake, changed significantly between 2001 and 2021. In contrast, the inflow-outflow lake wetland types, represented by the Bosten Lake, perform more consistently. Significant spatial-temporal variation is observed at Ebinur Lake, with the lake gradually shrinking and trans-forming into a marsh, where the largest marsh proportion degrades into non-wetland during the year. Bosten Lake experienced frequent conversions between marsh and non-wetland throughout the year. Furthermore, the responses of various dryland lakes to climate change are consistent, and a low precedes precipitation and follows evapotranspiration. However, their sensitivity to climate response varies, with the terminal lake being most affected by climate change. Mastering the dynamic changes and climate response of dryland wetlands achieves the sustainable development goals of drylands, including carbon neutrality and peak carbon dioxide emissions.

TI  - Trends and patterns of care of sentinel node biopsy in cutaneous melanoma: a population-based study in Queensland
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel node biopsy (SNB) has evolved from offering staging and prognostication to a procedure that guides therapeutic management. The aim was to evaluate the rate of SNB for patients with high-risk melanoma and assess factors that may have impacted on the procedure being performed. MethodsData of patients with primary invasive cutaneous melanoma from 01 January 2009 to 31 December 2019 were obtained from the Queensland Oncology Repository. High-risk melanoma was defined as >= 0.8 mm thick or < 0.8 mm with ulceration present (AJCC eighth edition pT1(b)-pT(4)). Results14 006 (33.8%) of 41 412 patients diagnosed with cutaneous invasive melanoma were in the high-risk group. 2923(20.9%) patients had SNB, with the rate increasing from 14.2% (2009) to 36.8% (2019) (P = 0.002), and an increasing proportion being performed in public hospitals over the 11 year period (P = 0.02). Older age (OR0.96 (0.959-0.964) (P < 0.001)), female (OR0.91 (0.830-0.998) (P = 0.03)), head and neck primary (OR0.38 (0.33-0.45) (P < 0.001)), and pT(1b) (OR0.22 (0.19-0.25) (P < 0.001)) were factors associated with SNB not being performed. Travel out of the Hospital and Health Services of residence for SNB occurred in 26.2%. Although the travel rate decreased from 24.7% (2009) to 23.0% (2019) (P = 0.04), the absolute number increased due to the increase in SNB rate. Those most likely to travel were younger, from remote areas, or from affluent backgrounds. ConclusionIn this first Australian population-based study, there was an increased adherence to SNB guideline, although overall SLNB rates remain low, with nearly 2/3 of eligible cases not having the procedure in 2019. Although travel rates decreased marginally, the overall number increased. This study highlights the crucial need to further improve access to SNB for melanoma surgery for the Queensland population.

TI  - Automatic detection and classification of land subsidence in deltaic metropolitan areas using distributed scatterer InSAR and Oriented R-CNN
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an effective tool for measuring large-scale land subsidence. However, the measurement points generated by InSAR are too many to be manually analyzed, and automatic subsidence detection and classification methods are still lacking. In this study, we developed an oriented R-CNN deep learning network to automatically detect and classify subsidence bowls using InSAR measurements and multi-source ancillary data. We used 541 Sentinel-1 images acquired during 2015-2021 to map land subsidence of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area by resolving persistent and distributed scatterers. Multi-source data related to land subsidence, including geological and lithological, land cover, topographic, and climatic data, were incorporated into deep learning, allowing the local subsidence to be classified into seven categories. The results showed that the oriented R-CNN achieved an average precision (AP) of 0.847 for subsidence detection and a mean AP (mAP) of 0.798 for subsidence classi-fication, which outperformed the other three state-of-the-art methods (Rotated RetinaNet, R3Det, and ReDet). An independent effect analysis showed that incorporating all datasets improved the AP by 11.2% for detection and the mAP by 73.9% for classification, respectively, compared with using InSAR measurements only. Combining InSAR measurements with globally available land cover and digital elevation model data improved the AP for subsidence detection to 0.822, suggesting that our methods can be potentially transferred to other regions, which was further validated this using a new dataset in Shanghai. These results improve the understanding of deltaic subsidence and facilitate geohazard assessment and management for sustainable environments.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols are the main components of air pollutants, which are closely related to haze, dust storm and air pollution. In this study, an aerosol data assimilation system was developed using Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system to assimilate the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observations from FY4 and Himawari-8 for the first time and applied in the heavy dust case over east Asia in March 2018. Three parallel experiments assimilated AOD from FY4, Himawari-8 and both the FY4 and Himawari-8 respectively and a control experiment which did not employ DA were performed. The hourly aerosol analyses and forecasts are compared with the assimilated FY-4 AOD, Himawari-8 AOD and independent AOD from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). The results showed that all forms of DA experiments improved a low Bias and the RMSE reduced about 20%. The aerosol data assimilation with observations from both the FY-4 and Himawari-8 satellites substantially improved aerosol analyses and subsequent forecasts with more abundant aerosol observation information, especially over the northwest of China. This study indicates that the new generation geostationary meteorological satellites have potential to dramatically contribute to air quality forecasting.

AB  - Longwave radiation components, including downward, upward, and net longwave radiation (DLR, ULR, and NLR, respectively), are essential parameters in heat flux exchange across the ocean-atmosphere interface. However, few long-term, high-resolution, and accurate sea-surface longwave radiation (SSLR) products are available. We generated the first high-resolution (5-km) all-sky daily SSLR product from Advanced Very HighResolution Radiometer (AVHRR) top-of-atmosphere observations, combined with the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis V5 near-surface meteorological variables and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sea-surface temperatures from 1981 to 2018. We coupled the densely connected convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory neural network as a retrieval algorithm. The training dataset was generated using integrated SSLR samples from 2002 to 2012 at 437 globally distributed locations. The archived product, SSLR_AVHRR, showed a high accuracy against 81,546 buoy-based observations from eight observation networks, with an R2 of 0.96 (1.00, 0.77), root mean square error of 10.27 (4.51, 9.27) Wm-2, and mean bias error of -1.30 (0.30, -0.72) Wm-2 for DLR (ULR, NLR) retrievals. Based on SSLR_AVHRR, the global DLR (ULR) flux exhibited a significantly (p-value < 0.05) increasing trend of 1.03 (1.08) Wm-2/decade during 1982-2018. The trend was 0.24 (0.34) Wm-2/decade during 1982-2000, which increased to 1.79 (1.45) Wm-2/decade during 2001-2018. This globally increasing trend was dominantly impacted by the significant increases in high latitude, particularly in the Arctic Ocean. Trend variations at low latitudes, which were more frequent than at middle and high latitudes because of the El Nin similar to o-Southern Oscillation, mitigated the increasing rates of global DLR and ULR after strong El Nin similar to o years, whereas the global NLR flux remained relatively stable throughout the study period. This method can be extended and applied to estimate other air-sea fluxes based on a unified estimating framework to help mitigate imbalanced energy and freshwater budgets at the air-sea interface to some degree.

TI  - Exploiting hyperspectral and multispectral images in the detection of tree species: A review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Classification of tree species provides important data in forest monitoring, sustainable forest management and planning. The recent developments in Multi Spectral (MS) and Hyper Spectral (HS) Imaging sensors in remote sensing have made the detection of tree species easier and accurate. With this systematic review study, it is aimed to understand the contribution of using the Multi Spectral and Hyper Spectral Imaging data in the detection of tree species while highlighting recent advances in the field and emphasizing important directions together with new possibilities for future inquiries. In this review, researchers and decision makers will be informed in two different subjects: First one is about the processing steps of exploiting Multi Spectral and HS images and the second one is about determining the advantages of exploiting Multi Spectral and Hyper Spectral images in the application area of detecting tree species. In this way exploiting satellite data will be facilitated. This will also provide an economical gain for using commercial Multi Spectral and Hyper Spectral Imaging data. Moreover, it should be also kept in mind that, as the number of spectral tags that will be obtained from each tree type are different, both the processing method and the classification method will change accordingly. This review, studies were grouped according to the data exploited (only Hyper Spectral images, only Multi Spectral images and their combinations), type of tree monitored and the processing method used. Then, the contribution of the image data used in the study was evaluated according to the accuracy of classification, the suitable type of tree and the classification method.

TI  - Deciphering tropical tree communities using earth observation data and machine learning
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Publicly available EO datasets offer new possibilities to generate biodiversity information at the community composition level, an essential biodiversity variable, beyond forest type. We demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-2, GEDI LiDAR canopy height and ALOS-DEM in discriminating and classifying tropical tree communities in the Western Himalayas, India. For this, tree communities were first identified based on the ordi-nation of field data and subsequently classified using satellite data applying machine learning, i.e. random forest (RF). From the three forest types in the study area, eight distinct tree communities were identified for which classification accuracy increased from single date (75.17%) to multi-date images (85.33%) and further by applying feature selection (88.17%). Whereas the best classification accuracy of 94.66% was achieved when canopy height and topographic variables were also considered. The findings suggest that RF is suitable for mapping tree communities by combining Sentinel-2 with GEDI and DEM parameters.

TI  - Optical remotely sensed data for mapping variations in cashew plantation distribution and associated land uses in Ogbomoso, Nigeria Southwest
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The study examined spatial variation in the extent of land used for cashew plantation cultivation and associated land uses as notable agroecosystem in the guinea savanna region of Ogbomoso, Southwestern Nigeria. Data used for the study include point data recorded with GPS through purposive sampling and satellite imageries of 1987, 1997, 2002 and 2018 were acquired from Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM + and Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS. The satellite imageries were processed and classified using supervised classification. The imageries were classified into five themes of water, plantation, savanna and farmland, built-up area and bare land. Results revealed that cashew plantation occupied 12.4% of the total area in 1987, 16.2% in 1997, 23.1% in 2002 and 20.7% in 2018. This reflects 8.3% increase in the area of land covered by cashew plantation between 1987 and 2018 being notable agricultural tree/cash crop in the vegetation zone. Cashew plantations showed strong correlation with advances in years with correlation coefficient value r = 0.74. Image classification accuracy assessment conducted returned overall accuracy level ranges from 87.6% in 2002 to 93.2% in 1987. The study concludes that there is gradual increased in the area of land use for cashew cultivation but this is however recently threatened by rapid urbanization process.

TI  - A remote sensing tool for near real-time monitoring of harmful algal blooms and turbidity in reservoirs
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) diminish the utility of reservoirs for drinking water supply, irrigation, recreation, and ecosystem service provision. HABs decrease water quality and are a significant health concern in surface water bodies. Near real-time monitoring of HABs in reservoirs and small water bodies is essential to understand the dynamics of turbidity and HAB formation. This study uses satellite imagery to remotely sense chlorophyll-a concentrations (chl-a), phycocyanin concentrations, and turbidity in two reservoirs, the Grand Lake O' the Cherokees and Hudson Reservoir, OK, USA, to develop a tool for near real-time monitoring of HABs. Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery from 2013 to 2017 and from 2015 to 2020 were used to train and test three different models that include multiple regression, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). Performance was assessed by comparing the three models to estimate chl-a, phycocyanin, and turbidity. The results showed that RFR achieved the best performance, with R-2 values of 0.75, 0.82, and 0.79 for chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin, while multiple regression had R-2 values of 0.29, 0.51, and 0.46 and SVR had R-2 values of 0.58, 0.62, and 0.61 on the testing datasets, respectively. This paper examines the potential of the developed open-source satellite remote sensing tool for monitoring reservoirs in Oklahoma to assess spatial and temporal variations in surface water quality.

TI  - Biophysical drivers for predicting the distribution and abundance of invasive yellow sweetclover in the Northern Great Plains
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextYellow sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis; YSC) is an invasive biennial legume that bloomed across the Northern Great Plains in 2018-2019 in response to above-average precipitation. YSC can increase nitrogen (N) levels and potentially cause substantial changes in the composition of native plant species communities. There is little knowledge of the spatiotemporal variability and conditions causing substantial widespread blooms of YSC across western South Dakota (SD).ObjectivesWe aimed to develop a generalized prediction model to predict the relative abundance of YSC in suitable habitats across rangelands of western South Dakota for 2019. Our research questions are: (1) What is the spatial extent of YSC across western South Dakota? (2) Which model can accurately predict the habitat and percent cover of YSC? and (3) What significant biophysical drivers affect its presence across western South Dakota?MethodsWe trained machine learning models with in situ data (2016-2021), Sentinel 2A-derived surface reflectance and indices (10 m, 20 m) and site-specific variables of climate, topography, and edaphic factors to optimize model performance.ResultsWe identified moisture proxies (Shortwave Infrared reflectance and variability in Tasseled Cap Wetness) as the important predictors to explain the YSC presence. Land Surface Water Index and variability in summer temperature were the top predictors in explaining the YSC abundance. We demonstrated how machine learning algorithms could help generate valuable information on the spatial distribution of this invasive plant. We delineated major YSC hotspots in Butte, Pennington, and Corson Counties of South Dakota. The floodplains of major rivers, including White and Bad Rivers, and areas around Badlands National Park also showed a higher occurrence probability and cover percentage.ConclusionsThese prediction maps could aid land managers in devising management strategies for the regions that are prone to YSC outbreaks. The management workflow can also serve as a prototype for mapping other invasive plant species in similar regions.

TI  - The lymphatic system of the uterine cervix: towards a more precise definition of the drainage routes
T2  - SURGICAL AND RADIOLOGIC ANATOMY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeLymph node involvement in cancer of the uterine cervix is a major independent prognostic factor for overall survival. The aim of our study was to examine the lymphatic drainage regions of the different parts of the uterine cervix.MethodsAn anatomical study of fresh cadavers was conducted by injecting patent blue in the anterior or posterior lip of the uterine cervix and dissecting drainage regions. Furthermore, a retrospective radiological and pathological studies were conducted on patients who were treated for early-stage cancer of the uterine cervix with lymph node involvement. Radiological analysis of pre-therapeutic MRIs and/or pathological analysis of surgical specimens showed the precise location of the tumour. A correlation between the anatomy of the primary lesion site and the lymphatic area involved was established.ResultsWe administered 15 cadaveric injections: 8 in the anterior lip of the uterine cervix and 7 in the posterior one. For 100% of the anterior lip injections, lymphatic drainage was bilateral ileo-obturator (n = 8/8) combined with bilateral parametrial drainage. For the posterior injections, there was never any ileo-obturator drainage, and 6 of the 7 (75%) posterior injections drained in the posterior uterine serosa. Concerning the clinical study, we included 21 patients. We observed a non-significant tendency towards bilateral lymph node involvement when the tumour of the anterior lip.ConclusionPhysiological lymphatic drainage of the uterine cervix presents anatomical specificities, depending on the structure studied, anterior or posterior lip of the cervix. Better knowledge of these specificities should allow personalized surgery for each patient.

T2  - Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The construction of efficient and stable Lactobacillus expression vector is critical for strain improvement and development of customized strains. In this study, four endogenous plasmids were isolated from Lacticaseibacillus paracasei ZY-1 and subjected to functional analysis. The Escherichia coli-Lactobacillus shuttle vectors pLPZ3N and pLPZ4N were constructed by combining the replicon rep from pLPZ3 or pLPZ4, the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene cat from pNZ5319 and the replicon ori from pUC19. Moreover, the expression vectors pLPZ3E and pLPZ4E with the promoter Pldh3 of lactic acid dehydrogenase and the mCherry red fluorescent protein as a reporter gene were obtained. The size of pLPZ3 and pLPZ4 were 6 289 bp and 5 087 bp, respectively, and its GC content, 40.94% and 39.51%, were similar. Both shuttle vectors were successfully transformed into Lacticaseibacillus, and the transformation efficiency of pLPZ4N (5.23*102-8.93*102 CFU/mug) was slightly higher than that of pLPZ3N. Furthermore, the mCherry fluorescent protein was successfully expressed after transforming the expression plasmids pLPZ3E and pLPZ4E into L. paracasei S-NB. The beta-galactosidase activity of the recombinant strain obtained from the plasmid pLPZ4E-lacG constructed with Pldh3 as promoter was higher than that of the wild-type strain. The construction of shuttle vectors and expression vectors provide novel molecular tools for the genetic engineering of Lacticaseibacillus strains.

T2  - NEW PERSPECTIVES ON TURKEY
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decade, environmental issues have gained saliency in Turkish politics, especially after the 2013 Gezi Park demonstrations. This article is on the relationship between politics and deforestation in Turkey. It combines possible major drivers-political, economic, and climatic-of deforestation in Turkey with high-resolution satellite data on deforestation to conduct a systemic empirical analysis. The results show that districts in which Justice and Development Party mayors are in power have higher deforestation. The effect is around an average combined area of forty-two football fields in a given district. The article also shows that increased mining activities and newly built hydropower plants positively correlate with deforestation.

TI  - Dynamics of land use and land cover change in peri urban area of Burdwan city, India: a remote sensing and GIS based approach
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Peri-urban area around a city is a dynamic zone that undergoes considerable changes over time in terms of its functional land use. Analogous to other Indian cities, these changes are also evident in the peri-urban villages of Burdwan city, which has seen intense land use changes between 1987 and 2017. These changes are gauged by using LANDSAT-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) for 1987; LANDSAT-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) for 2002 and LANDSAT 8 (OLI) for 2017. This study makes a unique contribution by combining the use of remote sensing and intensity analysis to evaluate changes in land use and land cover. The results showed that both the 1987-2002 and 2002-2017 time periods experience rapid change and the land use transformation has been accelerated over the whole period. The profound changes in the vegetation and water bodies are amplified by rampant reclamation for built up and commercial purposes. Results show that the proportion of vegetation and waterbodies decreased by 72.3% and 56.3%, respectively, whereas built-up area has increased by 182.8%. The research also revealed a built up pattern mostly towards the north-west, north, North-East and south-east direction. The current study attempts to analyse the variables causing land transformation and the many actors and their roles in driving these alterations. Finally, the extensive explanation and spatio-temporal differentiation maps and tables created with geospatial data will undoubtedly aid in understanding the peri-urban growth dynamics process and changing form of land-use land cover and aid the decision-making process of local planners, stakeholders, and academicians.

TI  - Preliminary examination of influence of Chlorophyll, Total Suspended Material, and Turbidity on Satellite Derived-Bathymetry estimation in coastal turbid water
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has been researched for almost the past five decades, but the application of SDB for operational use is still in its initial stages. The higher concentration of suspended material is a major barrier in assessing bathymetry accurately with remote sensing data. The influence of various optically active substances (OAS) needs to be quantified to develop a more robust SDB algorithm. The goal of the study is to improve the accuracy of SDB by understanding the spatial distribution of Chlorophyll (Chl), Total Suspended Material (TSM), and Turbidity in coastal water. A preliminary investigation using the numerical analysis between Landsat-7 & 8 spectral bands, OAS parameters, and bathymetry is presented in this paper. SDB has been derived using three machine learning algorithms; Linear, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression. The resulting SDB residuals have been analyzed in relation to Chlorophyll, Turbidity, and TSM in coastal seawater. The study found that most of the erroneous SDB residuals and extreme values were distributed in high or medium concentrated OAS regions. The result of the study may further enhance SDB estimation accuracy by considering the influence of the above three OAS in coastal waters. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Clinical utility of axillary nodal markers in breast cancer
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: De-escalation of axillary surgery for lymph node (LN) positive breast cancer is facilitated by marking involved nodes which, when removed with sentinel nodes constitute risk-adapted targeted axillary dissection (TAD). Whether after chemotherapy or for primary surgery, selected patients with biopsy-proven involvement of nodes may be eligible for axillary conservation. Likewise, impalpable recurrence or stage 4 patients with localised axillary disease may benefit. In these contexts, several devices are used to mark biopsied nodes to facilitate their accurate surgical removal. We report our experience using the paramagnetic MAGSEED (Endomag (R), Cambridge, UK).Methods: Local approval (BR2021_149) was obtained to interrogate a prospective database of all axillary markers. The primary endpoint was successful removal of the marked LN.Results: Of 241 markers (in 221 patients) inserted between October 2018 and July 2022, all were retrieved. Of 74 patients who had Magseeds (R) inserted after completion of NACT (involved nodes initially marked using an UltraCorTMTwirlTM marker), the Magseeds (R) were found outside the node in neighbouring axillary tissue in 18 (24.3%) patients. When Magseeds (R) were placed at commencement of NACT in 54 patients, in only 1 (1.8%) was the marker found outside the node -a statistically significantly lower rate (Chi2 10.7581 p 1/4 0.001038). For 'primary TAD' patients and those localised for recurrent or stage IV disease, all 93 had the Magseed (R) found within the biopsied node. Conclusion: This series supports our axillary nodal marking technique as safe and reliable. For TAD following NACT, placement at the start of treatment led to a significantly higher localisation rate. Crown Copyright (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Environmental drivers of spatio-temporal dynamics in floodplainvegetation: grasslands as habitat for megafauna in Bardia National Park(Nepal)
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbance-dependent grasslands, often associated with hydromorphological and fire dynamics, are threatened, especially in subtropical climates. In the Nepalese and Indian Terai Arc Landscape at the foot of the Himalayas, natural and cultural grasslands serve a viable role for greater one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) and for grazers that form prey of the Royal Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris). The grasslands are vulnerable to encroachment of forest. We aimed to establish the effects of environmental drivers, in particular river discharge, river channel dynamics, precipitation and forest fires, on the spatio-temporal dynamics of these grasslands. The study area is the floodplain of the eastern branch of the Karnali River and adjacent western part of Bardia National Park. We created annual time series (1993-2019) of land cover with the use of field data, remotely sensed LANDSAT imagery and a supervised classification model. Additionally, we analysed the pattern of grassland patches and aerial photographs of 1964. Between 1964 and 2019, grassland patches decreased in abundance and size due to encroachment of forest. Outside the floodplain, conversion of grassland to bare substrate coincides with extreme precipitation events. Within the floodplain, conversion of grassland to bare substrate correlates with the magnitude of the annual peak discharge of the bifurcated Karnali River. Since 2009, however, this correlation is absent due to a shift of the main discharge channel to the western branch of the Karnali River. Consequently, alluvial tall grasslands (Saccharum spontaneum dominant) have vastly expanded between 2009 and 2019. Because the hydromorphological processes in the floodplain have become more static, other sources of disturbances - local flooding of ephemeral streams, anthropogenic maintenance, grazing and fires - are more paramount to prevent encroachment of grasslands. Altogether, our findings underscore that a change in the environmental drivers impact the surface area and heterogeneity of grassland patches in the landscape, which can lead to cascading effects for the grassland-dependent megafauna.

TI  - Monitoring erosion in tropical savannas from C-band radar coherence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased erosion related to climate and/or land cover change has adverse impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Mapping of erosion hotspots improves our ability to identify and potentially remediate the most active erosion sources. The topical savannas of the Great Barrier Reef catchments, in northeast Australia, are generating excessive sediment yields, primarily from gully erosion. To reduce the adverse impacts on marine ecosystems, there is an urgent need to identify priority erosion hotspots and implement mitigation measures. While repeat airborne LiDAR surveys allow subtle topographic change detection, they are cost-intensive for catchment-scale applications and their applicability is constrained by data avalability and detection treshold of ground level change. In contrast, satellite-based radar imagery can allow large scale tracking of geomorphic change at high temporal resolution. Here we apply a new method based on Sentinel-1 C-band radar images and Coherence Change Detection (CCD), where large stacks of interferometric coherence images are subdivided with rain gauge time-series for separation of erosion-rich and erosion-free coherence information. After correcting the former with the latter, the resulting corrected coherence maps are compared with differential elevation models derived from multitemporal LiDAR, regional scale gully delineation maps, maps of gullying potential and in-situ field verification. Our results demonstrate the promising potential of this technique in detecting gully erosion hotspots. The coherence loss indicating erosion/deposition is well detected in wide gully morphologies, however, the line-of-sight angle does not allow penetration into narrow linear gullies. Further, CCD detects sheetwash or rill erosion occurring in areas identified as at risk of gully expansion, which is commonly below detection threshold for multitemporal LiDAR datasets. When used with LiDAR-derived geomorphic change mapping and gullying potential maps, CCD allows identification of gully erosion dynamics and forecasting gully evolution and creation, which is critical for supporting mitigation measures.

TI  - Estimating lichen α- and β-diversity using satellite data at different spatial resolutions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding biodiversity patterns and its environmental drivers is crucial to meet conservation targets and develop effective monitoring tools. Inconspicuous species such as lichens require special attention since they are ecologically important but sensitive species that are often overlooked in conservation planning. Remote sensing (RS) can be particularly beneficial for these species as in combination with modelling techniques it allows planners to assess and better understand biodiversity patterns. This study aims to model the lichen alpha-diversity (species richness) and beta-diversity (species turnover) biodiversity components using high resolution RS variables across a subarctic region in Northern Quebec (similar to 190.25 km(2)). Two sensors, one commercial (WorldView-3, WV3) and another freely accessible (Sentinel-2, S2), at different resolutions (1.2 m and 10 m, respectively) were tested separately to develop our variables and feed the models. Lichens were sampled in 45 plots across different habitat types, ranging from forested habitats (coniferous, deciduous) to wetlands (bogs, fens) and rocky outcrops. Two sets of uncorrelated variables (Red and NIR; EVI2) from each sensor were parallelly used to build the alpha- and beta-diversity models (8 models in total) through Poisson regressions and generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM), respectively. Red and NIR variables were useful for modeling the two biodiversity components at both resolutions, providing information on stand canopy closure and structure, respectively. EVI2, especially from WV3, was only informative for assessing beta-diversity, providing similar information than Red. Poisson models explained up to 32 % of the variation in lichen alpha-diversity, with Red, NIR and EVI2, either from WV3 or S2, showing negative relationships with lichen richness. GDMs described well the relationship between beta-diversity and spectral dissimilarity (R-2 from 0.25 to 0.30), except for the S2 EVI2 model (R-2 = 0.07), confirming that more spectrally and thus environmentally different areas tend to harbor different lichen communities. While WV3 often outperformed the S2 sensor, the latter still provides a powerful tool for the study of lichens and their conservation. This study contributes to improve our knowledge and to inform on the use of RS to understand biodiversity patterns of inconspicuous species, which we consider to be an essential step to enhance their rep-resentation in conservation planning.

TI  - Development and validation of an ultrasonography and clinicopathological features-based nomogram for non-sentinel lymph node metastasis
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: With the development of precise treatment for breast cancer, the current trend of clinical treatment aims to limit axillary surgery as much as possible. At present, there is an unmet need to predict the probability of patients with a low risk of non-sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis and determine whether the omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is appropriate. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with breast cancer who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and ALND. The patients were randomly assigned to training and validation sets. The associations between non-SLN metastasis (NSLNM) and ultrasonography and clinicopathological characteristics were assessed by multivariate logistic regression. Then, a nomogram model was constructed and validated using the calibration curve and the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: Vascular infiltration, positive SLN number, negative SLN number, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and lymph node shape were identified as independent predictive factors for positive NSLNM. The areas under the curve of the nomogram model to predict NSLNM were 0.793 and 0.780 in the training and validation sets, respectively, and P=0.161 and P=0.768 in the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test, respectively. Conclusions: A nomogram model based on ultrasonography and clinicopathological features predicting NSLNM was established in our study, which is helpful for accurately assessing the risk of NSLNM in invasive breast cancer and providing evidence for individual surgical procedures involving axillary lymph nodes.

TI  - Providing a framework for seagrass mapping in United States coastal ecosystems using high spatial resolution satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrasses have been widely recognized for their ecosystem services, but traditional seagrass monitoring ap-proaches emphasizing ground and aerial observations are costly, time-consuming, and lack standardization across datasets. This study leveraged satellite imagery from Maxar's WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 high spatial resolution, commercial satellite platforms to provide a consistent classification approach for monitoring seagrass at eleven study areas across the continental United States, representing geographically, ecologically, and climatically diverse regions. A single satellite image was selected at each of the eleven study areas to correspond temporally to reference data representing seagrass coverage and was classified into four general classes: land, seagrass, no seagrass, and no data. Satellite-derived seagrass coverage was then compared to reference data using either balanced agreement, the Mann-Whitney U test, or the Kruskal-Wallis test, depending on the format of the reference data used for comparison. Balanced agreement ranged from 58% to 86%, with better agreement be-tween reference-and satellite-indicated seagrass absence (specificity ranged from 88% to 100%) than between reference-and satellite-indicated seagrass presence (sensitivity ranged from 17% to 73%). Results of the Mann -Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests demonstrated that satellite-indicated seagrass percentage cover had mod-erate to large correlations with reference-indicated seagrass percentage cover, indicative of moderate to strong agreement between datasets. Satellite classification performed best in areas of dense, continuous seagrass compared to areas of sparse, discontinuous seagrass and provided a suitable spatial representation of seagrass distribution within each study area. This study demonstrates that the same methods can be applied across scenes spanning varying seagrass bioregions, atmospheric conditions, and optical water types, which is a significant step toward developing a consistent, operational approach for mapping seagrass coverage at the national and global scales. Accompanying this manuscript are instructional videos describing the processing workflow, including data acquisition, data processing, and satellite image classification. These instructional videos may serve as a management tool to complement field-and aerial-based mapping efforts for monitoring seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Multi- and hyperspectral classification of soft-bottom intertidal vegetation using a spectral library for coastal biodiversity remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring biodiversity and how anthropogenic pressures impact this is critical, especially as anthropogenically driven climate change continues to affect all ecosystems. Intertidal areas are exposed to particularly high levels of pressures owing to increased population density in coastal areas. Traditional methods of monitoring intertidal areas do not provide datasets with full coverage in a cost-effective or timely manner, and so the use of remote sensing to monitor these areas is becoming more common. Monitoring of ecologically important monospecific habitats, such as seagrass beds, using remote sensing techniques is well documented. However, the ability for multispectral data to distinguish efficiently and accurately between classes of vegetation with similar pigment composition, such as seagrass and green algae, has proved difficult, often requiring hyperspectral data. A ma-chine learning approach was used to differentiate between soft-bottom intertidal vegetation classes when exposed at low tide, comparing 6 different multi-and hyperspectral remote and in situ sensors. For the library of 366 spectra, collected across Northern Europe, high accuracy (>80%) was found across all spectral resolutions. While a higher spectral resolution resulted in higher accuracy, there was no discernible increase in accuracy above 10 spectral bands (95%: Sentinel-2 MSI sensor with a spatial resolution of 20 m). This work highlights the ability of multispectral sensors to discriminate intertidal vegetation types, while also showing the most important wavelengths for this discrimination (-530 and -730 nm), giving recommendations for spectral ranges of future satellite missions. The ability for multispectral sensors to aid in accurate and rapid intertidal vegetation classi-fication at the taxonomic resolution of classes, could be a significant contribution for future sustainable and effective ecosystem management.

TI  - A cohort analysis of surgically treated primary head and neck lentigo maligna (melanoma): Prognostic value of melanoma subtype and new insights in the clinical value of guideline adherence
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Knowledge about lentigo maligna (melanoma) (LM/LMM) and its associated prognostic clinicopathological characteristics are limited compared to that of non-LM/LMM subtypes. The current study aimed to determine the clinical relevance of the LM/LMM subtype and its influence on recurrence and survival outcomes.Methods: All consecutive cases of primary cutaneous head and neck LM/LMM treated by wide local excision over a ten-year period were retrospectively reviewed and compared to non-LM/LMM. Clinical outcome and prognostic factors were assessed by cumulative incidence and competing risk analyses.Results: A total of 345 patients were identified. Specific clinicopathological characteristics such as lower median Breslow thickness (1.6 mm versus 2.1 mm; P = 0.013), association with diagnostic sampling errors (17.3% versus 5.2%; P = 0.01), and increased risk of local recurrences due to incomplete resection (18.7% versus 2.3%; P < 0.001), were significantly associated with LM/LMM. Guideline adherence was similar between the two study groups. The positive nodal status at baseline for LMM was low compared to non-LM/LMM (4.2% vs 17.9%; P = 0.037). The LMM subtype, facial localization, and reduced surgical margins (i.e., guideline non-adherence) were not shown to be independent prognostic factors for disease-free, melanoma-specific, or overall survival after correction for competing risks such as patient age and Breslow thickness.Conclusions: The LMM subtype was not shown to be prognostically different from non-LM/LMM when corrected for other variables of influence such as patient age and Breslow thickness. Reduced resection margins did not seem to affect disease-free, and melanoma-specific survival and warrant LM/LMM-specific guidelines. Further research is needed to evaluate the value of SLNB in LMM patients.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A machine learning modeling framework for <i>Triticum turgidum</i> subsp. <i>durum</i> Desf. yield forecasting in Italy
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The forecasting of crop yield is one of the most critical research areas in crop science, which allows for the development of decision support systems, optimization of nitrogen fertilization, and food safety. Many tested modeling approaches can be differentiated according to the models and data used. The models used are traditional crop models that require data that are often difficult to measure. New modeling approaches based on artificial intelligence algorithms have proven to be of high performance, flexible, and can be tested based on available data. In this study, four independent field experiments conducted on Triticum turgidum subsp. durum Desf. in central-southern Italy were used to train a set of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the yield using 16 variables: fertilization, nitrogen management, pedoclimatic, and remote sensing data. Four ML algorithms were calibrated and validated over two independent sites, and a linear regression model was used as a control. The calibrated models can predict the grain yield in the two regions by using ancillary data, topsoil physical and chemical properties, multispectral drone imagery, climatic data, and nitrogen fertilizer applied at the site. Among the four ML algorithms, stochastic gradient boosting (root-mean-square error = 0.58 t ha(-1)) outperformed others during calibration and transferability. Nitrogen application rate, seasonal precipitation, and temperature are the most important features for predicting wheat yield.

TI  - Evaluation of the Long-term Performance of Microwave Radiation Imager Onboard Chinese Fengyun Satellites
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate brightness temperature (BT) is a top priority for retrievals of atmospheric and surface parameters. Microwave Radiation Imagers (MWRIs) on Chinese Fengyun-3 (FY-3) serial polar-orbiting satellites have been providing abundant BT data since 2008. Much work has been done to evaluate short-term MWRI observations, but the long-term performance of MWRIs remains unclear. In this study, operational MWRI BTs from 2012-19 were carefully examined by using simultaneous Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) BTs as the reference. The BT difference between MWRI/FY3B and AMSR2 during 2012-19 increased gradually over time. As compared with MWRI/FY3B BTs over land, those of MWRI/FY3D were much closer to those of AMSR2. The ascending and descending orbit difference for MWRI/FY3D is also much smaller than that for MWRI/FY3B. These results suggested the improvement of MWRI/FY3D over MWRI/FY3B. A substantial BT difference between AMSR2 and MWRI was found over water, especially at the vertical polarization channels. A similar BT difference was found over polar water based on the simultaneous conical overpassing (SCO) method. Radiative transfer model simulations suggested that the substantial BT differences at the vertical polarization channels of MWRI and AMSR2 over water were partly contributed by their difference in the incident angle; however, the underestimation of the operational MWRI BT over water remained a very important issue. Preliminary assessment of the operational and recalibrated MWRI BT demonstrated that MWRI BTs were substantially improved after the recalibration, including the obvious underestimation of the operational MWRI BT at the vertical polarization channels over water was corrected, and the time-dependent biases were reduced.

TI  - Two-Speed Deep-Learning Ensemble for Classification of Incremental Land-Cover Satellite Image Patches
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High-velocity data streams present a challenge to deep learning-based computer vision models due to the resources needed to retrain for new incremental data. This study presents a novel staggered training approach using an ensemble model comprising the following: (i) a resource-intensive high-accuracy vision transformer; and (ii) a fast training, but less accurate, low parameter-count convolutional neural network. The vision transformer provides a scalable and accurate base model. A convolutional neural network (CNN) quickly incorporates new data into the ensemble model. Incremental data are simulated by dividing the very large So2Sat LCZ42 satellite image dataset into four intervals. The CNN is trained every interval and the vision transformer trained every half interval. We call this combination of a complementary ensemble with staggered training a "two-speed" network. The novelty of this approach is in the use of a staggered training schedule that allows the ensemble model to efficiently incorporate new data by retraining the high-speed CNN in advance of the resource-intensive vision transformer, thereby allowing for stable continuous improvement of the ensemble. Additionally, the ensemble models for each data increment out-perform each of the component models, with best accuracy of 65% against a holdout test partition of the RGB version of the So2Sat dataset.

TI  - Using blood lead concentrations of wildlife sentinels to identify environmental risk factors of lead exposure for public health and wildlife rehabilitation efforts
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Lead poisoning remains a persistent health issue for both humans and wildlife, despite strides to reduce lead contamination in the environment. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), this study explores the associations between blood lead levels (BLLs) in wildlife sentinels and possible built environment lead exposure risk factors in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota urban area. Results show a high-level of heterogeneity in animal BLLs (n = 472) across our urban environment and suggest that each kilometer increase in road density is associated with a 17.07% (95% CI: 1.48%, 35.05%) increase in BLL in our study species of Virginia opossums and Eastern gray squirrels, and a 14.28% (95% CI: 1.16%, 29.09%) increase in BLL of rock pigeons. For squirrels and opossums, we see an additional 5.72% (95% CI: 0.59%, 10.85%) increased risk of BLL for every 1000 people per square-mile. The relationship between animal sentinels and environmental hazards can give us an insight into the potential lead exposure risks for humans. The use of wildlife sentinel data to explore environmental risk factors supports a One Health approach to better address public health questions and aid in wildlife rehabilitation related to residual lead poisoning from ambient environmental exposures.

TI  - Leggett-Garg violations for continuous-variable systems with Gaussian states
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW A
M3  - Article
AB  - Macrorealism (MR) is the worldview that certain quantities may take definite values at all times irrespective of past or future measurements and may be experimentally falsified via the Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities. We put this worldview to the test for systems described by a continuous variable x by seeking LG violations for measurements of a dichotomic variable Q = sign(x), in the case of Gaussian initial states in a quantum harmonic oscillator. Extending our earlier analysis [C. Mawby and J. J. Halliwell, Phys. Rev. A 105, 022221 (2022)], we find analytic expressions for the temporal correlators. An exploration of parameter space reveals significant regimes in which the two-time LG inequalities are violated, and likewise at three and four times. To obtain a physical picture of the LG violations, we exploit the continuous nature of the underlying position variable and analyze the relevant quantum-mechanical currents, Bohm trajectories, and Wigner function. We also show that larger violations are possible using the Wigner LG inequalities. Further, we extend the analysis to LG tests using coherent state projectors, thermal coherent states, and squeezed states.

TI  - Impact assessment of severe cyclonic storm Asani on the nesting grounds of Olive Ridley turtle, Rushikulya Estuary and spit in Odisha state, India
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to understand the impact of cyclone Asani on the coastal dynamics and nesting grounds of Olive Ridley sea turtles in the Rushikulya Estuary and spit in Odisha. The novelty of this study is the need to understand the effects of natural disasters on the marine environment and wildlife. This study provides new and valuable data on the effects of specific cyclones on sea turtle populations and highlights the need for increased attention and protection of these important habitats. The period of shoreline change analyzed in this study was before (May 2, 2022) and after (May 17, 2022) the impact of cyclone Asani. Multi-temporal Sentinel 2A images and Digital Shoreline Analysis System were used to perform such an analysis. Field surveys were conducted using a Leica DGPS ArcPad, and group discussions with relevant stakeholders such as the fishing community, government officials, and coastal conservation guards were also undertaken. The findings of this study showed that the cyclone had a significant impact on the spit, dividing it into four smaller pieces and opening three new mouths. The spit experienced erosion and a significant reduction in length, and local fishing community reported that 15-20% of sea turtle eggs were washed away. This study highlights the severe threat to the survival of Olive Ridley sea turtles in Odisha due to changing cyclone patterns and the potential for degradation of the local ecosystem. The results of this study can aid in coastal conservation and management strategies to protect marine turtle populations in the region.

TI  - Spatial prediction of the urban inter-annual land surface temperature variability: An integrated modeling approach in a rapidly urbanizing semi-arid region
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The inter-annual land surface temperature (LST) is a meteorological indicator of urban environments, affecting energy consumption and quality of life. In this study, the annual LST variability (ALSTV) of a rapidly urbanizing region in Iran including Karaj, Shahriar and Mohammad-Shahr cities and their surrounding suburbs was esti-mated using Landsat-8 images. Pixel-based image classification and object-based segmentation techniques were employed to extract built-up patches and spectrally homogeneous regions. Using the multiple regression analysis, the ALSTV of built-up patches was modeled as a function of their structure and the spatial characteristics of other land-use patches located in their respective segments (as neighborhood factors). A Cellular Automata model was utilized to simulate the expansion of built-up area up to 5% and, therefore, estimate their future ALSTV. The mean ALSTV was highest in urban areas (33.25 +/- 7.41 degrees C), while the lowest mean value of 24.12 +/- 3.24 degrees C was in green covers. The ALSTV of built-up patches were positively associated with their area and the percentage and size of neighborhood built-up patches, while negatively with the percentage of neighborhood green patches. To create a thermally comfortable landscape, additional green patch allocation and preventing excessive urban patch growth are required in all large built-up segments.

TI  - A near real-time web-system for predicting fire spread across the Cerrado biome
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are aggravating due to climate change. Public policies need territorial intelligence to prevent and promptly fight fires, especially in vast regions like Brazil. To this end, we have developed a fire-spread prediction system for the Brazilian Cerrado, the biome most affected by wildfires in South America. The system automatically uploads hot pixels and satellite data to calculate maps of fuels loads, vegetation moisture, and probability of burning for simulating fire spread thrice a day for the entire Cerrado at 25 ha and for nine conservation units at 0.04 ha spatial resolution. In both versions, the model attains 65-89% of spatial match. Model results together with ancillary data, e.g., historical burned areas and annual CO2 emissions from fires, are available on an interactive web-platform that serves as a tool for fire prevention and fight, particularly in the selected conservation units where the platform is being used for daily operations.

AB  - The egg parasitoid Centrodora italica Ferriere is reported for the first time from sentinel eggs of two species of Tettigoniidae (Orthoptera), Pachytrachis gracilis (Brunner von Wattenwyl) and Eupholidoptera schmidti (Fieber). In Italy, only two hosts of this parasitic wasp are known, one of which is a tettigoniid species. Exposure of sentinel eggs represented a useful method to detect new host associations of this parasitoid species that can search for their host's eggs in the ground. The parasitoids were identified by comparing our specimens with those of the type series, and the original description of C. italica.

TI  - Increasing seroprevalence of Japanese encephalitis virus in even-toed hoofed mammals (Artiodactyla species) associated with an upsurge of human cases in South Korea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The annual incidence of Japanese encephalitis (JE) has increased markedly in South Korea since 2010. We hypothesized that this increase was associated with higher frequencies of JE virus in animals.Methods: We analyzed 5201 serum samples collected from even-toed hoofed mammals (Artiodactyla species) across South Korea from 2008 to 2012 using a stratified two-stage probability approach.Results: The highest annual incidence of human JE cases and deaths occurred in 2010. Cases increased from six (no deaths) in 20 08-20 09 to 26 cases (seven deaths) in 2010. The JE virus seroprevalence in deer and elk fawns increased from 2.4% in 2008 to 24.1% in 2009, and in wild boars, it increased from 19.3% to 55.0% in the same period, which preceded the surge of human cases. Furthermore, the seroprevalence in calves increased from 15.3% in 2008 to 35.8% in 2010, and that in lambs and goat kids, increased from 8.5% in 2009 to 26.2% in 2010, which coincided with the surge in humans.Conclusion: Our findings show that the increased incidence of human JE in South Korea was temporally associated with an increasing seroprevalence in the Artiodactyla species. Surveillance of sentinel animals may be useful to predict the emergence of JE in humans.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Refined mapping and kinematic trend assessment of potential landslides associated with large-scale land creation projects with multitemporal InSAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2012, a mega-project, "Mountain Excavation and City Construction" (MECC), has been underway on the Chinese Loess Plateau, aiming to create extra flat ground for urban growth. However, this large-scale land creation has led to dramatic changes in the local geological environment, forming a large number of engineered loess slopes. This study aims to map and assess the boundaries and stability of these potentially unstable engineered slopes (potential landslides). Based on spatio-temporal deformation patterns of landslides prior to failure, a novel interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)-based procedure for potential landslide mapping and stability evaluation was constructed in this study. The proposed procedure was employed to map and evaluate the potential landslides in the Yan'an New District (YND), the largest land-creation area in the Loess Plateau. First, the spatial locations and boundaries of the potential landslides were determined by combining optical image interpretation with differential deformation maps derived from Sentinel-1 small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) analysis. Then, the kinematic evolution trend of the mapped potential landslide was evaluated by quantitative analysis of the time-series displacements using an exponential model. Finally, the potential influencing factors and failure modes of the potential landslide were examined and discussed. The results indicate that the InSAR-derived differential deformation maps reflect the external boundary of the potential landslides well, and a total of 18 potential landslides are identified and mapped for the first time in the large-scale land-creation area of the YND. Over 82% of the coherent targets (CTs) within these potential landslides showed primary or steady creep during the InSAR observation period; however, tertiary creep was also observed on several slopes. Thus, it is crucial to utilize multitemporal InSAR and/or ground-based equipment for the continuous monitoring of engineered slopes in large-scale land-creation areas. The high correlation between spatiotemporal deformation patterns and environmental factors indicates that the activity of potential landslides is mainly controlled by the thickness of filling loess, while rainfall accelerates the displacement of slopes. These findings can contribute to the development of landslide disaster prevention and mitigation measures in the YND.

TI  - Satellite interferometry for regional assessment of landslide hazard to pipelines in northeastern British Columbia, Canada
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Pipelines are a critical component of transportation infrastructure. They offer the safest and most efficient way to transport large volumes of oil and natural gas from development areas to refineries and consumers. Landslides can damage pipelines resulting in a spill of a toxic substance. However, landslide hazards to pipelines and other infrastructure can be significantly reduced, if the location of landslides is known and the appropriate mitigation measures are taken in advance. Traditional, ground-based methods for mapping areas susceptible to landslides can be expensive and limited. Radar interferometry is a remote sensing technique that measures ground deformation from two Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Time series of ground deformation computed from repeatedly acquired SAR data allows us to detect slow-moving, deep-seated landslides over a large area with high spatial resolution and precision. European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellite systematically collects SAR data worldwide, and large datasets have been collected since approximately 2016-2017. A combination of improved availability of SAR data, inexpensive processing power and advanced processing techniques designed for large datasets provides an opportunity to map ground deformation on a regional scale. The study's objective is to compare deformation maps, as proxies for landslide identification, computed from commercial RADARSAT-2 data and freely available Sentinel-1 data over a region in northeast British Columbia, Canada, with an extensive network of pipelines. It is concluded that readily available Sentinel-1 data can produce high-quality deformation maps capable of detecting slow-moving landslides. In the study area, hundreds of slow-moving landslides are mapped using hotspot analysis based on Getis-Ord Gi* statistics, and two small regions where landslide activity near the pipelines is particularly significant are studied in detail. Field observations also revealed that slope deformation features formed in the surface sediments consist of colluvium derived from a mix of glaciolacustrine, till and fine-grained sedimentary bedrock.

TI  - THE (QUEER) AESTHETICS OF JEAN PAUL'S <i>SIEBENKAS</i>
T2  - GERMAN LIFE AND LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes that the eighteenth-century novel Siebenkas contains the formulation of an aesthetic theory that embraces same-sex desire. The novel's author, Jean Paul Friedrich Richter, still relatively unknown among literary scholars today, uses the myth of Narcissus as an aesthetic blueprint for the novel. In doing so, he appears to comply with the aesthetic conventions espoused by his German Romantic peers, many of whom considered self-contemplation to be a prerequisite for gaining access to the Absolute, a term that designates an unconditioned totality that was dear to authors, artists and philosophers at the time. However, the article suggests that Jean Paul's true purpose is to employ the myth to subversive ends. In particular, the author builds upon the myth's homoerotic underpinnings - largely (but not entirely) forgotten in the eighteenth century - to articulate a theory of aesthetics that no longer seeks to efface homosexual desire. The aesthetic worldview that emerges from this process is one that foregrounds imitation as a fundamental building-block of queer aesthetics and that, in contraposition to some of the dominant aesthetic thinking of the age, advocates the legitimacy of an aesthetics that celebrates desire rather than suppressing it.

TI  - LANDSAT 8 LST Pan sharpening using novel principal component based downscaling model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The panchromatic (PAN) band is accessible at a much higher spatial resolution than the thermal infrared (TIR) band in remote sensing satellites. To mitigate this issue, current research proposes a fusion method based on principal components of PAN and TIR band pairs to enhance the spatial resolution of Land surface temperature (LST) images. In this research, LANDSAT-8 LST images of 100 m resolution have been downscaled to 15 m resolution by the Novel principal component (NPC) based downscaling model. The downscaled LST image's thermal values have been cross-verified by in situ thermal points collected by the thermal data logger and image quality indices. The results have shown the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.51-0.92 for downscaled LST im-age from 100m to 15m resolution. The correlation between downscaled LST and ground truth points is between 0.54 and 0.83. The proposed NPC-based LST-PAN combination technique col-lects spatial details of the Earth's surface from PAN data as well as indulges thermal information of TIR image. The proposed fusion technique has upgraded the spatial goal and peculiarity of TIR images data set. The higher spatial resolution of thermal images can increase the level of preci-sion in various remote sensing applications. These improved data sets can be used in a variety of applications, including urban heat island mapping, agricultural crop monitoring, forest fire de-tection, and hydrological modeling, to name a few. The increased spatial resolution provided by NPC fusion results in more accurate and consistent temperature readings, leading to improved de-cision-making and management in these and other applications.

T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Accurate in-season crop phenology estimation (CPE) using remote sensing (RS)-based machine-learning methods is challenging because of limited ground-truth data. In this study, a biophysical crop model was used to guide neural network (NN)-based, in-season CPE. Using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), we conducted uncalibrated simulations for corn (Zea mays L.) across Iowa and Illinois in the U.S. Midwest with in-season weather and historical information for planting and harvest. We investigated guiding the NN CPE method with growth stage (GSTD) and water stress factor (WSF) outputs from these simulations. Results show that guided NNs are able to estimate onset and progression of phenological stages more accurately than an unguided baseline and a crop model-only method. GSTD guidance improved CPE during seasons when progress deviated from a regional average because of temperature but was detrimental during seasons of delayed planting and harvest. WSF guidance improved CPE during seasons when planting and harvest were delayed by heavy rainfall but performed less well during grainfill and mature stages. Neural network-based CPE guided by both GSTD and WSF provided the most accurate estimates for pre-emergence, emerged, silking, and grainfill stages as well as lower RMSE for the median stage transition date than reported in three full-season CPE studies. An accurate RS method for estimating planting could link DSSAT simulations to the current planting window and improve upon these results. This model-guided approach can be extended to other crops and regions to unlock in-season crop risk assessments that are directly linked to crop phenology.

TI  - Lake surface temperature retrieved from Landsat satellite series (1984 to 2021) for the North Slave Region
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface temperature (LST) is an important attribute that highlights regional weather and climate variability and trends. The spatial resolution and thermal sensors on Landsat platforms provide the capability of monitoring the temporal and spatial distribution of lake surface temperature on small- to medium-sized lakes. In this study, a retrieval algorithm was applied to the thermal bands of Landsat archives to generate a LST dataset (North Slave LST dataset) for 535 lakes in the North Slave Region (NSR) of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, for the period of 1984 to 2021. North Slave LST was retrieved from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS); however, most of the dataset was created from the thermal bands of Landsat 5 (43 %) due to its longevity (1984-2013). Cloud masks were applied to Landsat images to eliminate cloud cover. In addition, a 100 m inward buffer was applied to lakes to prevent pixel mixing with shorelines. To evaluate the algorithm applied, retrieved LST was compared with in situ data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST observations. A good agreement was observed between in situ observations and North Slave LST, with a mean bias of 0.12 circle C and a root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of 1.7 circle C. The North Slave LST dataset contains more available data for warmer months (May to September; 57.3 %) compared to colder months (October to April). The average number of images per year for each lake across the NSR ranged from 20 to 45. The North Slave LST dataset, available at (Attiah et al., 2022), will provide communities, scientists, and stakeholders with spatial and temporal changing temperature trends on lakes for the past 38 years.

TI  - SAR image formation scheme implementation and endorsement sprouting from Level-0 data decoding
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data processing evolving from level-0 raw data is complicated, especially in data decoding, manifesting in obtaining a well-focused SAR image. This paper is intended to present a complete MATLAB-based SAR data processing tool, which helps the end-user to treat simply the steps of image generation. This paper would enrich the research community in the field of SAR processors, especially in the area of understanding, handling, and developing a SAR processor based on space packet protocol standard (STD 01) used in many SAR systems such as Sentinel-1, ERS-1, CubeL, JPSS-2, 3, and 4. Also, this work opens the door for researchers to decode other space packet protocol standards and even to create an algorithm based on fully understanding the image formation algorithm from its roots. Moreover, the work in this paper could be a stepping-stone for the beginner in the field of SAR signal processing to become familiarized with SAR image generation procedures. The level-0 raw data used in this paper is based on Sentinel 1 SAR satellite obtained from the European Space Agency Copernicus website, a free open-source for level-0 and level-1 data types. The MATLAB program allows users to compare their generated image with the level-1 single-look complex (S1-L1-SLC) image utilizing entropy, contrast, and sharpness image quality metrics. The results showed that the images produced by the proposed algorithm are comparable to Sentinel-1 level-1 SAR images for the same scene and achieved satisfactory accuracy under the requirements for image quality.

TI  - Impact of small farmers' access to improved seeds and deforestation in DR Congo
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1960s, the increased availability of modern seed varieties in developing countries has had large positive effects on households' well-being. However, the effect of related land use changes on deforestation and biodiversity is ambiguous. This study examines this question through a randomized control trial in a remote area in the Congo Basin rainforest with weak input and output markets. Using plot-level data on land conversion combined with remote sensing data, we find that promotion of modern seed varieties did not lead to an increase in overall deforestation by small farmers. However, farmers cleared more primary forest and less secondary forest. We attribute this to the increased demand for nitrogen required by the use of some modern seed varieties, and to the lack of alternative sources of soil nutrients, which induced farmers to shift towards cultivation of land cleared in primary forest. Unless combined with interventions to maintain soil fertility, policies to promote modern seed varieties may come at the cost of important losses in biodiversity.Availability of modern seed varieties in developing countries has had positive effects on households' well-being. Here, the authors show that without support to maintain soil fertility, access to modern seed varieties increases primary forest clearance in DR Congo.

TI  - Geospatial dimensions of the renewable energy transition-The importance of prioritisation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The renewable energy transition is a priority for many researchers, policy makers, and political leaders because it is projected to stop the dependence of economic growth on increasing fossil fuel use and thus curtail climate change. This study examines how expert judgments affect develop-ment decisions to enable the renewable energy transition. Geospatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analyses (MCDA) are frequently used to select offshore wind energy (OWE) sites, however, they are often weak and/or often rely on limited judgement. The Analytical Hierarchy Process is used here with 25 diverse experts to assess the variability in priorities for OWE siting criteria. A geospatial MCDA is implemented using experts' individual priorities, aggregated weights and Monte Carlo simulations. Case study results reveal large variations in expert opinions and bias strongly affecting MCDAs weighted by single decision-makers. A group-decision approach is proposed to strengthen consent for OWE, underpinning the renewable energy transition.

TI  - The integrated stress response is activated in the salivary glands of Sjogren's syndrome patients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionPrimary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune exocrinopathy that affects the structure and function of salivary and lachrymal glands. Labial salivary gland (LSG) acinar cells from SS patients lose cellular homeostasis and experience endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress. The integrated cellular stress response (ISR) is an adaptive pathway essential for restoring homeostasis against various stress-inducing factors, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, and endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress. ISR activation leads eIF2 alpha phosphorylation, which transiently blocks protein synthesis while allowing the ATF4 expression, which induces a gene expression program that seeks to optimize cellular recovery. PKR, HRI, GCN2, and PERK are the four sentinel stress kinases that control eIF2 alpha phosphorylation. Dysregulation and chronic activation of ISR signaling have pathologic consequences associated with inflammation. MethodsHere, we analyzed the activation of the ISR in LSGs of SS-patients and non-SS sicca controls, determining the mRNA, protein, and phosphorylated-protein levels of key ISR components, as well as the expression of some of ATF4 targets. Moreover, we performed a qualitative characterization of the distribution of ISR components in LSGs from both groups and evaluated if their levels correlate with clinical parameters. ResultsWe observed that the four ISR sensors are expressed in LSGs of both groups. However, only PKR and PERK showed increased expression and/or activation in LSGs from SS-patients. eIF2 alpha and p-eIF2 alpha protein levels significantly increased in SS-patients; meanwhile components of the PP1c complex responsible for eIF2 alpha dephosphorylation decreased. ATF4 mRNA levels were decreased in LSGs from SS-patients along with hypermethylation of the ATF4 promoter. Despite low mRNA levels, SS-patients showed increased levels of ATF4 protein and ATF4-target genes involved in the antioxidant response. The acinar cells of SS-patients showed increased staining intensity for PKR, p-PKR, p-PERK, p-eIF2 alpha, ATF4, xCT, CHOP, and NRF2. Autoantibodies, focus score, and ESSDAI were correlated with p-PERK/PERK ratio and ATF4 protein levels. DiscussionIn summary, the results showed an increased ISR activation in LSGs of SS-patients. The increased protein levels of ATF4 and ATF4-target genes involved in the redox homeostasis could be part of a rescue response against the various stressful conditions to which the LSGs of SS-patients are subjected and promote cell survival.

TI  - Radial growth in mangrove <i>Xylocarpus granatum</i> J. Koenig is driven by salinity in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh
T2  - DENDROCHRONOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Albeit the Sundarbans provides protection and livelihood supports to similar to 7.5 million climate vulnerable coastal people in Bangladesh and India, this sentinel mangrove ecosystem has been threatened by anthropogenic disturbances and rapid environmental changes including sea level rise (SLR). In this context, long-term tree growth data are increasingly essential to understand the effects of environmental changes on mangroves and also to formulate their management plans. In this study, we evaluate the nature and periodicity of growth rings in Xylocarpus granatum, an ecologically important mangrove tree species growing in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. In addition, we analyze the influences of climatic variables (i.e., precipitation and temperature) and river discharge on its radial growth. The results reveal that X. granatum forms distinct growth rings which are marked by a layer of parenchyma band consisting of 1-4 cells. The visual crossdating and the quality of chronology statistics indicate that the growth rings are crossdatable. A site-specific chronology was developed spanning from 1973 to 2020 based on the crossdated samples. The annual nature of X. granatum's growth rings offer an opportunity to estimate tree age and growth rate. The ring width is influenced by salinity which is regulated mainly by freshwater influx through annual precipitation along with river discharge, particularly in July. This study suggests that growth rings could be used as a proxy in exploring X. granatum's growth dynamics, especially in relation to environmental changes.

TI  - An integrated water resource management approach for Lake Trasimeno, Italy
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to outline governance actions to mitigate impacts of climate change scenarios (drought) in Lake Trasimeno. A water balance model was integrated with a decision support system to evaluate water levels and water management scenarios. Water quality indices, based on Sentinel-2 images, allow the monitoring of parameters such as chlorophyll-a and turbidity. The possibility of diverting water volume from Montedoglio or Casanova reservoirs into Trasimeno Lake, according to the hypothesis of different "intervention thresholds levels" and volumes immitted, is investigated. Simulation results show that hydrometric zero represents the optimal threshold, maximizing the volume supplied and mitigating a water level decrease. An inverse correlation was observed between the lake water levels, turbidity, and chlorophyll-a concentration indices. Even if further studies to test the effects of mixing water with different physical and chemical characteristics are necessary, the proposed mitigation strategy could avoid the rapid growth of the above-mentioned quality parameters.

TI  - Feasibility and Safety of Tailored Lymphadenectomy Using Sentinel Node-Navigated Surgery in Patients with High-Risk T1 Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundSelective lymphadenectomy using sentinel node-navigated surgery (SNNS) might offer a less invasive alternative to esophagectomy in patients with high-risk T1 esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a new treatment strategy, consisting of radical endoscopic resection of the tumor followed by SNNS.MethodsIn this multicenter pilot study, ten patients with a radically resected high-risk pT1cN0 EAC underwent SNNS. A hybrid tracer of technetium-99m nanocolloid and indocyanine green was injected endoscopically around the resection scar the day before surgery, followed by preoperative imaging. During surgery, sentinel nodes (SNs) were identified using a thoracolaparoscopic gammaprobe and fluorescence-based detection, and subsequently resected. Endpoints were surgical morbidity and number of detected and resected (tumor-positive) SNs.ResultsLocalization and dissection of SNs was feasible in all ten patients (median 3 SNs per patient, range 1-6). The concordance between preoperative imaging and intraoperative detection was high. In one patient (10%), dissection was considered incomplete after two SNs were not identified intraoperatively. Additional peritumoral SNs were resected in four patients (40%) after fluorescence-based detection. In two patients (20%), a (micro)metastasis was found in one of the resected SNs. One patient experienced neuropathic thoracic pain related to surgery, while none of the patients developed functional gastroesophageal disorders.ConclusionsSNNS appears to be a feasible and safe instrument to tailor lymphadenectomy in patients with high-risk T1 EAC. Future research with long-term follow-up is warranted to determine whether this esophageal preserving strategy is justified for high-risk T1 EAC.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Relationship with the Land Use/Land Cover Indices Leading to Thermal Field Variation in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in the Land Surface Temperature (LST) caused by global warming and extreme weather events is significantly increasing Urban Hot Spots (UHS) while impacting the environmental quality within urban areas. In this research, with the help of Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite images, the evolution of Land Use/Cover (LULC), LST, and Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) between the years 1985 and 2020 is examined. The main aim is to evaluate how these variables, together with the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Urban Index (UI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Built Index, and Proportion Vegetation (PV) have influenced the variability of the UHS and the level of thermal comfort according to the Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI). The results report significant average rises of the variables: LST (6.62 degrees C), SUHI (0.97 degrees C), UHS (8.61%) of the UI and NDBI indices and class 6 of UTFVI (88.53%) that are related to the variability of the LULC corroborated by statistical analysis. Our results provide valuable information on the future development of urban areas in Northern Cyprus to make them more resilient and sustainable to rising temperatures.

TI  - Basal mass balance and prevalence of ice tongues in the Western ross sea
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice tongues at the fringes of the Antarctic ice sheet lose mass primarily through both basal melting and calving. They are sensitive to ocean conditions which can weaken the ice both mechanically or through thinning. Ice tongues, which are laterally unconfined, are likely to be particularly sensitive to ocean-induced stresses. Here we examine ice tongues in the Western Ross Sea, by looking into the factors affecting their stability. We calculate the basal mass change of twelve Antarctic ice tongues using a flux gate approach, deriving thickness from ICESat-2 height measurements and ice surface velocities from Sentinel-1 feature-tracking over the same period (October 2018 to December 2021). The basal mass balance ranges between -0.14 +/- 0.07 m yr(-1) and -1.50 +/- 1.2 m yr(-1). The average basal mass change for all the ice tongues is -0.82 +/- 0.68 m of ice yr(-1). Low values of basal melt suggest a stable mass balance condition in this region, with low thermal ocean forcing, as other studies have shown. We found a heterogeneous basal melt pattern with no latitudinal gradient and no clear driver in basal melt indicating that local variables are important in the persistence of ice tongues in the absence of a strong oceanographic melting force. Moreover, thanks to the temporal resolution of the data we were able to resolve the seasonal variability of Drygalski and Aviator Ice Tongues, the two largest ice tongues studied.

TI  - Two invasive <i>Hieracium</i> species' potential distributions within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem were defined using invasion susceptibility models and habitat typing
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive Hieracium plant species are invading the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The potential distribution of orange hawkweed (Hieracium aurantiacum) and meadow hawkweed (Hieracium caespitosum) were estimated using habitat susceptibility models to assist land managers' management of these invasive plants. The objectives of this study were to: (1) develop models describing susceptibility of ecosystems to hawkweed invasion, (2) identify indicator species of orange hawkweed and meadow hawkweed, (3) determine habitat types where these invasive hawkweeds might occur, and (4) create habitat susceptibility maps for management planning and ground surveys. Models were developed using a Mahalanobis distance similarity technique from remotely sensed biotic and abiotic variables, as well as known location data for orange and meadow hawkweed. Ground validation was conducted to assess model weaknesses and subsequent model modification. Indicator plant species were identified as surrogates to determine the likelihood of hawkweed presence during ground survey. Transect data collected from areas susceptible to invasion also were used to determine habitat types where hawkweed might occur. The best model included eight variables: north-south aspect, east-west aspect, slope, NDVI, NDWI, blue spectral band, green spectral band, and precipitation. High susceptibility (65 + % likelihood of suitable habitat) consisted of 66,000 ha for meadow hawkweed and 35,000 ha for orange hawkweed, 5.0% and 2.7% of the study area, respectively. Meadow hawkweed and orange hawkweed had seven and three indicator plant species, respectively. Predicted hawkweed habitat susceptibility encompassed nine habitat types, ranging from xeric sagebrush steppe to wet forests and they overlapped except at the xeric habitat type. Habitat susceptibility models save costs and allow survey prioritization to those areas most susceptible to invasion.

TI  - Monitoring salinity in bare soil based on Sentinel-1/2 image fusion and machine learning
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the application of satellite remote sensing data to salinity inversion in bare soil, multispectral satellites enjoy richer wavelength bands compared with synthetic aperture radar (SAR), but their vulnerability to cloudy weather limits the inversion accuracy. In contrast, SAR has stronger penetration, is less affected by cloudy weather, and can work around the clock. Therefore, in order to monitor soil salinity over a longer period of time and under various climatic conditions, and to further improve the accuracy of salinity inversion, we fused Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images and investigated the feasibility of SAR and multispectral satellite image fusion in salinity inversion in this paper. And we conducted experiments in Hetao Irrigation Area, Inner Mongolia, China. Gram-Schmidt(GS) was used to fuse Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images at the same time, and maximum-normalization was carried out on the DN value of the fused image. Then some remote indices conducted with the normalized DN, together with high relevant fused single bands were input into Back Propagation(BP), Support Vector Machine(SVM), Random Forest(RF) as independent variables after two-tailed significance test and Variable importance in projection(VIP) selection, for soil salinity inversion model construction. Finally, the inversion results of the study area were evaluated with R2, RMSE, RPD, RSS, and RPIQ. The results of this study showed that the bare soil salinity inversion based on the fusion of VV(Sentinel-1) and Sentinel-2 had a higher accuracy than that on the fusion of VH (Sentinel-1) and Sentinel-2 image and that without the fusion. Among the three machine learning models, random forest (RF) achieved the most satisfying results (R2 = 0.801, RMSE = 0.686), followed by SVM(R2 = 0.624, RMSE = 0.875) and BP(R2 = 0.613, RMSE = 0.918). This study demon-strated the feasibility of fusing Sentinel-1 radar images with Sentinel-2 multispectral images to improve the accuracy of soil salinity inversion, and constructed the soil salinity inversion model based on machine learning and GS fusion.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The dataset consists of ocean surface wind speed and direction at 10 m height and 1 km spatial resolution around the wider Australian coastal areas, spanning 4 years (2017 to 2021) of measurements from Sentinel-1 A and B imaging Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) platforms. The winds have been derived using a consistent SAR wind retrieval algorithm, processing the full Sentinel-1 archive in this region. The data are appropriately quality controlled, flagged, and archived as NetCDF files representing SAR wind field maps aligned with satellite along-track direction. The data have been calibrated against Metop-A/B Scatterometer buoy-calibrated, wind measurements and examined for potential changes in calibration over the duration of the data. The calibrated data are further validated by comparisons against independent Altimeter (Cryosat-2, Jason-2, Jason-3, and SARAL) wind speeds. Several methods for data access are also listed. The database is potentially useful for offshore industries (oil and gas, fisheries, shipping, offshore wind energy), public recreational activities (fishing, sailing, surfing), and protection and management of coasts and natural habitats.

TI  - Urban waterlogging resilience assessment and postdisaster recovery monitoring using NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data: A case study of the ?July 20, 2021? heavy rainstorm in Zhengzhou City, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, with the acceleration of urbanization and abnormal changes in the overall cli-mate, cities have been increasingly threatened and affected by disasters. Assessing and improving urban resilience, as well as postdisaster recovery monitoring, are of great significance for rele-vant municipal departments. Taking the heavy rainstorm event that occurred on July 20, 2021, in Zhengzhou City as an example, this study explored the resilience and postdisaster recovery of Zhengzhou City based on remote sensing data and other multisource data. First, we calculated the resilience assessment index and built an assessment model. Then, we analyzed and evaluated the resilience. Finally, based on NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data, we verified the accuracy of the re-silience results and dynamically monitored the postdisaster recovery process. The results show that the overall resilience of Zhengzhou City to waterlogging disasters is low in the southwest and high in the northeast. The changing trend of the nighttime light brightness following the disaster was consistent with the resilience assessment results. Then, due to rescue work, the light index in-creased briefly in July; Due to the serious impact of the disaster, the facilities were damaged, and the light index was reduced in August. With the development of recovery work, the disaster -influenced and light index areas gradually recovered and exceeded the predisaster level. Corre-sponding urban resilience strategies were proposed based on the assessment results. This study can provide a scientific basis and reference for relevant aspects such as disaster prevention, re-covery, and reconstruction in Zhengzhou City and other cities.

TI  - Scalable RT-LAMP-based SARS-CoV-2 testing for infection surveillance with applications in pandemic preparedness
T2  - EMBO REPORTS

AB  - Throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, limited diagnostic capacities prevented sentinel testing, demonstrating the need for novel testing infrastructures. Here, we describe the setup of a cost-effective platform that can be employed in a high-throughput manner, which allows surveillance testing as an acute pandemic control and preparedness tool, exemplified by SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in an academic environment. The strategy involves self-sampling based on gargling saline, pseudonymized sample handling, automated RNA extraction, and viral RNA detection using a semiquantitative multiplexed colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay with an analytical sensitivity comparable with RT-qPCR. We provide standard operating procedures and an integrated software solution for all workflows, including sample logistics, analysis by colorimetry or sequencing, and communication of results. We evaluated factors affecting the viral load and the stability of gargling samples as well as the diagnostic sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay. In parallel, we estimated the economic costs of setting up and running the test station. We performed > 35,000 tests, with an average turnover time of < 6 h from sample arrival to result announcement. Altogether, our work provides a blueprint for fast, sensitive, scalable, cost- and labor-efficient RT-LAMP diagnostics, which is independent of potentially limiting clinical diagnostics supply chains.

TI  - Predictability of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> from air quality emissions
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the coevolution of greenhouse gases and air quality pollutants can provide insight into underlying anthropogenic processes enabling predictions of their emission trajectories. Here, we classify the dynamics of historic emissions in terms of a modified Environmental Kuznets Curve (MEKC), which postulates the coevolution of fossil fuel CO2 (FFCO2) and NOx emissions as a function of macroeconomic development. The MEKC broadly captures the historic FFCO2-NOx dynamical regimes for countries including the US, China, and India as well as IPCC scenarios. Given these dynamics, we find the predictive skill of FFCO2 given NOx emissions constrained by satellite data is less than 2% error at one-year lags for many countries and less than 10% for 4-year lags. The proposed framework in conjunction with an increasing satellite constellation provides valuable guidance to near-term emission scenario development and evaluation at time-scales relevant to international assessments such as the Global Stocktake.The historical changes in country emissions of greenhouse gases and air quality pollutants are classified together as a function of economic development, providing valuable guidance to emission scenario development.

TI  - Do silvopastoral management practices affect biological pest control in oil palm plantations?
T2  - BIOCONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The reliance of conventional oil palm production on agrochemicals to control understory vegetation has caused devastating impacts on the environment. Overuse of chemical herbicides leads to the decline of native biodiversity and production-related ecosystem services, including biological pest control. In contrast to herbicide applications, livestock integration is a chemical-free approach to eradicate weeds without negative consequences on the environment. In this sentinel prey experiment, we assessed the predation pressure (based upon the number of bite marks left by natural predators such as arthropods, birds, and mammals) in three oil palm plantations with different weeding practices (i.e., rotational grazing, free-range grazing, and conventional weeding) located on the south-west part of Peninsular Malaysia. We also investigated the effects of site level characteristics on the predation pressures of artificial caterpillars. Across all types of weeding systems, we found that the majority of the predation attempts on the deployed artificial caterpillars were made by arthropods (532 attempts), whereas mammals (66 attempts) and birds (60 attempts) played much smaller roles. Our results showed that predation pressures were consistent across sites indicating that oil palm-cattle integrated plantations (either free-range or rotational grazing systems) would experience similar level of pest control services as conventional herbicide-sprayed plantations. Our results also indicate the influence of site-level habitat variables (i.e., mean of palm heights, canopy cover, and elevation) on predation pressures. Our results suggest that livestock-oil palm integration may sustain natural predation with little or no herbicide input.

TI  - Macroalgae monitoring from satellite optical images using Context-sensitive level set (CSLS) model
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatically detecting macroalgae from optical remote sensing images has been a long-standing problem in ocean monitoring. Existing operational spectral-based techniques tend to assign a threshold to an indicator such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to determine whether or not macroalgae exists in a pixel. This thresholding scheme relies on individual pixel features and cannot address the environment variability among different images or even across one single image. To address these limitations, we develop the unsupervised classification method taking the ecological indicator of NDVI as input by exploiting a region-based level set driven by context-sensitive energy function for macroalgae detection from optical remote sensing images. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations based on satellite optical images with various imaging time and spatial resolutions (16-250 m) from GF-1, GF-4, Landsat-8, and Aqua demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness for Ulva prolifera detection. The model is proved to be superior to the traditional NDVI thresholding method and state-of-the-art level set methods in terms of higher accuracy (Kappa coefficients 0.87-0.92) and automation (without artificial threshold/parameter adjustment). Moreover, the model has the advantage of accommodating complex environmental conditions (such as different water turbidity, thin clouds and sun glint), and can be utilized for detection of Sargassum bloom. The model could facilitate the accurate extraction of macroalgae in-formation and thus serve disaster prevention and control. It may also be used to assist high-accuracy training data preparation for supervised classification and detect the objects with obvious texture and spectral charac-teristics (such as oil spills) based on customized bands combination.

TI  - Digital assessments of soil organic carbon storage using digital maps provided by static and dynamic environmental covariates
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the vertical and lateral distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic carbon density (SOCD) is indispensable for soil use and environmental management because of their vital role in soil quality assessments. Primarily, they are needed in calculating soil organic carbon storage (SOCS). The objective of this research was to provide digital maps of SOC and SOCD variation as well as their uncertainties at multiple standardized depths (H1: 0-5, H2: 5-15, H3: 15-30, H4: 30-60 and H5: 60-100 cm) using a parsimonious model with optimized terrain-related attributes and satellite-derived data. SOCS were evaluated at soil subgroup levels. An area of about 808 km(2) with varying elevation, plant cover and lithology from the Miandoab region, West Azerbaijan Province, Iran was selected as a case study area. A total of 386 soil samples were collected from 104 profiles comprising various soil genetic horizons. A continuous spline function was then fitted to the target properties in advance of creating a dataset at five standard depth intervals (following the GlobalSoilMap project). These were then grouped into three classes including top (H1), middle (H2, H3 and H4) and bottom (H5) depths to ease interpretation. Static and dynamic covariates (30-m resolution) were derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) and a suite of Landsat-8 spectral imageries, respectively. Four candidate models including stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), random forest (RF), cubist (CU) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) Tree were tested in this study. Finally, the digital maps at 30-m resolution of SOC and SOCD and their uncertainties were prepared using the best-fit model and the bootstrapping method, respectively. Four soil subgroups (Gypsic Haploxerepts, Typic Calcixerepts, Typic Haploxerepts and Xeric Haplocalcids) were identified across the study area. The covariates had variable contributions on the evaluated models. The XGBoost Tree model generally outperformed other models for prediction of SOC and SOCD (R-2 = 0.60, on average). Regardless of soil subgroups, the uncertainty analysis showed that the SOCD map had a low prediction interval range value indicating high accuracy. Additionally, the highest SOCS and SOCD was observed at the top followed by middle and bottom depths in the study area. All subgroups exhibited a decreasing trend of SOCD with increasing depth. A similar trend was also observed for SOCS. The highest SOCD (on average) was observed in Gypsic Haploxerepts (4.71 kg C/m(2)) followed by Typic Calcixerepts (4.46 kg C/m(2)), Typic Haploxerepts (4.45 kg C/m(2)) and Xeric Haplocalcids (4.40 kg C/m(2)). Overall, the SOCS normalized by area within soil order boundaries was greater in Inceptisols than Aridisols across the study area. The findings of this study provide critical information for sustainable management of soil resources in the area for agricultural production and environmental health in the Miandoab region of Iran.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban floods are more concerned in recent days due to their substantial effect in loss of human lives and properties. Due to climate change, urban floods are frequently observed in many parts of the world. Flood events in Chennai city are a frequent scenario due to rapid increase in the density of population. Adyar river watershed and surrounding urban cover are focused in the present study. The present study aims at mapping flooded region using Sentinel 1A datasets over Adyar watershed. Series of Sentinel 1A image is collected before, during and after floods for mapping the extent of flood and mapping risk zones in Adyar watershed. Methodologies such as ISODATA Technique, Multi-Temporal Analysis, Thresholding Method, PCA and ICA Analysis and Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix are adopted for the extraction of flooded extent from the SAR datasets. Analysis performed over the Adyar watershed provided promising results in the extraction of flooded extent with Thresholding Method and Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix being the dominant of all the methods. Though higher accuracy is obtained in the extraction of flooded extent, limitation of layover, foreshortening and shadow is experienced in the built up region for the extraction of flooded pixels.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF AESTHETICS CREATIVITY AND THE ARTS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - There is substantial interest among psychologists in the psychological processes of engaging arts and humanities. Despite this, there is still a need for methodological tools to investigate the psychological mechanisms through which engagement in arts and humanities enhances individual well-being. Using four rounds of data collection (including one retest), we document the development and validation of the scales measuring each of the five theorized mechanisms: reflection, acquisition, immersion, socialization, and expression. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, we found a three-factor structure for reflection (life/worldview, emotional, and external), and six-factor for acquisition (vicarious experience, direct encouragement, social persuasion, experience of mastery-ability, experience of mastery-success, and positive physiological response), two-factor structure for immersion (effort and passage of time), three-factor for socialization (relationships, identity, conversation), and one-factor structure for expression. We also reported measurement invariance in mechanisms of engagements in arts vs. humanities and between males and females and over time. The measure demonstrated predictive and concurrent validity for flourishing outcomes, good test-retest reliability, and measurement equivalence across gender, between arts and humanities, and over time.

TI  - Nodal positivity and systemic therapy among patients with clinical T1-T2N0 human epidermal growth factor receptor-positive breast cancer: Results from two international cohorts
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe optimal treatment strategy for patients with small human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive tumors is based on nodal status. The authors' objective was to evaluate pathologic nodal disease (pathologic lymph node-positive [pN-positive] and pathologic lymph node-positive after preoperative systemic therapy [ypN-positive]) rates in patients who had clinical T1-T2 (cT1-cT2)N0M0, HER2-positive breast cancer treated with upfront surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). MethodsTwo databases were queried for patients who had cT1-cT2N0M0, HER2-positive breast cancer: (1) the Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center (DF/BCC) from February 2015 to October 2020 and (2) the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona and the Hospital Clinico of Valencia (HCB/HCV) from January 2012 to September 2021. The pN-positive/ypN-positive and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) rates were compared between patients who underwent upfront surgery versus those who received NAC. ResultsAmong 579 patients from the DF/BCC database, 368 underwent upfront surgery, and 211 received NAC; the rates of nodal positivity were 19.8% and 12.8%, respectively (p = .021). The pN-positive rates increased by tumor size (p < .001), reaching 25% for those with cT1c tumors. The ypN-positive rates did not correlate with tumor size. NAC was associated with decreased nodal positivity (odds ratio, 0.411; 95% confidence interval, 0.202-0.838), but the ALND rates were similar (22 of 368 patients [6.0%] who underwent upfront surgery vs. 18 of 211 patients [8.5%] who received NAC; p = .173). Among 292 patients from the HCB/HCV database, 119 underwent upfront surgery, and 173 received NAC; the rates of nodal positivity were 21% and 10.4%, respectively (p = .012). The pN-positive rates increased with tumor size (p = .011). The ALND rates were equivalent by treatment strategy (23 of 119 patients [19.3%] who underwent upfront surgery vs. 24 of 173 patients [13.9%] who received NAC; p = .213). ConclusionsAmong patients who had cT1-cT2N0M0, HER2-positive breast cancer, approximately 20% who underwent upfront surgery were pN-positive, and the rate reached 25% for those with cT1c tumors. Given the opportunity for tailored therapy among lymph node-positive, HER2-positive patients, these data provide rationale for future analyses investigating the utility of routine axillary imaging in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.

TI  - Capturing the spatiotemporal variations in the gross primary productivity in coastal wetlands by integrating eddy covariance, Landsat, and MODIS satellite data: A case study in the Yangtze Estuary, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of the spatiotemporal variations in the gross primary productivity (GPP) in coastal wetlands is essential for blue carbon quantification. However, the currently available moderate-spatial-resolution GPP algorithms and products may contain large uncertainties and may rarely meet the demands of tidal wetland research. In this paper, we examine two statistical methods, namely, simple linear regression and random forest regression, to capture the high spatial resolution GPP variations in the salt marshes in the Yangtze Estuary by integrating multi-source data, including eddy covariance, Landsat, and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectror-adiometer (MODIS) satellite data. The satellite-derived photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI) are used individually and in different combinations to drive the two statistical methods and investigate their performances in estimating the GPP. The results show that together with the PAR, the EVI generally has the greatest potential for GPP estimation (R2 > 0.75, RMSE < 6.80 mu mol m- 2 s- 1) based on simple linear regression. However, the NDVI outperforms the EVI in wetlands with little tidal flooding and plant litter. The random forest method improves the performance in terms of upscaling the GPP measurements to large regions, and the com-bination of the EVI, NDVI, NDWI, and PAR performs the best, indicating that the use of the more advanced algorithm and the incorporation of a remotely sensed index that reflects the tidal influence are beneficial to GPP estimation in coastal salt marshes. Moreover, using Landsat data with a high spatial resolution (30 m) yields a much more accurate GPP estimation than using MODIS data with a 500 m resolution. Our results demonstrate that the use of high spatial resolution data, the proper use of remotely sensed indices, and the incorporation of a good combination of these indices through an advanced algorithm such as a machine learning algorithm are vital for capturing the nearly instantaneous GPP variations in coastal wetlands at large spatial scales.

TI  - Eco-Sanitary Regionalization of Wild Boar (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) in the Western Palearctic Realm as a Tool for the Stewardship of African Swine Fever
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is a viral hemorrhagic disease affecting domestic and wild suids, with catastrophic socioeconomic impact worldwide. In the European scenario, wild boar (Sus scrofa) actively contributes to the maintenance and spread of the disease. In this study, we applied a multivariate clustering method to define ecoregions in the western Palearctic realm based on ecological and sanitary aspects of ASF in wild boar. Beforehand, we performed a principal components analysis for the eight selected variables. An analysis of the countries was carried out in terms of the extent of ecoregions and ASF notifications. After clustering, we identified nine eco-regions that showed important differences based on the used eco-sanitary variables. Several ecoregions stand out in the country and notification analysis for retaining the most ASF cases and being present in their surrounding locations. Here, we developed a cartographical tool to understand patterns in the distribution and spread of ASF in wild boar at the European level, as well as improve prevention, control, surveillance plans, and eradication strategies, especially future vaccination programs once a safe and effective vaccine is available.

TI  - Quantifying and analyzing the impact assessment on land use change of urban growth using a timeline
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change occurs by altering natural landscape to manmade built environment. Rapid urban growth is the main factor for land use change at global level. Addis Ababa is one of the recent rapidly growing urban areas in Africa. Since 1983, the population has increased by nearly three times. However, the spatial expansion of the urban area has been much greater with urban sprawl, informal settlement, industry, condominium housing, and real estate development. The demand for urban land has been increasing at alarming rate both by city government, investors, and its residents. The city is primate and the population nine times the second largest city in the country. This study focused on quantifying and analyzing impact assessment of urban growth on land use change from 1986 to 2019. The study assessed the major change in extent and determinants of land use change through 33 years (1986-2019) and future growth scenario the next 30 years from 2019 to 2049. This study used Landsat image, base map of 1986, 1998, 2008, and 2019, to analyze built-up growth and land use change. Observation and interview have also taken to explore more on major urban growth and land use change driving factor from concerned bodies. The last, land use efficiency method was applied to measure land consumption rate and population growth rate. The result showed that in 1986, 1998, 2008, and 2019, built-up covered 21.83%, 42.31%, 59.42%, and 81.20% respectively. This shows that the agriculture and open space were rapidly changed to built-up by 32,486.67 hectares for housing, manufacturing, and infrastructure development. The result from concerned bodies has portrayed that the key determinants for urban land use change in the city were population growth at 4.2% per annum. Government led condominium housing, real estate development, and industrial development expansion including informal settlement has been rapidly reducing agriculture and open space through time. Therefore, unconventional planning approach could be exercised based on community interest for affordable high-rise building. Moreover, disseminate or decentralize industries beyond capital city in regional capital to reduce migration rate and rapid change of urban land use by creating employment opportunity and urban-urban linkage in the reginal capital rather than the capital city.

TI  - Long-term ecological changes in China?s Ramsar sites
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are globally critical for human survival and Earth's sustainable development. However, wetlands are experiencing rapid degradation and loss due to pollution, reclamation, climate change, invasions, etc. Ramsar sites are globally recognized as wetland hotspots that have been designated Wetlands of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention. However, the long-term trends of change that affect these sites remain unclear. This study explored the ecological changes and characteristics of Ramsar sites using 7 ecological indicators from three aspects: vegetation status, hydrological dynamics and anthropogenic disturbance, with the support of 36 -year dense Landsat imagery and the trend and mutation analysis algorithms of Theil-Sen and BreakoutDetection. The results showed that (1) for the long-term trend, the ecological status of 55% of China's Ramsar sites experienced a trend of degradation, and the remaining Ramsar sites showed a trend of restoration in the past 36 years. (2) After the mutation was analysed, 47% of the Ramsar sites showed an environmental and ecological improvement trend in the recent period. (3) More than 50% of Ramsar sites were found to have ecological re-versals in vegetation status and hydrological dynamics in the past 36 years.

TI  - Sentinel Surveillance of Schistosomiasis-China, 2021
T2  - CHINA CDC WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: This report analyzes the national surveillance data for schistosomiasis in 2021 to understand the current status and provide evidence for further policy actions to promote elimination. This analysis is in line with the National Surveillance Plan of Schistosomiasis, which was revised in 2020 to adapt to the new stage of moving towards elimination.Methods: Data from the 2021 national surveillance of schistosomiasis in humans, livestock, and snails were collected from 13 provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs) and analyzed using descriptive epidemiological methodology. The antibody-positive rate and area of newly discovered and re-emergent snail habitats were calculated. Results: In 2021, a total of 31,661 local residents and 101,558 transient population were screened for antibodies using indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA). Of those who tested positive, 745 local residents and 438 transient population underwent further parasitological examination, with only one stool-positive result in the transient population. Additionally, 12,966 livestock were examined using the miracidia hatching test, with no positives detected. The total area of newly discovered and re-emergent snail habitats was 957,702 m2 and 4,381,617 m2, respectively. No infected snail was found using the microscopic dissection method, but six pooled snail samples were reported as positive using the loop -mediated isothermal amplification method for detecting specific sequences of Schistosoma. japonicum, in Anhui and Jiangxi Provinces. Conclusions: The prevalence of schistosomiasis among humans and livestock was found to be low, however, a potential transmission risk was identified in certain areas. To reduce the risk of transmission, a comprehensive control strategy should be continued and new techniques should be implemented in the surveillance and early warning system.

TI  - Shoreline change rate estimation: Impact on salt production in Kutubdia Island using multi-temporal satellite data and geo-statistics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastline is a natural interface that separates the wet and dry parts of the beach. Shoreline configuration is always influenced by natural and anthropogenic forces. Storm surge is one of the major natural events that has converted the shape of shoreline along the Kutubdia island. With the use of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), the coastal area was evaluated to estimate the change dynamics of Kutubdia Island. This highly active coast with erosion and deposition has inherent complexity in determining the shoreline movement and quantifying the rate of change. The study examined the positional change of the shoreline of the island between 1980 and 2021 including its impacts on salt production using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools and multi-temporal LANDSAT images. To distinguish between water and land features, the LANDSAT images were radiometrically corrected and a spectral index, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was used. The shorelines were extracted using a histogram-based Otsu's Binary threshold approach and image-based visual interpretation. The Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE), Linear Regression Rate (LRR), and End Point Rate (EPR) was used to calculate shoreline change rates. EPR and LRR both estimated average change rates of -4.125 m/yr and -4.647 m/ yr, respectively. Between 1980 and 2021, an overall land area of 9.2439 sq. km was lost, while there were no significant land depositions. The landward movement was more noticeable on the northern side of the island. The eastern side showed no significant alterations. The short-term (in 2031) and long-term (in 2041) coastline positions have been forecast based on the demarcated shoreline. The results of the forecast also show that the shoreline will move landward but not significantly seaward. Island erosion is particularly dangerous in the northern and southern zones. The result also shows that salt production is decreasing due to island erosion, especially in the south. If the erosion continues at the same rate salt production will decrease almost by 4563.38 tons between 2021 and 2041. The results of this study may help with the proper management and planning for Kutubdia Island. Moreover, this can also be used in statistical modeling, to predict where the shoreline will be in the future.

AB  - Let A be a unital prime *-algebra with characteristic not 2 and with a projection e? 0,1. Suppose that d:A?Q(s)(A) is a map satisfying d(xy*z+zy*x/2)=d(x)y*z+xd(y)*z+xy*d(z)+d(z)y*x+zd(y)*x+zy*d(x)/2 for all x,y,z is an element of A, where Q(s)(A) denotes the symmetric Martindale algebra of quotients of A. It is shown that d is an additive triple derivation. Moreover, there exist a?Q(s)(A) with a*=-a and an additive *-derivation d:A -> Qs(A) such that d(x)=ax+d(x) for all x is an element of A. The analogous results for prime locally matrix *-algebras, prime *-algebras with nonzero socle, factor von Neumann algebras and standard operator *-algebras on Hilbert spaces are also described.

TI  - An improved method for estimating soil moisture over cropland using SAR and optical data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The paper aims to construct simple soil moisture(SM) retrieval model using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The water cloud model (WCM) removed the contribution of vegetation to the radar backscattering coefficient, and the backscattering coefficient of soil was estimated. Based on the established SM retrieval model without soil roughness parameters, the SM in farmland and forest land was retrieved using radar VV-VH dual-polarization data. We considered the interference of uneven surfaces on the radar signal, added the radar local incidence angle parameter to improve the model, and constructed a semi-empirical SM retrieval model. The accuracy of the results showed Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.04 and the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.80. The SM retrieval model for removing soil roughness parameters can estimate soil moisture with reasonable accuracy. The influence of topographic factors (elevation, slope and aspect) on the retrieval results of the model was analyzed. It was found that the area with the steep slope and blocked radar signal is not conducive to estimate SM. The SM retrieval method constructed in this paper provides many advantages for some research and practical applications, and its application in other SAR data remains to be further studied.

TI  - Application of machine learning techniques to derive sea water turbidity from Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) from satellites has the potential to provide comprehensive, rapid and inexpensive information about water bodies, integrating in situ measurements. Traditional methods to retrieve optically active water quality parameters from satellite data are based on semiempirical models relying on few bands, which often revealed to be site and season specific. The use of machine learning (ML) for remotely sensed water quality estimation has spread in recent years thanks to the advances in algorithm development and computing power. These models allow to exploit the wealth of spectral information through more flexible relationships and are less affected by atmospheric and other background factors. The present study explores the use of Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) Level-1C Top of Atmosphere spectral radiance to derive water turbidity, through application of machine learning techniques. A dataset of 222 combination of turbidity measurements, collected in the North Tyrrhenian Sea - Italy from 2015 to 2021, and values of the 13 spectral bands in the pixel corresponding to the sample location was used. Two regression techniques were tested and compared: a Stepwise Linear Regression (SLR) and a Polynomial Kernel Regression. The two models show accurate and similar performance (R2 = 0.736, RMSE = 2.03 NTU, MAE = 1.39 NTU for the SLR and R2 = 0.725, RMSE = 2.07 NTU, MAE = 1.40 NTU for the Kernel). A band importance analysis revealed the contribution of the different spectral bands and the main role of the red-edge range. The work shows that it is possible to reach a good accuracy in turbidity estimation from MSI TOA reflectance using ML models, fed by the whole spectrum of available bands, although the possible generation of errors related to atmospheric effect in turbidity estimates was not evaluated. Comparison between turbidity estimates obtained from the models with turbidity data from Copernicus CMEMS dataset named 'Mediterranean Sea, Bio-Geo-Chemical, L3, daily observation' produced consistent results. Finally, turbidity maps from satellite imagery were produced for the study area, showing the ability of the models to catch extreme events.

TI  - Assimilation of aircraft observations over the Indian monsoon region: Investigation of the effects of COVID-19 on a reanalysis
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced the availability of global aircraft-based observations (ABOs), which has been restored later in 2021. This study focuses on the impact of ABOs on a regional reanalysis. Indian Monsoon Data Assimilation and Analysis (IMDAA) is a regional reanalysis for a period from 1979 to 2020 (originally up to 2018) over India and surrounding regions produced at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), India, in collaboration with the UK Met Office. A comparison of the impact of ABOs on other conventional and satellite observations assimilated in the NCMRWF global model and IMDAA during 2019 and 2020 revealed the importance of ABOs, particularly in IMDAA, since it did not assimilate the latest satellite data as the IMDAA system was frozen in October 2016. A data denial experiment that removes all the ABOs from the IMDAA assimilation system for a period from March to November 2019 is designed. The results from the IMDAA reanalysis run, which assimilates ABOs during the same period, are compared with the data denial experiment. Assimilation of ABOs strengthened the upper tropospheric circulation, the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), during the Indian summer monsoon compared to the data denial experiment. Analysis of the features of two cyclones that developed over the North Indian Ocean during the study period revealed that ABO assimilation played a key role in simulating the track and intensity of these cyclones when they were in the 'severe' category. Since the sample is small, more cyclone cases need to be analysed to consolidate the result.

TI  - Climatic variables impact on inland lakes water levels and area fluctuations in an arid/semi-arid region of Iran, Iraq, and Turkey based on the remote sensing data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this study, the impact of vegetation, land surface temperature, and precipitation on changes in water level and area of seven inland lakes (Urmia lake in Iran, Tharthar, Mosul lakes and Hammar 4 wetland in Iraq, and Beysehir and Ercek lakes in Turkey) is analyzed to evaluate the variability of these lakes due to climate change. The altimetric data from four remote sensing databases (TOPEX/POSEIDON and Jason 1, 2, and 3), the area of the lakes from the images of Landsat OLI and ETM + sensors, the vegetation from MOD13Q1-NDVI 250 m database, land surface temperature from LST-MOD11A1, and precipitation from GPM_3IMERGM product were used in this study to assess the changes occurring in the period of the last 20 years (2000-2019). The results showed that in the analyzed area the values of the land surface temperature and vegetation indices increased, whereas annual precipitation sums decreased. Although temperature and vegetation changes in all three countries were almost consistent with each other, changes in the water level and area of the studied lakes were different. The highest decrease in the water level was observed for Urmia lake. Although decreases in the water level were also observed in other lakes, their water level returned after a time to its initial level (1992). This was not the case for Urmia lake, where the water level after 1999 never returned to the initial value, finally lowering by 7 m. The fluctuations of the water level and area of Iran, Turkey, and Iraq lakes are however caused by factors other than only those related to climate, which needs more investigations to determine more precisely the changes in the water level of these lakes.

TI  - Study of dynamics in surface ice flow rate of glaciers in Hunza basin, Karakoram
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the Karakoram region are widely recognized for their historical surging phenomenon. Accurate field-based glacier monitoring is challenging in the Karakoram due to the presence of mixed-nature glaciers that are advancing, receding, and surging. Many geographers came to the opinion that surging is a thermally controlled activity in the Karakoram as opposed to a hydrologically controlled activity as a result of characteristics including high-altitude warmth, precipitation, and accumulation patterns of these glaciers. But the main surge mechanism is still a mystery. The current study used Landsat multispectral satellite datasets to examine and investigate the glaciers' vulnerability to surging activity in the Hunza basin based on the annual surface ice flow rate and frontal snout advancement of the glaciers from 1990 to 2021. Around 80 glaciers in the Hunza basin have been researched, and based on interannual surface flow rates, it has been determined that Batura, Hassanabad II, Barpu, Gharesa, Hispar, Khurdopin, Minapin, Virjerab, Yazgil, and Ghulkin glaciers are more vulnerable to surging. The findings show that during the research period, these glaciers had surged and advanced along their snouts. The frontal snout of these glaciers advances, and moraines are deposited closer to the glacier terminus as a consequence of active surge points over the ablation region. The Hunza basin's topography, precipitation, and thermal regimes regulate the glaciers' surging phenomena causing successive acceleration in the glaciers. Field-based measurements made with a differential global positioning system are used to corroborate the obtained results.

TI  - Atmospheric correction of absorbing aerosols for satellite ocean color remote sensing over coastal waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric correction (AC) of satellite ocean color remote sensing, which is affected by the vertical distribution of absorbing aerosols (AA), is prone to large uncertainties in the waters with AA, especially for remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(& lambda;)) retrievals in the blue and ultraviolet bands. In this study, a new AC algorithm called the Ocean Color-XGBoost with radiative transfer (RT) simulation Retrieval Tool (OC-XGBRT), which is based on extensive radiative simulation and machine learning model, was developed to retrieve the Rrs(& lambda;) at the short wavelength bands of visible light in the presence of AA while considering their vertical distributions. The goal of the OC-XGBRT AC algorithm is to improve the quality of ocean color satellite products over inland and coastal waters with AA and heavy aerosol loadings. The images acquired by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite (MODIS-Aqua) over six regions with the cases of AA were utilized to assess the performance of OC-XGBRT. The Rrs(& lambda;) retrieved by OC-XGBRT were validated with in situ measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) and the SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage (SeaBASS). The results showed that OC-XGBRT provided more accurate Rrs(412 nm) and Rrs(443 nm) products than the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) v7.5 standard near-infrared (NIR) AC algorithms, the POLYnomial-based approach established for the atmospheric correction of MERIS data (PLOYMER), and the Ocean Color-Simultaneous Marine and Aerosol Retrieval Tool (OC-SMART) over coastal and inland waters, with mean absolute percentage deviation (APD) and root mean square error (RMSE) values less than -36.9% and - 5.5 x 10-4 sr-1, respectively. Application results of OC-XGBRT in six typical regions further demonstrated that the quality of retrieved Rrs(412 nm) and Rrs(443 nm) had substantially improved compared with the original satellite products under the condition of AA. Moreover, the implementation of the OC-XGBRT contributes to a significant enhancement in the spatial coverage of utilizable Rrs(& lambda;) values at blue bands. Our proposed OC-XGBRT AC algorithm has the potential to process ocean color satellite data under the condition of AA.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 39th Annual Miami Breast Cancer Conference
CL  - Miami Beach, FL
AB  - Introduction: The reported incidences of breast cancer-related lymphedema (LE) affecting the arms vary greatly. Reason for this variability includes different diagnostic techniques used across studies. In the current study, we compared the accuracy of indocyanine green lymphography (ICG_L) and bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) in detecting LE before presentation of clinical signs.Methods and Results: Patients with no initial detectable signs of clinical LE of their arms after axillary lymph node dissection or removal of >5 lymph nodes on sentinel lymph node biopsy were included. Subclinical LE was defined as BIS values outside the normal range [(>= 7 units (or >10 units)] or a 7-unit (or 10 unit) change between two measurements. We tracked ICG_L and BIS measurements for 133 potentially affected arms (n = 123). ICG_L detected signs of lymphatic flow disruption in 63 arms (47%). Based on the BIS value of 7 units, 60 arms (45%) had values outside the normal range. When using ICG_L-identified LE cases as true positives, BIS had a 54% accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.54) in detecting LE. Accuracy was 61% for subclinical LE symptoms when compared with ICG_L (AUC = 0.62). Both BIS and subclinical LE symptoms had <0.70 AUC-receiver characteristic operator curve, suggesting that BIS and development of subclinical LE symptoms are not adequate for identifying patients with subclinical LE.Conclusion: ICG_L is a reliable diagnostic tool for detecting early signs of lymphatic flow disruption in subclinical LE. Utilizing ICG_L to diagnose subclinical LE followed by a personalized treatment plan may provide patients the best chance of preventing disease progression.

TI  - Simultaneous estimation of fractional cover of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation using visible-near infrared satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In vegetation-abundant ecosystems, accurate fractional cover estimation of multiple targets, including nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and bare soil (BS) is an important indicator of carbon storage and climate change, and a contributing factor to soil and water conservation, wildfire, and drought. Satellite remote sensing began with sensors limited to the visible and near infrared (VNIR, 380 nm to 1000 nm), and advancing to sensors spanning the whole solar domain (350 nm to 2500 nm) over the last five decades. However, NPV is still difficult to distinguish from BS in satellite images covering large spatial areas, since their spectral reflectances are always mixed and have subtly different spectral features. Many spectral indices have been proposed to identify NPV, however, most include a short-wave infrared band which is lacking on many current and historical spaceborne sensors. To fully utilize current and historical airborne/satellite images with only VNIR bands, a novel spectral index - the VNIR spectral shape index (SSI) - is proposed in this paper. Using spectra of PV, NPV, and BS acquired from world-recognized spectral libraries, the SSI was devised using only blue, green, red, and NIR bands. When applied to Sentinel-2 MSI images, the SSI was effective in estimating/mapping the fractional cover of PV, NPV, and BS using the triangular space method. The resulting fractional cover was evaluated in three 3 km x 2 km study areas including one grassland, one woodland, and one cropland. The spectral reflectance collected by spectroradiometer in field work and digital image collect by digital camera mounted on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) support that the triangular space method is able to estimate the fractional cover of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation simultaneously, and that endmember selection relying solely on satellite images is reasonable. Comparing the abundance of each target in UAV images to corresponding MSI pixels, the SSI index and triangular space method proved effective for fractional cover estimation in varied vegetated ecosystems. For fractional cover evaluation in grassland, woodland, and cropland, the R2 reaching to 0.59, 0.62, and 0.70, respectively. These results demonstrate that the SSI is feasible for multiple sensors, enabling potential large temporal and/or spatial scale applications.

TI  - Assessing the causal effect of long-term exposure to air pollution on cognitive decline in middle-aged and older adults-Empirical evidence from a nationwide longitudinal cohort
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution remains a risk factor for the global burden of disease. Middle-aged and older people are more susceptible to air pollution because of their declining physical function and are more likely to develop diseases from long-term air pollution exposure. Studies of the effects of air pollution on cognitive function in middle-aged and older adults have been inconsistent. More representative and definitive evidence is needed. This study analysed data from the Chinese Family Panel Study, an ongoing nationwide prospective cohort study, collected in waves 2014, 2016 and 2018. Rigorously tested instrument was selected for analysis and participants' PM2.5 and instrument exposures were assessed using high-precision satellite data. The causal relationship between long-term exposure to air pollution and poor cognitive function in middle-aged and older adults was investigated using the Correlated Random Effects Control Function (CRE-CF) method within a quasi-experimental framework. This study included a total of 7042 participants aged 45 years or older. A comparison of CRE-CF with other models (OLS model, ordered probit model, and ordered probit-CRE model) demonstrated the necessity of using CRE-CF given the endogeneity of air pollution. The credibility and validity of the instrumental variable were verified. In the CRE-CF model, long-term exposure to PM2.5 was found to accelerate cognitive decline in middle-aged and older adults (coefficients of -0.159,-0.336 and-0.244 for the total cognitive, verbal and mathe-matical scores, respectively). Taken together, these results suggest that chronic exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with cognitive decline in middle-aged and older adults, which highlights the need for appropriate protective policies.

TI  - Satellites reveal hotspots of global river extent change
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers are among the most diverse, dynamic, and productive ecosystems on Earth. River flow regimes are constantly changing, but characterizing and understanding such changes have been challenging from a long-term and global perspective. By analyzing water extent variations observed from four-decade Landsat imagery, we here provide a global attribution of the recent changes in river regime to morphological dynamics (e.g., channel shifting and anabranching), expansion induced by new dams, and hydrological signals of widening and narrowing. Morphological dynamics prevailed in similar to 20% of the global river area. Booming reservoir constructions, mostly skewed in Asia and South America, contributed to similar to 32% of the river widening. The remaining hydrological signals were characterized by contrasting hotspots, including prominent river widening in alpine and pan-Arctic regions and narrowing in the arid/semi-arid continental interiors, driven by varying trends in climate forcing, cryospheric response to warming, and human water management. Our findings suggest that the recent river extent dynamics diverge based on hydroclimate and socio-economic conditions, and besides reflecting ongoing morphodynamical processes, river extent changes show close connections with external forcings, including climate change and anthropogenic interference. Rivers are among the most diverse, dynamic, and productive ecosystems on Earth. Here, using Landsat imagery, the authors provide a global attribution of the recent changes in river regime to morphological dynamics, dam-induced widening, and hydrological signals.

TI  - Multi-instrumental analysis of the day-to-day variability of equatorial plasma bubbles
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a multi-instrument observational analysis of the equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs) variation over the American sector during a geomagnetically quiet time period of 07-10 December 2019. The day-to-day variability of EPBs and their underlying drivers are investigated through coordinately utilizing the Global-scale Observations of Limb and Disk (GOLD) ultraviolet images, the Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) in-situ and remote sensing data, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) total electron content (TEC) observations, as well as ionosonde measurements. The main results are as follows: 1) The postsunset EPBs' intensity exhibited a large day-to-day variation in the same UT intervals, which was fairly noticeable in the evening of December 07, yet considerably suppressed on December 08 and 09, and then dramatically revived and enhanced on December 10. 2) The postsunset linear Rayleigh-Taylor instability growth rate exhibited a different variation pattern. It had a relatively modest peak value on December 07 and 08, yet a larger peak value on December 09 and 10. There was a 2-h time lag of the growth rate peak time in the evening of December 09 from other nights. This analysis did not show an exact one-to-one relationship between the peak growth rate and the observed EPBs intensity. 3) The EPBs' day-to-day variation has a better agreement with that of traveling ionospheric disturbances and atmospheric gravity waves signatures, which exhibited relatively strong wavelike perturbations preceding/accompanying the observed EPBs on December 07 and 10 yet relatively weak fluctuations on December 08 and 09. These coordinate observations indicate that the initial wavelike seeding perturbations associated with AGWs, together with the catalyzing factor of the instability growth rate, collectively played important roles to modulate the day-to-day variation of EPBs. A strong seeding perturbation could effectively compensate for a moderate strength of Rayleigh-Taylor instability growth rate and therefore their combined effect could facilitate EPB development. Lacking proper seeding perturbations would make it a more inefficient process for the development of EPBs, especially with a delayed peak value of Rayleigh-Taylor instability growth rate.

TI  - Deadly disasters in southeastern South America: flash floods andlandslides of February 2022 in Petropolis, Rio de Janeiro
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - On 15 February 2022, the city of Petropolis in the highlands of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, received an unusually high volume of rain within 3 h (258 mm), generated by a strongly invigorated mesoscale convective system. It resulted in flash floods and subsequent landslides that caused the deadliest landslide disaster recorded in Petropolis, with 231 fatalities. In this paper, we analyzed the root causes and the key triggering factors of this landslide disaster by assessing the spatial relationship of landslide occurrence with various environmental factors. Rainfall data were retrieved from 1977 to 2022 (a combination of ground weather stations and the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation - CHIRPS). Remotely sensed data were used to map the landslide scars, soil moisture, terrain attributes, lineof-sight displacement (land surface deformation), and urban sprawling (1985-2020). The results showed that the average monthly rainfall for February 2022 was 200 mm, the heaviest recorded in Petropolis since 1932. Heavy rainfall was also recorded mostly in regions where the landslide occurred, according to analyses of the rainfall spatial distribution. As for terrain, 23% of slopes between 45-60ffi had landslide occurrences and east-facing slopes appeared to be the most con- ducive for landslides as they recorded landslide occurrences of about 9% to 11 %. Regarding the soil moisture, higher variability was found in the lower altitude (842 m) where the residential area is concentrated. Based on our land deformation assessment, the area is geologically stable, and the landslide occurred only in the thin layer at the surface. Out of the 1700 buildings found in the region of interest, 1021 are on the slope between 20 to 45 degrees and about 60 houses were directly affected by the landslides. As such, we conclude that the heavy rainfall was not the only cause responsible for the catastrophic event of 15 February 2022; a combination of unplanned urban growth on slopes between 45-60 degrees, removal of vegetation, and the absence of inspection were also expressive driving forces of this disaster.

TI  - Random forest classifications for landuse mapping to assess rapid flood damage using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Devastating flood events in northeast Bangladesh are almost a regular phenomenon and last for an abnormally long time for a variety of reasons, including the mountainous topography and the abundance of extreme rainfall events upstream of this region, the complex interaction of the ex-isting river network and haors (wetlands with shallow depressions) in this region. Apart from the monsoon floods, this region frequently experiences flooding during the pre-monsoon (Mar-May) season, known as flash floods, which are considered one of the worst hazards. For conducting the recovery processes after any flood event, accurate damage assessment needs to be done as much as it is possible, which may ensure proper planning and decision-making. Hence, this study pro-posed a methodology to combine Optical and Radar Sentinel products for flood monitoring and damage assessment. The major advantage of using two different Sentinel products combinedly was while Sentinel-2 could be used for land cover mapping, Sentinel-1 could be used for flood in-undation mapping during monsoon periods due to its cloud-penetrating radar imaging property. Gowainghat, an upazila of Sylhet district in Bangladesh, was selected as the case study area, which is prone to monsoons and flash floods almost every year. This area is also one of the most ecological hotspots in Bangladesh, dominated by different haors and beels. Being a dominant wa-terbody region, it is also necessary to classify the land covers distinctly. A random forest classifier has been introduced in this study to better represent flood extent in this region by ensuring better accuracy of the land cover classification. The results from this study revealed that better results were obtained during land cover mapping when the random forest classifier was applied (90% ac-curacy) compared to the maximum likelihood classification (74% accuracy). Moreover, the flood damage was evaluated for different land classes providing 89.06% overall accuracies when com-pared with current land cover. It has been found that about 23.98% of the total agricultural land went underwater during the last monsoon flood, while 72.41% was affected during the last flash flood. The study assisted in determining the losses related to floods and focused on the impor-tance of water management for the target locality.

TI  - Patterns of nodal metastases, biological behaviour and prognosis of canine mast cell tumours of the pinna: A multi-institutional retrospective study
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Canine cutaneous mast cell tumours (cMCTs) of the pinna have been associated with an aggressive biological behaviour, although data remain scarce. The knowledge acquired over the past years on histologic gradings, and the value of lymph node (LN) staging, may help in better characterizing this anatomical presentation. The first aim was to describe the frequency, location, and histologic appearance of LN metastases in cMCT of the pinna. A second aim was to evaluate prognosis. Medical records of dogs with cMCT of the pinna, that underwent tumour and sentinel (SLN) or regional LN (RLN) excision, were reviewed. The influence of potential prognostic variables on time to progression (TTP) and tumour-specific survival (TSS) was investigated. Thirty-nine dogs were included: 19 (48.7%) had Kiupel high-grade (K-HG) and 20 (51.3%) had low-grade (K-LG) MCTs. Eighteen (46.1%) dogs underwent SLN mapping: the superficial cervical LN was at least one of SLN in 17 (94.4%) cases. Twenty-two (56.4%) dogs had LN metastases; the superficial cervical LN was always involved. On multivariable analysis, only K-HG was associated with increased risk of progression (p = .043) and tumour-related death (p = .021). Median TTP and TSS were 270 and 370 days in K-HG, respectively; these were not reached in dogs with K-LG tumours (p < .01). cMCTs of the pinna are often K-HG and are also associated with a higher frequency of LN metastasis; however, we confirmed the independent prognostic value of histologic grading. A multimodal treatment may lead to favourable long-term outcome. Moreover, the superficial cervical LN is most often the SLN.

TI  - Developing an intelligent cloud attention network to support global urban green spaces mapping
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) play an important role in understanding of urban ecosystems, climate, environment, and public health concerns. Satellite derived UGS maps provide an efficient and effective tool for urban studies and contribute to targets and indicators of the sustainable development goals, at the global level, set by the United Nations. However, clouds create a challenging issue in optical satellite image processing, leading to significant uncertainty in UGS mapping. In this study, we propose an automatic UGS mapping method by integrating satellite images with crowdsourced geospatial data while aiming to reduce the uncertainty caused by cloud contamination. The proposed method consists of three parts: (1) auxiliary data pre-processing module; (2) cloud attention intelligent network (CAI-net); and (3) non-cloud scenes classification module. The auxiliary data pre-processing module was used to convert crowdsourcing geospatial data into auxiliary maps. The CAI-net was proposed to retrieve detailed UGS classes within clouds from satellite image patches and auxiliary maps, while non-cloud scenes classification module was used to extract UGS from satellite image patches. The proposed method was applied to generate spatial continuous global UGS map products, considering the uncertainty caused by cloud contamination. The results show the proposed method yielded a high-quality global UGS map with average overall accuracy as high as 92.96% when satellite images had cloud coverage ranging from 0% to 50%. The geospatial AI, specifically CAI-net, can provide more accurate UGS mapping regardless of different geographical and climatic conditions of the study areas, which is especially significant for humid tropical and subtropical regions with frequent clouds and rains.

TI  - Evaluation of surface reflectance bandpass adjustment techniques
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing number of on-orbit earth observation sensors in the solar domain (visible to middle infrared). While most the sensors are designed with apparent analogous bandpasses, they often exhibit differ-ences in terms of Relative Spectral Response (RSR). Although the differences are well characterized, there is a need for techniques to adjust for the effect of these differences on surface reflectance after accounting for cali-bration, directional, and atmospheric effects. This research evaluated eight bandpass adjustment techniques using synthetic and actual remote sensing observations on seven widely used sensors. The scope of the study is global. The eight evaluated techniques were: a) spectral band adjustment factor technique (SBAF, i.e., one-coefficient regression), b) linear fit technique (i.e., two-coefficient regression), c) three Adaptive SBAF techniques (ASBAF), which are defined according to three different cost functions and apply a target-dependent SBAF, d) two artificial neural network approaches using (i) a single band (ANN-1B) and (ii) all bands (ANN-NB) as inputs, and e) a Classification and Regression Tree method (CART) using all bands as inputs. All these techniques require a calibration phase, which was carried out separately using three hyperspectral data sets: (i) USGS spectral measurements, (ii) simulated reflectance by the ProSail radiative transfer model, and (iii) real-world Hyperion observations. The full data set is publically available. The evaluation using the three hyperspectral data sets alone showed that the techniques with a single band as input (SBAF, LIN, and ANN-1B) generated higher uncertainty than the techniques with all bands as input (ASBAF, ANN-N, CART). The ASBAF techniques performed well with a few differences among the three ASBAF variants. The ANN-N was the technique that performed the best. The evaluation based on actual remote sensing data sets (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data were used) suggested that all techniques reduced the deviation between the two data sets. Nonetheless, the deviation between the two data sets caused by factors other than RSR dif-ferences did not permit a clearcut comparison of the techniques. Some recommendations regarding the tech-niques to select for a particular application are provided. Finally, this research introduces the concept of RSR difference index (RDI) to quantify the spectral differences between two spectral bands.

AB  - BackgroundThe aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of flexible endoscopy-guided tracer injection for sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification in patients with laryngeal and pharyngeal carcinoma. MethodsSixteen cT1-4N0-2M0 patients with laryngeal or pharyngeal carcinoma underwent intra- and peritumoral [Tc-99m]Tc-nanocolloid injections after topical anesthesia under endoscopic guidance. SPECT-CT scans were performed at two time points. ResultsTracer injection and visualization of SLNs was successful in 15/16 (94%) patients. Median number of tracer injections was 1 intratumoral and 3 peritumoral. The median duration of the endoscopic procedure including tracer injection after biopsy taking was 7 min (range 4-16 min). A total of 28 SLNs were identified which were all visualized on the early and late SPECT-CT. Most SLNs were visualized in neck levels II and III. ConclusionsFlexible endoscopy-guided tracer injection for SLN identification is a feasible and fast procedure in laryngeal and pharyngeal carcinoma patients.

TI  - Brief communication: Glacier mapping and change estimation using very high-resolution declassified Hexagon KH-9 panoramic stereo imagery (1971-1984)
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The panoramic cameras (PCs) on board Hexagon KH-9 (KH-9PC) satellite missions from 1971-1984 captured very high-resolution stereo imagery with up to 60 cm spatial resolution. This study explores the potential of this imagery for glacier mapping and change estimation. We assess KH-9PC imagery using data from the KH-9 mapping camera (KH-9MC), KH-4PC, and SPOT and Pleiades satellite imagery. The high resolution of KH-9PC leads to higher-quality DEMs, which better resolve the accumulation region of the glaciers in comparison to the KH-9MC. On stable terrain, KH-9PC DEMs achieve an elevation accuracy of <4 m with respect to SPOT and Pleiades DEMs. While the estimated geodetic mass balances using PC and MC data are similar after outlier filtering, the elevation change data show superior spatial coverage and considerably less noise when using KH-9PC data.

TI  - Determining the primary sources of uncertainty in the retrieval of marine remote sensing reflectance from satellite ocean color sensors II. Sentinel 3 OLCI sensors
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainties in remote sensing reflectance Rrs for the Ocean Color sensors strongly affect the quality of the retrieval of concentrations of chlorophyll-a and water properties. By comparison of data from SNPP VIIRS and several AERONET-OC stations and MOBY, it was recently shown that the main uncertainties come from the Rayleigh-type spectral component (Gilerson et al., 2022), which was associated with small variability in the Rayleigh optical thickness in the atmosphere and/or its calculation. In addition, water variability spectra proportional to Rrs were found to play a significant role in coastal waters, while other components including radiances from aerosols and glint were small. This work expands on the previous study, following a similar procedure and applying the same model for the characterization of uncertainties to the Sentinel-3A and B OLCI sensors. It is shown that the primary sources of uncertainties are the same as for VIIRS, i.e., dominated by the Rayleigh-type component, with the total uncertainties for OLCI sensors typically higher in coastal areas than for VIIRS.

TI  - Progress in the remote sensing of veld fire occurrence and detection: A review
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Our research provides a detailed overview of the progress in remotely sensed fire monitoring techniques, which have been developed and employed for fire occurrence and detection. Our overview is provided from a literature search of English-peer reviewed articles, conference proceedings and scientific book sections published between the periods of 1980 and 2019. Literature reveals that historically, fire detection through remotely sensed techniques has mainly occurred through ground-based, airborne and satellite systems. Mathematical models, such as decision tree models, Species Distribution Models, Dynamic Global Vegetation Models and Global Climate Models, have also been employed alongside satellite systems to facilitate a greater understanding of fire dynamics and its susceptibility to changes in ecological and climatic variables. Fire frequency and severity are known to be influenced by atmospheric conditions, fuel load and ignitions. However, the literature suggests that targeting inappropriate wildfires with these techniques may still result in wildfires outside of the natural fire regime. Most studies regarding fire occurrence and/or monitoring focus on satellite-based techniques as they provide the greatest coverage of wildfires at varying spatial and temporal resolutions depending on the sensor used. Satellite systems are advantageous for fire monitoring as they provide extensive coverage inexpensively. Finally, fire occurrence is explicitly influenced by moisture-limited climatic conditions and/or fuel load in the form of leaf-litter or water-stressed plants.

AB  - Under the dual stress of climate change and human activities, ecological problems such as vegetation degra-dation, soil erosion, and desertification have disturbed the balance of the human-land relationship, damaged the ecosystem integrity, and seriously affected the sustainable development of human societies and ecological en-vironments. Scientifically assessing the stability or vulnerability of an ecosystem is a key prerequisite for measuring its degree of sustainability. Ecological vulnerability (EV) provides a reasonable quantitative pathway as the comprehensive result of ecosystem change. However, to meet the challenges of variable external inter-ference, the capabilities of existing assessment frameworks require further improvement. This study constructed a novel comprehensive remote sensing index directly based on land surface characteristics-regional ecological vulnerability index (REVI) and assessed the spatio-temporal characteristics and driving mechanism of EV in Gansu Province during 2000-2020. The applicability of three objective methods, namely principal component analysis, entropy weighing method, and spatial distance model, was verified against field data, and the effec-tiveness of implementing major ecological programs was discussed. The results showed that: (1) EV intensity of the study area remained at a relatively high level, and its spatial distribution exhibited apparent latitude -longitude zonality and spatially stratified heterogeneity; (2) EV decreased in 41.926% of the study area but continued to increase in 1.235%, and it exhibited an overall conversion pattern of "significant decrease in large areas and increase in small areas" in the past 21 years; (3) the effectiveness of ecological programs determined their impacts on EV, regulating the contribution and interaction of water resources, vegetation cover, soil degradation, and human activities, and promoting sustainable development of the ecosystem in a vulnerable cycle; and (4) urban expansion was achieved at the cost of occupying cropland and ecological land, and became the primary cause for the increased EV. The framework presented in this study is suitable for large-scale EV assessment, even at the global scale, with higher application potential. The results have important reference value for ecological protection, land resource utilization and sustainable development of similar vulnerable ecosystems, which are helpful for formulating sustainable and coordinated development policies.

TI  - Flood damage inspection and risk indexing data for an inventory of bridges in Central Greece
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This dataset is related to the research paper entitled "Bridge -specific flood risk assessment of transport networks using GIS and remotely sensed data" published in the Science of the Total Environment. It provides the information neces-sary for the reproduction of the case study that was used for the demonstration and validation of the proposed risk assessment framework. The latter integrates indicators for the assessment of hydraulic hazards and bridge vulnerability with a simple and operationally flexible protocol for the in-terpretation of bridge damage consequences on the service-ability of the transport network and on the affected socio-economic environment. The dataset encompasses (i) inven-tory data for the 117 bridges of the Karditsa Prefecture, in Central Greece, which were affected by a historic flood that followed the Mediterranean Hurricane (Medicane) Ianos, in September 2020; (ii) results of the risk assessment analy-sis, including the geospatial distribution of hazard, vulnera-bility, bridge damage, and associated consequences for the area's transport network; (iii) an extensive damage inspec-tion record, compiled shortly after the Medicane, involving a sample of 16 (out of the 117) bridges of varying char-acteristics and damage levels, ranging from minimal dam-age to complete failure, which was used as a reference for validation of the proposed framework. The dataset is com-plemented by photos of the inspected bridges which facili-tate the understanding of the observed bridge damage pat-terns. This information is intended to provide insights into the response of riverine bridges to severe floods and a thor-ough base for comparison and validation of flood hazard and risk mapping tools, potentially useful for engineers, as-set managers, network operators and stakeholders involved in decision-making for climate adaptation of the road sector.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Soil moisture estimates at 1 km resolution making a synergistic use of Sentinel data
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high-resolution ( similar to 10-100 m) surface soil moisture (SM) observations are important for applications in agriculture, among other purposes. This is the original goal of the (SMP)-M-2 (Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2-Derived Soil Moisture Product) algorithm, which was designed to retrieve surface SM at the agricultural plot scale by simultaneously using Sentinel-1 (S1) backscatter coefficients and Sentinel-2 (S2) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) as inputs to a neural network trained with Water Cloud Model simulations. However, for many applications, including hydrology and climate impact assessment at regional level, large maps with a high resolution (HR) of around 1 km are already a significant improvement with respect to most of the publicly available SM datasets, which have resolutions of about 25 km.In this study, the (SMP)-M-2 algorithm was adapted to work at 1 km resolution and extended from croplands to herbaceous vegetation types. A target resolution of 1 km also allows the evaluation of the interest in using NDVI derived from Sentinel-3 (S3) instead of S2. Two sets of SM maps at 1 km resolution were produced with (SMP)-M-2 over six regions of similar to 10(4) km(2) in Spain, Tunisia, North America, Australia, and the southwest and southeast regions of France for the whole year of 2019. The first set was derived from the combination of S1 and S2 data (S1 C S2 maps), while the second one was derived from the combination of S1 and S3 (S1 C S3 maps). S1 C S2 and S1 C S3 SM maps were compared to each other, to those of the 1 km resolution Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) SM and Soil Water Index (SWI) datasets, and to those of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) C S1 product.The S2MP S1 C S2 and S1 C S3 SM maps are in very good agreement in terms of correlation ( R >= 0.9), bias ( <= 0.04m(3) m(-3)), and standard deviation of the difference (SDD <= 0.03m(3) m(-3)) over the six domains investigated in this study. In a second step, the S1 C S3 S2MP maps were compared to the other HR maps. S1 C S3 SM maps are well correlated to the CGLS SM maps (R similar to 0.7-0.8), but the correlations with respect to the other HR maps (CGLS SWI and SMAP C S1) drop significantly over many areas of the six domains investigated in this study. The highest correlations between the HR maps were found over croplands and when the 1 km pixels have a very homogeneous land cover. The bias among the different maps was found to be significant over some areas of the six domains, reaching values of +/- 0:1m(3) m(-3). The S1 C S3 maps show a lower SDD with respect to CGLS maps ( <= 0.06m(3) m(-3)) than with respect to the SMAP C S1 maps (<= 0:1m(3) m(-3)) for all the six domains.Finally, all the HR datasets (S1 C S2, S1 C S3, CGLS, and SMAP C S1) were also compared to in situ measurements from five networks across five countries, along with coarseresolution (CR) SM products from SMAP, SMOS, and the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (CCI). While all the CR and HR products show different bias and SDD, the HR products show lower correlations than the CR ones with respect to in situ measurements. The discrepancies in between the different HR datasets, except for themore simple land cover conditions (homogeneous pixels with croplands) and the lower performances with respect to in situ measurement than coarse-resolution datasets, show the remaining challenges for large-scale HR SM mapping.

TI  - Investigating and predicting Land Surface Temperature (LST) based on remotely sensed data during 1987-2030 (A case study of Reykjavik city, Iceland)
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observing the state and changes of land cover (LC) is critical for assessing the status and changes of ecosystems such as urban development. Remote sensing can extract useful data from a large region regularly and at the same time. The present study has used Landsat 5 and 8 images to derive LC classification and Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps of Reykjavik city for four years 1987, 1995, 2006, and 2019. Satellite images were classified into four major land-cover classes using the Artificial Neural Network classification (ANN) algorithm. Then, calculations including the LST and the distance from the water were calculated for each study period. Finally, using the Markov chain, the prediction of land cover classes and LST classes for 2020 was obtained. The results have shown an average of 21.5% (8.2 km2), 71% (32.9 km2), -62.9% (43.7 km2), and 3.4% (2.6 km2) growth for Urban Areas (UA), Vegetation Land (VL), Bare Lands (BL), and Water Lands (WL) of Reykjavik evaluated LC classes. Reykjavik LC forecasting shows that UA will have had a 38.5% (8.2 km2), VL a -43% (34.1 km2), BL a 14.7% (3.8 km2), and WL a 14.8% (11.9 km2) by 2030. The mean of LST in this area has risen by 67.5% (7.7 degrees C) during this period. This is also supported by the findings of the analysis of the NDVI and LST connection. According to the research, the LST and the NDVI value of 0.1 to 0.7 have a positive relationship in this area. However, there is a negative correlation between LST with NDVI values of 0.8 and 0.9. The results showed that the mean of LST was also influenced by the distance from WL water bodies. The LST has grown by a mean of 0.7 of correlation as the distance from WL has increased. The results of this research will be useful in order to get an overview of the past and present situation and plan for the control of heat islands and land cover changes in Reykjavik.

TI  - A new method for calculating C factor when projecting future soil loss using the Revised Universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) in semi-arid environments
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how reservoir sedimentation rates may evolve due to climate change is essential for projecting future changes in reservoir water storage capacity. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is commonly used to assess regional soil loss rates because of its suitability for working with the coarse temporal and spatial scale of climate model outputs. Application of the RUSLE for projecting future erosion rates is constrained by the relatively limited number of classes used in projected changes of native vegetation: this typically reduces a wide range of variation in RUSLE cover (C) factors to a single value per class, and these classes may be insensitive to changes in species composition and canopy density with time and space. This paper develops a low-cost, efficient, and objective approach to projecting future C values directly based on widely available Landsat data, downscaled climate model data, and a limited number of terrain variables. Observed C is estimated from Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) values using standard methods. A linear relationship is established between the observed C values and average annual antecedent temperature, average annual antecedent precipitation, latitude, and percent sand (adjusted R-2 = 0.75604, 0.7543, and RMSE = 0.09448, 0.07043, respectively). A proof of principal study demonstrates that, unlike when land cover classes are used to estimates C, a RUSLE model driven by the regression-based C provides a correct order-of-magnitude estimate of observed long-term erosion and sediment yield rates (e.g., an estimate of 2.9-3.2 t ha(-1) y(-1) is obtained where observed rates range from 1.2 to 3.9 t ha(-1) y(-1) for the same time period, and up to 8 t ha(-1) y(-1) historically, while standard formulations of RUSLE yield 16.1 and 0.3 t ha(-1) y(-1)). Using climate model data to estimate both precipitation intensity (R factor) and C in the RUSLE model results in basin wide projected end 21st century soil erosion rates for relative concentration pathway 8.5 of 5.5-7.5 t ha(-1) y(-1), consistent with expectations for accelerated soil loss in the study area as climate change reduces soil moisture while increasing precipitation intensity. The same model driven by land cover class estimates of C produces soil loss rates an order of magnitude smaller (0.3-0.4 t ha(-1) y(-1)), consistent with a much more heavily vegetated landscape than could be supported under the increasingly arid projected climate.

TI  - Urban expansion impacts on agricultural land and thermal environment in Larkana, Pakistan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban area expansion and the increase in the built-up area are major threats to agriculture, the natural environment, and ecology throughout the world. The population of the city of Larkana is rapidly increasing due to natural growth and uncontrolled migration from the surrounding areas, which have resulted in a haphazard increase in the built-up area over the fertile agricultural land and affected the city's thermal environment. This research aims to evaluate the impacts of urban area expansion on agricultural land and the thermal environment of the study area by assessing the change in land use/ land cover (LULC) from 1990 to 2020 and land surface temperature (LST). For this purpose, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was applied, and LST was calculated in Google Earth Engine (GEE) using Landsat imageries for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. For the RF classifier algorithm, 3500 reference random points were generated for each year, which were then randomly divided into two datasets, i.e., a training sample consisting of 70% of the points and a validation dataset (30% of the points). After LULC classification, the results were validated for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, and the accuracy was 88.3%, 89%, 90.01%, and 90.8%, respectively. The study results showed that the built-up area increased from 12.31 to 43.83 km(2) while the barren land in the study region decreased from 56.51 km(2) to 11.62 km(2). The agricultural land was 66.66 km(2) in 1990, expanded to 101.38 km(2), and then decreased to 79.49 km(2) in 2020. The results also revealed that most of the urban expansion in the last decade (2010-2020) took place on agricultural land. The urban thermal environment also showed a gradual increase in surface temperatur,e as recorded by the LST results. The LST results revealed that the maximum LST was 33.4? in 1990, which increased to 36.1? in 2020, and similarly, the minimum LST was 25.1?, which also increased to 26.6? in 2020. This study provides useful results for stakeholders to devise better policies and plans to control further haphazard urban expansion on fertile agricultural land in the study area.

TI  - Rapid assessment of riverine flood inundation in Chenab floodplain using remote sensing techniques
T2  - GEOENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionAfter flood occurrences, remote sensing images provide crucial information formapping flood inundation extent. Optical satellite images can be utilized to generate flooded area maps when the flooded areas are free from clouds.Materials and MethodsIn this study flooded area was calculated using a variety of water indices and classification algorithms, calculated on Landsat data. Pre-flood, during flood, and post-flood satellite data were collected for in-depth flood investigation. The delineation of inundated areas was done using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and Water Ratio Index (WRI). In order to detect and compare flooded areas with water indices, the supervised maximum likelihood algorithm was also used for land use and land cover mapping.ResultsThe results of the investigation allowed for a flooded area and recession. The analysis revealed that the flooded area covered about 68% of the study area, and remained standing for seven weeks. We used the misclassified areas approach, as determined, using the classified results, to improve the results of the flooded areas, generated through the use of each of the 3 water indices. The result showed that the MNDWI images showed better accuracy of above 90%, which reflects the reliability of the results.ConclusionThis proposed remote sensing (RS) technique provides a basis for the identification of inundated areas with less misclassified areas, which enable an emergency response to be targeted, for newly flooded areas. Thus, the present study provides a novel rapid flood mapping perspective and provides a considerable contribution to flood monitoring.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shared needles are a possible iatrogenic and hematogenous inanimate vector of African Swine Fever virus (ASFV) in farm conditions. To evaluate that possible transmission, sixty, 4-week-old pigs were procured from an ASF free herd free. Upon arrival, pigs were randomly divided into two sets. Set 1 served as seeder pigs, and were randomly allocated to 4 groups. The other pigs were divided into 8 groups, and served as sentinels. Seeder pigs were oronasally challenged with ASFV at high (10(8) copy numbers/mL), moderate (10(6) copy numbers/mL) or low (10(1) copy numbers/mL) challenge titer, except a subgroup that remained unchallenged (negative control). At 7 days post challenge (peak viremia), all four seeder groups were intradermally and intramuscularly (IM) injected with a vaccine adjuvant (Diluvac Forte, MSD Animal Health, The Netherlands) using a needle-free device (IDAL 3G, MSD Animal Health, The Netherlands) and conventional needles, respectively. The same needle or needle-free device was then used to inject the same volume of adjuvant into set 2 (n = 48) pigs. All pigs were observed for clinical disease daily and assayed for the presence of ASFV DNA by quantitative PCR. All seeder groups developed viremia (except the control pigs). ASFV viremia was detected in all sentinel groups injected via the intramuscular route. Transmission rate from the IM route via conventional needles was positively correlated with virus titer in blood circulation of seeders. Sentinels intramuscularly exposed to needles from high titer challenged seeders displayed more severe and acute clinical disease compared to that of exposed to low titer challenged seeders. No viremia nor clinical signs were observed in the sentinel groups injected via the intradermal route. This study confirmed the hematogenous transmission of ASFV between pigs through needle-sharing.

TI  - Retrieval of cloud microphysical properties from Himawari-8/AHI infrared channels and its application in surface shortwave downward radiation estimation in the sun glint region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of cloud property retrieval and shortwave downward radiation (SWDR) estimation is essential for global radiation budget and climate change studies. Sun glint areas remain a challenge for the existing cloud and SWDR algorithms based on the visible channel since surface specular reflection has a sig-nificant impact on satellite retrieval. In this study, a set of algorithms for cloud detection and cloud microphysical parameter estimation were developed using infrared multichannel data from the new generation geostationary satellite Himawari-8 based on the random forest method. The results indicated that the cloud retrieval algorithm exhibited better performance in the sun glint areas where the official Himawari-8 products (cloud detection and cloud optical thickness) were overestimated. We developed a new SWDR estimation algorithm combining the radiative transfer model and machine learning techniques by considering the cloud properties from the cloud retrieval algorithm. The results indicated that the SWDR and cloud radiative forcing derived by the new algo-rithm were more consistent with those of the well-known radiation products Cloud and the Earth's Radiant Energy System than those estimated using the official-based cloud product, with decreases in the root mean square error of approximately 22% and 41%, respectively. The new algorithms effectively addressed sun glint contamination by providing more data coverage and exhibiting stable performance on a spatiotemporal scale.

TI  - The global spatial-temporal distribution and EOF analysis of AOD based on MODIS data during 2003-2021
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term global distribution study of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) has great significance for air pollution control, forest fire prevention and climate studies. The global spatial-temporal distribution and variation of the AOD at 550 nm are analyzed using AOD(550) product of Modis/Aqua during 2003-2021. The AOD(550) is also studied by Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis method. The results show that the distribution of AOD(550) has obvious regional and seasonal characteristics, and the interannual variation is distinct. The AOD(550) distribution with latitude/longitude is closely related to the distribution of population and aerosol natural source. The high-AOD(550) areas are mainly distributed in eastern Asia, southeast Asia, south Asia, the Middle East, northwestern Africa, central and western Africa, western waters of Africa and the Amazon region of South America; The AOD(550) seasonal distribution results are JJA > MAM > DJF > SON over globe, SON > DJF > (MAM approximate to JJA) over the southern hemisphere, and MAM > JJA > DJF > SON over the northern hemisphere, respectively. Moreover, the seasonal distribution characteristics varies in different regions especially over ocean and land. The results of interannual variation show an upward trend during 2005-2011, and fluctuates during 2012-2020. The annual mean AOD(550) over the northern hemisphere (0.187-0.207) is significantly higher than that of southern hemisphere (0.110-0.135), while the latter shows an increasing trend (0.0009/year). The EOF analysis results demonstrate the complexity of the AOD(550) global distribution. The annual mean results show the change trends of aerosols in different regions and find some special aerosol events. While the monthly mean results show that aerosols over ocean are mostly dominated by land sources (dust and biomass burning sources), and the ocean transport pattern presents an annual cycle.

TI  - Evaluating Mixing Height Estimations in the Western United States Using Satellite Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire smoke can be transported far from its origin, adversely impacting human health. The height of the atmospheric mixing layer, the near-surface layer of the troposphere in which turbulent convection leads to vertical mixing, is called the mixing height. Mixing height is a critical input in the smoke dispersion and air quality models used by agencies that monitor wildfires and air pollution. These models, coupled with forecaster expertise, are also used to determine if it is safe to execute a prescribed burn. In this paper, we derive mixing heights from two satellite datasets in order to assess mixing height forecasts produced by the National Weather Service (NWS) Fire Weather Program. Namely, we use Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) Vertical Feature Masks (VFM) and vertical water vapor profiles from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Our comparison indicates that NWS forecasts tend to underestimate CALIOP mixing heights with a median relative error of -13% and a mean relative error of -3.34%. Although MODIS and NWS mixing heights showed some agreement below 3 km, the lower vertical resolution of the MODIS estimates hindered a full comparison. We examine the discrepancies among mixing heights over wildfire smoke plumes determined by these methods and discuss biases and limitations. This work provides insight into potential bias patterns present in current mixing height forecasts and provides directions for future improvements in both NWS mixing height forecasts and satellite-based measurements of mixing height.

TI  - High-resolution carbon neutrality mapping and a heterogeneity analysis for China?s two typical megalopolises
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution carbon neutrality mapping is critical to guide carbon sequestration increase and carbon emissions reduction in spatial. Based on multiple sources of big data, which include both high-precision satellite data and field data, this study explored a new approach to simulate the spatial distribution of carbon neutrality and comprehensively compared the influencing factors of industry structure, land use and landscape for Beijing and Shanghai. The results indicate that carbon emissions in Shanghai are 1.8 times those of Beijing. Carbon sink in Beijing can only offset about 13% of carbon emissions, while Shanghai shows little carbon sink due to limited natural green land. Large areas in the west, north and northwest of Beijing show carbon sink, and high carbon emission values are mainly located in the southeast of the urban area. Shanghai shows a more intensive carbon emissions distribution, and the carbon emissions are widely distributed, covering the whole area except for Chongming island. Carbon emissions in urban regions generally show a decreasing trend from urban centre to suburb. Shanghai has much higher carbon neutrality pressure than Beijing, one reason for this is that Shanghai has very limited natural green land, and another reason is that Shanghai has many more industries, which generate a large amount of carbon emissions, and this amount is still increasing, although industry carbon emissions have obviously decreased since 2000. Landscape can influence carbon emissions but not as strongly as industry and land use structure. The landscape compactness of water, wetland and industry land in Shanghai is higher than Beijing, whereas all the other lands in Beijing are more compact. Finally, some policy implications are proposed for the two cities.

TI  - rsdtlib: Remote sensing with deep-temporal data library
T2  - SOFTWAREX
M3  - Article
AB  - For over a decade, satellite based remote sensing data have been intensively used for Deep Learning (DL) to help to identify Land Cover (LC) and Land Use (LU), and to detect urban and vegetation changes. Usually, these tasks are carried out with few samples or short and low-dimensional time series. In a recent study demonstrating urban change detection and monitoring, a windowed high - dimensional large time series (deep-temporal) was leveraged that not only considered a large amount of observations but also combined multiple modes for a higher temporal resolution. The software used in this approach for pre-processing, called rsdtlib, is described in the underlying work. It is made available to help others in the field of remote sensing to use this approach for Deep and Machine Learning (ML) solutions. The software is scalable to support a wide range of demands, including providing single observation samples, observation pairs, multiple modes, and the construction of windowed deep-temporal time series. Its output data is in a DL/ML training ready format and the software solution integrates well with existing remote sensing tools and services. The rsdtlib software is hosted on Github as an open source project to invite other researchers and practitioners in the remote sensing domain to utilize it.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Unearthing the decolonial environmental worldview (DEW): The case of Jamaica
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Environmentalism has been defined in multiple ways across the literature from a global perspective, both as an ideology and as a movement. However, the definitions of environmentalism have been either vaguely defined or broad with the most common characterization being that of conservation and preservation being at the heart of environmentalism. While there is considerable research on environmentalism in the industrialized world context, there is still limited research in developing regions, with a dearth of research in the Caribbean, hence the rationale for this research. The physical environments of former colonial states have always been subjected to exploitation, yet the way in which this resource has been used by local populations have not been characterized. This paper begins to examine the ways in which local populations of former colonized states view environmentalism. Taking a case study approach, Jamaica is used as the beginning point of reference. Using interviews with self-identified environmental activists, results indicate that there is, what is uniquely referred to in this paper, a decolonial environmental worldview (DEW) that exists among environmental activists. This worldview is grounded in a number of principles that are tied to the way in which the decolonization process continues to proceed in the Caribbean region. The paper postulates that this DEW framework has elasticity and should be applied to other postcolonial societies to determine its salience.

TI  - Extracting exotic annual grass phenology and climate relations in western US rangeland ecoregions
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This research builds upon the extensive body of work to model exotic annual grass (EAG) characteristics and invasion. EAGs increase wildland fire risk and intensifies wildland fire behavior in western U.S. rangelands. Therefore, understanding characteristics of EAG growth increases understanding of its dynamics and can inform rangeland management decisions. To better understand EAG phenology and spatial distribution, monthly weather (precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature) variables were analyzed for 24 level III ecoregions. This research characterizes EAGs' phenology identified by a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) threshold-based interpolation technique. An EAG phenology metric model was used to estimate a growing season dynamic for the years 2017-2021 for shrub and herbaceous land cover types in the western conterminous United States (66% of the area). The EAG phenology metrics include six growing season metrics such as start of season time, end of season time, and time of maximum NDVI during the growing season. The models' cross validation results for Pearson's r ranged from 0.88 to 0.95. Increased understanding of the effects that weather conditions have on EAG growth and spatial distribution can help land managers develop time-sensitive plans to protect entities deemed valuable to society like native habitat, wildlife, recreational areas, and air quality.

TI  - Land subsidence analysis using synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is considered a threat to developing cities and is triggered by several natural (geological and seismic) and human (mining, groundwater withdrawal, oil and gas extraction, constructions) factors. This research has gathered datasets consisting of 80 Sentinel-1A ascending and descending SLC images from July 2017 to July 2019. This dataset, concerning InSAR and PSInSAR, is processed with SARPROZ software to determine the land subsidence in Gwadar City, Balochistan, Pakistan. Later, the maps were created with ArcGIS 10.8. Due to InSAR's limitations in measuring millimeter-scale surface deformation, Multi-Temporal InSAR techniques, like PSInSAR, are introduced to provide better accuracy, consistency, and fewer errors of deformation analysis. This remote-based SAR technique is helpful in the Gwadar area; for researchers, city mobility is constrained and has become more restricted post-Covid-19. This technique requires multiple images acquired of the same place at different times for estimating surface deformation per year, along with surface uplifting and subsidence. The InSAR results showed maximum deformation in the Koh-i-Mehdi Mountain from 2017 to 2019. The PS-InSAR results showed subsidence up to -92 mm/year in ascending track and -66 mm/year in descending track in the area of Koh-i-Mehdi Mountain, and up to -48 mm/year in ascending track and -32 mm/year in descending track in the area of the deep seaport. From our experimental results, a high subsidence rate has been found in the newly evolving Gwadar City. This city is very beneficial to the country's economic development because of its deep-sea port, developed by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The research is associated with a detailed analysis of Gwadar City, identifying the areas with significant subsidence, and enlisting the possible causes that are needed to be resolved before further developments. Our findings are helpful to urban development and disaster monitoring as the city is being promoted as the next significant deep seaport with the start of CPEC.

TI  - Henrik Ibsen, Emperor Julian, and the crisis of faith in modernity
T2  - CLASSICAL RECEPTIONS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although it is one of his lesser known and performed plays, Henrik Ibsen considered Emperor and Galilean to be his Hovedverk-his 'main' or 'pivotal' work-in which he finally presented his positive worldview. It remains comparatively little studied in scholarship, though one scholar has recently argued that it is the key to unlocking his entire corpus. The present study builds upon past scholarship uncovering the works Ibsen drew upon in writing the play but goes beyond the mere question of its historical sources and accuracy to consider Ibsen's purpose for including the specific and precise pieces of historical texture he chose in the particular order and configuration he devised. In short, we aim to identify the creative purposes for his curating of the historical details he took from his sources. What emerges from our analysis is that, even when Ibsen is following the sources, his protagonist stands out as a strikingly modern figure, more at home in the nineteenth century than the fourth. Ibsen portrays his Julian struggling with doubt and uncertainty of a distinctly modern caste; he puts in his mouth criticisms of Christianity that stem from modernity rather than the historical figure; and he suggests that, just as Christianity had to prove victorious over paganism in late antiquity, so Christianity itself must be superseded in the modern era, though perhaps some aspects of it are worth preserving in the yet-to-arrive third empire.

TI  - Improving Wildfire Probability Modeling by Integrating Dynamic-Step Weather Variables over Northwestern Sichuan, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Wildfire occurrence is attributed to the interaction of multiple factors including weather, fuel, topography, and human activities. Among them, weather variables, particularly the temporal characteristics of weather variables in a given period, are paramount in predicting the probability of wildfire occurrence. However, rainfall has a large influence on the temporal characteristics of weather variables if they are derived from a fixed period, introducing additional uncertainties in wildfire probability modeling. To solve the problem, this study employed the weather variables in continuous nonprecipitation days as the "dynamic-step" weather variables with which to improve wildfire probability modeling. Multisource data on weather, fuel, topography, infrastructure, and derived variables were used to model wildfire probability based on two machine learning methods-random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The results indicate that the accuracy of the wildfire probability models was improved by adding dynamic-step weather variables into the models. The variable importance analysis also verified the top contribution of these dynamic-step weather variables, indicating the effectiveness of the consideration of dynamic-step weather variables in wildfire probability modeling.

TI  - Tracking the effects of the long-term changes on the coastal archaeological sites of the Mediterranean using remote sensing data: The case study from the northern shoreline of Nile Delta of Egypt
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change effects along with anthropogenic activities present the main factors that threaten the existence of heritage sites across the north Nile Delta of Egypt close to the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea. Observing the changes in the landscape close to the archaeological sites is an important issue for decision-makers in terms of reducing the negative impact of natural events and human activities. The coastal heritage sites are becoming strongly threatened by the rising sea level phenomena that will happen due to global warming. Focusing on the distribution of the archaeological sites, this study aims to detect the areas at risk of shoreline erosion or accretion in the northern shoreline of the Nile Delta. In this study, the changes in the northern shoreline of the Nile Delta were observed and calculated during the last hundred years based on the integration between the old topographic maps from surveys in 1900, 1925 and 1945, optical satellite images captured by Landsat in 1972, 1986 and 2000; Sentinel2 2021; and the Radar SRTM data. The results of this study showed that the changes were enormous with a great shoreline erosion process over the last 121 years recorded along the shoreline in the periods between 1900-1925, 1925-1945, 1945-1972, 1972-1986, 1986-2000 and 2000-2021. The areas eroded were about 5.3, 4.7, 5.6, 8.9, 2.5 and 5.4 km(2), respectively. Such negative movements caused the loss of two heritage sites, and the expected changes will lead to the loss of additional heritage sites in the next 500 years. Furthermore, a model was suggested for protecting the coastal heritage sites threatened by the risk of submergence. This study can help the decision-makers to detect the coastal archaeological sites at risk and create innovative solutions for protecting these irreplaceable heritage sites.

TI  - The utility of airborne hyperspectral and satellite multispectral images in identifying Natura 2000 non-forest habitats for conservation purposes
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerial hyperspectral and multispectral satellite data are the two most commonly used datasets to identify natural and semi-natural vegetation. However, there is no documented analysis based on data from several areas concerning the difference in the classification accuracy of non-forest Natura 2000 habitat with the use of aerial hyperspectral and satellite multispectral data. Also, there is no recommendation, on which habitat can be classified with sufficient accuracy using free multispectral images. This study aimed to analyse the difference in classification accuracy of Natura 2000 habitats representing: meadows, grasslands, heaths and mires between data with different spectral resolutions and the results utility for nature conservation compared to conventional maps. The analysis was conducted in five study areas in Poland. The classification was performed on multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) and hyperspectral HySpex (HS) images using the Random Forest algorithm. Based on the results, it can be stated that the use of HS data resulted in higher classification accuracy, on average 0.14, than using S2 images, regardless of the area of the habitat. However, the difference in accuracy was not constant, varying by area and habitat characterisation. Greater differences in accuracy were observed for areas where habitats were characterised by high alpha-diversity or beta-diversity. The HS and S2 data make it possible to create maps that provide a great deal of new knowledge about the distribution of Natura 2000 habitats, which is necessary for the management of protected areas. The obtained results indicate that by using S2 images it is possible to identify, at a satisfactory level, alluvial meadows and grassland. For heaths and mires, using HS data improved the results, but it is also possible to acquire general distribution of these classes, whereas HS images are obligatory for mapping salt, Molinia and lowland hay meadows.

TI  - Temporal remote sensing based soil salinity mapping in Indo-Gangetic plain employing machine-learning techniques
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the most active land degradation processes, affecting predominantly arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid regions and leading to decreased agricultural yields. The Indo-Gangetic plain, which includes the irrigated command areas with arid and semi-arid climatic conditions are severely affected by secondary soil salinization. Assessing the spatial and temporal extent as well as the severity of salinization is an important step for adoption of proper reclamation measures to boost agricultural productivity in the salt affected areas. The study was conducted with this background to evaluate the extent and severity of soil salinization in alluvial plains of Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh, India. In this study, the satellite data of 6 months from January 2019 to June 2019 were pre-processed and various spectral indices were generated in Google Earth Engine. Remote sensing techniques provides an ideal platform for addressing this problem at larger scales and thus we employed Sentinel-2 derived vegetation and salinity spectral indices for distinguishing temporal change in severity of soil salinization and map the salinity as a function of these indices for the entire study area. The time series salinity analysis showed that among the various spectral indices Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI) had a clear differentiation between slight, moderate and severe salinity class in the first three months of the study period and the Salinity Index II (SI_II) could differentiate for the first four months. Further, two machine learning algorithms namely Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were used to create soil salinity prediction models making use of the soil Electrical Conductivity (EC) values of 115 ground-sampling sites as the predictand variable and the optimal spectral indices as the predictor variables. Further, we evaluated the prediction ability of different models using 12 and 24 variables combination using R-2 and RMSE values. The prediction accuracy of the RF model was found to be slightly higher than that of the SVM model, and the spatial distribution pattern of soil salinity predicted by the two models were comparable. We concluded that spectral indices combined with machine learning techniques have the potential for low cost reliable spatial and temporal soil salinity distribution mapping for planning and implementation of salinity reclamation measures.

T2  - RSC ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an effective approach was developed to synthesize a novel, multifunctional ionic liquid nanocatalyst based on zeolite-Y with 4-methylpyridinium chloride (4-MePy-Cl) and calcium ions (Ca/4-MePy-IL@ZY). Then, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were produced inside the zeolite pores with the use of ultrasonic waves. XRD, FESEM, FT-IR, EDX-Map, TGA-DTA, VSM, BET, and atomic absorption techniques were used to identify the structure of the magnetic nanocomposite. Then, its catalytic activity in the one-pot synthesis of 2-aminothiazoles using trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) as a green supplier of halogen ions for intermediates was studied. To provide ideal conditions for the preparation of pure products, first, the one-pot reaction of acetophenone and thiourea in various solvents, different temperatures, and the presence of different amounts of nanocatalysts and the molar amount of TCCA was used. Next, the reaction was investigated in the one-pot preparation of 2-aminothiazole derivatives under optimal conditions. This method replaces iodine (I-2), a toxic reagent, for the first time with TCCA, a safe and sustainable source of halogen. The use of non-toxic solvent and a cheap, safe, recyclable nanocatalyst, quick reaction times, high efficiency, and ease of nanocatalyst separation with the aid of a magnet are additional benefits of this method. This has led to this procedure being classified as "green chemistry".

AB  - Evergreen forests are sensitive to climate change and their role in the exchange of carbon, water, and energy in terrestrial ecosystems is irreplaceable. The temporal and spatial variation of the evergreen forest is closely related to forest monitoring and management in China, which has a far-reaching impact on forest protection and sustainable development. However, the lack of annual fine resolution maps of evergreen forests limits our exploration of the evolution of the spatiotemporal patterns of evergreen forests. Therefore, it is necessary to timely and accurately maps evergreen forests with high spatial resolution. We used a new phenology index of NDVImax-NDVIwinter_max to identify evergreen forests at the 10-m scale. First, we mapped annual 2019 land cover types to obtain the forest mask. Second, we calculated the classification phenology index by extracting the difference between evergreen forests and deciduous forests in phenological characteristics. Finally, we extracted the evergreen forest in 2019 from the annual forest map based on the constructed phenological indicators. The kappa coefficient of our annual forest map for 2019 was 0.92, and the overall, producer and user accuracies were 97.98%, 90.09%, and 97.46%, respectively. The kappa coefficient of the annual evergreen forest map in 2019 was 0.98, and the overall, producer and user accuracies were 99.73%, 97.84%, and 99.68%, respectively. Our study shows that the new phenological index can identify and map evergreen forests on complex landforms dominated by evergreen-deciduous mixed forests, which can be applied to other regions and years in China. The results of this study have reference value for evaluating the spatial distribution and resource management of evergreen forests.

TI  - Combined use of urban Atlas and Corine land cover datasets for the implementation of an ecological network using graph theory within a multi-species approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological sustainability has recently risen to prominence in scientific research and management applications. Approaches to measuring ecological connectivity and their application to optimize ecological network (EN) design are powerful tools against landscape fragmentation and biodiversity loss.We focused on building an EN by identifying the most sensitive areas for ecological connectivity within the Reggio Calabria (Italy) metropolitan area. We also proposed a defragmentation scenario to improve the obtained EN.The CORINE Land Cover and the Urban Atlas 2018 were used to obtain a fine-scale representation of the study area. Ten terrestrial mammal species were used to model connectivity following a multi-species approach. Dispersal distance, patch size, and resistance to species movement were used to identify patches and corridors. Vegetational fractional coverage based on three years time series of Sentinel-2 red-edge normalized difference vegetation index was used to discriminate areas with higher naturalness. We used graph theory and connectivity metrics to test the EN's robustness and identify locations for restoration in a defragmentation scenario.The obtained EN, formed by three separate components, was composed of 724 arcs and 300 nodes with an average patch area of 27.04 ha. After the defragmentation hypothesis, the EN, formed by only one component, was composed of 771 arcs and 328 nodes with an average patch area of 26.82 ha.It was possible to analyze an EN's connectivity and evaluate the impact of a scenario intended to enhance multi-species connectivity. By comparing several connectivity metrics, we highlighted the potential of land in-terventions as a planning tool to enhance future ecological sustainability and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - High spatio-temporal resolution evapotranspiration estimates within large agricultural fields by fusing eddy covariance and Landsat based data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) are difficult to quantify at varying spatial and temporal scales. Eddy covariance (EC) methods estimate ET at high temporal resolutions (30 min), but with little knowledge regarding its spatial variation. In contrast, remote sensing-based methods using Landsat (7 and 8) provide high spatial resolution (30 m) ET with low temporal resolution (8 to16-days for 2 concurrent Landsat platforms). In this study, we developed a new algorithm to generate high spatio-temporal (daily 30 m resolution) ET (ETFUSE) within large agricultural fields by fusing eddy covariance and Landsat ET data. ETFUSE was compared with standardized Penman-Monteith ET (ETPM) and spline interpolated alfalfa reference fraction ET (ETRF) at six sites in the Continental United States. Spatial cross-correlation (using NDVI as a covariable), EC flux footprint modeling, and a source weighted scaling relationship between EC footprints and Landsat ET were used in fusion algorithm to generate ETFUSE. Using Ameriflux and Texas Water Observatory sites as testbeds, ET dynamics were found statistically similar for ETFUSE, ETRF, and ETPM for various land covers and growing seasons. Correlation coefficients for ETFUSE compared with ETPM were 0.77-0.96 at the study sites, during the growing seasons from 2016 to 2019. RMSEs and MAEs ranged between 0.35-0.96 mm d-1 and 0.28-0.51 mm d-1, respectively, for ETFUSE compared to ETPM. The ETFUSE algorithm is limited for use up to 81 km2 extents centered around EC towers. ETFUSE provides spatially variable ET, reflecting areas with low and high ET, useful in variable-rate irrigation systems for precision agriculture water management or in hydrologic models.

TI  - Alkaline taste sensation through the alkaliphile chloride channel in <i>Drosophila</i>
T2  - NATURE METABOLISM
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The authors identify a high-pH-activated chloride channel as a taste receptor responsible for the avoidance of alkaline foods in fruit flies, laying the groundwork for future research on alkaline taste sensation in other animals.The sense of taste is an important sentinel governing what should or should not be ingested by an animal, with high pH sensation playing a critical role in food selection. Here we explore the molecular identities of taste receptors detecting the basic pH of food using Drosophila melanogaster as a model. We identify a chloride channel named alkaliphile (Alka), which is both necessary and sufficient for aversive taste responses to basic food. Alka forms a high-pH-gated chloride channel and is specifically expressed in a subset of gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs). Optogenetic activation of alka-expressing GRNs is sufficient to suppress attractive feeding responses to sucrose. Conversely, inactivation of these GRNs causes severe impairments in the aversion to high pH. Altogether, our discovery of Alka as an alkaline taste receptor lays the groundwork for future research on alkaline taste sensation in other animals.

TI  - Projecting live fuel moisture content via deep learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Live fuel moisture content (LFMC) is a key environmental indicator used to monitor for high wildfire risk conditions. Many statistical models have been proposed to predict LFMC from remotely sensed data; however, almost all these estimate current LFMC (nowcasting models). Accurate modelling of LFMC in advance (projection models) would provide wildfire managers with more timely information for assessing and preparing for wildfire risk. Aims. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential for deep learning models to predict LFMC across the continental United States 3 months in advance. Method. Temporal convolutional networks were trained and evaluated using a large database of field measured samples, as well as year-long time series of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data and Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) meteorological data. Key results. The proposed 3-month projection model achieved an accuracy (root mean squared error (RMSE) 27.52%; R-2 0.47) close to that of the nowcasting model (RMSE 26.52%; R-2 0.51). Conclusions. The study is the first to predict LFMC with a 3-month lead-time, demonstrating the potential for deep learning models to make reliable LFMC projections. Implications. These findings are beneficial for wildfire management and risk assessment, showing proof-of-concept for providing advance information useful to help mitigate the effect of catastrophic wildfires.

TI  - Distinct mechanisms of chlorophyll-a blooms occur in the Northern Maluku Sea and Sulu Sill revealed by satellite data
T2  - DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a is the predominant phytoplankton pigment responsible for determining primary productivity. In the present study, we used satellite-based data of chlorophyll-a, surface wind, and precipitation from 2003 to 2019 to investigate the variability of chlorophyll-a in the northern Maluku Sea and the Sulu Sill and examine its generating mechanism. We found that the chlorophyll-a bloom in the northern Maluku Sea occurs during the southeast monsoon season, while in the Sulu Sill, the chlorophyll-a concentration is higher than that in the northern Maluku Sea and occurs throughout the year. In the northern Maluku Sea, the chlorophyll-a bloom is generated by coastal upwelling. The maximum southerly wind during the southeast monsoon generates the strongest offshore Ekman Mass Transport (EMT) in the northern Maluku Sea trig-gering coastal upwelling. However, the power spectra analysis of satellite-derived chlorophyll-a shows strong peaks and amplitudes at both fortnightly (MSf) and monthly (Mm) frequencies, indicating that tidal mixing is an important generating mechanism for chlorophyll-a blooms in the Sulu Sill. Shallow bathymetry in the Sulu Sill may aid tidal mixing in effectively transporting nutrients from the near bottom to the sea surface, increasing chlorophyll-a concentration.

TI  - 2019 M7.1 Ridgecrest earthquake slip distribution controlled by fault geometry inherited from Independence dike swarm
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Faults often form through reactivation of pre-existing structures, developing geometries and mechanical properties specific to the system's geologic inheritance. Competition between fault geometry and other factors (e.g., lithology) to control slip at Earth's surface is an open question that is central to our knowledge of fault processes and seismic hazards. Here we use remote sensing data and field observations to investigate the origin of the 2019 M7.1 Ridgecrest, California, earthquake rupture geometry and test its impact on the slip distribution observed at Earth's surface. Common geometries suggest the fault system evolved through reactivation of structures within the surrounding Independence dike swarm (IDS). Mechanical models testing a range of fault geometries and stress fields indicate that the inherited rupture geometry strongly controlled the M7.1 earthquake slip distribution. These results motivate revisiting the development of other large-magnitude earthquake ruptures (1992 M7.3 Landers, 1999 M7.1 Hector Mine) and tectonic provinces within the IDS.Faults responsible for the 2019 M7.1 Ridgecrest, California earthquake likely evolved through reactivation of pre-existing Independence dike swarm structures. The inherited rupture geometry strongly controlled the earthquake slip distribution.

TI  - Assessing the impacts of historical and future land-use/cover change on habitat quality in the urbanizing Lhasa River Basin on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a hotspot for biodiversity conservation in the world. Understanding the impacts of land-use/cover change (LUCC) on natural habitat quality (NHQ) in terms of both historical and future urbani-zation and ecological restoration is important, but existing studies have only focused on the total impacts of historical LUCC on NHQ on the TP. This study aims to assess both historical and future impacts by taking the Lhasa River Basin (LRB) as an example. We quantified the LUCC from 2000 to 2020 based on remote sensing data, and simulated the LUCC during 2020-2030 under the scenarios of business-as-usual (BAU) and cropland conservation. Finally, we used the habitat quality model to assess the impacts of LUCC on NHQ. We found that the improved NHQ due to ecological restoration exceeded the deteriorated NHQ due to urban expansion, resulting in the total NHQ showing an increasing trend in the LRB during 2000-2020. Under the BAU scenario, NHQ was projected to remain stable. However, under the cropland protection scenario, NHQ was projected to deteriorate due to the large-scale occupation of natural habitats by urban expansion, which will be prominent in Chengguan District (NHQ will decrease by 22.52%). To protect both cropland and natural habitats, limiting urban sprawl and implementing ecological protection and restoration are needed.

TI  - Forty-year spatio-temporal dynamics of agricultural climate suitability in China reveal shifted major crop production areas
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies measuring climate change effects on crop production and development usually focus on extreme tem-perature and heat indicators while ignoring water requirements and land suitability. In this study, spatially continuous differences in climate data from 1980 to 2017 using meteorological station data and elevation data as covariates were analysed with the ANUSPLIN software. The analysis integrated the effects of water and thermal resources on the agricultural production layout. Cover remote sensing of China's multi-period land use showed that the centre of gravity of the suitable planting area of winter wheat, spring maize, and medium rice has changed according to climate conditions. It is anticipated that other arable land reserve resources, including unused lands, grasslands, and forest land, in sensitive areas such as the Taklamakan Desert, Loess Plateau, and Hexi Corridor could be rationally developed. This study provides valuable references for agricultural zoning adjustment and agricultural development policy formulation.

TI  - Etiologic fractions in patients of hepatocellular carcinoma in India with and without a background of cirrhosis: a multi-centric study
T2  - HEPATOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundHepatocellular cancer (HCC) typically arises in the background of cirrhosis. The epidemiology of HCC has changed in recent years due to availability of newer antivirals, changing life-styles and greater possibility for early detection. We undertook a multicentric national sentinel surveillance for liver cirrhosis and HCC to assess the attributable risk factors for the development of HCC, both with and without a background of cirrhosis.MethodsData from January 2017 till August 2022 from hospital-based records of eleven participating centers were included. Diagnosed cases of cirrhosis [radiological (multiphase and/or histopathological] and HCC [as per AASLD 2018] were included. History of significant alcohol intake was elicited by AUDIT-C questionnaire.ResultsAltogether 5798 enrolled patients were assessed, of which 2664 patients had HCC. The mean age was 58.2 +/- 11.7 years and 84.3% (n = 2247) were males. Diabetes was found in over a third of those with HCC (n = 1032;39.5%). The most common etiology of HCC was NAFLD (n = 927;35.5%) followed by viral hepatitis B and C and harmful levels of alcohol. Among those with HCC, 27.9% (n = 744) had no cirrhosis. Higher proportion of cirrhotic HCC patients had alcohol as an etiological factor as compared to non-cirrhotic (17.5 vs. 4.7%, p <= 0.001). NAFLD was an etiological factor for a higher proportion of non-cirrhotic HCC patients as compared to cirrhotic HCC (48.2 vs. 30.6%, p <= 0.001). Diabetics more commonly had non-cirrhotic HCC (50.5 vs. 35.2%). The following factors were associated with an occurrence of cirrhotic HCC: male gender (OR 1.372 and 95% CI 1.070-1.759), age above 60 years (OR 1.409 and 95% CI 1.176-1.689), HBV (OR 1.164 and 95% CI 0.928-1.460), HCV (OR 1.228 and 95 CI 0.964-1.565) and harmful consumption of alcohol (OR 3.472 and 95% CI 2.388-5.047). The adjusted odds of non-cirrhotic patients having NAFLD was 1.553 (95% CI 1.290-1.869).ConclusionThis large multi-centric study demonstrates that NAFLD is the most important risk factor for development of both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic HCC in India and has overtaken viral hepatitis. Awareness campaigns and large-scale screening are required to reduce the high burden of NAFLD-related HCC in India.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper empirically explores the extent to which European cities are on track to sustainable development by examining the environmental performance of a large sample of cities observed during the last two decades. The paper builds on the Environmental Kuznets Curve framework and leverages satellite data to build a set of environmental indicators as varied and as granular as possible. Evidence suggests that European cities are, on average, on track to sustainable development, meaning that the contribution of their economic growth to environmental degradation is already negative or close to becoming so. The paper also examines Transnational City Networks as accelerators of environmental transition. The results suggest that cities participating in such networks anticipate the transition with respect to their peers.

TI  - Recalls Associated with Food Allergens and Gluten in FDA-Regulated Foods from Fiscal Years 2013 to 2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Allergens are one of the leading causes of food recalls in the US. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforces requirements relating to major food allergens (MFAs) and gluten-free labeling to ensure food safety for allergic and celiac patients, respectively. Violative foods are subject to recalls. In this study, recall data for FDA-regulated foods were analyzed for fiscal years (FYs) 2013-2019 to identify trends and root causes asso-ciated with 1471 food allergen and gluten recalls. Of the 1471 recalls, 1415 recalls were due to MFAs, 34 recalls were due to gluten-free labeling violation and 23 recalls involved other allergens. Recalls due to MFAs overall increased during the study period with a peak incidence in FY 2017. MFA recall health hazard classifications were assessed as Class I (51.2%), Class II (45.5%), and Class III (3.3%). A majority of MFA recalls involved one allergen (78.8%). Milk was the most common MFA involved in MFA recalls (37.5%), followed by soy (22.5%) and tree nuts (21.6%). Almond, anchovy, and shrimp were the most common allergens recalled within the MFA groups of tree nuts, fish, and Crustacean shellfish, respectively. About 97% of MFA recalls involved one product category and among them, the category of 'bakery products, dough, bakery mixes and icings' ranked first (367 recalls), followed by the category of 'chocolate and cocoa products' (120 recalls). Labeling-associated errors accounted for 71.1% of MFA recalls with known root causes (914 out of 1286). It is important for the industry to develop and implement appropriate allergen controls to reduce the number of MFA recalls.

TI  - Evaluation of the influenza-like illness sentinel surveillance system: A national perspective in Tanzania from January to December 2019
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends periodic evaluations of influenza surveillance systems to identify areas for improvement and provide evidence of data reliability for policymaking. However, data on the performance of established influenza surveillance systems are limited in Africa, including Tanzania. We aimed to assess the usefulness of the Influenza surveillance system in Tanzania and to ascertain if the system meets its objectives, including; estimating the burden of disease caused by the Influenza virus in Tanzania and identifying any circulating viral strains with pandemic potential. MethodologyFrom March to April 2021, we collected retrospective data through a review of the Tanzania National Influenza Surveillance System electronic forms for 2019. Furthermore, we interviewed the surveillance personnel about the system's description and operating procedures. Case definition (ILI-Influenza Like Illness and SARI-Severe Acute Respiratory Illness), results, and demographic characteristics of each patient were obtained from the Laboratory Information System (Disa*Lab) at Tanzania National Influenza Center. The United States Centers for disease control and prevention updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems were used to evaluate the system's attributes. Additionally, the system's performance indicators (including turnaround time) were obtained by evaluating Surveillance system attributes, each being scored on a scale of 1 to 5 (very poor to excellent performance). ResultsA total of 1731 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were collected from each suspected influenza case in 2019 from fourteen (14/14) sentinel sites of the influenza surveillance system in Tanzania. Laboratory-confirmed cases were 21.5% (373/1731) with a predictive value positive of 21.7%. The majority of patients (76.1%) tested positive for Influenza A. Thirty-seven percent of patients' results met the required turnaround time, and 40% of case-based forms were incompletely filled. Although the accuracy of the data was good (100%), the consistency of the data was below (77%) the established target of >= 95%. ConclusionThe overall system performance was satisfactory in conforming with its objectives and generating accurate data, with an average performance of 100%. The system's complexity contributed to the reduced consistency of data from sentinel sites to the National Public Health Laboratory of Tanzania. Improvement in the use of the available data could be made to inform and promote preventive measures, especially among the most vulnerable population. Increasing sentinel sites would increase population coverage and the level of system representativeness.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - The geophysical properties of snow are essential to study the mountain snow/glacier system and can be used as an indicator for any related hazard. In this study, an attempt has been made to model the geophysical properties of snow, such as dielectric, density, and wetness using the Sentinel-1 dual-polarized SLC product. A state-of-the-art inversion model has been developed using Sentinel-1 derived stokes parameters to estimate snow dielectric and subsequently used to model density and wetness employing Looyega's and Denoth's equations. The proposed inclusion of stokes parameters in the inversion model has significantly predicted the results. The respective modeled and in-situ snow dielectric, density, and wetness show a good coefficient of determination (R-2 > 0.7) with 95% confidence. Utilizing the field-measured values, the estimated root mean squared error (RMSE) of snow dielectric, density, and wetness, is 0.26, 0.08 g/cm(3), and 0.84, respectively. The comparison of the proposed model with some of the existing models reflects its good efficiency in predicting the snow geophysical parameters.

TI  - Evaluating resampled and fused Sentinel-2 data and machine-learning algorithms for mangrove mapping in the northern coast of Qeshm island, Iran
T2  - NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests, as an essential component of the coastal zones in tropical and subtropical areas, provide a wide range of goods and ecosystem services that play a vital role in ecology. Mangroves are globally threatened, disappearing, and degraded. Consequently, knowledge on mangroves distribution and change is important for effective conservation and making protection policies. Developing remote sensing data and classification methods have proven to be suitable tools for mapping mangrove forests over a regional scale. Here, we scrutinized and compared the performance of pixel-based and object-based methods under Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms in mapping a mangrove ecosystem into four main classes (Mangrove tree, mudflat, water, and sand spit) using resampled and fused Senti-nel-2 images. Additionally, landscape metrics were used to identify the differences between spatial patterns obtained from different classification methods. Results showed that pixel-based classifications were influ-enced heavily by the effect of salt and pepper noise, whereas in object-based classifications, boundaries of land use land cover (LULC) polygons were smoother and visually more appealing. Object-based clas-sifications, with an excellent level of kappa, distinguished mudflat and sand spit from each other and from mangrove better than the pixel-based classifications which obtained a fair-to-good level of kappa. RF and SVM performed differently under comparable circumstances. The results of landscape metrics comparison presented that the classification methods can be affected on quantifying area and size metrics. Although the results supported the idea that fused Sentinel images may provide better results in mangrove LULC classification, further research needs to develop and evaluate various image fusion approaches to make use of all Sentinel's fine resolution images. Our results on the mapping of mangrove ecosystems can contribute to the improvement of management and conservation strategies for these ecosystems being impacted by human activities.

TI  - Metabolomics for in situ monitoring of attached<i> Crassostrea</i><i> gigas</i> and<i> Mytilus</i><i> edulis:</i> Effects of offshore wind farms on aquatic organisms
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - While offshore wind power has support from countries around the world, studies show that offshore wind farms (OWFs) may affect marine organisms. Environmental metabolomics is a high-throughput method that provides a snapshot of an organism's metabolic state. To elucidate the effects of OWFs on aquatic organisms, we studied, in situ, Crassostrea gigas and Mytilus edulis attached within and outside of OWFs and their reef areas. Our results show that epinephrine, sulphaniline, and inosine 5 '-monophosphate were significantly increased and L-carnitine was significantly reduced in both Crassostrea and Mytilus species from the OWFs. This may be related to immune response, oxidative stress, energy metabolism and osmotic pressure regulation of aquatic organisms. Our study shows that active selection of biological monitoring methods for risk assessment is necessary and that metab-olomics of attached shellfish is useful in elucidating the metabolic pathways of aquatic organisms in OWFs.

TI  - Effects of Hudson River Stressors on Atlantic Tomcod: Contaminants and a Warming Environment
T2  - REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE & AQUACULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - The Hudson River (HR) Estuary has a long history of pollution with a variety of contaminants including PCBs and dioxins. In fact, 200 miles of the mainstem HR is designated a U.S. federal Superfund site, the largest in the nation, because of PCB contamination. The tidal HR hosts the southernmost spawning population of Atlantic tomcod, Microgadus tomcod, and studies revealed a correlation between exposure of juveniles to warm water temperature during summer to abundance of spawning adults of the same cohort in the following winter. Further, a battery of mechanistically linked biomarkers, ranging from the molecular to the population levels, were significantly impacted from contaminant exposures of the HR tomcod population. In response to xenobiotic insult, the HR tomcod population developed resistance to PCB and TCDD toxicity resulting from a deletion in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor2 (AHR2) gene. Furthermore, RNA-Seq analysis of global gene expression demonstrated that effects of the AHR2 polymorphism were far more pervasive than anticipated. The most highly PCB-contaminated sediments in the upper HR were dredged between 2009 and 2015 with the objective of lowering PCB concentrations in fishes in the lower HR. Success of the remediation project has been controversial. These observations suggest that tomcod provides an informative model to evaluate the efficacy of HR PCB remediation efforts on downriver fish populations and possible interactive effects between contaminant exposure and a warming environment.

TI  - Cropland abandonment mapping at sub-pixel scales using crop phenological information and MODIS time-series images
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland abandonment is a common land-use change with mixed impacts on the environment and rural eco-nomic development. Prevalent small family farms and excessive land fragmentation result in cropland aban-donment processes that are often gradual and spatially dispersed. These difficulties limit the ability to apply previous remote sensing mapping methods of cropland abandonment to areas with complex underlying surfaces, where mixed pixels and spectral aliasing problems arise. To meet the demands of broad-scale and high-accuracy abandoned cropland mapping, we developed the PCRRSBS -CV model by combining the phenology-based cropland retirement remote sensing (PCRRS) model with the coefficient of variation (CV) and tilled soil frac-tion (BS). This method combines information regarding crop phenology with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series images. The PCRRS model was used to estimate changes in spectral metrics parameters during the process of cropland abandonment. Additionally, the dead fuel index and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were employed to estimate the BS in mixed pixels (according to crop type). We predicted that use of the BS as the weighting coefficient for the PCRRS model would reduce interference from the mixed pixel problem, while spatial heterogeneity could be reduced by dividing the research area into regional units. Use of the CV of the NDVI time series with phenological information highlights the volatility of crop growth periods and helps to eliminate disturbances associated with woodlands and grasslands. Finally, we demonstrated this method in the Loess Plateau of China and a portion of central Europe; we verified its accuracy using high-resolution images from Google Earth. Our algorithm demonstrated overall accuracy of 82.2 % and can extract cropland abandonment information as little as 20 % of a pixel. The overall root mean square error (RMSE) was controlled below 15 %. In summary, the high accuracy achieved by this method enables the monitoring of cropland abandonment dynamics on a large scale.

TI  - Segmented continuously varying pulse interval sequence design for extremely high-resolution spaceborne sliding spotlight SAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an active microwave remote sensing device used to obtain high-resolution SAR images.With the development of SAR, extremely high-resolution SAR (i.e. resolution reaching 0.1 m) plays an increasingly important role in applications such as target recognition. In extremely high-resolution spaceborne SAR, the variation of slant range history becomes extremely severe, resulting in echoes of interest overlapping with transmitted pulses and nadir echoes when transmitting the pulses at constant pulse intervals (PIs), further causing the loss of echo data. Although a continuously varying pulse interval (CVPI) system can expand the tolerance of slant range variation to some extent, overlap still occurs when the variation in slant range exceeds a certain threshold. Thus, this paper proposes segmented CVPI sequence design methods to solve the data acquisition problem in the situation of severe variation in slant range history. The timing diagram- and strip layering diagram-based segmented CVPI sequence design methods, which are suitable for the acquisition of spaceborne SAR data with any variation of slant range, are given. The characteristics of the two methods are analysed. Finally, several computer simulations indicate that the echoes generated by the proposed methods are not overlapped, which verifies the validity of the proposed methods.

TI  - Feature-aware aggregation network for remote sensing image cloud detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is a key pre-processing step for optical satellite remote sensing images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most widely used and powerful cloud detection techniques in recent years, featuring the fusion of different levels of feature maps. However, existing methods use feature cascading, element addition, or element multiplication to fuse directly, ignoring the similarities and differences between features and their contribution to the detected cloud regions, resulting in a large amount of noise being introduced into the fusion process. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a feature-aware aggregation network (FAANet), which can make full use of valuable information for cloud detection through feature enhancement and feature aggregation. The feature enhancement module (FEM) consists of a high-level feature enhancement module (HFEM) and a low-level feature enhancement module (LFEM). HFEM is used to enhance the advanced semantic features to supplement the cloud features lost during the recovery of high-resolution feature maps; LFEM is used to enhance the image spatial detail features to further refine the predicted cloud maps. In addition, a feature aggregation module (FAM) is designed to selectively aggregate coded block features, decoded block features, and enhanced semantic features through a new aggregation mechanism to compliment the features diluted by up-sampling and improve the integrity of the generated cloud maps. Experimental results on three open-source cloud detection datasets and self-built Landsat-8 cloud detection dataset with higher spatial resolution show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance under different evaluation metrics. The advantages of the method proposed in this paper for saliency image segmentation are verified and provide a reference for other computer vision tasks. Code is available at .

TI  - The Association of Guideline-Concordant Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Melanoma at Minority-Serving Hospitals
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundMinority-serving hospitals (MSHs) have been associated with lower guideline adherence and worse outcomes for various cancers. However, the relationship among MSH status, concordance with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) guidelines, and overall survival (OS) for patients with cutaneous melanoma is not well studied.MethodsThe National Cancer Database was queried for patients diagnosed with T1a*, T2, and T3 melanoma between 2012 and 2017. MSHs were defined as the top decile of institutions ranked by the proportion of minorities treated for melanoma. Based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, guideline-concordant care (GCC) was defined as not undergoing SLNB if thickness was < 0.76 mm without ulceration, mitosis >= 1/mm(2), or lymphovascular invasion (T1a*), and performing SLNB for patients with intermediate thickness melanomas between 1.0 and 4.0 mm (T2/T3). Multivariable logistic regressions examined associations with GCC. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests were used to evaluate OS between MSH and non-MSH facilities.ResultsOverall, 5.9% (N = 2182/36,934) of the overall cohort and 37.8% of minorities (n = 199/527) were managed at MSHs. GCC rates were 89.5% (n = 33,065/36,934) in the overall cohort and 85.4% (n = 450/527) in the minority subgroup. Patients in the overall cohort (odds ratio [OR] 0.85; p = 0.02) and the minority subgroup (OR 0.55; p = 0.02) were less likely to obtain GCC if they received their care at MSHs compared with non-MSHs. Minority patients receiving care at MSHs had a decreased survival compared with those treated at non-MSHs (p = 0.002).ConclusionsAdherence to SLNB guidelines for melanoma was lower at MSHs. Continued focus is needed on equity in melanoma care for minority patients in the United States.

TI  - A deep unrolling pansharpening method based on spectral consistency and double spatial priors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, deep learning (DL) pansharpening methods have become the most popular solution for acquiring high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. However, most DL-based methods design the task as black-box network architecture, ignoring the physical meaning of individual network modules. Such a network structure is difficult to extract sufficient spatial details or lacks interpretability. To address this problem, we propose a neural network pansharpening method with interpretable deep spatial detail injection based on the assumption of spectral consistency and double spatial detail priors in HRMS images. First, we assume that the HRMS image consists of a spectral and spatial component together. Spectral and partial spatial details are obtained by upsampling the multispectral (MS) images. Next, a variational model is constructed for image fusion from the LRMS image and the panchromatic (PAN) image to the HRMS image.The alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) algorithm is then used to optimally solve the variational model to obtain the spatial detail that needs to be injected into the MS image. Finally, the model optimization solving process is expanded into a corresponding neural network structure using the idea of deep unrolling. Each network module corresponds to the solving step of the iterative algorithm. Our proposed pansharpening method is therefore interpretable in terms of spatial detail injection. In our experiments, we find that the proposed method achieves an optimal balance between spectral and spatial quality, and has a strong generalization capability over different datasets, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed pansharpening method.

TI  - A comparative study on intra-annual classification of invasive saltcedar with Landsat 8 and Landsat 9
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of exotic saltcedar along riparian corridors has dramatically altered the landscape structure and ecological function of riparian habitats in the western United States. The development of accurate and reproducible mapping methods with remote sensing plays an indispensable role in the timely monitoring of saltcedar, re-evaluating its ecological functions, and establishing effective control measures. The utmost challenge for achieving this goal is manifested as the lack of time series of remote sensing images to capture the saltcedar phenology adequately. To this end, the newly available Landsat 9 images, combined with its counterpart of Landsat 8, offer a precious opportunity to compensate for the temporal image shortage. To understand Landsat 9 in the saltcedar classification and to discover helpful information for its application, this study presents the first attempt to classify saltcedar using intra-annual Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 images. We adopted two machine learning algorithms, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), to compare the performance of Landsat 9 and Landsat 8 for intra-annual saltcedar classification. In addition, we investigated the respective contribution of each spectral band to the overall performance and identified the optimal time window for saltcedar classification. The results indicated that the difference in classification performance between Landsat 9 and Landsat 8 was insignificant. The shortwave infrared bands associated with both Landsat 8 & 9 have contributed most to the process of saltcedar identification. Image acquired in July, November, and December yielded better results than other months for saltcedar classification. It is concluded that Landsat 8 & 9 constellation has the potential to refine saltcedar classification accuracy on larger spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - The optimization of XGBoost model and its application in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations estimation based on MODIS data in the Guanzhong region, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Atmospheric pollution affects air quality and can pose a serious risk to public health. Traditional PM2.5 monitoring is limited by the uneven distribution of ground stations, which makes it difficult to obtain spatially continuous and accurate PM2.5 concentrations information. Using aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved from satellite remote sensing to study the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of PM2.5 can accurately predict the PM2.5 concentrations in a wide range and provide a basis for atmospheric pollution prevention and control. Considering the spatio-temporal correlations among the data, this study uses AOD data, introduces geographic location data, temporal data, meteorological data, and elevation data to construct an Optimized XGBoost (O-XGBoost) model with spatial and temporal characteristics to estimate PM2.5 concentrations in the Guanzhong region from 2019 to 2021 and analyse its spatial and temporal distribution characteristics. The results show that compared with the random forest (RF) and XGBoost models, the O-XGBoost model has higher estimation accuracy, with R-2, RMSE, and MAE of 0.873, 11.460 mu g . m(-3), and 8.061 mu g . m(-3), respectively. The estimation of PM2.5 concentrations based on the O-XGBoost model makes up for the uneven distribution of ground monitoring stations and improves the estimation accuracy.

TI  - Estimation of soil and crop residue parameters using AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed ground cover information and efficient modelling approaches are needed for estimating soil properties from hyperspectral remote sensing (HRS) data. With the objective to estimate both soil and crop residue (CR) parameters using HRS data from the airborne visible-infrared imaging spectrometer-next generation (AVIRIS-NG) sensor, soil and CR samples were collected from 101 locations in the Western Catchment of Chilika lagoon, India. Nonlinear unmixing and two chemometric models were examined for estimating basic soil properties, nutrient contents, soil and CR wetness, and masses of fresh crop residue (FCR) and dry crop residue (DCR). Both soil and CR parameters showed wide variation with FCR and DCR masses varying from 0 to 13.33 Mg ha(-1) and 0 to 10.16 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Soils were relatively dry with an average gravimetric water content (?(g)) of 14% whereas CR moisture content (?(c)) ranged from 2.4 to 93%. Estimated coefficient of determination (R-2) values in the validation datasets varied from 0.51 for soil base saturation to 0.91 for exchangeable Mg+2 using soil spectra obtained through linear polynomial unmixing of AVIRIS-NG spectra. The R-2 values were more than 0.70 for clay content, soil organic carbon (SOC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and several exchangeable cations although the CR parameters showed lower R-2 values than soil parameters. With the chemometric models calibrated, high spatial resolution maps for soil and CR parameters were generated, which offer a continuous mapping capability for such parameters. Extensive soil property data also allowed us to evaluate SOC sequestration capability of different land use systems. A critical value of 1/25 for the SOC/Clay content ratio was observed for most of our agricultural land uses and degraded landscapes showed lower SOC/Clay ratios. Thus, high spatial resolution soil and crop residue parameters may be accurately assessed for large areas with multiple land use and soil cover conditions.

T2  - DEVELOPING ECONOMIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation tanks are classic examples of common pool resources that have been traditionally managed by local communities. However, the tank performance under community management in Tamil Nadu has declined over the last few decades and threatened the local livelihoods. This study investigates the effect of community management on irrigation tank performance using village-level two-period data collected across 100 tank-intensive villages in Tamil Nadu. To address the problems encountered in the subjective measures, this study adopts an objective assessment method using the satellite imageries of Landsat-7 to derive tank performance measures. Satellite-derived data are then incorporated with the field survey data and used in the analysis. The results show that community participation in tank management has a significant positive impact on tank performance, suggesting that strengthening traditional institutions in irrigation tank management can be a viable strategy for reviving tank irrigation systems.

T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - IntroductionCompletion lymph node dissection (CLND) is no longer recommended routinely in the treatment of melanoma. CLND omission may understage patients for whom the distinction between stage IIIA and IIIB-C could alter adjuvant therapy recommendations. The aim of this study is to determine if stage migration has occurred with the declining use of CLND.MethodsPatients with clinically node-negative >= T1b cutaneous melanoma were identified from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2012 to 2018. CLND utilization and changes in AJCC staging were analyzed. Patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone were compared with those undergoing SLNB + CLND.ResultsOverall, 68,933 patients met inclusion criteria and 60,536 underwent SLNB, of which 9031 (14.9%) were tumor positive. CLND was performed in 3776 (41.8%). Patients undergoing CLND were younger (58 versus 62 years, p < 0.0001) and more likely male (61.5% versus 57.9%, p = 0.0005). Patients were more likely to have an N classification >N1a if they received SLNB + CLND (36.8%) versus SLNB alone (19.3%), p < 0.0001. This translated to a small difference in stage IIIA patients between groups (SLNB alone 34.0%, SLNB + CLND 31.8%, p < 0.0001). Of the patients with T1b/T2a tumors who would be upstaged from IIIA to IIIC with identification of additional positive nodes, IIIC incidence was only slightly higher after SLNB + CLND compared with SLNB alone (4.4% versus 1.1%, p < 0.0001). CLND utilization dramatically decreased from 59% in 2012 to 12.6% in 2018, p < 0.0001. However, the incidence of stage IIIA disease for all patients remained stable over the 7-year study period.ConclusionsWhile the utilization of CLND after positive SLNB has declined dramatically in the last 7 years, stage migration that may affect adjuvant therapy decisions has not occurred to a clinically meaningful degree.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaporative fraction (EF) is the ratio of latent heat (LE in W m(-2)) to available energy at the land surface. It can aid in partitioning the Sun's energy available at the Earth's surface into surface energy fluxes to understand land-atmosphere interactions as well as monitoring Evapotranspiration and terrestrial drought conditions. In this study, the feasibility of estimating instantaneous, diurnal, and daily EF with minimal satellite and meteorological inputs based on the temperature difference-vegetation index framework is explored in South Florida, United States (US). The model performance is assessed against the ground observations collected at three flux stations between 2008 and 2011. It was found that the energy balance closure was improved by 9% at the long hydroperiod marsh site (i.e. US-Elm) and 6% at the short hydroperiod marsh site (i.e. US-Esm) after water heat storage (W) correction was applied on energy fluxes since W is more important than soil heat flux (G) for wetland ecosystems. The results further indicated that the model produced accurate EF estimates and performed the best on diurnal, then instantaneous, and lastly daily periods. Overall, the model can be used to produce spatially continuous EF and ET maps since the flux towers are no longer active.

TI  - IDCF: information distribution composite feature for multi-modal image registration
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic registration of multi-modal remote sensing data is a challenging task. Due to the significant nonlinear radiation difference and noise between multi-mode images, the register points extracted by traditional gradient algorithms (such as SIFT) have low repetition rate and poor feature similarity, which makes it difficult to register multi-mode images. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a method which is called Multi-modal Image Matching Based on Information Distribution Composite Feature (IDCF). Firstly, an adaptive information entropy map (AIEM) is proposed. AIEM not only describes the information distribution characteristics of the image, but also the distribution of the contour features of the image. Compared with traditional contour feature extraction operators, AIEM extraction results are clearer, more comprehensive and more detailed. In addition, AIEM is more robust to NRD compared to gradient, which is greatly affected by NRD. Then, IDCF extracts corner points on AIEM as feature points because corner points have better repeatability. After that, a composite feature description model based on maximum information index map (MIIM) and information trend graph (ITM) is defined. MIIM describes the main change direction of image information and ITM describes the overall change trend of image information. Finally, the similarity criterion SAD is used to match the feature points. The proposed IDCF aims to capture the structural similarity between images and has been tested with a variety of optical, Lidar, SAR, and map data. The results show that IDCF is robust against complex NRD outperforms the advanced algorithms (i.e. RIFT, PSO-SIFT and OS-SIFT) in matching performance.

TI  - Satellite-based evidence highlights a considerable increase of urban tree cooling benefits from 2000 to 2015
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree planting is a prevalent strategy to mitigate urban heat. Tree cooling efficiency (TCE), defined as the temperature reduction for a 1% tree cover increase, plays an important role in urban climate as it regulates the capacity of trees to alter the surface energy and water budget. However, the spatial variation and more importantly, temporal heterogeneity of TCE in global cities are not fully explored. Here, we used Landsat- based tree cover and land surface temperature (LST) to compare TCEs at a reference air temperature and tree cover level across 806 global cities and to explore their potential drivers with a boosted regression tree (BRT) machine learning model. From the results, we found that TCE is spatially regulated by not only leaf area index (LAI) but climate variables and anthropogenic factors especially city albedo, without a specific variable dominating the others. However, such spatial difference is attenuated by the decrease of TCE with tree cover, most pronounced in midlatitude cities. During the period 2000- 2015, more than 90% of analyzed cities showed an increasing trend in TCE, which is likely explained by a combined result of the increase in LAI, intensified solar radiation due to decreased aerosol content, increase in urban vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and decrease of city albedo. Concurrently, significant urban afforestation occurred across many cities showing a global city-scale mean tree cover increase of 5.3 +/- 3.8% from 2000 to 2015. Over the growing season, such increases combined with an increasing TCE were estimated to on average yield a midday surface cooling of 1.5 +/- 1.3 degrees C in tree-covered urban areas. These results are offering new insights into the use of urban afforestation as an adaptation to global warming and urban planners may leverage them to provide more cooling benefits if trees are primarily planted for this purpose.

TI  - The relationships between patient safety culture and sentinel events among hospitals in Saudi Arabia: a national descriptive study
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel events (SEs) can result in severe and unwanted outcomes. To minimize the fear of sentinel events reporting and the occurrence of sentinel events, patient safety culture improvements within healthcare organizations is needed. To our knowledge, limited studies explored the relationships between patient safety culture and sentinel events on a local level and no research has been conducted at the national level in Saudi Arabia.ObjectivesThis study aimed to explore the relationships between the patient safety culture and the reported-SEs on a national level during the year 2020 in Saudi hospitals.MethodsThis was a descriptive study. We utilized two data sources (the reported-SEs and the patient safety culture survey) that were linked using hospitals information. To explore the relationships between patient safety culture and reported-SEs rates, we performed descriptive statistics, a test of independence, post-hoc analysis, correlation analysis, and multivariate regression and stepwise analyses.ResultsThe highest positive domain scores in patient safety culture domains in the Saudi hospitals (n = 366) were "Teamwork Within Units" (80.65%) and "Organizational learning-continuous improvement" (80.33%), and the lowest were "Staffing" (32.10%) and "Nonpunitive Response to Error" (26.19%). The highest numbers of reported-SEs in 103 hospitals were related to the contributory factors of "Communication and Information" (63.20%) and "Staff Competency and Performance" (61.04%). The correlation analysis performed on 89 Saudi hospitals showed that higher positive patient safety culture scores were significantly associated with lower rates of reported-SEs in 3 out of the 12 domains, which are "Teamwork Within Units", "Communication Openness", and "Handoffs and Transitions". Multivariate analyses showed that "Handoffs and Transitions", "Nonpunitive Response to Error", and "Teamwork Within Units" domains were significant predictors of the number of SEs. The "Staff Competency and Performance" and "Environmental Factors" were the most contributory factors of SEs in the number of significant correlations with the patient safety culture domains.ConclusionThis study identified patient safety culture areas of improvement where hospitals in Saudi Arabia need actions. Our study confirms that a more positive patient safety culture is associated with lower occurrence of sentinel events. To minimize the fear of sentinel events reporting and to improve overall patient safety a culture change is needed by promoting a blame-free culture and improving teamwork, handoffs, and communication openness.

TI  - Non-sentinel node metastasis prediction during surgery in breast cancer patients with one to three positive sentinel node(s) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our aim was to develop a tool to accurately predict the possibility of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis (NSLNM) during surgery so that a surgeon might decide the extent of further axillary lymph node dissection intraoperatively for patients with 1-3 positive sentinel lymph node(s) (SLN) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After retrospective analysis of Asan Medical Center (AMC) database, we included 558 patients' records who were treated between 2005 and 2019. 13 factors were assessed for their utility to predict NSLNM with chi-square and logistic regression with a bootstrapped, backward elimination method. Based on the result of the univariate analysis for statistical significance, number of positive SLN(s), number of frozen nodes, Progesterone Receptor (PR) positivity, clinical N stage were selected for the multivariate analysis and were utilized to generate a nomogram for prediction of residual nodal disease. The resulting nomogram was tested for validation by using a patient group of more recent, different time window at AMC. We designed a nomogram to be predictive of the NSLNM which consisted of 4 components: number of SLN(s), number of frozen nodes, PR positivity, and clinical N stage before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) value of this formula was 0.709 (95% CI, 0.658-0.761) for development set and 0.715 (95% CI, 0.634-0.796) for validation set, respectively. This newly created AMC nomogram may provide a useful information to a surgeon for intraoperative guidance to decide the extent of further axillary surgery.

TI  - Targeting of rainwater harvesting structures using geospatial tools and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in the semi-arid region of Rajasthan (India)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Burgeoning population growth and subsequent demand for freshwater, besides competition among irrigation, domestic, and industrial sectors, coupled with a changing climate, have necessitated prudent and effective management of water resources. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is considered one of the most effective strategies for water management. However, the location and design of RWH structures are essential for proper implementation, operation, and maintenance. An attempt has been made in this study to locate the most suitable site for RWH structure and design using one of the robust multi-criteria decision analysis techniques, viz. analytic hierarchy process, using geospatial tools in the Gambhir watershed, Rajasthan, India. High-resolution Sentinel-2A data and a digital elevation model of the Advanced Land Observation Satellite were used in this study. Five biophysical parameters, viz. land use and land cover, slope, soil texture, surface runoff, and drainage density, were considered to identify suitable locations for RWH structures. It was observed that runoff is the prime factor in determining the location of RWH structures compared to other parameters. It was revealed that 75.54 km(2) (13% of the total area) was very highly suited for the construction of RWH structures, while 114.56 km(2) (19%) was highly suitable. A total of 43.77 km(2) (7%) of land was determined to be unsuitable for the construction of any type of RWH structure. Farm ponds, check dams, and percolation ponds were suggested for the study area. Furthermore, Boolean logic was used to target a particular type of RWH structure. The study indicated that a total of 25 farm ponds, 14 check dams, and 16 percolation ponds can be constructed at identified locations in the watershed. Water resource development maps of the watershed generated using an analytical approach would be useful for policymakers and hydrologists for targeting and implementing RWH structures in the study watershed.

TI  - Modeling spatio temporal pattern of urban land use and land cover change by using geospatial technology: a case of Shambu Town, Horo Guduru Wallaga, Ethiopia
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Metropolitan and town planners in Ethiopia are dealing with high racial tensions concerned about the high rate of urban expansion which is posing a challenge to get efficient urban planning. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate urban land use and land cover (LULC) changes in Shambu Town over the past three decades and to forecast the futurity of urban expansion. The LULC classification was performed by using supervised classification with maximum likelihood from Landsat images of 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. The rapid rise of the urban population is a source of urban expansion. According to the study, every LULC type in the study area has been transformed from one LULC to another types. The result shows that agriculture, forest, and grassland land cover declined by 217.2 ha, 39 ha, and 54.8 ha, respectively, in the study area from 1990 to 2020. However, the built-up area increased by 311 ha within the past three decades. However, over the study period, agriculture and grassland both decreased by 474.7 ha and 66.3 ha, respectively. From LULC types of the study area, built-up area and forest land will be expanded by an area of 1064.3 ha and 170.5 ha respectively, in the coming 2050. Based on the finding of this study, we suggested that urban planners, land administration and management offices, environmental protection offices, and other stakeholders can investigate the impacts of LULC change and urban expansion on natural resources and ecological service systems, as well as the impact on people's livelihoods in the future for natural and land resource management.

TI  - Semi-automatic extraction of land degradation processes using multi sensor data by applying object based classification technique
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A semi-automated method has been developed for the extraction of land degradation processes using multi sensor data by applying an object-based classification. The object-based approach creates homogenous objects, which is the key component of this classification. The study utilized optical satellite (Landsat-8), microwave (RISAT-1, SAR) and Cartosat-1 digital elevation model (DEM) over Kanpur Dehat district, Uttar Pradesh, and Surendranagar district, Gujarat, India. The objects were created using Shepherd segmentation algorithm. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to classify the degraded and no apparent degradation (NAD) objects based on the three seasons (rabi, summer, and kharif) Landsat-8 bands. Degraded objects were further classified into salinity, forest water erosion, and water logging using brightness index based on Landsat-8, proximity analysis near the river channel using RISAT-1, and low-lying area using DEM, respectively. The digitally generated results were validated with manual digitized desertification status maps (DSM) published by Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad, India. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for Kanpur Dehat and Surendranagar districts were found 84.67%, 0.79 and 72.33%, 0.60, respectively. This study was carried out based on integrated analysis of different satellites (optical, microwave, and DEM). The advantage of newly designed framework offers less chance of mixing and narrowing down of the area for further classification with better accuracy. The developed framework is based on analytical approach, which was tested and implemented in the Python environment with efficient computing power. The study illustrates that the developed approach is independent of climatic-topographic conditions and executed over pilot study sites, which could be extended over larger regions of the land use/land cover for land degradation mapping.

TI  - Axillary lymph node recurrence following wire-directed sentinel lymph node dissection for breast cancer patients with biopsy-proven axillary metastases prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy at a safety net medical center
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAlthough sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is feasible, axillary management for patients with pretreatment biopsy-proven axillary metastases and who are clinically node-negative after NAC (ycN0) remains unclear. This retrospective study was performed to determine the rate of axillary lymph node recurrence for such patients who had wire-directed (WD) SLND. MethodsPatients treated with NAC from 2015 to 2020 had axillary nodes evaluated by pretreatment ultrasound. Core biopsies were done on abnormal nodes, and microclips were placed in nodes during biopsy. For patients with biopsy-proven node metastases who received NAC and were ycN0 by clinical exam, WD SLND was done. Patients with negative nodes on frozen section had WD SLND alone; those with positive nodes had WD SLND plus axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). ResultsOf 179 patients receiving NAC, 62 were biopsy-proven node-positive pre-NAC and ycN0 post-NAC. Thirty-five (56%) patients were node-negative on frozen section and had WD SLND alone. Twenty-seven (43%) patients had WD SLND + ALND. Forty-seven patients had postoperative regional node irradiation. With median follow-up of 40 months, there were recurrences in 4 (11%) of 35 patients having WD SLND and 5 (19%) of 27 having WD SLND + ALND, but there was only one axillary lymph node recurrence, identified by CT scan. ConclusionsAxillary node recurrence was very uncommon after WD SLND for patients who had pretreatment biopsy-proven node metastases and were ypN0 after NAC. These patients would be unlikely to derive clinical benefit from the addition of completion ALND to SLND.

TI  - Improved Hungarian algorithm-based task scheduling optimization strategy for remote sensing big data processing
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - With the development of remote sensing technology and computing science, remote sensing data present typical big data characteristics. The rapid development of remote sensing big data has brought a large number of data processing tasks, which bring huge challenges to computing. Distributed computing is the primary means to process remote sensing big data, and task scheduling plays a key role in this process. This study analyzes the characteristics of batch processing of remote sensing big data. This paper uses the Hungarian algorithm as a basis for proposing a novel strategy for task assignment optimization of remote sensing big data batch workflow, called optimal sequence dynamic assignment algorithm, which is applicable to heterogeneously distributed computing environments. This strategy has two core contents: the improved Hungarian algorithm model and the multi-level optimal assignment task queue mechanism. Moreover, the strategy solves the dependency, mismatch, and computational resource idleness problems in the optimal scheduling of remote sensing batch processing tasks. The proposed strategy likewise effectively improves data processing efficiency without increasing computer hardware resources and without optimizing the computational algorithm. We experimented with the aerosol optical depth retrieval algorithm workflow using this strategy. Compared with the processing before optimization, the makespan of the proposed method was shortened by at least 20%. Compared with popular scheduling algorithm, the proposed method has evident competitiveness in acceleration effect and large-scale task scheduling.

TI  - Beaver pond identification from multi-temporal and multi- sourced remote sensing data
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The maintenance and restoration of wetland habitat is a priority conservation action for most waterfowl and other wetland-dependent species in North America. Despite much progress in targeting habitat management in staging and wintering areas, methods to identify and target high-quality breeding habitats that result in the greatest potential for wildlife are still required. This is particularly true for species that breed in remote, inaccessible areas such as the American black duck, an intensively managed game bird in Eastern North America. Although evidence suggests that black ducks prefer productive, nutrient-rich waterbodies, such as beaver ponds, information about the distribution and quality of these habitats across the vast boreal forest is lacking with accurate identification remaining a challenge. Continuing advancements in remote sensing technologies that provide spatially extensive and temporally repeated information are particularly useful in meeting this information gap. In this study, we used multi-source remotely sensed information and a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process to map the spatial distribution of beaver ponds in Ontario. The use of multi-source data, including a Digital Elevation Model, a Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Image, and RadarSat 2 Polarimetric data, enabled us to identify individual beaver ponds on the landscape. Our model correctly identified an average of 83.0% of the known beaver dams and 72.5% of the known beaver ponds based on validation with an independent dataset. This study demonstrates that remote sensing is an effective approach for identifying beaver-modified wetland features and can be applied to map these and other wetland habitat features of interest across large spatial extents. Furthermore, the systematic acquisition strategy of the remote sensors employed is well suited for monitoring changes in wetland conditions that affect the availability of habitats important to waterfowl and other wildlife.

This study explored the impacts of flooding along selected reaches of the Padma River by analysing flood dynamics and bank erosion using Sentinel SAR-C and MSI image datasets, hydrologic, and field data. It involved mapping and validating the spatiotemporal distribution of flooding, erosion, and water turbulence. There were three phases of onset and recession of flooding between 1st July and 4th October, 2020. Image analysis showed that the highest floodwater extents during these phases were 14%, 20%, and 15% of the study area on 1st July, 6th August, and 23rd September, respectively. It was also found that a total of 92.8 km(2) of riverbank area was eroded between 6th April and 7th November. The distribution of water turbulence and bank erosion showed concurrence in most parts while exceptions were also observed. From June to October 2020, Pearson's correlation coefficients for monthly hydrologic data and erosion estimates were calculated to be (a) 0.791 between average river discharge and total eroded area, (b) 0.956 between maximum river discharge and total eroded area, (c) 0.741 between average water level and total eroded area, (d) 0.991 between average river discharge and average water level, (e) 0.519 between average water level and total rainfall, and (f) 0.484 between average water level and total rainfall. GIS analysis showed a total of 297 educational and healthcare facilities were flooded while 15 facilities were lost to bank erosion. A total of 489.75 km of road and 60.03 km(2) of settlements were inundated.

TI  - Comparing global and local land cover maps for ecosystem management in the Himalayas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As a breakthrough in geographical data science, two high-resolution (10m) global land cover products were published by the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) and European Space Agency (ESA). Yet, the accuracy and applicability of those maps have not been diagnosed in the Himalayas which is characterized by multifunctional and heterogenous landscapes. We compared the ESA and ESRI land cover products in terms of classification performance, overall accuracy, spatial agreement, and applicability in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan region by taking a case of multifunctional landscapes of Nepal. In addition, we generated a local land cover map in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment based on Sentinel-2 imagery for 2020 and compared it with the ESRI and ESA land cover products. The overall accuracy of ESRI product was higher (87.3%) than ESA (71.2%) and GEE-generated (73%) map. Shrubland, grassland and forestland were found to be the most common source of confusion in land cover mapping for both products. The spatial agreement (pixel match) of ESA and ESRI products was found to be about 62% of the landscape area, indicating substantial agreement between both products for land cover classification. The ESRI product is more reliable in mapping the Himalayan region. However, we suggest that the global land cover products must be flexible to further improvement by incorporating local topography, vegetation phenotype, spatial heterogeneity, and temporal dynamics of landscape and ecosystem services, particularly in the Himalayas.

TI  - STEEP: A remotely-sensed energy balance model for evapotranspiration estimation in seasonally dry tropical forests
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Improvement of evapotranspiration (ET) estimates using remote sensing (RS) products based on multispectral and thermal sensors has been a breakthrough in hydrological research. In large-scale applications, methods that use the approach of RS-based surface energy balance (SEB) models often rely on oversimplifications. The use of these models for Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF) has been challenging due to incompatibilities between the assumptions underlying those models and the specificities of this environment, such as the highly contrasting phenological phases or ET being mainly controlled by soil-water availability. We developed a RS-based SEB model from a one-source bulk transfer equation, called Seasonal Tropical Ecosystem Energy Partitioning (STEEP). Our model uses the plant area index to represent the woody structure of the plants in calculating the moment roughness length. We included the parameter kB- 1 and its correction using RS soil moisture in the calculation of the aerodynamic resistance for heat transfer. Besides, lambda ET caused by remaining water availability in endmembers pixels was quantified using the Priestley-Taylor equation. We implemented the algorithm on Google Earth Engine, using freely available data. To evaluate our model, we used eddy covariance data from four sites in the Caatinga, the largest SDTF in South America, in the Brazilian semiarid region. Our results show that STEEP increased the accuracy of ET estimates without requiring any additional climatological information. This improvement is more pronounced during the dry season, which, in general, ET for these SDTF is overestimated by traditional SEB models, such as the Surface Energy Balance Algorithms for Land (SEBAL). The STEEP model had similar or superior behavior and performance statistics relative to global ET products (MOD16 and PMLv2). This work contributes to an improved understanding of the drivers and modulators of the energy and water balances at local and regional scales in SDTF.

TI  - Glancing through the debris disk: Photometric analysis of DE Boo with CHEOPS☆
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims. DE Boo is a unique system, with an edge-on view through the debris disk around the star. The disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System, was reported to extend from 74 to 84 AU from the central star. The high photometric precision of the Characterising Exoplanet Satellite (CHEOPS) provided an exceptional opportunity to observe small variations in the light curve due to transiting material in the disk. This is a unique chance to investigate processes in the debris disk.Methods. Photometric observations of DE Boo of a total of four days were carried out with CHEOPS. Photometric variations due to spots on the stellar surface were subtracted from the light curves by applying a two-spot model and a fourth-order polynomial. The photometric observations were accompanied by spectroscopic measurements with the 1m RCC telescope at Piszkesteto and with the SOPHIE spectrograph in order to refine the astrophysical parameters of DE Boo.Results. We present a detailed analysis of the photometric observation of DE Boo. We report the presence of nonperiodic transient features in the residual light curves with a transit duration of 0.3-0.8 days. We calculated the maximum distance of the material responsible for these variations to be 2.47 AU from the central star, much closer than most of the mass of the debris disk. Furthermore, we report the first observation of flaring events in this system.Conclusions. We interpreted the transient features as the result of scattering in an inner debris disk around DE Boo. The processes responsible for these variations were investigated in the context of interactions between planetesimals in the system.

TI  - A quantitative trait GWAS on lens thickness identifies novel risk loci on <i>PTPRM</i> in the narrow angle individuals susceptible to PACG
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose PACG is one of the leading causes of blindness where lens thickness is a major risk factor for narrow-angle individuals. To our knowledge, no literature has been reported on candidate gene for lens thickness as a quantitative trait (QT). Here, we performed a genome-wide association analysis on lens thickness in the narrow-angle individuals. Materials and Methods We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the narrow angle individuals to investigate comprehensive genetic insights on lens thickness. Results In QT-GWAS, we identified 145 genome-wide suggestive significant loci in the discovery cohort. Subsequently, we observed 13 SNPs that showed statistical significance around the region of PTRRM. Regional association analysis for top significant genotyped variants identified PTPRM as the most likely candidate for increased LT. Integrative bioinformatic analyses confirmed that the associated genomic region has potential regulatory roles for modulating transcription as enhancers. In the replication cohort, the sentinel genotype SNP was further associated significantly (P-value =0.000448) with high LT individuals. In both cohorts, the T allele of rs1941137 in the PTPRM gene indicates as a risk allele for the increased LT. Conclusion In this study, we discovered evidence of a genomic association between chromosomal areas around the PTPRM and increased lens thickness, resulting in a narrow angle. The regulatory components corresponding to PTPRM variations might have a role in the thicker lens. We report that the genomic region near PTPRM, a gene of potential interest, is associated with increased lens thickness.

TI  - Disrupted montane forest recovery hinders biodiversity conservation in the tropical Andes
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Andean montane forests are biodiversity hotspots and large carbon stores and they provide numerous ecosystem services. Following land abandonment after centuries of forest clearing for agriculture in the Andes, there is an opportunity for forest recovery. Field-based studies show that forests do not always recover. However, large-scale and long-term knowledge of recovery dynamics of Andean forests remains scarce. This paper analyses tropical montane forest recovery trajectories over a 15-year time frame at the landscape and tropical Andean scale to inform restoration planning.Methods We first detect "potential recovery" as areas that have experienced a forest transition between 2000 and 2005. Then, we use Landsat time series analysis of the normalized difference water index (NDWI) to classify four "realized recovery" trajectories ("ongoing", "arrested", "disrupted" and "no recovery") based on a sequential pattern of 5-yearly Z-score anomalies for 2005-2020. We compare these results against an analysis of change in tree cover to validate against other datasets.Results Across the tropical Andes, we detected a potential recovery area of 274 km(2) over the period. Despite increases in tree cover, most areas of the Andes remained in early successional states (10-25% tree cover), and NDWI levelled out after 5-10 years. Of all potential forest recovery areas, 22% showed "ongoing recovery", 61% showed either "disrupted" or "arrested recovery", and 17% showed "no recovery". Our method captured forest recovery dynamics in a Peruvian arrested succession context and in landscape-scale tree-planting efforts in Ecuador.Main conclusions Forest recovery across the Andes is mostly disrupted, arrested or unsuccessful, with consequences for biodiversity recovery and provision of ecosystem services. Low-recovery areas identified in this study might be good candidates for active restoration interventions in this UN Decade on Restoration. Future studies could determine restoration strategies and priorities and suggest management strategies at a local planning scale across key regions in the biodiversity hotspot.

TI  - Machine-learning-estimation of high-spatiotemporal-resolution chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration using multi-satellite imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a concentration for quantifying phytoplankton biomass is commonly used as an indicator for evaluating the trophic level of lakes and water quality. This research aimed to develop a high spatiotemporal-resolution model for the retrieval of chlorophyll-a in inland water. Firstly, the machine learning based models considering Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) images were applied to estimate chlorophyll-a concentrations (R-2 = 0.873 and 0.822, respectively). The spatiotemporal fusion was performed to fuse the OLCI and MSI chlorophyll-a images with low temporal resolution but fine spatial-resolution, and with high temporal resolution but coarse spatial-resolution. The random forest was applied to fuse images from two distinct sensors, and to refine the spatial resolution of OLCI estimations to be the same as those of Sentinel-2 MSI. Results showed that the spatiotemporal fusion can estimate dense-temporal 10 m spatial resolution chlorophyll-a concentration in the Tsengwen Reservoir (Root-Mean-Square Error, RMSE = 1.25-1.47 mu g L-1). The spatiotemporal fusion model was effectively applied to determine high spatiotemporal-resolution chlorophyll-a measurements in the aquatic system.

TI  - Oil spills detection from SAR Earth observations based on a hybrid CNN transformer networks
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spills are the main threats to marine and coastal environments. Due to the increase in the marine transportation and shipping industry, oil spills have increased in recent years. Moreover, the rapid spread of oil spills in open waters seriously affects the fragile marine ecosystem and creates environmental concerns. Effective monitoring, quick identification, and estimation of the volume of oil spills are the first and most crucial steps for a successful cleanup operation and crisis management. Remote Sensing observations, especially from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors, are a very suitable choice for this purpose due to their ability to collect data regardless of the weather and illumination conditions and over far and large areas of the Earth. Owing to the relatively complex nature of SAR observations, machine learning (ML) based algorithms play an important role in accurately detecting and monitoring oil spills and can significantly help experts in faster and more accurate detection. This paper uses SAR images from ESA's Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite to detect and locate oil spills in open waters under different environmental conditions. To this end, a deep learning framework has been presented to identify oil spills automatically. The SAR images were segmented into two classes, the oil slick and the background, using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision transformers (ViT). Various scenarios for the proposed architecture were designed by placing ViT networks in different parts of the CNN backbone. An extensive dataset of oil spill events in various regions across the globe was used to train and assess the performance of the proposed framework. After the detection performance assessments, the F1-score values for the standard DeepLabV3+, FC-DenseNet, and U-Net networks were 75.08 %, 73.94 %, and 60.85, respectively. In the combined networks models (combination of CNN and ViT), the best F1-score results were obtained as 78.48 %. Our results showed that these hybrid models could improve detection accuracy and have a high ability to distinguish oil spill borders even in noisy images. Evaluation metrics are increased in all the combined networks compared to the original CNN networks.

TI  - Structural basis for SMAC-mediated antagonism of caspase inhibition by the giant ubiquitin ligase BIRC6
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Certain inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family members are sentinel proteins that prevent untimely cell death by inhibiting caspases. Antagonists, including second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC), regulate IAPs and drive cell death. Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 6 (BIRC6), a giant IAP with dual E2 and E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, regulates programmed cell death through unknown mechanisms. We show that BIRC6 directly restricts executioner caspase-3 and-7 and ubiquitinates caspase-3,-7, and-9, working exclusively with noncanonical E1, UBA6. Notably, we show that SMAC suppresses both mechanisms. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of BIRC6 alone and in complex with SMAC reveal that BIRC6 is an antiparallel dimer juxtaposing the substrate-binding module against the catalytic domain. Furthermore, we discover that SMAC multisite binding to BIRC6 results in a subnanomolar affinity interaction, enabling SMAC to competitively displace caspases, thus antagonizing BIRC6 anticaspase function.

TI  - Comparative assessment of surface soil moisture simulations by the coupled wcm-iem vs. data-driven models using the Sentinel 1 and 2 satellite images
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Radar satellite imagery has been widely used to obtain soil moisture (SM) estimates of high accuracy. However, obtaining the best accuracy of SM estimates requires investigating the contribution of vegetation canopy to the accuracy of retrieved SM. We used the Integral Equation Model (IEM) coupled with the Water Cloud Model (WCM) (herein referred to as the IWCM) to estimate surface SM using radar and multi-spectral images. Accordingly, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images corresponding to calibration (2017) and validation (2016) periods were used to obtain VV-polarized radar data (where radar transmits and receives vertical polarization), Leaf Area Index, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index at the SM measurement stations. SM measurements from eleven stations in the Walnut Gulch watershed, USA, were used as in situ data. Investigating the relationship between the simulation error on various variables revealed a dependence of error on precipitation received on the day before soil moisture measurement was carried out. Next, two data-driven models (DDMs), i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Regression Tree (RT), were used to obtain SM estimates at stations using radar signal and vegetation indices as their input features. Accordingly, the RT model showed the best performance with validation error of 0.071 m(3)/m(3) and 0.074 m(3)/m(3) for the LAI and NDVI-based models, respectively. Based on the RT results, precipitation of the previous day, followed by the Julian date had the highest values of importance in predicting the the soil moisture. The RT model was consequently used to calculate regionalized estimates for the watershed due to its higher accuracy in estimating SM in the measurement stations. The results indicated the feasibility of using DDMs to obtain regionalized surface SM measurements at the watershed scale.

TI  - Optical remote sensing (Sentinel-3 OLCI) used to monitor dissolved organic carbon in the Lena River, Russia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past decades the Arctic has experienced stronger temperature increases than any other region globally. Shifts in hydrological regimes and accelerated permafrost thawing have been observed and are likely to increase mobilization of organic carbon and its transport through rivers into the Arctic Ocean. In order to better quantify changes to the carbon cycle, Arctic rivers such as the Lena River in Siberia need to be monitored closely. Since 2018, a sampling program provides frequent in situ observations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) of the Lena River. Here, we utilize this ground truth dataset and aim to test the potential of frequent satellite observations to spatially and temporally complement and expand these observations. We explored all available overpasses (similar to 3250) of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on Sentinel-3 within the ice-free periods (May - October) for four years (2018 to 2021) to develop a new retrieval scheme to derive concentrations of DOC. OLCI observations with a spatial resolution of similar to 300 m were corrected for atmospheric effects using the Polymer algorithm. The results of this study show that using this new retrieval, remotely sensed DOC concentrations agree well with in situ DOC concentrations (MAPD=10.89%, RMSE=1.55 mg L-1, r(2)=0.92, n=489). The high revisit frequency and wide swath of OLCI allow it to capture the entire range of DOC concentrations and their seasonal variability. Estimated satellite-derived DOC export fluxes integrated over the ice-free periods of 2018 to 2021 show a high interannual variability and agree well with flux estimates from in situ data (RMSD=0.186 Tg C, MAPD=4.05%). In addition, 10-day OLCI composites covering the entire Lena River catchment revealed increasing DOC concentration and local sources of DOC along the Lena from south to north. We conclude that moderate resolution satellite imagers such as OLCI are very capable of observing DOC concentrations in large/wide rivers such as the Lena River despite the relatively coarse spatial resolution. The global coverage of remote sensing offers the expansion to more rivers in order to improve our understanding of the land-ocean carbon fluxes in a changing climate.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Subsidence induced by groundwater (GW) in the plains of Zanjan and Qazvin provinces in northwestern parts of Iran has impacted various infrastructures. Hence, investigating the study area to identify the risky zones and identifying the vulnerable members of power transmission towers (PTTs) are required by policy-makers. This study investigated the impact of GW depletion on land subsidence and its effect on PTTs in the Zanjan and Qazvin provinces. Subsidence maps were acquired via time series analysis by performing a small baseline subset on Sentinel-1 (2017-02-23 till 2019-02-25) satellite data. Results indicate maxima values of 132 mm/years and 80 mm/years subsidence rates in line-of-sight direction for Qazvin and Zanjan provinces, respectively. Observed GW shows a rapid decline of piezometric head of 13.2 m for Qazvin province. Furthermore, GW head drop, coupled with the dominance of fine-grained soils in Qazvin province, increases the probability of plain-wide subsidence. Employing a finite element method analysis on two commonly utilized PTTs in the region illustrated such vulnerable members (bottom legs and first transverse plane) under support settlement conditions. However, the T-30 tower, by mitigating the stress to more members of the tower, performed superior in most subsidence scenarios. It is recommended to implement new policies such as avoiding risky zones for developing PTTs, installing T-30 towers instead of DC towers in obstructed routes, and continuous monitoring of threatened PTTs.

TI  - Monitoring of sustainable land management using remotely sensed vegetation cover and variable tolerable soil erosion targets across New South Wales, Australia
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of land management practices is vital for the protection of soil resource and the environment. Here, we present a new approach to monitor sustainable land management using widely available remotely sensed data, such as MODIS fractional vegetation cover data. The method is based on the concept of maintaining sufficient vegetation cover to prevent hillslope water erosion beyond tolerable soil erosion targets. The targets were based on long-term natural erosion rates plus a small constant and are spatially and temporally variable, not static as in most reported studies to date. Where vegetation cover is more than that required to prevent nontolerable erosion under normal conditions for that calendar month, the site (pixel) is deemed to be managed sustainably. Monthly indices are then combined to form a yearly sustainable land management index (SLMI), presented as raster maps with a spatial resolution of 100 m. We explored this new method through case studies over New South Wales (NSW), Australia, over the period 2010 to 2021, with a particular examination of 2020. Results were further stratified by land uses and natural resource management regions, which revealed useful data and trends. The method is offered as an example of the potential use of readily available vegetation cover data to quantitatively assess and monitor levels of sustainable land management across landscapes. We believe it overcomes the limitations of previous methods to monitor vegetation cover and land management from remote-sensed data alone. Other users are encouraged to adapt the broad approach to meet local requirements.

TI  - A series of the first 13 combined Magseed and Magtrace cases in a single centre in regional Victoria
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe standard journey for a patient with impalpable breast cancer wishing to undergo breast-conserving surgery involves placement of a guidewire and lymphoscintigraphy pre-operatively. Access to these procedures is limited in the regional centres, this scheduling can require overnight stays away from home and can delay theatre which can increase patient distress. The Sentimag technology uses magnetism for localisation of preoperatively inserted Magseeds (for impalpable breast lesions) and Magtrace (for sentinel node biopsy), avoiding guidewire placement and nuclear medicine. This study evaluates the first 13 cases using this combined technique by a single specialist breast surgeon in a regional centre. MethodsThirteen consecutive patients were enrolled with ethics approval. Magseeds were placed under ultrasound guidance preoperatively, and Magtrace was injected at the time of pre-operative consultation. ResultsThe median age of patients was 60 (range 27-78). The average distance from hospital was 81.63 km (2.8-238 km). The average operating time was 1h54m (range 1 h 17 m-2 h 39 m) and the mean total journey time was 8h54m (range 6-23 h). The earliest time-out was 8:40 am. Re-excision rate was 23% (n = 3), however, in each re-excision case the lesions were in the axilla, were small (<15 mm) and were in patients with dense breasts on mammography. There were no significant adverse outcomes. ConclusionIn this preliminary study Sentimag localisation appears to be safe and reliable when used in combination. Re-excision rates were only slightly higher than reported in the literature and predicted to downtrend with ongoing learning curve.

TI  - Trends of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Rural Area in Sentinel Community-Based Surveillance-China, December 2022 to January 2023
T2  - CHINA CDC WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In late 2022, a rapid transmission of Omicron variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred throughout China. The purpose of this study was to provide the latest data and evaluate trends of SARS-CoV-2 infection in rural China among the community population.Methods: Data on SARS-CoV-2 infection among approximately 90,000 participants in rural China were collected by the National Sentinel Community-Based Surveillance (NSCS) system. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection (defined as positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or antigen) twice weekly from December 16, 2022 to January 12, 2023. The daily average of newly positive rate and its estimated daily percentage change were calculated to describe the national and regional trends of SARS-CoV-2 infection in rural China. Results: In rural China, the daily average new positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection peaked at 4.79% between December 20-22, 2022 and then decreased to 0.57% between January 10-12, 2023, with an average decrease of 29.95% per round. The peak of newly SARS-CoV-2 infection was slightly earlier and lower in North China (5.28% between December 20-22, 2022) than in South China (5.63% between December 23-26, 2022), and then converged from December 30, 2022 to January 2, 2023. The peak of 6.09% occurred between December 20-22, 2022 in Eastern China, while the peak of 5.99% occurred later, between December 27-29, 2022, in Central China.Conclusions: Overall, the epidemic wave in rural China peaked between December 20-22, 2022, and passed quickly following the optimization of prevention and control measures. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 infection in community populations in rural China is sporadic.

TI  - Operational wave forecasting for extreme conditions in the Arabian Sea-A comparison with buoy and satellite data
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - An operational wave forecasting system forced with Global Forecast System (GFS) winds was presented and evaluated for the Arabian Sea. WAVEWATCH III (WWIII) model was used for wave forecasting. Several simu-lations were executed using different input-dissipation parameterizations embedded in WWIII including ST2, ST3, ST4 and ST6 packages for the period of southwest monsoon and two tropical storms in the Arabian Sea. Performance of forecasting system with different source term packages were evaluated by comparing the fore-casted significant wave heights (Hs) with the altimeter-derived Hs and buoy data. Results indicated that time series of the forecasted data derived from different source term packages are well adapted to those of the measured ones at buoy location during southwest monsoon. However, ST3 and ST4 packages outperform the others in terms of forecasting Hs in the entire Arabian Sea as well as buoy location. Also, the forecasted Hs are reliable up to 72-hr lead time. Performance evaluation during the studied tropical cyclones showed that it is not possible to make a general conclusion about the best parameterization. However, the forecast system forced with GFS winds was capable of simulate the peak values of Hs -although with time lag -during the tropical cyclones.

TI  - Complex surface displacements of the Nanyu landslide in Zhouqu, China revealed by multi-platform InSAR observations
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zhouqu County of Gansu Province in northwestern China is a geological hazard-prone area with frequent landslide and debris flow events. As a recent example, the Jiangdingya landslide, a smaller landslide within the larger ancient Nanyu landslide, was reactivated and partially collapsed to block the Bailong River near the Nanyu Township on 12 July 2018. Previous studies have shown that heavy rainfall is the major triggering factor of the failure event, but the spatio-temporal pattern of surface displacements of the landslide remains unknown due to a lack of in-situ measurements on the slope. In this study, we retrieved the surface displacements of the Nanyu landslide before the slope failure event using time-series Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) analysis of Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data. Our results show that the ancient Nanyu landslide has been in an unstable state prior to the failure event. To investigate the spatial patterns in displacement, we inverted a quasi three-dimensional (3D) surface displacement field using multi-orbit InSAR measurements combined with the surface parallel flow model, which showed a significant spatial heterogeneity in displacement patterns across the ancient landslide. In particular, a sign of local reactivation was observed on the upper slopes, which might be related to recent road construction activities. Furthermore, the detectability of unstable slopes near the Nanyu landslide with Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 observations was analyzed to deepen our knowledge on the optimal choice of SAR data for geohazards detection and monitoring.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy can provide survival results equivalent to axillary lymph node dissection for patients with cN0 and T1-2 breast cancer; however, whether it can be performed on patients with T3-4c breast cancer is still controversialBackground For patients with cN0 and T1-2 breast cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can provide survival results equivalent to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). However, whether it can be performed on T3-4c patients is still controversial. Materials and Methods Female patients diagnosed with cN0, T3-4c, and M0 breast cancer from 2004 to 2019 were identified using the surveillance, epidemiology and end results (SEER) database and divided into 2 groups, the SLNB group (1-5 regional lymph nodes examined) and the ALND group (>= 10 regional lymph nodes examined). Finally, only those with pN0 disease were included in the SLNB group. The baseline differences in clinicopathological characteristics between groups were eliminated by propensity score matching (PSM). We also conducted subgroup analyses according to age, overall TNM stage, breast cancer subtypes, surgical approaches, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was survival. Results With a mean follow-up of 75 months, a total of 186 deaths were reported among 864 patients. The overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) in the SLNB group were 78.2% and 87.5%, respectively, and that in the ALND group were 78.7% and 87.3%, respectively. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for OS and BCSS in the SLNB group (vs. the ALND group) was 0.922 (95% CI, 0.691-1.230, P = .580) and 0.874 (95% CI, 0.600-1.273, P = .481), respectively. Besides, the OS and BCSS between the 2 groups were also similar in all subgroup analyses. Conclusions SLNB may be performed on female patients with cN0, T3-4c, and M0 breast cancer.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Spectral Pathway Analysis (SPA) by using hyperspectral remote sensing data has a significant role in the demarcation of litho boundaries. The SPA is a 5 step continuous process 1) The re-flectance spectral characterization through a controlled environment to the direct field sample along with satellite data acquisition 2) The generation of ICA and MNF 3) The endmember spec-tral extraction through the sub-pixel-based classification 4) The extraction of mineral characters from spectral absorption behavior 5) Mapping of litho units based on the integrative approaches by the data from the field, geology, and geochemical characters. In the present study, mafic and ultramafic complexes of the Bhavani shear zone which have a greater significance in the econom-ically viable mineral aspects are taken into the consideration of lithological delineation by using PRISMA hyperspectral data. As part of SPA, ICA and MNF were generated using the PRISMA data and validated with geology, which shows a tremendous result in demarcating the lithological boundaries. Subpixel classification (PPI, SAM, LSU, MF, MTMF, TCIMF, and MITTCIMF) was per-formed and evaluated using ancillary data from field observation, XRF, and laboratory-based ASD spectra.

TI  - Habitat changes and catch rate variability for greater amberjack in the Taiwan Strait: The effects of El Nino-southern oscillation events
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a crucial oceanographic phenomenon that leads to interannual fluctuations in the climate and ecosystem productivity of tropical and subtropical areas. These fluctuations affect the suitability of habitats for many commercial fish species. However, detailed information on the effects of this major phenomenon and the resulting environmental changes on the habitat and catch rates of the economically and ecologically crucial species of the greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) in the Taiwan Strait (TS) is lacking. In this study, we employed a weighted habitat suitability index (HSI) modeling method and used remotely sensed marine environmental data as well as data from recorders in Taiwanese fishing vessels (in 2014-2019) to understand the effects of ENSO events on the habitat suitability and catch rates for greater amberjack in the TS. Analysis of variance revealed that environmental factors substantially influenced greater amberjack habitats and catch rates during ENSO events across seasons. The catch rates were high in spring and summer in the southern and northern TS and in autumn and winter in the southern TS. The catch rates were higher in spring, summer, and autumn (>9.0 kg/h) in El Nino years, and in winter, the catch rates were higher in normal years (>12.0 kg/h) and lower in La Nina years. The predicted HSI for the southern and northern TS revealed that greater amberjack populations were predominantly distributed at 20-24 degrees N and 24-28 degrees N, respectively. Opposite habitat suitability was synchronously found in spring and summer during ENSO events, with higher HSI values recorded in spring in El Nino and normal years and higher HSI values recorded in summer in La Nina years. In winter, the HSI values of the southern and northern TS were higher in El Nino and normal years and substantially lower in La Nina years. Habitat suitability was extremely low in autumn. These findings imply that ENSO events play a key role in regulating environmental conditions and affect the catch rates and habitat suitability for the greater amberjack in the TS.

TI  - Does income inequality increase status anxiety? Not directly, the role of perceived upward and downward mobility
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Status anxiety theory posits that higher income inequality leads people to attribute more importance to their socioeconomic status and to worry about the position they occupy on the social ladder. We investigated through two experimental studies (N = 1117) the causal effect of economic inequality on status anxiety and whether expected upward and downward mobility mediates this effect. In Study 1, perceived economic inequality indirectly increased status anxiety through lesser expected upward mobility. In Study 2, perceived economic inequality decreased both expected upward and downward mobility, with opposite indirect effects on status anxiety. This suggests that the relationship between inequality and status anxiety is not straightforward, and could implicate the presence of multiple processes working at the same time-whereas lower expected downward mobility could suppress the effect of inequality, lower expected upward mobility could exacerbate it.

TI  - The emergence of scale-free fires in Australia
T2  - ISCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Between 2019 and 2020, during the country's hottest and driest year on record, Australia experienced a dramatic bushfire season, with catastrophic ecological and environmental consequences. Several studies highlighted how such abrupt changes in fire regimes may have been in large part a consequence of climate change and other anthropogenic transformations. Here, we analyze the monthly evolution of the burned area in Australia from 2000 to 2020, obtained via satellite imaging through the MODIS platform. We find that the 2019-2020 peak is associated with signatures typically found near critical points. We introduce a modeling framework based on forest-fire models to study the properties of these emergent fire outbreaks, showing that the behavior observed during the 2019-2020 fire season matches the one of a percolation transition, where system-size outbreaks appear. Our model also highlights the existence of an absorbing phase transition that might be eventually crossed, after which the vegetation cannot recover.

TI  - Trends in drug use among nightclub and festival attendees in New York City, 2017-2022
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Drug use is prevalent among people who attend electronic dance music (EDM) parties at nightclubs or festivals. This population can serve as a sentinel population to monitor trends in use of party drugs and new psychoactive substances (NPS) that may diffuse through larger segments of the population.Methods: We surveyed adults entering randomly selected EDM parties at nightclubs and dance festivals in New York City about their drug use in 2017 (n = 954), 2018 (n = 1,029), 2019 (n = 606), 2021 (n = 229), and 2022 (n = 419). We estimated trends in past-year and past-month use of 22 drugs or drug classes based on self-report from 2017-2022 and examined whether there were shifts pre-vs. post-COVID (2017-2019 vs. 2021-2022).Results: Between 2017 and 2022, there were increases in past-year and past-month use of shrooms (psilocybin), ketamine, poppers (amyl/butyl nitrites), synthetic cathinones ( "bath salts "), and novel psychedelics (lysergamides and DOx series), increases in past-year cannabis use, and increases in past-month use of 2C series drugs. Between 2017 and 2022, there were decreases in past-year heroin use and decreases in past-month cocaine use, novel stimulant use, and nonmedical benzodiazepine use. The odds of use of shrooms, poppers, and 2C series drugs significantly increased after COVID, and the odds of use of cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, methamphetamine, novel stimulants, and prescription opioids (nonmedical use) decreased post-COVID.Conclusions: We estimate shifts in prevalence of various drugs among this sentinel population, which can inform ongoing surveillance efforts and public health response in this and the general populations.

TI  - Influence of foliar traits, watershed physiography, and nutrient subsidies on stream water quality in the upper midwestern United States
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between nutrient cycling and water quality in mixed-use ecosystems is driven by interactions among biotic and abiotic processes. However, the underlying processes cannot always be directly observed or modeled at broad spatial scales. Numerous empirical studies have employed land use patterns, variations in watershed physiography or disturbance regimes to characterize nutrient export from mixed-use watersheds, but simultaneously disentangling the effects of such factors remains challenging and few models directly incorporate vegetation biochemistry. Here we use structural equation models (SEMs) to assess the relative influence of foliar chemical traits (derived from imaging spectroscopy), watershed physiography, and human land use on the water quality (summer baseflow nitrate-N and soluble reactive phosphorus concentration) in watersheds across the Upper Midwestern United States. We use an SEM to link water quality (stream nitrate-nitrogen and dissolved phosphorus) to foliar retention (AVIRIS-Classic derived foliar traits related to recalcitrance), watershed retention (wetland proportion, MODIS Tasseled Cap Wetness), runoff (agricultural and urban land use), and watershed leakiness (AVIRIS-Classic foliar nitrogen, nitrogen deposition). The SEMs confirmed that variables associated with foliar retention derived from imaging spectroscopy are negatively related to watershed leakiness (standardized path coefficient = -0.892) and positively to watershed retention (standardized path coefficient = 0.705), with features related to watershed retention and runoff exerting the strongest controls on water quality (standardized path coefficients of -0.270 and 0.331 respectively). Comparing forested and agricultural watersheds, we found significantly increased importance of foliar retention to watershed leakiness in forests compared to agriculture (standardized coefficients of -1.004 and -0.764 respectively), with measures of watershed retention more important to runoff and water quality in agricultural watersheds. The results illustrate the capacity of imaging spectroscopy to provide measures of foliar traits that influence nutrient cycling in watersheds. Ultimately, the results may help focus development and restoration policies towards building more resilient landscapes that take into consideration associations among functional traits of vegetation, physiography and climate.

AB  - Coastal aquaculture ponds (CAPs) are of great importance for food security, ecosystem health, and greenhouse emissions. However, existing data often lacks geographic information on both national and international scale spatial data. Satellite remote sensing makes large-scale monitoring of CAPs more efficient. This is especially true when using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which can provide all-day acquisition as a high-quality data source for large-scale CAP mapping. In this study, focusing on CAPs in China and Vietnam, a novel method of large-scale CAPs mapping using Sentinel-1 images was developed. Moreover, high-resolution (10 m) CAP datasets in 2015 and 2020 were produced, and spatiotemporal changes and drivers were analyzed. The key results are as follows: (1) the overall accuracy of the mapping method proposed was >90%. (2) In 2020, CAP area in China was 8774.93 km2 (69.43%) and it was 3864.10 km2 (30.57%) in Vietnam. (3) CAPs showed an opposite trend in China and Vietnam. The CAP area decreased by 891.29 km2 with a change rate of about-9.22% in China, while the CAP area increased by 920.35 km2 with a change rate of about 31.26% in Vietnam. China had made unprecedented ecofriendly efforts to restrict expansion for improving the ecological environment. Vietnam focused more on increasing production than on environmental protection, leading to significant expansion. Our results offer some new insights on satellite remote sensing and its use in coastal eco-environmental management and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals 2, 6 and 14.

TI  - Comparison of two hybrid sentinel node tracers: indocyanine green (ICG)-<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-nanocolloid vs. ICG-<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-nanoscan from a nuclear medicine and surgical perspective
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundLymph node (LN) metastasis is a relevant predictor for survival in patients with a.o. penile cancer (PeCa), malignant melanoma. The sentinel node (SN) procedure comprises targeted resection of the first tumour-draining SNs. Here, the hybrid tracer indocyanine green (ICG)-Tc-99m-nanocolloid has been used for several years to combine optical and nuclear detection. Recently, the resource of the nanocolloid precursor stopped production and the precursor was replaced by a different but chemically comparable colloid, nanoscan. Our aim was to study the performance of ICG-Tc-99m-nanoscan compared to ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid from a nuclear and surgical perspective.MethodsTwenty-four patients with either PeCa or head-and-neck (H&N) melanoma and scheduled for a SN procedure were included. The initial group (n = 11) received ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid until no longer available; the second group (n = 13) received ICG-Tc-99m-nanoscan. Tracer uptake was assessed on lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission (SPECT). Intraoperatively, SNs were identified using gamma tracing and fluorescence imaging. Ex vivo (back-table) measurements were conducted to quantify the fluorescence emissions. Chemical analysis was performed to compare the ICG assembly on both precursors.ResultsThe mean tracer uptake in the SNs was similar for ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid (2.2 +/- 4.3%ID) and ICG-Tc-99m-nanoscan (1.8 +/- 2.6%ID; p = 0.68). 3 SNs (interquartile range (IQR) 3-4) were detected on lymphoscintigraphy in PeCa patients receiving ICG-Tc-99m-nanoscan compared to 2 SNs (IQR 2-3) in PeCa patients receiving ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid (p = 0.045), no differences were observed in H&N patients. Back-table measurements of resected SNs revealed a lower total fluorescence intensity in the ICG-Tc-99m-nanoscan group (24*10(9) arbitrary units (A.U) IQR 1.6*10(9)-14*10(9) in the ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid group versus 4.6*10(9) A.U. IQR 2.4*10(9)-42*10(9) in the ICG-Tc-99m-nanoscan group, p = 0.0054). This was consistent with a larger degree of "stacked" ICG observed in the nanoscan formulation. No tracer-related adverse events were reported.ConclusionsBased on this retrospective analysis, we can conclude that ICG-Tc-99m-nanoscan has similar capacity for SN identification as ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid and can safely be implemented in SN procedures.

TI  - Trends of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Couriers in Risky Business After the Optimization of Prevention and Control Measures-China, December 2022 to January 2023
T2  - CHINA CDC WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: On December 7, 2022, China implemented "Ten New Measures" to optimize prevention and control measures for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the national and regional trends of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among couriers in China from December 2022 to January 2023.Methods: Data from the National Sentinel Community-based Surveillance in China was utilized, including participants from 31 provincial-level administrative divisions and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection twice a week from December 16, 2022 to January 12, 2023. Infection was defined as a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or antigen. The daily average newly positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the estimated daily percentage change (EDPC) were calculated.Results: In this cohort, 8 rounds of data were collected. The daily average newly positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased from 4.99% in Round 1 to 0.41% in Round 8, with an EDPC of - 33.0%. Similar trends of the positive rate were also observed in the eastern (EDPC: -27.7%), central (EDPC: -38.0%) and western regions (EDPC: - 25.5%). Couriers and community population showed a similar temporal trend, with the peak daily average newly positive rate of couriers being higher than that of community population. After Round 2, the daily average newly positive rate of couriers decreased sharply, becoming lower than that of community population in the same period.Conclusions: The peak of SARS-CoV-2 infection among couriers in China has passed. As couriers are a key population for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they should be monitored continuously.

TI  - Identification of marine oil spill pollution using hyperspectral combined with thermal infrared remote sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The types of marine oil spill pollution are closely related to source tracing and pollution disposal, which is an important basis for oil spill pollution punishment. The types of marine oil spill pollution generally include different types of oil products as well as crude oil and its emulsions in different states. This paper designed and implemented two outdoor oil spill simulation experiments, obtained the hyperspectral and thermal infrared remote sensing data of different oil spill pollution types, constructed a hyperspectral recognition algorithm of oil spill pollution type based on classical machine learning, ensemble learning and deep learning models, and explored to improve the identification ability of hyperspectral oil spill pollution type by adding thermal infrared features. The research shows that hyperspectral combined with thermal infrared remote sensing can effectively improve the recognition accuracy of different oils, but thermal infrared remote sensing cannot be used to distinguish crude oil and high concentration water-in-oil emulsion. On this basis, the recognition ability of hyperspectral combined with thermal infrared for different oil film thicknesses is also discussed. The combination of hyperspectral and thermal infrared remote sensing can provide important technical support for emergency response to maritime emergencies and oil spill monitoring business of relevant departments.

TI  - Satellite-derived aridity index reveals China's drying in recent two decades
T2  - ISCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of dryland has caused a huge impact on the natural environment and human society. Aridity index (AI) can effectively reflect the degree of dry-ness, but spatiotemporally continuous estimation of AI is still challenging. In this study, we develop an ensemble learning algorithm to retrieve AIs from MODIS satellite data in China from 2003 to 2020. The validation proves the high match between these satellite AIs and their corresponding station estimates with a root-mean-square error of 0.21, bias of -0.01, and correlation coefficient of 0.87. The analysis results indicate China has been drying in recent two decades. Moreover, the North China Plain is undergoing an intense drying process, whereas the Southeastern China is becoming significantly more humid. On the na-tional scale, China's dryland area shows a slight expansion, while the hyper arid area has a decreasing trend. These understandings have contributed to China's drought assessment and mitigation.

TI  - A quantitative analysis of multi-decadal shoreline changes along the East Coast of South Korea
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - South Korea's east coast is facing several issues related to coastal erosion because of sea-level rise, typhoon-induced storm surges, and various coastal development projects. In recent decades, high storm waves have frequently appeared on the east coast, causing casualty, beach erosion, and coastal infrastructure damage, drawing significant public atten-tion. Thus, we analyzed the multi-decadal shoreline changes to understand the coastal dynamics and the forces respon-sible for the spatio-temporal changes along the 173 km coastline. The shorelines covering 38 years between 1984 and 2022 were derived from Landsat images and the change statistics, i.e., linear regression rate (LRR), endpoint rate (EPR), weighted linear regression (WLR), and net shoreline movement (NSM), were calculated at a 100 m alongshore intervals using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), revealed several distinct behaviors of shoreline position. The long-period (1984-2022) assessment showed an average shoreline change rate (LRR) of 0.17 m/year with an esti-mated mean erosion and deposition rate of -0.57 and 2.07 m/year, respectively. The long-term surface gain and loss of the backshore region exhibited that the net surface gain of the east coast is 421.13 ha, and the net loss is 181.82 ha. The assessment of decadal shoreline changes showed a cyclic pattern of erosion (from 1984-1990 and 1999-2010) and accretion (from 1990-1999 and 2010-2022). Furthermore, a secondary level of investigation was conducted to address a wider variety of coastal behaviors by segmenting shoreline change rates based on coast types and average slopes along coastlines. It was observed that the frequent coastal deformation is associ-ated with a flatter beach compared to a steep one. This study found that the artificial structures constructed along the east coast have not completely solved or stopped the erosion issues but shifted it from one location to an-other. The analysis of local and regional shoreline changes had shown that typhoon-induced storm surges, high storm waves, and anthropogenic activities like encroachment and the development of artificial coastal structures were the primary drivers of coastline changes along the east coast. Finally, we proposed a decision -making classification scheme that can be used to determine the mechanism of decision for protective and preven-tive measures against further coastal deterioration.

TI  - Forecasting natural regeneration of sagebrush after wildfires using population models and spatial matching
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextAddressing ecosystem degradation in the Anthropocene will require ecological restoration across large spatial extents. Identifying areas where natural regeneration will occur without direct resource investment will improve scalability of restoration actions.ObjectivesAn ecoregion in need of large scale restoration is the Great Basin of the Western US, where increasingly large and frequent wildfires threaten ecosystem integrity and its foundational shrub species. We develop a framework to forecast where post-wildfire regeneration of sagebrush cover (Artemisia spp.) is likely to occur within the burnt areas across the region (> 900,000 km(2)).MethodsFirst, we parameterized population models using Landsat satellite-derived time series of sagebrush cover. Second, we evaluated the out-of-sample performance by predicting natural regeneration in wildfires not used for model training. This model assessment reproduces a management-oriented scenario: making restoration decisions shortly after wildfires with minimal local information. Third, we asked how accounting for increasingly fine-scale spatial heterogeneity could improve model forecasting accuracy.ResultsRegional-level models revealed that sagebrush post-fire recovery is slow, estimating > 80-year time horizon to reach an average cover at equilibrium of 16.6% (CI95% 9-25). Accounting for wildfire and within-wildfire spatial heterogeneity improved out-of-sample forecasts, resulting in a mean absolute error of 3.5 +/- 4.3% cover, compared to the regional model with an error of 7.2 +/- 5.1% cover.ConclusionsWe demonstrate that combining population models and non-parametric spatial matching provides a flexible framework for forecasting plant population recovery. Models for population recovery applied to Landsat-derived time series will assist restoration decision-making, including identifying priority targets for restoration.

TI  - Long-term river extent dynamics and transition detection using remote sensing: Case studies of Mekong and Ganga River
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River dynamics are currently comprehensively studied at either a bankline or reach-scale level. Monitoring large-scale and long-term river extent dynamics provides fundamental insights relevant to the impact of climatic factors and anthropogenic activities on fluvial geomorphology. This study analyzed the two most populous rivers, Ganga and Mekong, to understand the river extent dynamics using 32 years of Landsat satellite data (1990-2022) in a cloud computing platform. This study categorizes river dynamics and transitions using the combination of pixel-wise water frequency and temporal trends. This approach can demarcate the river channel stability, areas affected by erosion and sedimentation, and the seasonal transitions in the river. The results illustrate that the Ganga river channel is found to be relatively unstable and very prone to meandering and migration as almost 40 % of the river channel has been altered in the past 32 years. The seasonal transitions, such as lost seasonal and seasonal to permanent changes are more prominent in the Ganga river, and the dominance of meandering and sedimentation in the lower course is also illustrated. In contrast, the Mekong river has a more stable course with erosion and sedimentation observed at sparse locations in the lower course. However, the lost seasonal and seasonal to permanent changes are also dominant in the Mekong river. Since 1990, Ganga and Mekong rivers have lost approximately 13.3 % and 4.7 % of their seasonal water respectively, as compared to the other transitions and categories. Factors such as climate change, floods, and man-made reservoirs could all be critical in triggering these morphological changes.

TI  - Theory as behaviour: Why empathy research needs horizontal, mutualistic habits of seeing
T2  - THEORY & PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - I propose that theory, typically understood as a mere intellectual position, is also a habit of seeing (in the Deweyan sense). It is a form of behaviour organized through person-environment collaboration that reshapes both person and environment, facilitating and constraining subsequent potentials for action. I discuss two of psychology's habits of seeing and their effect upon empathy research: (a) the vertical worldview, a habit of searching for reality at higher or lower levels, which neglects the empathizer's context and (b) dualism, a habit of treating organisms as distinct from environments, which creates the problem of other minds. I present two alternative habits of seeing: (a) van Dijk and Withagen's horizontal worldview, which looks outward to empathizers' contexts and (b) organism-environment mutuality, which approaches organisms and environments as processes rather than entities. These latter habits, I conclude, better afford psychologists the possibility of addressing the practical problem of nonempathetic behaviour.

TI  - Genus and size-specific susceptibility of soft corals to 2020 bleaching event in the Philippines
T2  - MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soft corals are zooxanthellate sessile animals supporting various organisms in coral reefs. However, their populations are threatened by the impacts of ocean warming. Under thermal stress conditions, soft corals may experience mild to severe bleaching which may lead to death. Understanding soft coral bleaching responses highlights the importance in predicting how populations and diversity may be affected by changing climate scenarios. In this study, we examined the bleaching responses of the three dominant soft coral genera (Lobophytum, n = 1318; Sarcophyton, n = 116; Sinularia, n = 639 colonies) in the Bolinao-Anda Reef Complex (BARC), Pangasinan, north-western Philippines during the 2020 thermal stress event in terms of genus and colony size susceptibility, and zooxanthellae density. Degree heating week (DHW) data from 1986-2020 were obtained using remotely sensed data to determine thermal anomalies in the study sites. The maximum DHW (6.3) in 2020 occurred between July-August while bleaching surveys were done during October of the same year. The percentage of bleached portions in each colony was used to determine bleaching category: no bleaching (0%), moderately bleached (1-50%) and heavily bleached (>50%). Quantification of bleaching prevalence and susceptibility of colony sizes were determined by colony count and mean diameter measurements taken from quadrat photographs in October 2020. Haphazard tissue collection (similar to 3 cm) in each colony of three soft coral genera per bleaching category was done to quantify zooxanthellae density. Results showed that Lobophytum colonies had the lowest bleaching prevalence (41%), followed by Sinularia (66%) and Sarcophyton (78%). All colony size classes of the three genera were susceptible to bleaching. However, smaller colonies of Lobophytum (<15 cm), Sarcophyton (<5 cm) and Sinularia (<5 cm) showed less susceptibility than large colonies. Zooxanthellae density was significantly reduced in moderately and heavily bleached colonies. The results of this study highlight that bleaching susceptibility is genus specific, with Sarcophyton and Sinularia being more susceptible to bleaching than Lobophytum. Smaller colonies seemed to be less susceptible to bleaching than large-sized soft corals suggesting a differential thermal stress response. Spatial variations in bleaching prevalence were also found among reef sites with varying environmental conditions and thermal stress histories. This work provided initial observations on how bleaching affects soft corals. Further studies on soft coral community recovery are recommended to fully understand how these organisms perform after thermal stress events.

TI  - Variation of surface water extent in the great Sebkha of Oran (NW of Algeria), using Landsat data 1987-2019: Interaction of natural factors and anthropogenic impacts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid and precise extraction of water information through satellite remote sensing has be-come a crucial technology in the study of water resources due to its ability to provide substantial and repeatable coverage instantly. This technology is particularly useful in monitoring wetlands, among other applications. It in this perceptive, this research aims to study the surface water ex-tent (SWE) variation of the Great Sebkha of Oran (GSO). A wetland area classified as Ramsar, bor-dering Oran city. Extended over nearly 40,000 ha, the water extent is influenced by climatic, geo-logical, and hydrological factors, which are typical of endorheic regions in semi-arid and arid cli-mates. However, over the last decade, these natural effects have been overtaxed by anthro-pogenic impacts caused by the strong urban expansion of the city of Oran. This is particularly evi-dent with the commissioning of the large El Kerma sewage wastewater treatment plant (WWTPK) in 2009. Located at NE edge of the GSO. The function of this plant is to treat a large proportion of the wastewater volume generated by the city of Oran. Nevertheless, for various reasons, a lag in the implantation of the various execution phases of a development project extended to the entire GSO basin has led to nearly a decade; the WWTPK has discharged partially treated wastewater di-rectly into GSO. This had a major impact on the mode of surface water extent change of the se-bkha and led to major pollution of the latter. To better understand the (SWE) dynamics, post and pre-discharges from the WWTPK in the sebkha were monitored monthly over 33 years (1987-2019). A consistent database of Landsat sensor images (TM, ETM+, and OLI) was col-lected and processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to extract the SWE in the GSO, which was achieved using spectral indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Nor-malized Difference Water Index (NDWI1 and NDWI2), Modified Normalized Difference Water In-dex (MNDWI) and Dryness/Wetness index (DWI). Subsequently, the SWE, correlated with precip-itation over the entire GSO watershed, was analyzed and discussed at different time steps: monthly, annual, and seasonal. Before 2009, the precipitation regime study concerning the SWE shows the complexity of the functional dynamics of the endorheic system of the GSO watershed. After 2009, the commissioning of WWTPK had disrupted the SWE variation of the GSO. The max-imum average of the SWE during the 2009-2019 sub-period was 169 km2, while it was 122 km2 during the undisturbed sub-period (1987-2008). The use of remote sensing data analysis con-tributes effectively to this work, representing proven results to protect this sensitive natural envi-ronment. They remain necessary to help decision-makers to ensure and preserve the sustainable ecological viability of the GSO and the natural environment of wetlands of the entire Oran sublit-toral furrow of Gdyel-Arzew: Daiet Morcelly, Telamine Lake, Sebkha golf Arzew.

TI  - Remote sensing of grasslands in the South American <i>Pampas</i> (scientometrics analysis)
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Remotely sensed data contains a range of information (spectral, spatial, radiometric, and temporal) useful in mapping and monitoring grassland extent, minimizing the cost of field data collection and laboratory analysis, thereby improving management and conservation of these ecosystems. The South American pampa biome is one of the most productive ecosystems in the world consisting of an evergreen grassland environment in the southern areas of the continent (Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina). In this review paper, a scientometrics analysis of the applications of grassland remote sensing in the South American pampa biome was performed with Web of Science Collection data using the relationship between authors/co-authors, institutions, countries, and keywords. Despite a large number of published works on the application of remote sensing in grassland ecosystems, comparatively, few have been conducted in the South American pampa biome. Of 166 published articles on remote sensing of grassland systems, the first one published on the pampas was in 1995, while research on this topic has been going on since 1985 in the rest of the world. Recently, some Journals have demonstrated interest in remote sensing of the pampa region: (a)IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth, (b) ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, and (c) Science of The Total Environment. A number of remote sensing methods applied elsewhere have yet to be applied in the South American Pampas, including LiDAR applications. A wide range of grassland parameters that can be estimated using remote sensing includes ecosystem health, alien species invasion, and biomass.

TI  - Addressing validation challenges for TROPOMI solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence products using tower-based measurements and an NIRv-scaled approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Several satellite-based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) products have progressively emerged and have been developed in recent years. However, till date, no direct validation has been conducted on existing satellite-based SIF products. In this study, validation of two groups of TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) SIF products, namely TROPOSIFCaltech (containing far-red and red TROPOSIFCaltech datasets) and TROPOSIFESA (containing TROPOSIF735 and TROPOSIF743 datasets that are retrieved from two different retrieval windows), was conducted using tower-based SIF measurements over seven sites. Several issues and potential obstacles emerged while matching satellite-based and in situ SIF retrievals, including spatial scale mismatch. To overcome the spatial scale mismatch between the satellite data and ground observations, a near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv)-scaled approach was employed to mitigate the spatial difference between the locations of specific sites and the matched TROPOSIF samples using Sentinel-2 imagery. Other issues related to retrival methods and instrument differences were examined. Subsequently, the 3FLD retrieval method was chosed for the in situ data. The validation results showed that the three far-red TROPOSIF datasets exhibit slightly different performances in terms of the validation accuracy; the R2 for TROPOSIFCaltech, TROPOSIF735, and TROPOSIF743 was 0.43, 0.33 and 0.40, respectively, which is asociated with root-mean-square error(RMSE) values of 0.59, 0.42 and 0.57 mW m- 2 sr-1 nm- 1, respectively. However, red TROPOSIFCaltech exhibited no significant correlation with tower-based SIF with R2 of 0.02 and RMSE of 0.34 mW m- 2 sr-1 nm- 1. Furthermore, the validation results at different sites varied, with R2 ranging from 0.01 to 0.70. Uncertainties still exist in the validation of the four TROPOSIF datasets, which are attributed to some unresolved issues, such as the limited quality of in situ SIF retrievals and the spatial scaling difference. Thus, to fully utilize satellite-based SIF products for wide ranging applications, further improvements in SIF product quality are urgently required at both ground and satellite scales.

TI  - Projected changes to Northern Hemisphere snow conditions over the period 1950-2100, given two emission scenarios
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study Northern Hemisphere (NH) snow conditions were simulated and analyzed for the period 1950-2100 under two emission scenarios RCP45 and RCP85. Daily snow conditions were simulated using the Snow17 model run on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) parallel cloud computing platform with each of the 21 GCMs in the NASA NEX GDDP dataset. The model was evaluated based on Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) and Snow Cover Area (SCA) data from the GLDAS-2 dataset and SCA remote sensing data from the MODIS/Terra instrument. The results showed that both NH SWE and the number of Snow-Covered Days (SCD) have and will continue to decrease at lower latitudes, whereas in many high latitude regions SWE is expected to increase, even as SCD is decreasing. The average annual NH SCD is expected to decrease by 12.5% and 23.1% between the periods 1950-1975 and 2075-2100, under RCP45 and RCP85, respectively. Between the same periods however, the NH mean winter SWE is expected to in-crease slightly in the beginning of the period under both RCPs. By 2100, SWE will have reduced to the 1950-1975 level under RCP45. Under RCP85, SWE will be 10% lower than the 1950-1975 level. These changes will pose a great challenge for water resource management across a wide spectrum, including impacting current way of living.

TI  - Sea ice classification of TerraSAR-X ScanSAR images for the MOSAiC expedition incorporating per-class incidence angle dependency of image texture
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We provide sea ice classification maps of a sub-weekly time series of single (horizontal-horizontal, HH) polarization X-band TerraSAR-X scanning synthetic aperture radar (TSX SC) images from November 2019 to March 2020, covering the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. This classified time series benefits from the wide spatial coverage and relatively high spatial resolution of TSX SC data and is a useful basic dataset for future MOSAiC studies on physical sea ice processes and ocean and climate modeling. Sea ice is classified into leads, young ice with different backscatter intensities, and first-year ice (FYI) or multiyear ice (MYI) with different degrees of deformation. We establish the per-class incidence angle (IA) dependencies of TSX SC intensities and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textures and use a classifier that corrects for the class-specific decreasing backscatter with increasing IAs, with both HH intensities and textures as input features. Optimal parameters for texture calculation are derived to achieve good class separation while maintaining maximum spatial detail and minimizing textural collinearity. Class probabilities yielded by the classifier are adjusted by Markov random field contextual smoothing to produce classification results. The texture-based classification process yields an average overall accuracy of 83.70 % and good correspondence to geometric ice surface roughness derived from in situ ice thickness measurements (correspondence consistently close to or higher than 80 %). A positive logarithmic relationship is found between geometric ice surface roughness and TSX SC HH backscatter intensity, similar to previous C- and L-band studies. Areal fractions of classes representing ice openings (leads and young ice) show prominent increases in middle to late November 2019 and March 2020, corresponding well to ice-opening time series derived from in situ data in this study and those derived from satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data in other MOSAiC studies.

TI  - The carbon sink of secondary and degraded humid tropical forests
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The globally important carbon sink of intact, old-growth tropical humid forests is declining because of climate change, deforestation and degradation from fire and logging(1-3). Recovering tropical secondary and degraded forests now cover about 10% of the tropical forest area(4), but how much carbon they accumulate remains uncertain. Here we quantify the aboveground carbon (AGC) sink of recovering forests across three main continuous tropical humid regions: the Amazon, Borneo and Central Africa(5,6). On the basis of satellite data products(4,7), our analysis encompasses the heterogeneous spatial and temporal patterns of growth in degraded and secondary forests, influenced by key environmental and anthropogenic drivers. In the first 20 years of recovery, regrowth rates in Borneo were up to 45% and 58% higher than in Central Africa and the Amazon, respectively. This is due to variables such as temperature, water deficit and disturbance regimes. We find that regrowing degraded and secondary forests accumulated 107 Tg C year(-1) (90-130 Tg C year(-1)) between 1984 and 2018, counterbalancing 26% (21-34%) of carbon emissions from humid tropical forest loss during the same period. Protecting old-growth forests is therefore a priority. Furthermore, we estimate that conserving recovering degraded and secondary forests can have a feasible future carbon sink potential of 53 Tg C year(-1) (44-62 Tg C year(-1)) across the main tropical regions studied.

TI  - Near-global distributions of overshooting tops derived from Terraand Aqua MODIS observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Overshooting cloud tops (OTs) form in deep convective storms when strong updrafts overshoot the tropopause. An OT is a well-known indicator of convective updrafts and severe weather conditions. Here, we develop an OT detection algorithm using thermal infrared (IR) channels and apply this algorithm to about 20 years' worth of MODIS data from both Terra and Aqua satellites to form an extensive, near-global climatology of OT occurrences. The algorithm is based on a logistic model which is trained using A-Train observations. We demonstrate that the overall accuracy of our approach is about 0.9 when the probability of the OT candidates is larger than 0.9. The OT climatology reveals a pattern that follows the climatology of deep convection and shallow convection over the midlatitude oceans during winter cold-air outbreaks. OTs appear most frequently over the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), central and southeastern North America, tropical and subtropical South America, southeastern and southern Asia, tropical and subtropical Africa, and northern middle-high latitudes. OT spatial distributions show strong seasonal and diurnal variabilities. Seasonal OT variations shift with large-scale climate systems such as the ITCZ and local monsoonal systems, including the South Asian monsoon, North American monsoon, and West African monsoon. OT diurnal variations agree with the known diurnal cycle of convection. Maximum OT occurrences are in the afternoon over most land areas and around midnight over ocean, and the OT diurnal cycle is stronger and more varied over land than over ocean. OTs over land are usually colder than over ocean, except at around 10:30 LT (Equator-crossing time). The top 10 coldest OTs from both Terra and Aqua mostly occur over land and at night. This study provides OT climatology for the first time, as derived from 2 decades of MODIS data, that represents the longest and stable satellite records.

TI  - Groundwater Volume Loss in Mexico City Constrained by InSAR and GRACE Observations and Mechanical Models
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater withdrawal can cause localized and rapid poroelastic subsidence, spatially broad elastic uplift of low amplitude, and changes in the gravity field. Constraining groundwater loss in Mexico City, we analyze data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and its follow-on mission (GRACE/FO) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1A/B images between 2014 and 2021. GRACE/FO observations yield a groundwater loss of 0.85-3.87 km(3)/yr for a region of similar to 300 x 600 km surrounding Mexico City. Using the high-resolution interferometric SAR data set, we measure >35 cm/yr subsidence within the city and up to 2 cm/yr of uplift in nearby areas. Attributing the long-term subsidence to poroelastic aquifer compaction and the long-term uplift to elastic unloading, we apply respective models informed by local geology, yielding groundwater loss of 0.86-12.57 km(3)/yr. Our results suggest Mexico City aquifers have been depleting at faster rates since 2015, exacerbating the socioeconomic and health impacts of long-term groundwater overdrafts.

TI  - A comprehensive assessment of in situ and remote sensing soil moisture data assimilation in the APSIM model for improving agricultural forecastingacross the US Midwest
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, the most popular approaches in agricultural forecasting leverage process-based crop models, crop monitoring data, and/or remote sensing imagery. Individually, each of these tools has its own unique advantages but is, nonetheless, limited in prediction accuracy, precision, or both. In this study we integrate in situ and remote sensing (RS) soil moisture observations with APSIM model through sequential data assimilation to evaluate the improvement in model predictions of downstream state variables across five experimental sites in the US Midwest. Four RS data products and in situ observations spanning 19 site years were used through two data assimilation approaches, namely ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and generalized ensemble filter (GEF), to constrain model states at observed time steps and estimate joint background and observation error matrices. Then, the assimilation's impact on estimates of soil moisture, yield, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), tile drainage, and nitrate leaching was assessed across all site years. When assimilating in situ observations, the accuracy of soil moisture forecasts in the assimilation layers was improved by reducing RMSE by an average of 17 % for 10 cm and similar to 28 % for 20 cm depth soil layer across all site years. These changes also led to improved simulation of soil moisture in deeper soil layers by an average of 12 %. Although crop yield was improved by an average of 23 %, the greatest improvement in yield accuracy was demonstrated in site years with higher water stress, where assimilation served to increase available soil water for crop uptake. Alternatively, estimates of annual tile drainage and nitrate leaching were not well constrained across the study sites. Trends in drainage constraint suggest the importance of including additional data constraint such as evapotranspiration. The assimilation of RS soil moisture showed a weaker constraint of downstream model state variables when compared to the assimilation of in situ soil moisture. The median reduction in soil moisture RMSE for observed soil layers was lower, on average, by a factor of 5. However, crop yield estimates were still improved overall with a median RMSE reduction of 17.2 %. Crop yield prediction was improved when assimilating both in situ and remote sensing soil moisture observations, and there is strong evidence that yield improvement was higher when under water-stressed conditions. Comparisons of system performance across different combinations of remote sensing data products indicated the importance of high temporal resolution and accurate observation uncertainty estimates when assimilating surface soil moisture observations.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Primary melanoma management relies on tumor extirpation and staging sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in eligible patients. This study compares SLNB utilization in patients undergoing wide local excision (WLE) or Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS).Methods: American Joint Committee on Cancer seventh edition >= patients with T1b melanoma undergoing WLE or MMS in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program were included. Propensity score matching was performed to compare patients who underwent MMS or WLE. Kaplan -Meier analysis and Fine-Gray cumulative incidence functions were used for overall and melanoma-specific survival.Results: Eight hundred twenty-five MMS cases and 38,760 WLE cases were identified. SLNB was performed in 32.61% of MMS patients and 61.77% of WLE patients with positive rates of 12.5% and 14.82%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression of factors associated with SLNB utilization revealed that WLE, male gender, younger age, extremity location, and nodular and rare melanoma subtypes were significantly associated with increased odds of receiving SLNB whereas head and neck location and lentigo maligna melanoma subtype were significantly less likely to receive SLNB.Limitations: Potential selection bias from a retrospective data set.Conclusion: Patients receiving WLE for >= T1b melanoma are more likely to receive a SLNB than patients undergoing MMS.

T2  - DISABILITY & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Disability among Latin American indigenous peoples is frequent and has particular characteristics. On the one hand, people understand and experience disability from their own worldview and cultural practices, but on the other hand, these cultural characteristics coexist with the reality of a disability produced by colonialism, colonization and forced assimilation into the states. Additionally, the socioeconomic conditions in which indigenous peoples live, as well as the political violence to which they are subjected, create a complex panorama that challenges disability studies to dialogue with other philosophies. Decoloniality, interculturality, epistemologies of the South, and indigenous thought can be approaches that discuss and problematize the study of disability in indigenous cultures from a more just and situated perspective.

TI  - Impacts of energy efficiency projects in developing countries: Evidence from a spatial difference-in-differences analysis in Malawi
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial difference-in-differences analysis is used to study the impacts of a large-scale development intervention aimed at improving energy efficiency in Malawi. The study proposes a quasi-experimental approach that com-pares the changes in several outcomes of interest over time between a population that benefitted from the program (the "treated" group) and a population that did not (the "control" group). Evidence for the analysis was primarily obtained from publicly available national household survey data and nighttime lights data. Results suggest that a combination of demand-side and supply-side interventions was associated with a statistically significant increase in electricity access, a decrease in the frequency of blackouts, and a switch from traditional fuels to electricity as the main source of energy for lighting (but not for cooking). At the same time, no evidence was found suggesting that the intervention caused households to pay more for electricity. The results are consistent with an emerging view in the literature that there are synergies between energy efficiency and energy access, especially in places where the bottleneck to wider electricity access is limited electricity generation ca-pacity rather than the cost of connecting more clients to the grid.

TI  - Fucosylated TLR4 mediates communication between mutualist fucotrophic microbiota and mammalian gut mucosa
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe glycans on the mucosa of suckling mice are predominantly sialylated; upon weaning, fucosylated glycans preponderate. This manifestation of mutualism between fucotrophic bacteria and the mature host utilizes a sentinel receptor in the intestinal mucosa; this receptor was isolated to distinguish its structural and functional features. DesignProvisional identification of the sentinel gut receptor as fuc-TLR4 was through colonization of germ-free mutant mice. Conventional mice whose microbiota was depleted with a cocktail of antibiotics were used to further define the nature and functions of fuc-TLR4 sentinel, and to define the role of the fucotrophic microbiota in gut homeostasis and recovery from insult. The nature of the sentinel was confirmed in cultured human HEL cells. ResultsFuc-TLR4 activity is distinct from that of TLR4. Activated mucosal fuc-TLR4 induces a fuc-TLR4 dependent non-inflammatory (ERK and JNK dependent, NF-kappa B independent) signaling cascade, initiating induction of fucosyltransferase 2 (secretor) gene transcription. In vitro, either defucosylation or TLR4 knockdown abrogates FUT2 induction, indicating that fuc-TLR4 activity requires both the peptide and glycan moieties. In vivo, fucose-utilizing bacteria and fucose-binding ligands induce mucosal fucosylation. Activation of this pathway is essential for recovery from chemically induced mucosal injury in vivo. ConclusionIn mature mice, fucosyl-TLR4 mediated gut fucosylation creates a niche that supports the healthy fucose-dependent mutualism between the mammalian gut and its fucotrophic microbes. Such microbiota-induced Fuc-TLR4 signaling supports initial colonization of the secretor gut, recovery from dysbiosis, and restoration or preservation of intestinal homeostasis.

TI  - Sea Ice Melt Pond Fraction Derived From Sentinel-2 Data: Along the MOSAiC Drift and Arctic-Wide
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Melt ponds forming on Arctic sea ice in summer significantly reduce the surface albedo and impact the heat and mass balance of the sea ice. Therefore, their areal coverage, which can undergo rapid change, is crucial to monitor. We present a revised method to extract melt pond fraction (MPF) from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, which is evaluated by MPF products from higher-resolution satellite and helicopter-borne imagery. The analysis of melt pond evolution during the MOSAiC campaign in summer 2020, shows a split of the Central Observatory (CO) into a level ice and a highly deformed ice part, the latter of which exhibits exceptional early melt pond formation compared to the vicinity. Average CO MPFs are 17% before and 23% after the major drainage. Arctic-wide analysis of MPF for years 2017-2021 shows a consistent seasonal cycle in all regions and years.

The sites are Banizoumbou (13.54N; 2.66E), Dakar (14.39N; 16.95 W), Djougou (9.76N; 1.59E), Ilorin (8.32N; 4.34E), and Ouagadougou (12.2N; 1.4 W). The overall and seasonal MODIS-AERONET AOD disparities for the locations were evaluated and compared with aerosol parameters associated with fine-mode prevalence at the sites, namely, total AOD (AOD(500nm)), precipitable water (PW), Angstrom derivative (alpha(1)), and fine mode fraction (FMF) for the seasons MAM, JJA, SON, and DJF. The largest overall disparity (least R-2) was found for Ilorin (R-2 = 0.021 +/- 0.295), while the least overall disparity (largest R-2) was found for Banizoumbou (R-2 = 0.660 +/- 0.132). The FMF was found to have the strongest correlations with the overall and seasonal disparities (R-2*FMF = - 0.626 (overall), R-2*FMF = - 0.350 (MAM), R-2*FMF = - 0.9 (JJA), R-2*FMF = - 0.602 (SON), R-2*FMF = 0.084 (DJF). The largest seasonal disparity occurred at Ilorin in JJA (R-2 = 0.014) when very low AOD(500nm) (0.352) was associated with significant fine-mode occurrence (alpha(1) = 0.433; FMF = 0.581), while the least seasonal disparity occurred in Djougou in MAM (R-2 = 0.866) when very high AOD(500nm) (0.814) was associated with the least fine-mode occurrence (alpha(1) similar to 0.00; FMF = 0.278). In Banizoumbou, Dakar, Djougou, and Ouagadougou, fine-mode aerosols occurred more significantly in the dry period (low PW), suggesting a biomass burning source, and at Ilorin, the fine-mode occurred more significantly in the monsoon season (high PW), suggesting a non-biomass burning source. Since the AOD at Ilorin correlated strongest with monsoon-season meridional wind (AOD(500nm)*MWwet = 0.611), compared to other seasonal wind fields, it is inferred that the large monsoon-season MODIS-AERONET AOD disparities at the site were due to southwesterly wind, which transports fine-mode aerosols from coastal industrial sites, as indicated in previous studies.

TI  - Development of a cerebral aneurysm segmentation method to prevent sentinel hemorrhage
T2  - NETWORK MODELING AND ANALYSIS IN HEALTH INFORMATICS AND BIOINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Image segmentation being the first step is always crucial for brain aneurysm treatment planning; it is also crucial during the procedure. A robust brain aneurysm segmentation has the potential to prevent the blood leakage, also known as sentinel hemorrhage. Here, we present a method combining a multiresolution and a statistical approach in two dimensional domain to segment cerebral aneurysm in which the Contourlet transform (CT) extracts the image features, while the Hidden Markov Random Field with Expectation Maximization (HMRF-EM) segments the image, based on the spatial contextual constraints. The proposed algorithm is tested on Three-Dimensional Rotational Angiography (3DRA) datasets; the average values of segmentation accuracy, DSC, FPR, FNR, specificity, and sensitivity, are found to be 99.72%, 93.52%, 0.07%, 5.23%, 94.77%, and 99.96%, respectively.

TI  - <i>Anopheles rufipes</i> implicated in malaria transmission both indoors and outdoors alongside <i>Anopheles funestus</i> and <i>Anopheles arabiensis</i> in rural south-east Zambia
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The primary malaria vector-control interventions, indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticidal nets, are effective against indoor biting and resting mosquito species. Consequently, outdoor biting and resting malaria vectors might elude the primary interventions and sustain malaria transmission. Varied vector biting and resting behaviour calls for robust entomological surveillance. This study investigated the bionomics of malaria vectors in rural south-east Zambia, focusing on species composition, their resting and host-seeking behaviour and sporozoite infection rates.Methods The study was conducted in Nyimba District, Zambia. Randomly selected households served as sentinel houses for monthly collection of mosquitoes indoors using CDC-light traps (CDC-LTs) and pyrethrum spray catches (PSC), and outdoors using only CDC-LTs for 12 months. Mosquitoes were identified using morphological taxonomic keys. Specimens belonging to the Anopheles gambiae complex and Anopheles funestus group were further identified using molecular techniques. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite infection was determined using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.Results From 304 indoor and 257 outdoor light trap-nights and 420 resting collection, 1409 female Anopheles species mosquitoes were collected and identified morphologically; An. funestus (n = 613; 43.5%), An. gambiae sensu lato (s.l.)(n = 293; 20.8%), Anopheles pretoriensis (n = 282; 20.0%), Anopheles maculipalpis (n = 130; 9.2%), Anopheles rufipes (n = 55; 3.9%), Anopheles coustani s.l. (n = 33; 2.3%), and Anopheles squamosus (n = 3, 0.2%). Anopheles funestus sensu stricto (s.s.) (n = 144; 91.1%) and Anopheles arabiensis (n = 77; 77.0%) were the dominant species within the An. funestus group and An. gambiae complex, respectively. Overall, outdoor CDC-LTs captured more Anopheles mosquitoes (mean = 2.25, 95% CI 1.22-3,28) than indoor CDC-LTs (mean = 2.13, 95% CI 1.54-2.73). Fewer resting mosquitoes were collected with PSC (mean = 0.44, 95% CI 0.24-0.63). Sporozoite infectivity rates for An. funestus, An. arabiensis and An. rufipes were 2.5%, 0.57% and 9.1%, respectively. Indoor entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) for An. funestus s.s, An. arabiensis and An. rufipes were estimated at 4.44, 1.15 and 1.20 infectious bites/person/year respectively. Outdoor EIRs for An. funestus s.s. and An. rufipes at 7.19 and 4.31 infectious bites/person/year, respectively.Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that An. rufipes may play an important role in malaria transmission alongside An. funestus s.s. and An. arabiensis in the study location.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy status improves adjuvant therapy decision-making in patients with clinical stage IIB/C melanoma: A population-based analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Given the results of the recent KEYNOTE-716 trial, the performance of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for patients with clinical stage IIB/C melanoma has been questioned.Objective: Determine the utility of SLN status in guiding the recommendations for adjuvant therapy.Methods: Patients with clinical stage IIB/C cutaneous melanoma who underwent wide local excision and SLN biopsy between 2004 and 2011 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Two prognostic models, with and without SLN status, were developed predicting risk of melanoma-specific death (MSD). The primary outcome was net benefit at treatment thresholds of 20% to 40% risk of 5-year MSD. Results: For the 4391 patients included, the 5-year MSD rate was 46%. The model estimating 5-year MSD risk that included SLN status provided greater net benefit at treatment thresholds from 30% to 78% compared to the model without SLN status. The added net benefit for the SLN biopsy-containing model persisted in subgroup analysis of patients in different age groups and with various T stages.Limitations: Retrospective study.Conclusions: A prognostic model with SLN status estimating patient risk for 5-year MSD provides superior net benefit compared to a model with primary tumor staging factors alone for threshold mortality rates $30%.

TI  - In the tension between large-scale analysis and accuracy-Identifying and analysing intra-urban (sub-)centre structures comparing official 3D-build-ing models and TanDEM-X nDSMs
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intra-urban polycentricity has often been described by a balanced distribution of jobs/residences outside the traditional core cities in so-called (sub-)centres. Recently, this purely socioeconomic view has changed, so that centres are also increasingly understood as a physical manifestation of spatial development policies. Built-up volumes derived from 3D-building models are therefore frequently used instead of or as complement to employment/population figures when studying intra-urban polycentricity. However, such data are expensive and not available universally and permit only geographically limited investigations to date. To overcome this constraint, we investigate whether globally available and consistent TanDEM-X nDSMs (TDX) provide a valid data base for intra-urban polycentricity research based on built-up volumes. Our study focuses on four urban regions in Germany for which we have obtained official 3D-building models (LoD-1). For each study site, we derive aggregated built-up volumes from the TDX and the LoD-1 data and identify (sub-)centres. We use three centre identification algorithms to account for the diversity of methods and outcomes. We consider the LoD-1 (sub-)centres as reference and the TDX (sub-)centres as the entities to be reviewed. First, we quantify their spatial agreement and compare if polycentricity measures calculated based on both data sets lead to similar results. Second, we explore possible causes for discrepancies between the TDX/LoD-1 (sub-)centres. We find high spatial resemblances between TDX and LoD-1 (sub-)centres. Accordingly, we observe that polycentricity measures display similar trends among the two data sets. Nevertheless, we also show that the agreement between TDX and LoD-1 centres can be affected in uneven terrain, in sparsely built-up areas, and by the algorithms used to identify (sub-)centres. Overall, our results suggest that TDX nDSMs reflect the distribution of built-up structures in sufficient detail so that local-spatial densifications - here equated with (sub-)centres - can be appropriately studied. We therefore conclude that TDX data offer a great potential for the thematic domain of morphological urban analysis at large scale.

TI  - Cross-sectional survey of surgical practices among gynecologic oncologists in the United States
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. We sought to document current surgical practices among gynecologic oncologists in the United States.Methods. In March/April 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology to identify gynecologic oncology practice trends in the United States. The survey collected demographic data and queried participants on types of surgical procedures performed and chemotherapy use. Univariant and multivariant analyses were used to evaluate the association between surgeon practice type, re-gion of practice, working with gynecologic oncology fellows, time in practice, and dominant surgical modality of practice on performance of specific procedures.Results. Among 1199 gynecologic oncology surgeons who were emailed the survey, 724 completed the survey (60.4% response rate). Of these respondents, 170 (23.5%) were within 6 years of fellowship graduation, 368 (50.8%) identified as female; and 479 (66.2%) worked in an academic setting. Surgeons who worked with gyne-cologic oncology fellows were more likely to perform bowel surgery, upper abdominal surgery, complex upper abdominal surgery, and prescribe chemotherapy. Surgeons who were >= 13 years out from fellowship graduation were more likely to perform bowel surgery and complex abdominal surgery and less likely to prescribe chemo-therapy and perform sentinel lymph node dissections (P < 0.05).Conclusions. These findings highlight the variation in surgical procedures performed by gynecologic oncolo-gists in the United States. These data support that there are practice variations that would benefit from further investigation.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pathways to Industrialisation and Urban Spatial Outcomes: The Case of Addis Ababa - Bishoftu Economic Growth Corridor, Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic developments affect urban land-use changes. Using Lefebvre's production of (urban) space as a conceptual framework, this study investigated the industrialisation process and its urban spatial outcomes in three cities (Galan, Dukem, and Bishoftu) along the southern outlet of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital. Landsat images were used to quantify the changing patterns of the three cities from the period 2006 to 2021. Interviews with key informants and document analysis were used to supplement these findings. The analysis reveals that in Addis Ababa-Bishoftu economic growth corridor, the unruly urban land-use changes have become a serious issue, challenging the sustainable development of cities. The study confirms that the proximity to Addis Ababa has contributed to the urbanisation process and urban corridor formation through investment expansion. This calls for a high level of expertise as well as integrated regional development for sustainable urban and industrial development.

TI  - Potential Impacts of Radio Occultation Data Assimilation on Forecast Skill of Tropical Cyclone Formation in the Western North Pacific
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the potential influence of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) data assimilation on the forecast skill of tropical cyclone formation over the western North Pacific in September-October 2019 through a regional model. Data from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate mission II are applied. The forecast skill considers the hits and misses for nine developing cases and the false alarms and correct negatives for 23 non-developing cases. Forecasts assimilating GNSS RO data reduce the false alarm ratio by 20% and increase the accuracy rate by 19%, compared to forecasts without GNSS RO data. Assimilation of GNSS RO data increases mid-level moisture around the disturbance centers at the initial time of the forecasts. It also increases low-level vorticity for developing cases but decreases vorticity throughout most of the troposphere for non-developing cases. These lead to improved forecast performance for tropical cyclone formation.Tropical cyclone formation is very sensitive to local atmospheric conditions such as moisture, temperature, and winds. Getting these conditions correct is therefore critical for accurate forecasts of tropical cyclone formation. Satellite data are commonly used to characterize atmospheric conditions over the remote oceans where tropical cyclones tend to form. New satellite data, specifically from the radio occultation of global navigation satellite systems, provide fine scale information on moisture, temperature, and pressure. This new information suffers less from contamination by clouds and precipitation than the traditional microwave and infrared satellite observations, and may further improve the representation of atmospheric conditions. In addition to cases of tropical cyclone formation, this study pays particular attention to the quality of forecasts of disturbances that did not develop into tropical cyclones-something that is often overlooked when assessing the quality of tropical cyclone formation forecasts. We find that incorporating radio occultation data into the regional model can improve the local environmental conditions for tropical cyclone formation forecasts. This leads to fewer false alarms and higher hit rates. These improvements may provide critical guidance for tropical cyclone formation forecasters.

TI  - Monitoring multidecadal coastline change and reconstructing tidal flat topography
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal zones are vulnerable to both landward and seaward pressures, i.e., sea level rise and aquaculture expansion. Thus, the conservation of coastal habitats has reached international prominence, as addressed in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 14.5. Nevertheless, stakeholders often have limited resources to monitor ample intertidal zones and cannot effectively evaluate actual conservation progress. Modern satellite imagery, especially optical data, provides a cost-efficient opportunity. Nonetheless, most past studies relied on noise-included water indices and demanded intensive manual editions. Therefore, this study presents an auto-matic processing strategy to estimate essential baseline information of coastal dynamics and topography, including shoreline changes, intertidal digital elevation model (DEM), and mean sea level (MSL). The results were statistically validated with bathymetric surveys and indicated that our proposed workflow can identify hotspots of coastal erosion-accretion and topographic features. Methodologically, by incorporating a fine -resolution global tide model, the tidal effect was greatly mitigated. We confirm that images acquired during flood stages can yield better quality tidal flat DEMs. The shoreline extraction approach refined in this study also enhances the positional accuracy via overcoming common biases, including water color variations and breaking wave-induced whitewash. These improvements and the wide applicability of our approach highlight the op-portunity of utilizing spaceborne remote sensing data to assess the coastal stability in different spatio-temporal scales.

TI  - Paradigmatic case of long-term colocated wind-wave energy index trend in Canary Islands
T2  - ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies based on remote sensing data and reanalysis have identified strong historical increments of wind speed in the area around the Canary Islands (Spain) without appreciating any increment of wave height. This decoupling of long-term trends for wind and wave data is not very common, and can be considered paradigmatic for an innovative study, with important implications for wind and wave hybrid or co-located energy production. In this study, wind and wave data from ERA5 reanalysis in the area around the Canary Islands have been used to compute a wind-wave energy co-location feasibility index between 1981- 2020 showing an increment of the index above +5%/decade. Furthermore, realistic wind and wave energy production has been calculated at an interesting hot-spot using a specific floating wind turbine co-located aside a oscillating buoy type wave energy converter. The corresponding capacity factor trend for wind energy (+0.8%/decade) and capture width ratio evolution for wave energy (-1.5%/decade) shows also the wind-wave decoupling, which constitutes a significant result for an original approach.

TI  - Assessing the effectiveness of a central flux tower in representing the spatial variations in gross primary productivity in a semi-arid pine forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A key challenge in ecosystem studies has been to quantitatively evaluate the extent to which a permanent eddy covariance (EC) flux tower reliably represents a forest that is much larger than its footprint, with potentially significant spatial variations in activities. Here, we addressed this challenge using normalized difference vege-tation index (NDVI) and gross primary productivity (GPP), derived from remote sensing measurements of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV; 5cm resolution), satellites (Landsat 8 and VEN mu S; 30 m and 5 m resolution, respectively), and data from the permanent (20 years) EC tower at the center of the 3000 ha semi-arid Yatir forest in Israel. Tree-level NDVI (after partitioning from the soil signal), plot-level GPP, tree size, stand density, and topographic parameters were obtained in 14 plots (0.36 ha each) across the forest over two years. These results were compared with the GPP estimates of the EC flux tower. The results showed significant spatial variations across the forest in plot-level RS-derived GPP but not in the tree-level NDVI. Canopy cover and topographical aspect were the dominant factors influencing the spatial variations in GPP, which increases with canopy cover on north-facing slopes. The plot-level GPP over the tower plot was consistent with the mean and range of values across the forest and agreed with the EC values for the same measurement time. Our results provide confidence in the long-term EC flux measurements at the study site and demonstrate a strategy to optimize the location of flux towers, which have critical contributions to the global efforts to assess biosphere-atmosphere interactions.

TI  - Estimation of surface soil moisture by combining a structural equation model and an artificial neural network (SEM-ANN)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important variable of the environment that directly affects hydrological, ecological, and climatic processes. However, owing to the influence of soil type, soil structure, topography, vegetation, and human activities, the distribution of soil water content is spatially heterogeneous. It is difficult to accurately monitor the distribution of soil moisture over large areas. To investigate the direct or indirect influence of various factors on soil moisture and ob-tain accurate soil moisture inversion results, we used structural equation models (SEMs) to determine the structural relationships between these factors and the degree of their influence on soil moisture. These models were subsequently transformed into the topology of artificial neural networks (ANN). Finally, a structural equation model coupled with an artificial neural network was constructed (SEM-ANN) for soil moisture inversion. The results showed the following: (1) The most important predictor of the spatial variability of soil moisture in the April was the temperature- vegetation dryness index, while land surface temperature was the most important predictor in the August; (2) After the ANN model was improved, the inversion accuracy of surface soil moisture by SEM-ANN model was improved, and the R2 of verification set was increased by 0.01 and 0.02 in April and August, respectively, and the relative analysis error was reduced by 0.5 % and 1.13 %. (3) There were no significant differences in soil moisture distribution trends between the April and August.

TI  - Urban anthropogenic heat index derived from satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing anthropogenic heat, which is emitted from human activities and energy consumption in urban areas and migrates to the atmosphere, significantly alters surface energy balances and the local climate and in turn generates urban heat islands (UHIs). Anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) has been estimated with energy balance residual and inventory methods. However, these methods have large uncertainty and fail to further explore the spatial distribution of anthropogenic heat at large scales due to limited data availability and the complexities of human activities, urban geometry, landscapes and building thermal properties. From the heat sources of the UHIs and based on thermodynamics, this study deduces that the AHE difference between urban and surrounding rural areas can be quantified as the residual of the heat for increasing UHIs and the heat difference from natural radiation between urban and rural areas. Thus, an urban anthropogenic heat index (UAHI) is proposed to quantify the contribution of AHF to UHIs, as a proxy of AHF. The UAHI is generated using the normalized differences in urban-rural land surface temperature (LST) and albedo derived from both Landsat and MODIS data. We investigate the spatial and temporal association between the UAHI and AHF in Beijing. The results demonstrated that the average annual UAHIs in Beijing ranged from 0.168 to 0.208 and steadily improved in the last decade. The UAHI can represent detailed spatial heterogeneity and temporal variations in AHF with correlation coefficients in the range from 35% to 50%. UAHI can also identify the dynamics of AHF hotspots and the heating and cooling sources in Beijing. Overall, the UAHI is a convincing indicator of the contribution of urban anthropogenic heat to UHIs, providing a new option for quantifying AHF dynamics and improving the knowledge of urban thermal environments.

TI  - Variations in chlorophyll-a concentration in response to hydrodynamics in a flow-through lake: Remote sensing and modeling studies
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A convolution neural network (CNN) machine learning algorithm is established for Chlorophyll-a retrieval in Poyang Lake using in-situ Chlorophyll-a concentrations and concurrent satellite image data. For comparison, other machine learning methods, e.g., deep neural network, XGBoost, random forest, gradient boost, decision tree, and linear regression, are also employed, together with two empirical models. Accuracy analysis validates the robustness of the CNN algorithm, with the R2 of 0.97 and the mean absolute errors of 1.74 mu gL-1, and its performance is better than other machine learning and empirical algorithms. The Chl-a in Poyang Lake is derived from Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) images based on the robust CNN algorithm. As a follow-through type, Poyang Lake has abundant hydrodynamics affecting the Chl-a in the lake water. Thus, the Delft3D Flexible Mesh (FM) model is employed in Poyang Lake to simulate the active hydrodynamics with a high spatial reso-lution (-80 m) under the realistic forcing in the period from 1 October 2020 to 15 March 2022. The simulation results reveal that the flow speed is a significant factor modulating the lake Chl-a with a high concentration in summer and a low concentration in winter; the flow speed and water storage exceed the temperature and solar radiance in modulating the Chl-a. The jacking effect of the Yangtze River can slow down the flow speed in the lake's north channel, therefore, augmenting the Chl-a by-20%, favoring phytoplankton blooms in Poyang Lake. The active eddies may significantly affect the lake Chl-a; cyclonic eddies enhance the local Chl-a, and anticy-clonic eddies weaken the Chl-a. A detailed analysis indicates that the Coriolis force plays a vital role in the momentum balance, which may cause the lift (restriction) of bottom nutrients in the cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddy area, increasing (decreasing) the surface nutrient supply. This study uses Poyang Lake as an example to show that such eddies conventionally appearing in a flow-through lake may dramatically affect the ecological environment in the lake water.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics analysis of surface water body and snow cover area to climate change in Gilgit Baltistan, Pakistan
T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Surface water and snow cover in mountainous areas are sensitive to climate change. Pakistan's irrigation water supply primarily depends on the Indus River. Identifying the spatio-temporal dynamics, response patterns of snow cover area (SCA) and surface water bodies (SWB) to climate change are vital for understanding the changes in the hydrological process of the Indus basin. Therefore, the SWB area was investigated using surface reflectance data (MOD09A1) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and SCA changes were examined using MODIS snow cover data (MOD10A2) from 2009 to 2018 in Gilgit Baltistan with respect to climatic variables. According to results the SWB area in Gilgit Baltistan, for annual, summer and winter, changes at the rate of -0.00057% yr(-1) (p > 0.05), -0.00042% yr(-1) (p > 0.05) and 0.00037% yr(-1) (p > 0.05), respectively. Moreover, annual mean temperature and the SWB exhibited a negative correlation (r = -0.244, p > 0.05) and correlation between SWB and total annual precipitation was positive (r = 0.535, p > 0.05). However, SCA of Gilgit Baltistan changed at the rate of -0.396% yr(-1) (p < 0.05), -0.940% yr(-1) (p < 0.05) and -0.253% yr(-1) (p > 0.05) for annual, summer and winter, respectively. Furthermore, annual mean temperature and SCA exhibited a negative correlation (r = -0.731, p < 0.05), whereas annual total precipitation and SCA showed a positive correlation (r = 0.636, p < 0.05). These results indicated that climate had been significantly affected the SCA and SWB of the Gilgit Baltistan.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The frontal position of an ice shelf is an important parameter for ice dynamic modelling, the computation of mass fluxes, mapping glacier area change, calculating iceberg production rates and the estimation of ice discharge to the ocean. Until now, continuous and up-to-date information on Antarctic calving front locations is scarce due to the time-consuming manual delineation of fronts and the previously limited amount of suitable earth observation data. Here, we present IceLines, a novel data set on Antarctic ice shelf front positions to assess calving front change at an unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. More than 19,400 calving front positions were automatically extracted creating dense inter- and intra-annual time series of calving front change for the era of Sentinel-1 (2014-today). The calving front time series can be accessed via the EOC GeoService hosted by DLR and is updated on a monthly basis. For the first time, the presented IceLines data set provides the possibility to easily include calving front dynamics in scientific studies and modelling to improve our understanding about ice sheet dynamics.

TI  - A policy approach for sustainable governance of sand mining activities in NW Kashmir Himalayas
T2  - EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability in river bed mining is emerging as a sensible yet unexplored area of research. This study assessed the socio-economic and environmental implications of mining operations in the River Jhelum of North-Western Kashmir Himalaya. To achieve the objectives of the study, surveys, focal group discussions, and questionnaires were used. Further, the high-resolution Google Earth imagery was used to monitor the distribution of mining boats correlated with extensive field-based surveys along a stretch of 150 km of Jhelum River. Manual counting from satellite data depicted that 2976 mining boats are currently operating in river Jhelum from the stretch between Khanabal to Boniyar involving manpower of about 17856 persons. The results indicated that similar to 2273662.74 metric tonnes of sand are extracted from river Jhelum annually. Socio-economic analysis revealed that sand mining serves as a source of livelihood to similar to 20000 families. Surveys and visual observations at mining sites revealed that the rampant riparian zone and mushrooming of in-stream mining activities have impacted river health causing erosion of river banks, flood plains, and pollution of the river ecosystem. This study offers a policy approach for sustainable governance of sand mining activities that pledge environmental protection with minimum regulatory costs and high levels of public cooperation.

TI  - Multiscale predictors of small tree survival across a heterogeneous tropical landscape
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainties about controls on tree mortality make forest responses to land-use and climate change difficult to predict. We tracked biomass of tree functional groups in tropical forest inventories across Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and with random forests we ranked 86 potential predictors of small tree survival (young or mature stems 2.5-12.6 cm diameter at breast height). Forests span dry to cloud forests, range in age, geology and past land use and experienced severe drought and storms. When excluding species as a predictor, top predictors are tree crown ratio and height, two to three species traits and stand to regional factors reflecting local disturbance and the system state (widespread recovery, drought, hurricanes). Native species, and species with denser wood, taller maximum height, or medium typical height survive longer, but short trees and species survive hurricanes better. Trees survive longer in older stands and with less disturbed canopies, harsher geoclimates (dry, edaphically dry, e.g., serpentine substrates, and highest-elevation cloud forest), or in intervals removed from hurricanes. Satellite image phenology and bands, even from past decades, are top predictors, being sensitive to vegetation type and disturbance. Covariation between stand-level species traits and geoclimate, disturbance and neighboring species types may explain why most neighbor variables, including introduced vs. native species, had low or no importance, despite univariate correlations with survival. As forests recovered from a hurricane in 1998 and earlier deforestation, small trees of introduced species, which on average have lighter wood, died at twice the rate of natives. After hurricanes in 2017, the total biomass of trees >= 12.7 cm dbh of the introduced species Spathodea campanulata spiked, suggesting that more frequent hurricanes might perpetuate this light-wooded species commonness. If hurricane recovery favors light-wooded species while drought favors others, climate change influences on forest composition and ecosystem services may depend on the frequency and severity of extreme climate events.

TI  - Early Detection and Prognostic Assessment of Cutaneous Melanoma Consensus on Optimal Practice and the Role of Gene Expression Profile Testing
T2  - JAMA DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Importance Therapy for advanced melanoma has transformed during the past decade, but early detection and prognostic assessment of cutaneous melanoma (CM) remain paramount goals. Best practices for screening and use of pigmented lesion evaluation tools and gene expression profile (GEP) testing in CM remain to be defined.Objective To provide consensus recommendations on optimal screening practices and prebiopsy diagnostic, postbiopsy diagnostic, and prognostic assessment of CM.Evidence Review Case scenarios were interrogated using a modified Delphi consensus method. Melanoma panelists (n = 60) were invited to vote on hypothetical scenarios via an emailed survey (n = 42), which was followed by a consensus conference (n = 51) that reviewed the literature and the rationale for survey answers. Panelists participated in a follow-up survey for final recommendations on the scenarios (n = 45).Findings The panelists reached consensus (>= 70% agreement) in supporting a risk-stratified approach to melanoma screening in clinical settings and public screening events, screening personnel recommendations (self/partner, primary care provider, general dermatologist, and pigmented lesion expert), screening intervals, and acceptable appointment wait times. Participants also reached consensus that visual and dermoscopic examination are sufficient for evaluation and follow-up of melanocytic skin lesions deemed innocuous. The panelists reached consensus on interpreting reflectance confocal microscopy and some but not all results from epidermal tape stripping, but they did not reach consensus on use of certain pigmented lesion evaluation tools, such as electrical impedance spectroscopy. Regarding GEP scores, the panelists reached consensus that a low-risk prognostic GEP score should not outweigh concerning histologic features when selecting patients to undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy but did not reach consensus on imaging recommendations in the setting of a high-risk prognostic GEP score and low-risk histology and/or negative nodal status.Conclusions and Relevance For this consensus statement, panelists reached consensus on aspects of a risk-stratified approach to melanoma screening and follow-up as well as use of visual examination and dermoscopy. These findings support a practical approach to diagnosing and evaluating CM. Panelists did not reach consensus on a clearly defined role for GEP testing in clinical decision-making, citing the need for additional studies to establish the clinical use of existing GEP assays.

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamics of tree cover change in semi-arid Ghana: evidence from Sentinel-2 time series data
T2  - AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Trees provide vital ecosystem services, yet anthropogenic activities have continued to reduce tree cover (TC) globally, leading to disparities in the distribution of ecosystem services at various scales. Similarly, empirical analysis of indicators that measure variations in TC at various temporal and spatial scales is limited in the semi-arid regions where global environmental challenges such as climate change are already affecting TC distribution. This paper quantified recent (2017 - 2019) TC changes in the semi-arid region of Ghana using Sentinel-2 times series data and the application of landscape metrics. The results showed that TC declined by 30% within two years. Urbanizing areas showed more rapid TC depletion rates, while some rural areas experienced a slight increase in TC. The findings suggest the need for local environmental governance by consolidating actions towards conserving semi-arid TC. Sustainable charcoal and fuelwood production are imperative for a long-term sustainable supply of ecosystem services.

TI  - An improved method for retrieving aerosol optical depth over Ebinur Lake Basin from Gaofen-1
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Ebinur is the largest saltwater lake in Xinjiang. In recent years, the exposed dry lake bottom surface has become a remarkable source of salt and dust owing to the desiccation of the lake. Given the importance of the lake basin to human livelihoods, comprehensive monitoring of basin behavior is required. Remote sensing offers numerous novel approaches to monitoring the spatial and temporal distribution of aerosols. During this study, high spatial resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) inversion at Lake Ebinur was still in the gap stage. The wide-field-of-view (WFV) data from four cameras on the GaoFen-1 (GF-1) satellite, launched by China in April 2013, offers high spatial and temporal resolution and excellent potential for AOD estimation. Owing to the shortwave infrared band (SWIR) deficiency and the complexity of surface reflectance, the coefficient of variation (CV) was proposed as a measure of surface reflectance to develop a surface reflectance database for land cover charac-teristics in the Ebinur Lake Basin. The significant improvements of the algorithm include (1) the design of an accurate and universal cloud detection algorithm through the blue and red bands. (2) The CV was used to assess the robustness of surface reflectance under long time series. After dividing the surface reflectance image pixels with low robustness, a reasonable value was assigned according to the surface reflectance variation character-istics of the image pixels. (3) Aerosol models were determined from the long-term measurements of the CIMEL solar photometer (CE318), and the validation of ground-based observations showed good correlation that WFV/ GF-1 AOD was comparable to CE318 AOD (R = 0.705; root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.098; mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.078), and the smaller MAE and RMSE confirmed the feasibility of inversion of AOD by this method.

TI  - Cross-region plastic greenhouse segmentation and counting using the style transfer and dual-task networks
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic Greenhouse (PG) is a vital component of protected agriculture, that can enhance crop yields and quality by altering the local microclimate conditions. Obtaining the number and distribution of PG based on highresolution remote sensing images is important for agricultural policymaking. However, due to the variability and interconnection of PGs in high-resolution images, counting and mapping them accurately is challenging. In addition, variation in data distribution across regions restricts the reuse of the trained model beyond the study area, impeding the cross-regional application from the source region to the target region. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel Cross-Regional Segmentation and Counting framework (CRSC) that integrates the unsupervised Style Transfer Network (STNet) and dual task-based Segmentation Counting Network (SCNet) to perform simultaneous PG segmentation and counting across different regions. The STNet is adopted as a target-adaptive data augmentation strategy to generate fake training samples from the source training samples. The SCNet is designed as a dual-task structure to perform the PG segmentation and PG counts simultaneously. Specifically, for each target region, we use the STNet to generate the fake training samples and then train a SCNet based on both source training samples and fake training samples. Subsequently, we leverage the trained SCNet to predict the segmentation and counting results of PGs, yielding the PG map and counting for each target region. The validation results on five target regions indicate that our proposed CRSC framework can achieve stable improvement in cross-regional segmentation and counting of PGs, especially in cases where the labeled samples in the source region are limited.

TI  - Estimation of regional actual evapotranspiration based on the improved SEBAL model
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The global food and water crises caused by climate warming are becoming increasingly significant. One of the important aspects of surface water transfer is evapotranspiration. The accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is of great significance in water resource management. However, accurate estimation of large-scale ET is challenging due to the adequate selection of the hot and cold pixels, the heterogeneity of the subsurface and the instability of the lower atmosphere. Therefore, in this paper, a surface energy balance model (Y-SEBAL) was proposed based on the SEBAL model and improved sensible heat flux calculation, and used to simulate large-scale actual evapotranspiration. Based on the principle of surface energy balance, this model introduced the empirical formula of sensible heat flux and simplifies the selection of limit to address the challenge of calculating the sensible heat flux of the crucial variable in the SEBAL model. The study simulated the spatial and temporal evolution of regional evapotranspiration with the model and verified the model simulation performance. In addition, the sensitivity of the model-driven data was quantified. The results showed that the simulation value of the Y-SEBAL model was highly consistent with the eddy covariance measurement data. In the verification results, the R value was 0.82, the index of agreement was 0.90, and the root mean square error was 0.81 mm center dot d(-1). The performance verification indices were better than the SEBAL model, MOD16 model, and SSEBop model. And the model had the highest sensitivity to wind speed, reaching 0.714. The Y-SEBAL model improved the simulation performance of the original model and simulated the actual evapotranspiration. The study can provide a new solution for improving the retrieval of evapotranspiration by remote sensing at the regional scale.
