TI  - Development of a Nonparametric Active Contour Model for Automatic Extraction of Farmland Boundaries from High-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural field maps are significant sources of data to achieve precision farming. The present research is a step toward generating land use/land cover maps automatically. The primary goal of this research was to develop an area-based model from nonparametric active contour models for agriculture land boundary extraction from IRS P5 satellite images. After investigating two well-known models created from nonparametric active contours, named local binary fitting and multi-phase, the local binary fitting model was selected to develop and enhance. Land boundary detection was improved by adding two texture layers to the input images and the development of the external energy function. The local binary fitting model was advanced as a multi-phase model in order to identify several regions in an image. Also, dull image boundaries were better extracted by changing the sigma parameter and regularization term. Evaluation of the proposed method yielded to the overall accuracy, user accuracy, producer accuracy, and kappa coefficient of 89.53%, 65.93%, 86.13%, and 86.52%, respectively.

TI  - The effects of orbit type on synthetic aperture RADAR (SAR) backscatter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The difference between an image pair acquired in crossing orbits of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors is of great importance. In this study, this difference was investigated in terms of backscatter and scattering mechanisms for several classes, including the Ground Vegetation (Gv), Water (Wtr), and Trees. Two RADARSAT-2 image pairs were used, one in spring and the other in winter. Almost all conditions were similar for each image pair except for the type of orbit. In the spring image pair, the backscatter for almost all classes from the image in the ascending orbit was more than that from the image captured in the descending mode. This was attributed to the change in the amount of evapotranspiration and the water content for the Gv and Tree classes, and was the result of wind speed variation for the Wtr class. For the winter image pair however, no significant difference was observed between the images acquired in the crossing orbits. The reason was that all the classes were frozen and, therefore, no evapotranspiration and roughness change occurred in that time. The results of this study proved that the difference between the images captured from crossing SAR orbits should be taken into account.

TI  - Irrigation water management in arid regions of Middle East: Assessing spatio-temporal variation of actual evapotranspiration through remote sensing techniques and meteorological data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and temporal distribution of reference (ETo) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) over the central region of Saudi Arabia during 1950-2013 are estimated using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Firstly, the FAO Penman-Monteith method was used to model the spatial distribution of ETo on a grid-by-grid basis using data collected from meteorological stations and GIS techniques. Then, crop coefficients (Kc) were modeled as a function of 16-day time-series MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Next, using Kc maps and ETo as input, daily AET was simulated by the soil water balance (SWB) model and aggregated to monthly and annual AET. From empirical NDVI-Kc relationships developed and applicable at pixel level, Kc derived from the NDVI-Kc relationships agree well with Kc recommended by FAO over various crop growth stages in the field. The monthly AET maps for 1950-2013 show a gradual increase in AET during the crop-growing season in January to May but a subsequent decline as the season progresses from June to December. The AET estimated for January to June are arranged in descending order, which are May (3.67-44.7 mm/day), April (5.99-36.8 mm/day), March (2.96-32.7 mm/day), February (0.68-20 mm/day), June (2.42-17.7 mm/day) and January (1-11 mm/day), respectively. Statistical analysis shows that statistically significant change point in daily AET generally occurred in 1990, such that the long-term average daily AET of 1950-1990 at 3.6 mm/day increased to about 5.3 mm/day between 1990 and 2016 with a positive trend of 1.5 mm/decade. The annual AET estimated for irrigated cropland in northern and central regions of Riyadh, Al-Qassim province and Hail province range from 1200 to 2900 mm/year. In these regions, low AET values are found in shrubland, grassland, and other natural vegetation. The annual AET estimated by the SWB model are about 9-11% higher than modeled AET in the study area, where the long-term average daily AET estimated for 1950-2013 range from 2 mm/day to 30 mm/day. Representative AET maps derived from applying the NDVI-Kc relationships to the SWB model will be useful to achieve the planning and management of sustainable water use in arid regions of Middle East.

TI  - Repeated fires reduce plant diversity in low-elevation Wyoming big sagebrush ecosystems (1984-2014)
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sagebrush is one of the most imperiled ecosystems in western North America, having lost about half of its original 62 million hectare extent. Annual grass invasions are known to be increasing wildfire occurrence and burned area, but the lasting effects (greater than five years post-fire) that the resulting reburns have on these plant communities are unclear. We created a fire history atlas from 31 yr (1984-2014) of Landsat-derived fire data to sample along a fire frequency gradient (zero to three fires) in an area of northern Nevada that has experienced frequent fire in this time period. Thirty-two percent of our study area (13,000 km(2)) burned in large fires (over 404 ha) at least once, 7% burned twice, and 2% burned three or more times. We collected plant abundance data at 28 plots (N = 7 per fire frequency), with an average time since fire of 17 yr. We examined fire's effect on plant diversity using species accumulation curves, alpha diversity (Shannon's dominance, Pielou's evenness, and number of species), and beta diversity (Whittaker, Simpson, and Z indexes). For composition, we used non-metric multidimensional scaling. We then used PERMANOVA models to examine how disturbance history, temperature, precipitation, and aridity around the time of the fire affected subsequent community composition and diversity. One fire fundamentally changed community composition and reduced species richness, and each subsequent fire reduced richness further. Alpha diversity decreased after one fire. Beta diversity dedined after the third fire. Cover of exotics was 10% higher in all burned plots, and native cover was 20% lower than in unburned plots, regardless of frequency. PERMANOVA models showed fire frequency and antecedent precipitation as the strongest predictors of beta diversity, while time since fire and vapor pressure deficit for the year of the fire were the strongest predictors of community composition. Given that a single fire has such a marked effect on species composition, and repeated fires reduce richness and beta diversity, we suggest that in lower elevation big sagebrush systems fire should be minimized as much as possible, perhaps even prescribed fire. Restoration efforts should be focused on timing with wet years on cooler, wetter sites.

TI  - SPRUCE FORESTS OF THE NOTHERN-WEST LADOGA REGION
T2  - Botanicheskii Zhurnal (St. Petersburg)
M3  - Article
AB  - The field research of North-West Ladoga region was carried out in various seasons of 1998-2004. The main purposes of these studies was inventorisation of phytocoenotic diversity of the territory, assessment of the present-day changes of vegetation cover. The key-plot is in the area of the Baltic Crystalline Shield granite rock out-crops. Landscapes represent granite ridges (selgas), limnetic clayey terraces and peatbogs in the narrow selga depressions. The Lake Ladoga render smoothed influence of the climatic conditions near shores (cool raining summer, warm autumn and winter). The most widespread vegetation type is pine forests. The mixed forests (beech, aspen, young pine and spruce) replace coniferous forests after fires or fellings. The article contains information about spruce forests of the North-West Ladoga region. Spruce forests were determinated on the 3 groups of association (greenmoss, herbaceous and sphagnous), 6 association and 6 variants of association (the ecological-phytocoenotic classification was used). Spruce forest associations are represented by the bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus)-greenmoss (Hylocomium splendens, Pleurozium schreberi, Dicranum polysetum), bilberry-woodsour (Oxalis acetosella)-greenmoss and woodsour-greenmoss, herbaceous (Equisetum sylvaticum, Deschampsia cespitosa)-ferny (Athyrium filix-femina, Dryopteris filix-mas, D. carthusiana, D. expansa, Gymnocarpium dryopteris), bilberry-sphagnous (Sphagnum girgensohnii) and herbaceous (Comarum palustre, Menyanthes trifoliata)sphagnous (Sphagnum girgensohnii, S. centrale). Also, spruce bilberry-woodsour-greenmoss and woodsour-greenmoss forests with nemoral herbs (Hepatica nobilis, Actaea spicata, Dryopteris filix-mas, Latyrus vernus, Stellaria holostea) are the typical feature of the North-Western Ladoga region. Over the past decade, the forests of the investigated area has been severely cut down. According to the results of satellite images Sentinel-2 (05-2017) were identified areas of new clear cuttings, as well as the area of the remaining spruce forests, a comparison of the data with the map of 2004, calculated the area of the remaining spruce forests. According geobotanical map 2004 area of key-plot is account 35 km(2), and area of forests - 22.3 km(2). Of these, spruce forests were occupied by a 5.5 km(2). Cutting areas in 2004 were 0.4 km(2), in 2017 - 2.7 km(2). Almost half of the spruce forests of the investigated territory were cuttings. The area of remaining spruce forests was 3.1 km(2).

TI  - Strength in Numbers: Combining Multi-Source Remotely Sensed Data to Model Plant Invasions in Coastal Dune Ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A common feature of most theories of invasion ecology is that the extent and intensity of invasions is driven by a combination of drivers, which can be grouped into three main factors: propagule pressure (P), abiotic drivers (A) and biotic interactions (B). However, teasing apart the relative contribution of P, A and B on Invasive Alien Species (IAS) distributions is typically hampered by a lack of data. We focused on Mediterranean coastal dunes as a model system to test the ability of a combination of multi-source Remote Sensing (RS) data to characterize the distribution of five IAS. Using generalized linear models, we explored and ranked correlates of P, A and B derived from high-resolution optical imagery and three-dimensional (3D) topographic models obtained from LiDAR, along two coastal systems in Central Italy (Lazio and Molise Regions). Predictors from all three factors contributed significantly to explaining the presence of IAS, but their relative importance varied among the two Regions, supporting previous studies suggesting that invasion is a context-dependent process. The use of RS data allowed us to characterize the distribution of IAS across broad, regional scales and to identify coastal sectors that are most likely to be invaded in the future.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background. This national, sentinel prospective study aimed to identify children with severe hospitalized varicella, despite availability of universal 1-dose vaccination since 2005, and determine associations between virus genotypes and disease severity.Children with varicella or zoster from 5 Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance hospitals were enrolled. Lesions were swabbed for genotyping. Associations with disease severity were analyzed using multiple regression.From 2007 to 2015, 327 children with confirmed varicella (n = 238) or zoster (n = 89) were enrolled. Two hundred three (62%) were immunocompetent children; including 5 of 8 children who required intensive care unit management. Eighteen percent (36 of 203) of immunocompetent children had been previously vaccinated. Vaccinated children aged > 18 months were less likely to have severe disease (9%; 5 of 56) than unvaccinated children (21%; 21 of 100; P = .05). Three of 126 children who had virus genotyping (2 immunocompromised) had varicella (n = 2) or zoster (n = 2) due to the Oka/vaccine strain. European origin clades predominated and were independently associated with more severe disease (odds ratio = 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 9.5; P = .04).Severe hospitalized varicella still occurs with a 1-dose varicella program, although predominantly in unvaccinated children. Most 1-dose vaccine recipients were protected against severe disease. Viral genotyping in complex hospitalized cases is important to assist in monitoring disease due to Oka-vaccine strain.Severe hospitalized varicella cases still occur with a 1-dose varicella program, although predominantly in unvaccinated children. Children who are unimmunized or who are infected with clades of European origin are more likely to have severe hospitalized infection.

TI  - Agroforestry has an impact on nocturnal predation by ground beetles and Opiliones in a temperate organic alley cropping system
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainability of organic vegetable cropping relies on ecosystem services such as biocontrol. Vegetable agroforestry can combine perennial woody crops and non-woody crops, which may alter ground predator activity-density and predation potential. We used living sentinel prey (Cydia pomonella) to assess predation in two different months, as a function of three levels of canopy openness in an agroforestry system combining lettuce crops and grassy strips. Ground beetles and arachnids were sampled throughout the year and we analyzed summer data conjointly to assess potential differences in the activity-density of these major predators between treatments. We found significantly higher predation potential in June in all agroforestry treatments compared to the control. In August, however, no differences were observed. Ground beetles and Opiliones were the major predators involved in observed predation events at both sampling periods. Differences in predation potential in June (- 35% in the control compared to agroforestry treatments) could be due to differences in Pterostichus madidus and Opiliones activity-density, which may have increased due to warmer temperatures under trees compared to the control plot.

TI  - Reflectarray to Generate Four Adjacent Beams per Feed for Multispot Satellite Antennas
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This contribution describes a design concept of a reflectarray antenna to produce four adjacent beams per feed through the simultaneous use of polarization and frequency discrimination. The feed position is computed to produce two adjacent beams in different frequencies accounting for the beam squint effect, which ensures a minimum phase variation between the phase distributions at the two frequencies. The other two beams in orthogonal polarization are generated by implementing in the reflectarray a different phase shift for each polarization. This contribution presents the design, manufacturing, and measurement of a 43 cm demonstrator that operates at transmit frequencies in the Ka-band. The proposed concept can be suitable for multiple spot-beam satellites in the Ka-band, enabling a reduction in the number of antennas and feeds needed to provide the multispot coverage.

TI  - FLOOD HAZARD MAPPING USING ON-SITE SURVEYED FLOOD MAP, HECRAS V.5 AND GIS TOOL: A CASE STUDY OF NAKHON RATCHASIMA MUNICIPALITY, THAILAND
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - For a small flood affected area, satellite data normally provides physical properties of flood event with low accuracy information (location and boundary). Flood depth and flood duration cannot be identified from a snapshot of satellite image. Therefore, on-site surveying of historical flood properties and its impact are still essential, and this observed flood map is realistic and reliable information for future flood management. The objective of this study is to construct a flood hazard map from available observed flood map of the small flood affected area and use HEC-RAS V. 5 and GIS tool to formulate the flood hazard map for future scenarios. This method was applied for the municipality of Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand. For a simulation, input physical parameters were generated by Hec-GeoRAS in ArcGIS based on DEM (5x5 m(2)). A range of calibrated Manning's n in a main channel was obtained from fitting exercise with observed Rating curve. Land-use map was used to estimate the Manning's n in floodplain depending upon the type of land cover. Simulated results were exported to ArcGIS to delineate water surface on floodplain. Then, the maximum discharge value at the observed station (M. 164) for return periods of 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, and 100 years were used as upstream input flood to simulate the flood map. It is found that, for the 2010 flooding event in the concerning area, the simulated flood hazard map subjected to the discharge of 50 years return period (217 m(3)/s) which is almost identical with the observed flood map from the surveying.

TI  - Assessing land transformation and associated degradation of the west part of Ganga River Basin using forest cover land use mapping and residual trend analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The west part of Ganga River Basin (WGRB) has experienced continuous land transformation since the Indus Valley Civilisation shifted from the Indus basin to the Ganga basin. Particularly in the last few decades the land transformation has increased many-folds due to the changing climate and rapid increase in population. In this paper, we assessed land transformation and associated degradation in the WGRB based on the forest cover land use (FCLU) mapping and residual trend analysis (RTA). The FCLU maps for 1975 and 2010 were generated using 216 Landsat satellite images and validated using 1509 ground points. We mapped 29 forest and 18 non-forest types and estimated a total loss of 5571 km(2) forest cover and expansion in settlement areas (5396 km(2)). Other major changes mapped include a decrease in wetlands and water bodies, while an increase in agriculture and barren lands with an overall mapping accuracy of 85.3% (kappa, 0.82) and 88.43% (kappa, 0.84) for 1975 and 2010, respectively. We also performed the RTA analysis using GIMMS-NDVI3g to identify areas of significant negative vegetative photosynthetic change as an indicator for land degradation. All the RTA models showed monotonic nature of the residual trends and resulted as moderately positive but highly significant (P < 0.001). Land degradation in the form of barren land accompanied by a decline in vegetation quality and coverage was found prominent in the basin with a possibility of an accelerated rate of land degradation in future due to the rapid loss of permanent forest cover.

TI  - Age Determinants for Breast Surgery Using the Choosing Wisely initiative for early-stage breast cancer treatment strategies
T2  - CLINICAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer treatment for women aged 70 years and older can be complicated by existing comorbidities, a shorter lifespan, and a greater risk of side effects from treatments such as chemotherapy. Identifying and continually assessing appropriate breast cancer treatment strategies in older women is important. This article highlights an approach to surgical treatment that demonstrates that age may not be the most important factor in surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer.

TI  - Potential effects of aerosols on the diurnal cycle of precipitation over Central Africa by RegCM4.4
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we examine the potential influence of aerosols on the diurnal cycle of precipitation over Central Africa by analysing 5-year simulations performed with the version 4.4 of the Abdus Salam International Centre of Theoretical Physics model (RegCM4.4). Two sets of 6 years from January 2001 to December 2006 were simulated at a 40-km horizontal grid with 1 year for spin-up. Overall, our results indicate that the simulated seasonal aerosol loads are underestimated everywhere over the study domain compared to MODIS total aerosol optical depth retrieval, except the northern part encompassing Sahel region characterized by an occurrence of dust aerosols loading coming from the Sahelian region in West Africa. The model diurnal precipitation was evaluated against the TRMM 3B42 rainfall product. The diurnal evolution of precipitation reveals that the model represents the general pattern, but always with very low values peculiarly in the late afternoon. Over the rainy area, amplitude of precipitation is systematically affected by either a reduction or an increase by up to +/- 20% and +/- 40% during DJF and JAS, respectively. Scattering and absorption of solar radiation by aerosols can explain the reduction in diurnal amplitude of precipitation.The time of maximum precipitation is not really affected during both seasons over the major part of rainy area.

TI  - Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) annual report 2016: Prospective hospital-based surveillance for serious paediatric conditions
T2  - COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) network is a hospital-based active surveillance system employing prospective case ascertainment for selected serious childhood conditions, particularly vaccine preventable diseases and potential adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). PAEDS data is used to better understand these conditions, inform policy and practice under the National Immunisation Program, and enable rapid public health responses for certain conditions of public health importance. PAEDS enhances data available from other Australian surveillance systems by providing prospective, detailed clinical and laboratory information on children with selected conditions. This is the third annual PAEDS report, and presents surveillance data for 2016.MethodsSpecialist nurses screened hospital admissions, emergency department records, laboratory and other data, on a daily basis in 5 paediatric tertiary referral hospitals in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland to identify children with the conditions under surveillance. Retrospective data on some conditions was also captured by an additional hospital in the Northern Territory. Standardised protocols and case definitions were used across all sites. Conditions under surveillance in 2016 included acute flaccid paralysis(AFP) (a syndrome associated with poliovirus infection), acute childhood encephalitis (ACE), influenza, intussusception (IS; a potential AEFI with rotavirus vaccines), pertussis, varicella-zoster virus infection (varicella and herpes zoster), invasive meningococcal and invasive Group A streptococcus diseases. Most protocols restrict eligibility to hospitalisations; ED only presentations are also included for some conditions.ResultsIn 2016, there were 673 cases identified across all conditions under surveillance. Key outcomes of PAEDS included: contribution to national AFP surveillance to reach World Health Organization (WHO) reporting targets; identification of the leading infectious causes of acute encephalitis which included human parechovirus, influenza, enteroviruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and bacterial meningo-encephalitis; demonstration of high influenza activity with vaccine effectiveness (VE) analysis demonstrating some protection offered through vaccination. All IS cases associated with vaccine receipt were reported to the relevant state health department. Varicella and herpes zoster case numbers increased from previous years associated with suboptimal vaccination in up to 40% of cases identified. Pertussis surveillance continued in 2016 with the addition of test negative controls captured for estimating vaccine effectiveness. Surveillance for invasive meningococcal disease showed predominance for serotype B in absence of immunisation, and new invasive group A streptococcus surveillance captured severe disease in children.ConclusionsPAEDS continues to provide unique policy-relevant data on serious paediatric conditions using hospital-based sentinel surveillance.

TI  - Principles and Applications of the Global Human Settlement Layer as Baseline for the Land Use Efficiency Indicator-DSDG 11.3.1
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) produces new global spatial information, evidence-based analytics describing the human presence on the planet that is based mainly on two quantitative factors: (i) the spatial distribution (density) of built-up structures and (ii) the spatial distribution (density) of resident people. Both of the factors are observed in the long-term temporal domain and per unit area, in order to support the analysis of the trends and indicators for monitoring the implementation of the 2030 Development Agenda and the related thematic agreements. The GHSL uses various input data, including global, multi-temporal archives of high-resolution satellite imagery, census data, and volunteered geographic information. In this paper, we present a global estimate for the Land Use Efficiency (LUE) indicatorSDG 11.3.1, for circa 10,000 urban centers, calculating the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate between 1990 and 2015. In addition, we analyze the characteristics of the GHSL information to demonstrate how the original frameworks of data (gridded GHSL data) and tools (GHSL tools suite), developed from Earth Observation and integrated with census information, could support Sustainable Development Goals monitoring. In particular, we demonstrate the potential of gridded, open and free, local yet globally consistent, multi-temporal data in filling the data gap for Sustainable Development Goal 11. The results of our research demonstrate that there is potential to raise SDG 11.3.1 from a Tier II classification (manifesting unavailability of data) to a Tier I, as GHSL provides a global baseline for the essential variables called by the SDG 11.3.1 metadata.

TI  - Classification of Crops, Pastures, and Tree Plantations along the Season with Multi-Sensor Image Time Series in a Subtropical Agricultural Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and efficient land-cover mapping is of high interest, especially in agricultural landscapes. Classification based on satellite images over the season, while important for cropland monitoring, remains challenging in subtropical agricultural areas due to the high diversity of management systems and seasonal cloud cover variations. This work presents supervised object-based classifications over the year at 2-month time-steps in a heterogeneous region of 12,000 km(2) in the Sao Paulo region of Brazil. Different methods and remote-sensing datasets were tested with the random forest algorithm, including optical and radar data, time series of images, and cloud gap-filling methods. The final selected method demonstrated an overall accuracy of approximately 0.84, which was stable throughout the year, at the more detailed level of classification; confusion mainly occurred among annual crop classes and soil classes. We showed in this study that the use of time series was useful in this context, mainly by including a small number of highly discriminant images. Such important images were eventually distant in time from the prediction date, and they corresponded to a high-quality image with low cloud cover. Consequently, the final classification accuracy was not sensitive to the cloud gap-filling method, and simple median gap-filling or linear interpolations with time were sufficient. Sentinel-1 images did not improve the classification results in this context. For within-season dynamic classes, such as annual crops, which were more difficult to classify, field measurement efforts should be densified and planned during the most discriminant window, which may not occur during the crop vegetation peak.

TI  - Self-adaptive cloud detection approach for GaoFen-1 optical remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection for remote sensing imageries is a fundamental as well as significant step due to the inevitable existence of large amount of clouds in the optical remote sensing data. A highly efficient cloud detection approach is capable of saving data collection cost and improving data utilization efficiency. Homomorphic filtering algorithm is one of the most commonly methods that based on single-scene image for detecting clouds. This algorithm has the advantage of fast computation and high accuracy in cloud areas detection. However, the detected cloud areas are heavily dependent on the cut-off frequency of the homomorphic filter. The homomorphic filtering progress usually uses cut-off frequency with empirical value which might not be applicable to large amount of intricate input data. Therefore, this paper aims to construct the relationship between the image spectra power and the filter cut-off frequency. Based on the domestic high spatial resolution optical remote sensing data GF-1, this research makes the detection of clouds could be process to achieve a bulk deal. Our approach make the cut-off frequency self-adaptive changes rather than used empirical value when compared with the traditional homomorphic filtering, thus it could be able to meet more complicated scenarios. Further, the post-processing steps including whiteness index, spectral threshold, and morphological opening and closing operators are applied to coarse cloud mask to optimize results. We have tested on 98 GF-1 high resolution multispectral imageries, results indicated that our approach is capable of detecting cloud as well as haze areas with high accuracy of 93.81%. This novel self-adaptive method shows its great application potential for real-time and high efficient cloud detection, meanwhile reduced the error detection rates caused by high reflectance ground objects.

TI  - Near real-time vegetation anomaly detection with MODIS NDVI: Timeliness vs. accuracy and effect of anomaly computation options
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For food crises early warning purposes, coarse spatial resolution NDVI data are widely used to monitor vegetation conditions in near real-time (NRT). Different types of NDVI anomalies are typically employed to assess the current state of crops and rangelands as compared to previous years. Timeliness and accuracy of such anomalies are critical factors to an effective monitoring. Temporal smoothing can efficiently reduce noise and cloud contamination in the time series of historical observations, where data points are available before and after each observation to be smoothed. With NRT data, smoothing methods are adapted to cope with the unbalanced availability of data before and after the most recent data points. These NRT approaches provide successive updates of the estimation of the same data point as more observations become available. Anomalies compare the current NDVI value with some statistics (e.g. indicators of central tendency and dispersion) extracted from the historical archive of observations. With multiple updates of the same datasets being available, two options can be selected to compute anomalies, i.e. using the same update level for the NRT data and the statistics or using the most reliable update for the latter. In this study we assess the accuracy of three commonly employed 1 km MODIS NDVI anomalies (standard scores, non-exceedance probability and vegetation condition index) with respect to (1) delay with which they become available and (2) option selected for their computation. We show that a large estimation error affects the earlier estimates and that this error is efficiently reduced in subsequent updates. In addition, with regards to the preferable option to compute anomalies, we empirically observe that it depends on the type of application (e.g. averaging anomalies value over an area of interest vs. detecting "drought" conditions by setting a threshold on the anomaly value) and the employed anomaly type. Finally, we map the spatial pattern in the magnitude of NRT anomaly estimation errors over the globe and relate it to average cloudiness.

TI  - Land-use components, abundance of predatory arthropods, and vegetation height affect predation rates in grasslands
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use is a major driver of biodiversity loss in many taxa including the mega-diverse arthropods, but consequences for arthropod-mediated processes are still little understood. Using a rapid ecosystem function assessment (REFA), we approximated predation by quantifying predation attempts on artificial sentinel prey. Dummies were placed on the soil surface of 83 managed temperate grasslands across a broad range of land-use intensities (grazing intensity, mowing frequency, and the amount of applied fertiliser) in two regions of Germany. Additionally, we measured vegetation height and assessed the abundance of ground-dwelling arthropods using pitfall traps. We documented predation marks left by arthropods, rodents, and birds. The proportion of dummies with predation marks (i.e. predation rates) differed between regions. Vegetation height was the strongest predictor for predation in our study but correlated only weakly with land use. Predation rates increased with increasing vegetation height, for rodents and for all predator groups combined. All three land-use components affected predation, which was most prominent for arthropod predation. Arthropod predation increased with higher grazing intensity and decreased with higher mowing frequency and higher fertilisation intensity. Also, the abundances of ground-dwelling arthropods affected predation. While predation rates generally increased with a higher abundance of carabids and decreased with higher abundance of ants, the effects of spider abundance interacted with region. Our results demonstrate that different components of land use can have counteracting effects on predation rates acting together with changes in the abundance of different predator groups and vegetation height. This suggests that land-use practices that sustain high vegetation and ground-dwelling predator abundances increase predation rates in grasslands and consequently the potential to provide ecosystem services in the form of pest control.

TI  - APPLICATION OF LANDSAT-DERIVED NDVI IN MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT OF VEGETATION COVER CHANGES IN CENTRAL SERBIA
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the application of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the monitoring and assessment of temporal vegetation cover changes (from 2006 to 2014) in three municipalities of Central Serbia: Topola, Jagodina and Kursumlija. Additionally, special focus is placed on the analysis of the forest areas and the possible use of NDVI in the forest management sector. Results of the NDVI applied through Idrisi software identify all vegetation cover types and their typical values for presented case studies and observed periods. Obtained results for Serbian case studies indicate two major observations outlined for the investigated period. It was noticed that vegetation cover is experiencing a certain decrease, and that certain discrepancies exists between the NDVI and official forest area statistics for certain municipalities. The study outlines the positive outcomes of the applied remote sensing techniques, especially for southern Serbian municipalities where illegal logging activities are pronounced. Hence, this method proved very promising for countries performing national forest inventories, such as Serbia, providing local forest managers with several essential up-to-date information about vegetation cover changes on an annual basis.

M3  - Article
AB  - The traveling-wave tube is a critical subsystem for satellite data transmission. Its role in the history of wireless communications and in the space conquest is significant, but largely ignored, even though the device remains widely used nowadays. This paper presents, albeit non-exhaustively, circumstances and contexts that led to its invention, and its part in the worldwide (in particular in Europe) expansion of TV broadcasting via microwave radio relays and satellites. We also discuss its actual contribution to space applications and its conception. The originality of this paper comes from the wide period covered (from first slow-wave structures in 1889 to present space projects) and from connection points made between this device and commercial exploitations. The appendix deals with an intuitive pedagogical description of the wave-particle interaction.

TI  - Monitoring Suspended Particle Matter Using GOCI Satellite Data After the Tohoku (Japan) Tsunami in 2011
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster that occurred on March 11, 2011, was caused by the Tohoku tsunami, which was itself triggered by the devastating 9.0 Mw moment magnitude earthquake. This study investigates spatial and temporal changes of the suspended particulate matter (SPM) content in the North-Eastern part of Japan (Pacific Ocean) using a geostationary ocean color sensor. The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), which is centered on the Korean peninsula but could also observe the Japanese area, is able to acquire eight images per day, thus allowing the analysis of rapid daily changes in water mass. The analysis of GOCI data shows that SPM concentration notably increased both along the coast and within the Bay of Sendai shortly after the tsunami. Motionless patterns of SPM were observed at 2, 14, 25, and 37 km from the coast. It is shown that SPM concentration rapidly decreased one month later. The SPM concentration did not remain high the following year, contrary to what was observed for the Sumatra Tsunami in 2004. The origin of SPM is also investigated in this study. Our analysis suggests that some of the SPM originates from the resuspension of bottom sediments due to the reflection of the tsunami on the coastline that leads to the migration of marine particles toward the sea surface. The fate of the SPM concentration is then discussed based on the analysis of meteorological conditions, river discharge, and tsunami wave properties.

TI  - Microplastic ingestion by the farmed sea cucumber <i>Apostichopus japonicus</i> in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Microplastic ingestion by the farmed sea cucumber is undocumented. Microplastics were isolated from the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus that was collected from eight farms along the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea in China. To examine microplastic ingestion, the intestines were isolated, digested and then subjected to the floatation test. The microplastic abundance in the sediment ranged from 20 to 1040 particles kg(-1) of dry sediment, while the ingested microplastics ranged from 0 to 30 particles intestine(-1). After filtering the coelomic fluid, the extracted microplastics from the coelomic fluid ranged from 0 to 19 particles animal(-1). Thus, we speculated that microplastics may transfer to the coelomic fluid of sea cucumber. The ingested micropiastics did not correlate with the animal body weight but was site dependent, suggesting that sea cucumber may serve as sentinel for microplastic pollution monitoring in the sediment. The microplastics were identified by Fourier transform infrared micro spectroscopy, and the polymer types were mainly cellophane, polyester, and polyethylene terephthalate. This study revealed that, microplastics widely existed in sea cucumber farms, and that sea cucumbers ingest microplastics as suitable with their mouth open. Moreover, the microptastics might transfer to the coelomic fluid of the sea cucumber. Further investigations are needed to assess the chronic effect of the microplastics on the growth and physiological status of the sea cucumber. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study explored the potentiality of integrating principal component analysis, minimum noise fraction, independent component analysis transformation and spectral ratioing of selected bands of Landsat 8 and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer for geological mapping in west Gebel Elba area, Halayeb district, South Eastern desert, Egypt. Data fusion of optical and radar remote sensing using Color Normalization Transformation showed an effective approach to further identify lithological units and rock boundaries. The Freeman-Durden decomposition method was used to determine the dominant scattering mechanisms and to identify the current state of the surface cover. This approach provided solution for geological mapping of the study area, which is impeded by difficult accessibility and could be generic methodology for similar studies. It enabled to identify and map rock units and lithological formations at range of validly from 73% for wadi deposits to 90 for quartz diorite.

TI  - Forest Spectral Recovery and Regeneration Dynamics in Stand-Replacing Wildfires of Central Apennines Derived from Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding post-fire regeneration dynamics is an important task for assessing the resilience of forests and to adequately guide post-disturbance management. The main goal of this research was to compare the ability of different Landsat-derived spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) to track post-fire recovery occurring in burned forests of the central Apennines (Italy) at different development stages. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2) and a novel index called Forest Recovery Index 2 (FRI2) were used to compute post-fire recovery metrics throughout 11 years (2008-2018). FRI2 achieved the highest significant correlation (Pearson's r = 0.72) with tree canopy cover estimated by field sampling (year 2017). The Theil-Sen slope estimator of linear regression was employed to assess the rate of change and the direction of SVIs recovery metrics over time (2010-2018) and the Mann-Kendall test was used to evaluate the significance of the spectral trends. NDVI displayed the highest amount of recovered pixels (38%) after 11 years since fire occurrence, whereas the mean value of NDMI, NBR, NBR2, and FRI2 was about 27%. NDVI was more suitable for tracking early stages of the secondary succession, suggesting greater sensitivity toward non-arboreal vegetation development. Predicted spectral recovery timespans based on pixels with a statistically significant monotonic trend did not highlight noticeable differences among normalized SVIs, suggesting similar suitability for monitoring early to mid-stages of post-fire forest succession. FRI2 achieved reliable results in mid- to long-term forest recovery as it produced up to 50% longer periods of spectral recovery compared to normalized SVIs. Further research is needed to understand this modeling approach at advanced stages of post-fire forest recovery.

TI  - OLCI-based NIR-red models for estimating chlorophyll-<i>a</i>concentration in productive coastal waters-a preliminary evaluation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present here results that demonstrate the potential of the recently launched Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard the satellite Sentinel-3A to deliver accurate estimates of chlorophyll-a(chl-a) concentration in coastal waters using reflectances in the red and near-infrared (NIR) spectral regions. Two-band and three-band NIR-red models that were previously used for data from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) were applied to OLCI data from the Sea of Azov and the Taganrog Bay, Russia. Atmospherically corrected reflectance data from OLCI were compared toin situreflectance data collected concurrently with a field spectrometer. Results show that the default atmospheric correction procedure currently applied to OLCI data performs well in preserving the spectral shape of chl-a-specific reflectance features in the red and NIR regions. Similar to what was achieved with MERIS data, the NIR-red models yield accurate estimates of chl-aconcentration, with accuracies on the order of 90%, though the parameters of the NIR-red algorithms based on OLCI data are slightly different from what was obtained with MERIS data. More data, from various geographical locations, need to be analyzed to establish robust NIR-red algorithms for OLCI data.

TI  - High-Resolution Multisensor Remote Sensing to Support Date Palm Farm Management
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Date palms are a valuable crop in areas with limited water availability such as the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, due to their hardiness in tough conditions. Increasing soil salinity and the spread of pests including the red palm weevil (RPW) are two examples of growing threats to date palm plantations. Separate studies have shown that thermal, multispectral, and hyperspectral remote sensing imagery can provide insight into the health of date palm plantations, but the added value of combining these datasets has not been investigated. The current study used available thermal, hyperspectral, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and visual Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images to investigate the possibilities of assessing date palm health at two "levels"; block level and individual tree level. Test blocks were defined into assumed healthy and unhealthy classes, and thermal and height data were extracted and compared. Due to distortions in the hyperspectral imagery, this data was only used for individual tree analysis; methods for identifying individual tree points using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps proved accurate. A total of 100 random test trees in one block were selected, and comparisons between hyperspectral, thermal and height data were made. For the vegetation index red-edge position (REP), the R-squared value in correlation with temperature was 0.313 and with height was 0.253. The vegetation index-the Vogelmann Red Edge Index (VOGI)-also has a relatively strong correlation value with both temperature (R-2 = 0.227) and height (R-2 = 0.213). Despite limited field data, the results of this study suggest that remote sensing data has added value in analyzing date palm plantations and could provide insight for precision agriculture techniques.

TI  - Monitoring Effects of Land Cover Change on Biophysical Drivers in Rangelands Using Albedo
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the relationship between land cover change and albedo, recognized as a regulating ecosystems service. Trends and relationships between land cover change and surface albedo were quantified to characterise catchment water and carbon fluxes, through respectively evapotranspiration (ET) and net primary production (NPP). Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat satellite data were used to describe trends at catchment and land cover change trajectory level. Peak season albedo was computed to reduce seasonal effects. Different trends were found depending on catchment land management practices, and satellite data used. Although not statistically significant, albedo, NPP, ET and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were all correlated with rainfall. In both catchments, NPP, ET and NDVI showed a weak negative trend, while albedo showed a weak positive trend. Modelled land cover change was used to calculate future carbon storage and water use, with a decrease in catchment carbon storage and water use computed. Grassland, a dominant dormant land cover class, was targeted for land cover change by woody encroachment and afforestation, causing a decrease in albedo, while urbanisation and cultivation caused an increase in albedo. Land cover map error of fragmented transition classes and the mixed pixel effect, affected results, suggesting use of higher-resolution imagery for NPP and ET and albedo as a proxy for land cover.

TI  - Local Perception of Drivers of Land-Use and Land-Cover Change Dynamics across Dedza District, Central Malawi Region
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) dynamics, and an understanding of the drivers responsible for these changes, are very crucial for modelling future LULC changes and the formulation of sustainable and robust land-management strategies and policy decisions. This study adopted a mixed method consisting of remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS)-based analysis, focus-group discussions, key informant interviews, and semi-structured interviews covering 586 households to assess LULC dynamics and associated LULC change drivers across the Dedza district, a central region of Malawi. GIS-based analysis of remotely sensed data revealed that barren land and built-up areas extensively increased at the expense of agricultural and forest land between 1991 and 2015. Analysis of the household-survey results revealed that the perceptions of respondents tended to validate the observed patterns during the remotely sensed data-analysis phase of the research, with 57.3% (n = 586) of the respondents reporting a decline in agricultural land use, and 87.4% (n = 586) observing a decline in forest areas in the district. Furthermore, firewood collection, charcoal production, population growth, and poverty were identified as the key drivers of these observed LULC changes in the study area. Undoubtedly, education has emerged as a significant factor influencing respondents' perceptions of these drivers of LULC changes. However, unsustainable LULC changes observed in this study have negative implications on rural livelihoods and natural-resource management. Owing to the critical role that LULC dynamics play to rural livelihoods and the ecosystem, this study recommends further research to establish the consequences of these changes. The present study and future research will support decision makers and planners in the design of tenable and coherent land-management strategies.

TI  - Shoreline mapping: how do Fuzzy Sigmoidal, Bayesian, and Demspter-Shafer classifications perform for different types of coasts?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined Fuzzy Sigmoidal, Bayesian, and Demspter-Shafer classifications to map shorelines in Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia for different types of coasts (CT). These three soft classification methods were applied to simulated Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre-5 (SPOT-5 with 10 and 20 m spatial resolutions) images covering the three shoreline locations which were typically different in shape and orientation: (a) rocky breakwater coasts (CT-1), (b) rocky and sandy airport coasts (CT-2), and (c) sandy beach coasts (CT-3) for predicting shorelines. Visual inspection and statistical measures showed that variations in accuracies were evident, predominantly due to differences in CTs; mapping accuracy decreased with an increase of spatial resolution, but accuracy increased if shorelines were aligned exact parallel to the column of pixel grid. Sigmoidal can predict shoreline over the CT-3 areas with greater accuracy than the other two methods and has less dependence on spatial resolutions for across the CTs. But effective use of Bayesian membership function for mapping shoreline over certain small and narrow jetty-like structures makes this classifier also efficient. The soft classifier assessed in this study produced reliable shoreline maps and should help shoreline change detection and monitoring from coarser spatial resolution imagery.

TI  - Epidemiology of human astroviruses among children younger than 5 years: Prospective hospital-based sentinel surveillance in South Africa, 2009-2014
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The epidemiology of human astroviruses (HAstVs) in hospitalised patients less than 5 years of age from selected sites in South Africa was investigated. Diarrheagenic stool specimens collected from April 2009 to May 2014 were screened retrospectively for selected viruses, bacteria and parasites. Method Patient data were analysed to identify epidemiologic factors most frequently detected with HAstV infections. The following case-comparisons were investigated; HAstV-positive and HAstV-negative children, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and HIV-uninfected (HAstV-positive) children and HIV-exposed and unexposed (HAstV-positive HIV-uninfected) children. Results Astrovirus was identified in 7.0% (234/3340) of cases and most frequently in ages 7 to 12 months (9.2%; 90/975) compared with 5.8% to 6.6% in other 6-month age groups. No seasonal trends were observed. More HAstVs were detected in children from homes that used outdoor water sources (7.6%) compared to indoor sources [5.7%; adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1; P = 0.009]. Astroviruses were detected in 8.4% (67/799) of HIV-uninfected patients that were exposed to HIV compared with 5.9% (74/1257) of HIV-unexposed patients (P = 0.032). Conclusion Astroviruses were most prevalent in children aged 7 to 12 months and were detected throughout the study period. The study was limited as only hospitalised patients were investigated and no comparisons were made to diarrhoea-free control groups. Future HAstV surveillance should include community-based studies and children presenting at outpatient facilities.

TI  - Change detection of bare-ice albedo in the Swiss Alps
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Albedo feedback is an important driver of glacier melt over bare-ice surfaces. Light-absorbing impurities strongly enhance glacier melt rates but their abundance, composition and variations in space and time are subject to considerable uncertainties and ongoing scientific debates. In this study, we assess the temporal evolution of shortwave broadband albedo derived from 15 end-of-summer Landsat scenes for the bare-ice areas of 39 large glaciers in the western and southern Swiss Alps. Trends in bare-ice albedo crucially depend on the spatial scale considered. No significant negative temporal trend in bare-ice albedo was found on a regional to glacier-wide scale. However, at higher spatial scales, certain areas of bare ice, including the lowermost elevations and margins of the ablation zones, revealed significant darkening over the study period 1999 to 2016. A total glacier area of 13.5 km(2) (equivalent to about 12% of the average endof- summer bare-ice area in the study area) exhibited albedo trends significant at the 95% confidence level or higher. Most of this area was affected by a negative albedo trend of about -0.05 decade(-1). Generally, bare-ice albedo exhibits a strong interannual variability, caused by a complex interplay of meteorological conditions prior to the acquisition of the data, local glacier characteristics and the date of the investigated satellite imagery. Although a darkening of glacier ice was found to be present over only a limited region, we emphasize that due to the recent and projected growth of bare-ice areas and prolongation of the ablation season in the region, the albedo feedback will considerably enhance the rate of glacier mass loss in the Swiss Alps in the near future.

TI  - Evaluation of TanDEMx and SRTM DEM on watershed simulated runoff estimation
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In hydrological models, digital elevation models (DEMs) are being used to extract stream network and delineation of the watershed. DEMs represent elevation surfaces of earth landscape. Spatial resolution refers to the dimension of the cell size representing the area covered on the ground. Spatial resolution is the main parameter of a DEM. The grid cell size of raster DEM has significant effects on derived terrain variables such as slope, aspect, curvature, the wetness index, etc. Selection of appropriate spatial resolution DEM depends on other input data being used in the model, type of application and analysis that needs to be performed, the size of the database and response time. Each DEM contains inherent errors due to the method of acquisition and processing. The accuracy of each DEM varies with spatial resolution. The present paper deals with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM DEMs) and compares their watershed delineation, slope, stream network and height with ground control points. It was found that the coarse resolution DEM-derived attributes and terrain morphological characteristics were strongly influenced by DEM accuracy. The objective of the present study is to investigate the impact of DEM resolution on topographic parameters and runoff estimation using TanDEM-12, TanDEM-30 and SRTM-90m with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. The analysis of the results using different DEM resolutions gave a varied number of sub-basins, Hydrological Response Units (HRUs) and watershed areas. The results were optimum at a specific threshold value as extraction of drainage network has a significant influence on simulated results. The accuracy of DEM is important, as the source of construction of DEM is the main factor causing uncertainty in the output. The results showed variable amounts of runoff at the watershed level, which may be attributed to varied stream lengths, minimum and maximum elevations and sub-basin areas.

TI  - Assessment and prediction of spatial patterns of human-elephant conflicts in changing land cover scenarios of a human-dominated landscape in North Bengal.
T2  - PLoS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of utmost importance to research on the spatial patterns of human-wildlife conflicts to understand the underlying mechanism of such interactions, i.e. major land use changes and prominent ecological drivers. In the north eastern part of India there has been a disparity between nature, economic development and fragmentation of wildlife habitats leading to intense conflicts between humans and Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in recent times. Both the elephant and human population have increased in the past few decades with large tracts of forests converted to commercial tea plantations, army camps and human settlements. We analyzed data maintained by the wildlife department on human deaths and injuries caused by elephant attacks between 2006-2016 to understand spatial and temporal patterns of human-elephant conflict, frequency and distribution. The average annual number of human deaths and injuries to elephant attacks between 2006 to 2016 was estimated to be 212 (SE 103) with the highest number of such incidents recorded in 2010-2011. Based on a grid based design of 5 km2 and 25 km2 resolution, the main spatial predictors of human-elephant conflicts identified through Maxent presence only models are annual mean precipitation, altitude, distance from protected area, area under forests, tea plantations and agriculture. Major land use changes were assessed for this region from 2008 to 2018 using satellite imageries in Arc GIS and a predicted imagery of 2028 was prepared using Idrisi Selva. Based on the 2018 imagery it was found that forest area had increased by 446 km2 within 10 years (2008-2018) and the annual rate of change was 12%. Area under agriculture had reduced by 128 km2 with an annual (-) rate of change of 2.5%. Area under tea plantation declined by 307 km2 with an annual (-) rate of change of 12% whereas area under human settlements increased by 61 km2 with an annual (-) rate of change of 44%. Hotspots of human-elephant conflicts were identified in an east west direction primarily around protected areas, tea plantations and along major riverine corridors. During informal interactions with farmers, tea estate labors it was revealed that local community members chased and harassed elephants from agriculture fields, human settlements under the influence of alcohol and thus were primary victims of fatal interactions. Our analytical approach can be replicated for other species in sites with similar issues of human-wildlife conflicts. The hot-spot maps of conflict risk will help in developing appropriate mitigation strategies such as setting up early warning systems, restoration of wildlife corridors especially along dry river beds, using deterrents and barriers for vulnerable. Awareness about alcohol related incidents and basic biology of elephants should be organized regularly involving non-governmental organizations targeting the marginalized farmers and tea estate workers.

AB  - It is of utmost importance to research on the spatial patterns of human-wildlife conflicts to understand the underlying mechanism of such interactions, i.e. major land use changes and prominent ecological drivers. In the north eastern part of India there has been a disparity between nature, economic development and fragmentation of wildlife habitats leading to intense conflicts between humans and Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in recent times. Both the elephant and human population have increased in the past few decades with large tracts of forests converted to commercial tea plantations, army camps and human settlements. We analyzed data maintained by the wildlife department on human deaths and injuries caused by elephant attacks between 2006-2016 to understand spatial and temporal patterns of human-elephant conflict, frequency and distribution. The average annual number of human deaths and injuries to elephant attacks between 2006 to 2016 was estimated to be 212 (SE 103) with the highest number of such incidents recorded in 2010-2011. Based on a grid based design of 5 km2 and 25 km2 resolution, the main spatial predictors of human-elephant conflicts identified through Maxent presence only models are annual mean precipitation, altitude, distance from protected area, area under forests, tea plantations and agriculture. Major land use changes were assessed for this region from 2008 to 2018 using satellite imageries in Arc GIS and a predicted imagery of 2028 was prepared using Idrisi Selva. Based on the 2018 imagery it was found that forest area had increased by 446 km2 within 10 years (2008-2018) and the annual rate of change was 12%. Area under agriculture had reduced by 128 km2 with an annual (-) rate of change of 2.5%. Area under tea plantation declined by 307 km2 with an annual (-) rate of change of 12% whereas area under human settlements increased by 61 km2 with an annual (-) rate of change of 44%. Hotspots of human-elephant conflicts were identified in an east west direction primarily around protected areas, tea plantations and along major riverine corridors. During informal interactions with farmers, tea estate labors it was revealed that local community members chased and harassed elephants from agriculture fields, human settlements under the influence of alcohol and thus were primary victims of fatal interactions. Our analytical approach can be replicated for other species in sites with similar issues of human-wildlife conflicts. The hot-spot maps of conflict risk will help in developing appropriate mitigation strategies such as setting up early warning systems, restoration of wildlife corridors especially along dry river beds, using deterrents and barriers for vulnerable. Awareness about alcohol related incidents and basic biology of elephants should be organized regularly involving non-governmental organizations targeting the marginalized farmers and tea estate workers.

TI  - Eruption frequency patterns through time for the current (1999-2018) activity cycle at Volcan de Fuego derived from remote sensing data: Evidence for an accelerating cycle of explosive paroxysms and potential implications of eruptive activity
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcan de Fuego is a stratovolcano in Guatemala that has produced over 50 VEI >= 2 eruptions since 1524. After two decades of quiescence, in 1999 Fuego entered a new period of eruptive activity that continues until the present day, characterized by persistent Strombolian activity interspersed with occasional "paroxysmal" eruptions of greater magnitude, the most recent of which occurred in 2018. The land surrounding Fuego accommodates tens of thousands of people, so greater understanding of its eruptive behaviour has important implications for hazard assessment. Nevertheless, there is relatively little literature that studies recent (since 1999) activity of Fuego in detail.Using time-series analysis of remote sensing thermal data during the period 2000-2018 combined with recent bulletin reports, we present evidence for a new eruptive regime beginning in 2015. We find that this regime is defined by a greater frequency of paroxysmal eruptions than in previous years and is characterized by the following sequence of events: (i) effusion of lava flows and increase in summit explosive activity, followed by (ii) an intense eruptive phase lasting 24-48 h, producing a sustained eruptive column, continuous explosions, and occasional pyroclastic flows, followed by (iii) decrease in explosive activity. We discuss various models that explain this increase in paroxysmal frequency, and consider its implications for hazard assessment at Fuego. We advocate the pairing of remote sensing data with monitoring reports for understanding long-term changes in behaviour of poorly-instrumented volcanoes. The results that we present here provide a standard for informed assessment of future episodes of unrest and paroxysmal eruptions of Fuego. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Urban Heat Island in an Urban Context: A Case Study of Mashhad, Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the spatio-temporal changes of urban heat island (UHI) in a mega city located in a semi-arid region and the relationships with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) are appraised using Landsat TM/OLI images with the help of ENVI and ArcGIS software. The results reveal that the relationships between NDBI, NDVI and land surface temperature (LST) varied by year in the study area and they are not suitable indices to study the land surface temperature in arid and semi-arid regions. The study also highlights the importance of weather conditions when appraising the relationship of these indices with land surface temperature. Overall, it can be concluded that LST in arid and steppe regions is most influenced by barren soil. As a result, built-up areas surrounded by soil or bituminous asphalt experience higher land surface temperatures compared to densely built-up areas. Therefore, apart from setting-up more green areas, an effective way to reduce the intensity of UHI in these regions is to develop the use of cool and smart pavements. The experiences from this paper may be of use to cities, many of which are struggling to adapt to a changing climate.

TI  - Land cover changes and fragmentation in mountain neotropical ecosystems of Oaxaca, Mexico under community forest management
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land cover have a direct impact on forest ecosystem goods and services. In this study, changes in land cover in Sierra de Juarez-Oaxaca ecosystems were estimated using a consistent processing of Landsat images and OBIA methodology. Additionally, landscape analyses using FRAGSTAT were conducted. In 2014, Sierra de Juarez-Oaxaca was covered by approximately 84% of forests, mainly pine-oak and cloud forests. After extensive deforestation until 2001, this trend was reversed and the forest cover surface area in 2014 was slightly higher than in 1979. The comparison of the landscape structure of the forested and agricultural lands suggests an increase in habitat heterogeneity. However, interspersion and juxtaposition indices, showing the patch shape by patch area and perimeter, were similar throughout the study period (1979-2014). Social and economic drivers can explain this situation: namely, community organization, forest enterprises, payment for ecosystem services programs, and changes of agricultural activity. Communities in the Sierra of Oaxaca have reforested degraded lands, created community forest enterprises, and preserved the forest under conservation schemes like those proposed by the Mexican payment for ecosystem services programs. However, their sustainable management faces internal challenges and has become highly dependent on political and institutional decisions beyond their control.

AB  - Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is a rare melanoma variant that has unique biology and pathology compared with conventional melanoma (non-DM). Importantly, DM is classified into pure and mixed histologic subtypes, which have been correlated with outcomes. Management of DM broadly mirrors that of non-DM; however, there are unique considerations for DM that influence treatment approaches. This paper will provide a contemporary overview of this disease and will review the literature regarding the management of DM.

TI  - The usefulness of alos-palsar dem data for drainage extraction in semi-arid environments in The Iishana sub-basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The study area is the Iishana sub-basin located in north-central Namibia. The basin is characterised by low-lying interconnected ephemeral drainage networks locally known as Iishana. In the past decade, the basin has experienced frequent droughts and flooding events due to recent weather anomalies possibly enhanced by the sprawling urban development.Study focus: Although extensive studies have been conducted on water availability in the basin, no attempts have been made to update existing hydrological maps which provide limited information on the impacts of geo-hydrological dynamics in the area. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite Digital Elevation Model (ALOS DEM) for drainage network extraction. ArcHydro tools were used for drainage feature extraction. Validation of extracted networks was based on field observations and delineated networks from earth observation data and Normalized Difference Wetness Index (NDWI). The accuracy of extracted drainage networks was assessed through visual observation of data overlay and the coefficient of line correspondence (CLC).New hydrological insights: The resulting drainage networks will be used to update the current hydrographic map of the area which will aid in the development of flood and drought mitigating measures for environmental management. The CLC computed metric obtained a 0.91 match between extracted and delineated drainage networks. The results show that ALOS DEM is capable of extracting drainage networks within the Iishana sub-basin.

TI  - Mapping Substrate Types and Compositions in Shallow Streams
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of riverbed compositions could enable advances in hydro-morphological and habitat modeling. Substrate mapping in fluvial systems has not received as much attention as in nearshore, optically shallow inland, and coastal waters. As finer spatial-resolution image data become more available, a need emerges to expand research on the remote sensing of riverbed composition. For instance, research to date has primarily been based on spectral reflectance data from above the water surface without accounting for attenuation by the water-column. This study analyzes the impacts of water-column correction for substrate mapping in shallow fluvial systems (depth < 1 m). To do so, we performed three different experiments: (a) analyzing spectroscopic measurements in a hydraulic laboratory setting, (b) simulating water-leaving radiances under various optical scenarios, and (c) evaluating the potential to map bottom composition from a WorldView-3 (WV3) image of a river in Northern Italy. Following the retrieval of depth and diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d), bottom reflectances were estimated using a water-column correction method. The results indicated significant enhancements in streambed maps based on bottom reflectances relative to maps produced from above-water spectra. Accounting for deep-water reflectance, embedded in the water-column correction, was demonstrated to have the greatest impact on the retrieval of bottom reflectance in NIR bands, when the water column is relatively thick (>0.5 m) and/or when the water is turbid. We also found that the WV3's red-edge band (i.e., 724 nm) considerably improved the characterization of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) densities from either above-water or retrieved bottom spectra. This study further demonstrated the feasibility of mapping SAV density classes from a WV3 image of the Sarca River in Italy by retrieving the bottom reflectances.

T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree cover in China has undergone massive changes through deforestation, reforestation, and afforestation during the last 60 years. This study investigates the distribution of tree cover in the eastern part of China in 2010, and how it is related to climate, topography, and anthropogenic pressure. We use random forest modeling of remote sensing data for tree cover, together with data for topography, climate, and anthropogenic pressure. Our results show that 2,136,000 km(2) had tree cover >= 25% in the eastern part of China in 2010 and that the areas with high tree cover were mainly distributed in north-eastern, southern, and south-central China. The variable that best explains the distribution of tree cover is actual evapotranspiration followed by slope and population density. The association between slope and tree cover increases as population density rises, suggesting that the association may be influenced by anthropogenic land use intensity and that slopes act as refugees for forests. Our study emphasizes the need to pay attention to the association between slope and tree cover and especially to the anthropogenic factors that, entirely or to some extent, drive this association.

TI  - Impact of preservation techniques on pteropod shell condition
T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pteropods have been a key focus of ocean acidification studies during the last decade due to their fragile aragonite shells and key role they play in polar ecosystems. Pteropods collected at sea are typically preserved before analysis at onshore laboratories. Despite the importance placed on pteropods as a sentinel for the impact of ocean acidification on marine calcifiers, there has never been a systematic study assessing how different preservation techniques affect the condition of pteropod shells. In this study we perform an experiment to assess the impact of six preservation techniques on the shell condition of Limacina retroversa pteropods. Using five shell condition-assessment methods, we find shells that were air dried were the least altered relative to the time of collection. Of the solution-based preservation techniques, shells were least altered when preserved in 70% buffered ethanol and most altered in a solution of sodium chloride buffered formalin. Our results have implications for the interpretation of pteropod shell condition in samples which have been stored in solution, and provide guidelines for the preservation of future pteropod collections.

TI  - Enhancing the standardized drought vulnerability index by integrating spatiotemporal information from satellite and in situ data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a complex natural hazard with its adverse multifaceted impacts cascading in every physical and human system. The vulnerability magnitude of various areas to drought mostly depends on their exposure to water deficiency, the existing water management policy framework and its implementation. The Standardized Drought Vulnerability Index (SDVI) is an integrated attempt towards characterizing drought vulnerability based on a comparative classification system, incorporating precipitation patterns, the supply and demand trends, and the socioeconomic background as the most crucial contributors to drought vulnerability. This work attempts to evolve the SDVI by presenting a more rigorous method of index parameters estimation and argues that the combination of in-situ and satellite data improve the index results in an effort to further minimize the paucity of drought related information. At the same time, it helps to surpass previous limitations in temporal and spatial propagation of the vulnerability concept. The new framework is applied in the South Platte Basin, within Colorado, on the 2012 summer drought (July-September). The proposed index modification may convey drought information in a more holistic manner to decision makers. SDVI could aid in advancing the understanding of each component contribution through in situ and remote sensing data integration and in avoiding existing practices of broken linkages and fragmentation of the reported impacts. Thus, it is believed that the SDVI could serve as an additional tool to guide decisions and target mitigation and adaptation actions, allowing for a more integrated management approach.

KCB is located in the semi-arid central Anatolian region of Turkey and hosts many important wetland sites including Salt Lake. Six Landsat-5 TM images selected from the 1984-2011 period were used in the analysis. A real-time field work was performed during the overpass of Landsat-5 satellite on 21/08/2011 over Salt Lake to collect coordinated temperature measurements using a handheld GPS and thermal infrared thermometer. All satellite images were geometrically and radiometrically corrected to relate the image data with in-situ measurements. Thematic LST images were used to evaluate the conditions over the region between 1984 and 2011. The results show that real-time ground temperature and satellite remote sensing data were in good agreement with correlation coefficient (R2) values of 0.94. The remotely sensed and processed satellite images and resulting thematic indices maps show that dramatic land surface temperature changes occurred (about 2 degrees C) in the KCB from 1984 to 2011. Analysis of climatic data supports this finding. Air temperatures and pan evaporation had significant upward trends from 1984 to 2011. Analysis conducted using both LST and climatic data prove that the basin has been experiencing drought in recent years. It is suggested that the use of water supplies, especially ground water should be controlled taking into account particularly summer drought impacts over the basin.

TI  - Spreading dynamics of small river plumes off the northeastern coast of the Black Sea observed by Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We use near simultaneous ocean color satellite imagery from NASA's Landsat 8 and ESA's Sentinel-2 missions to reconstruct surface currents along the northeastern shore of the Black Sea and study the spread of a small river plume formed in this area. Several times a year Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellites both pass over the study area within a time interval of < 10 min. Analysis of near simultaneous ocean color composites obtained during these periods provides an opportunity for accurate reconstruction of surface currents. It is especially efficient for detecting motion of frontal zones associated with river plumes which are visible in optical satellite imagery. Using an optical flow algorithm we reconstructed surface currents associated with the motion of a small plume formed by the Mzymta River in response to different wind forcing conditions. We show that the dynamics of the Mzymta plume are significantly different to those of large plumes. First, a near-field jet of the small plume is abruptly decelerated by friction with the subjacent ocean and does not form a recirculating bulge even under low wind forcing conditions. As a result, freshwater discharge does not accumulate near the river mouth and is transported to the far-field part of the plume. Second, under certain external forcing conditions the angle between wind direction and Ekman transport within the plume takes anomalously large values of 60-80 degrees. As a result, onshore winds cause upstream accumulation of the river plume, while offshore/downwelling and up-welling winds result in downstream and offshore transport of freshwater discharge, respectively.

TI  - Separating Built-Up Areas from Bare Land in Mediterranean Cities Using Sentinel-2A Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research work, a multi-index-based support vector machine (SVM) classification approach has been proposed to determine the complex and morphologically heterogeneous land cover/use (LCU) patterns of cities, with a special focus on separating bare lands and built-up regions, using Istanbul, Turkey as the main study region, and Ankara and Konya (in Turkey) as the independent test regions. The multi-index approach was constructed using three-band combinations of spectral indices, where each index represents one of the three major land cover categories, green areas, water bodies, and built-up regions. Additionally, a shortwave infrared-based index, the Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI), was proposed as an alternative to existing built-up indices. All possible index combinations and the original ten-band Sentinel-2A image were classified with the SVM algorithm, to map seven LCU classes, and an accuracy assessment was performed to determine the multi-index combination that provided the highest performance. The SVM classification results revealed that the multi-index combination of the normalized difference tillage index (NDTI), the red-edge-based normalized vegetation index (NDVIre), and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) improved the mapping accuracy of the heterogeneous urban areas and provided an effective separation of bare land from built-up areas. This combination showed an outstanding overall performance with a 93% accuracy and a 0.91 kappa value for all LCU classes. The results of the test regions provided similar findings and the same index combination clearly outperformed the other approaches, with 92% accuracy and a 0.90 kappa value for Ankara, and an 84% accuracy and a 0.79 kappa value for Konya. The multi-index combination of the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), the NDVIre, and the MNDWI, ranked second in the assessment, with similar accuracies to that of the ten-band image classification.

TI  - The CanMars Mars Sample Return analogue mission
T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The return of samples from known locations on Mars is among the highest priority goals of the international planetary science community. A possible scenario for Mars Sample Return (MSR) is a series of 3 missions: sample cache, fetch, and retrieval. The NASA Mars 2020 mission represents the first cache mission and was the focus of the CanMars analogue mission described in this paper. The major objectives for CanMars included comparing the accuracy of selecting samples remotely using rover data versus a traditional human field party, testing the efficiency of remote science operations with periodic pre-planned strategic observations (Strategic Traverse Days), assessing the utility of realistic autonomous science capabilities to the remote science team, and investigating the factors that affect the quality of sample selection decision-making in light of returned sample analysis.CanMars was conducted over two weeks in November 2015 and continued over three weeks in October and November 2016 at an analogue site near Hanksville, Utah, USA, that was unknown to the Mission Control Team located at the University of Western Ontario (Western) in London, Ontario, Canada. This operations architecture for CanMars was based on the Phoenix and Mars Exploration Rover missions together with previous analogue missions led by Western with the Mission Control Team being divided into Planning and Science sub-teams. In advance of the 2015 operations, the Science Team used satellite data, chosen to mimic datasets available from Mars-orbiting instruments, to produce a predictive geological map for the landing ellipse and a set of hypotheses for the geology and astrobiological potential of the landing site. The site was proposed to consist of a series of weakly cemented multi-coloured sedimentary rocks comprising carbonates, sulfates, and clays, and sinuous ridges with a resistant capping unit, interpreted as inverted paleochannels.Both the 2015 CanMars mission, which achieved 11 sols of operations, and the first part of the 2016 mission (sols 12-21), were conducted with the Mars Exploration Science Rover (MESR) and a series of integrated and hand-held instruments designed to mimic the payload of the Mars 2020 rover. Part 2 of the 2016 campaign (sols 22-39) was implemented without the MESR rover and was conducted exclusively by the field team as a Fast Motion Field Test (FMFT) with hand-carried instruments and with the equivalent of three sols of operations being executed in a single actual day. A total of 8 samples were cached during the 39 sols from which the Science Team prioritized 3 for "return to Earth". Various science autonomy capabilities, based on flight proven or near-future techniques intended for actual rover missions, were tested throughout the 2016 CanMars activities, with autonomous geological classification and targeting and autonomous pointing refinement being used extensively during the FMFT. Blind targeting, contingency sequencing, and conditional sequencing were also employed.Validation of the CanMars cache mission was achieved through various methods and approaches. The use of dedicated documentarians in mission control provided a detailed record of how and why decisions were made. Multiple separate field validation exercises employing humans using traditional geological techniques were carried out. All 8 of the selected samples plus a range of samples from the landing site region, collected out-of simulation, have been analysed using a range of laboratory analytical techniques. A variety of lessons learned for both future analogue missions and planetary exploration missions are provided, including: dynamic collaboration between the science and planning teams as being key for mission success; the more frequent use of spectrometers and micro-imagers having remote capabilities rather than contact instruments; the utility of strategic traverse days to provide additional time for scientific discussion and meaningful interpretation of the data; the benefit of walkabout traverse strategies along with multi-sol plans with complex decisions trees to acquire a large amount of contextual data; and the availability of autonomous geological targeting, which enabled complex multi-sol plans gathering large suites of geological and geochemical survey data.Finally, the CanMars MSR activity demonstrated the utility of analogue missions in providing opportunities to engage and educate children and the public, by providing tangible hands-on linkages between current robotic missions and future human space missions. Public education and outreach was a priority for CanMars and a dedicated lead coordinated a strong presence on social media (primarily Twitter and Facebook), articles in local, regional, and national news networks, and interaction with the local community in London, Ontario. A further core objective of CanMars was to provide valuable learning opportunities to students and post-doctoral fellows in preparation for future planetary exploration missions. A learning goals survey conducted at the end of the 2016 activities had 90% of participants "somewhat agreeing" or "strongly agreeing" that participation in the mission has helped them to increase their understanding of the four learning outcomes.

TI  - The sentineling-Foraging trade-off in dominant and subordinate Arabian babblers
T2  - ETHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many cooperative breeders forage under predation risks, sentineling is a central activity, and groupmates have to balance between sentineling and foraging. The optimal balance between sentinel activity and foraging may differ among dominant and subordinate individuals, as dominants are more efficient foragers. Two theoretical models pertain to this balance and predict when individuals with different foraging abilities should switch between the two activities on the basis of their energetic state. In one of these models, individuals must attain a critical energetic level by dusk to pass the night, and in the second model fitness is monotonically increasing with the energetic state. We tested these models in the cooperatively breeding Arabian babbler, Turdoides squamiceps. We measured the length of sentinel bouts and the gaps between them both in natural conditions and following experimental feeding. Following feeding ad libitum, subordinates expanded their sentinel bouts significantly more than dominants in comparison with natural conditions. These findings are consistent with the first model, but not with the second. In the experiment, we measured the mass of mealworms consumed by each individual following a sentinel bout relative to its body mass. This ratio was larger for subordinates, indicating that they ended their sentinel bouts at a lower energetic state than dominants. This finding is consistent with the second model, but not with the first. Immediately after eating ad libitum, in 62% of the cases the first behavior performed by the babblers was a new sentinel bout, but in 17% it was a mutual interaction with a groupmate, indicating that social interactions also play a role in the trade-off vis-a-vis sentinel activity.

TI  - Remote sensing of cropping practice in Northern Italy using time-series from Sentinel-2
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Maps of cropping practice, including the level of weed infestation, are useful planning tools e.g. for the assessment of the environmental impact of the crops, and Northern Italy is an important example due to the large and diverse agricultural production and the high weed infestation. Sentinel-2A is a new satellite with a high spatial and temporal resolution which potentially allows the creation of detailed maps of cropping practice including weed infestation. To explore the applicability of Sentinel-2A for mapping cropping practice, we analysed the Normalised Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series from five weed-infested crop fields as well as the areas designated as non-irrigated agricultural land in Corine Land Cover, which also contributed to an increased understanding of the cropping practice in the region. The analysis of the case studies showed that the temporal resolution of Sentinel-2A was high enough to distinguish the gross features of the cropping practice, and that high weed infestations can be detected at this spatial resolution. The analysis of the entire region showed the potential for mapping cropping practice using Sentinel-2. In conclusion, Sentinel-2A is to some extent applicable for mapping cropping practice with reasonable thematic accuracy.

TI  - Hospitalization for Respiratory Syncytial Virus Bronchiolitis in the Palivizumab Prophylaxis Era: Need for Reconsideration of Preventive Timing and Eligibility
T2  - ISRAEL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related bronchiolitis is a common cause of morbidity in young infants. The recommendations for its passive prevention by palivizumab are currently under intensive debate.Objectives: To elucidate the optimal prevention strategy by studying the morbidity of RSV disease under the current recommendations for palivizumab prophylaxis in Israel.Methods: We collected demographic and clinical data of all children hospitalized with microbiologically confirmed RSV bronchiolitis during 2015-2016 at Schneider Children's Medical Center. The seasonality of RSV disease was also studied for the period 2010-2017 in sentinel clinics scattered throughout Israel.Results: Of the 426 hospitalized children, 106 (25%) had underlying diseases but were not eligible for palivizumab prophylaxis according to the current criteria in Israel. Their course was severe, with a mean hospital stay of 6.7 days and a 12% admission rate to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Palivizumab-eligible children who did not receive the prophylaxis before hospitalization had the most severe course, with 22% admitted to the PICU. More children were diagnosed with RSV disease in October than in March among both hospitalized and ambulatory children; 44% of the palivizumab-eligible hospitalized children were admitted in the last 2 weeks of October, before 1 November which is the recommended date for starting palivizumab administration in Israel.Conclusions: According to the results of the present study we suggest advancing RSV prophylaxis in Israel from 1 November to mid-October. The precise palivizumab-eligible categories should be reconsidered.

TI  - Mapping terrestrial oil spill impact using machine learning random forest and Landsat 8 OLI imagery: a case site within the Niger Delta region of Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial oil pollution is one of the major causes of ecological damage within the Niger Delta region of Nigeria and has caused a considerable loss of mangroves and arable croplands since the discovery of crude oil in 1956. The exact extent of landcover loss due to oil pollution remains uncertain due to the variability in factors such as volume and size of the oil spills, the age of oil, and its effects on the different vegetation types. Here, the feasibility of identifying oil-impacted land in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria with a machine learning random forest classifier using Landsat 8 (OLI spectral bands) and Vegetation Health Indices is explored. Oil spill incident data for the years 2015 and 2016 were obtained from published records of the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency and Shell Petroleum Development Corporation. Various health indices and spectral wavelengths from visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared bands were fused and classified using the machine learning random forest classifier to distinguish between oil-free and oil spill-impacted landcover. This provided the basis for the identification of the best variables for discriminating oil polluted from unpolluted land. Results showed that better results for discriminating oil-free and oil polluted landcovers were obtained when individual landcover types were classified separately as opposed to when the full study area image including all landcover types was classified at once. Similarly, the results also showed that biomass density plays a significant role in the characterization and classification of oil contaminated and oil-free pixels as tree cover areas showed higher classification accuracy compared to cropland and grassland.

TI  - Modeling Winter Wheat Leaf Area Index and Canopy Water Content With Three Different Approaches Using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) and canopy water content (CWC) are important variables for monitoring crop growth and drought, which can be estimated from remotely sensed data. The goal of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (S2 MSI) data for winter wheat LAI and CWC estimation with three different inversion approaches in the main farming region in North China. During the winter wheat key growth stages in 2017, 22 fields, each with five independent samples, the total number of sample plot is 110, were designed for experimental measurements. In this study, the LAI and CWC were retrieved separately using empirical models through different spectral indices, neural network (NN) algorithms, and lookup table (LUT) methods based on the PROSAIL model. The accuracies of the estimated LAI and CWC were assessed through in situ measurements. The results show that the LUT inversion approach was more suitable for LAI and CWC estimation than the spectral index-based empirical model or the NN algorithm. With the LUT approach, LAI was obtained with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.43m(2).m(-2) and a relative RMSE (RRMSE) of 11% using seven S2MSI bands, and CWC was obtained with an RMSE of 0.41 kg.m(-2), and an RRMSE of 32% using five S2 MSI bands. In all the three methods, S2MSI was sensitive to LAI variation and able to reach higher accuracies when red edge bands were used. However, CWC inversion was still a challenge using S2 MSI data.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy for treatment of endometrial cancer: current perspectives
T2  - MINERVA GINECOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - The risk of lymph nodal metastases in endometrial cancer varies greatly according to the characteristics of the primary tumor. Surgical staging with a systematic lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer is debated since three decades. On one hand, it provides important pathological information on the spread of the tumor allowing for an appropriate decision making on adjuvant treatment but on the other side it is characterized by a non-negligible short and long-term morbidity. In the past decade, various efforts have been made in the attempt to apply the concept of the sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer. The sentinel lymph node mapping has the potential to provide the necessary pathological lymph nodal information at a reasonable cost in terms of morbidity. In this review, the most relevant aspects of the sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer are summarized. Furthermore, the performance in terms of false negative rates and detection rates, the clinical value of the pathological ultrastaging, its clinical applicability in different scenarios including patients preoperatively considered to be at low or at high risk are discussed. Oncological outcome of the patients who have been submitted to a sentinel lymph node mapping as compared to a full lymhadenectomy are presented as well as technical aspects to improve the performance of the surgical technique.

The volcano deformation state following the unrest was investigated through multi-sensor Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) time series. We focused on the analysis of Copernicus Sentinel-1, Radarsat-2 and TerraSAR-X Multi-temporal SAR Interferometric (MT-InSAR) results, for the post-unrest period 2012-17. Data from multiple Sentinel-1 tracks and acquisition geometries were used to constrain the E-W and vertical components of the deformation field along with their evolution in time. The interpretation of the InSAR observations and modelling provided insights on the post-unrest deformation pattern of the volcano, allowing the further re-evaluation of the unrest event. The increase of subsidence rates on Nea Kameni, in accordance with the observed change of the spatial deformation pattern, compared to the pre-unrest period, suggests the superimposition of various deformation sources. Best-fitting inversion results indicate two deflation sources located at southwestern Nea Kameni at 1 km depth, and in the northern intra-caldera area at 2 km depth. A northern sill-like source interprets the post-unrest deflation attributed to the passive degassing of the magma intruded at 4 km during the unrest, while an isotropic source at Nea Kameni simulates a prevailing subsidence occurring since the pre-unrest period (1992-2010).

TI  - Large lake gauging using fractional imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large floodplain lakes provide riparian habitat, are sediment and nutrient sinks, help control flow connectivity and flooding along rivers, and are both used by humans and strongly impacted by human activity. However, water level in many remote large floodplain lakes, especially in developing countries, is often monitored inconsistently or not at all. In this study, a novel method for estimating large lake water level using passive, optical remote sensing data combined with any digital elevation model (DEM) is presented. The method obtains water level estimates at 30 m(2) resolution using Landsat, in this case in conjunction with SRTM elevation data, nested within a 240 m(2) grid "fishnet". A probabilistic mean of elevation values for all water-designated pixels (between 5% and 95% filled within each grid) produces lake water levels often accurate to within +/- 50 cm of gauged reference data on Lake Curuai in the Amazon River and Tonle Sap Lake along the Mekong River. The method is relatively insensitive to cloud cover, especially as lake size increases. This study is the first to use solely passive optical remote sensing data for water level estimation and thus could be used to produce accurate, long-term estimations of water level in many large lakes globally. The use of optical sensors to obtain lake water level is both an important complement and potential alternative to methods that use active sensors.

TI  - An Extraction of Solar-contaminated Energy Part from MODIS Middle Infrared Channel Measurement to Detect Forest Fires
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we have proposed an improved method to detect forest fires by correcting the reflected signals of day images using the middle-wavelength infrared (MWIR) channel. The proposed method is allowed to remove the reflected signals only using the image itself without an existing data source such as a land-cover map or atmospheric data. It includes the processing steps for calculating a solar-reflected signal such as 1) a simple correction model of the atmospheric transmittance for the MWIR channel and 2) calculating the image-based reflectance. We tested the performance of the method using the MODIS product. When compared to the conventional MODIS fire detection algorithm (MOD14 collection 6), the total number of detected fires was improved by approximately 17%. Most of all, the detection of fires improved by approximately 30% in the high reflection areas of the images. Moreover, the false alarm caused by artificial objects was clearly reduced and a confidence level analysis of the undetected fires showed that the proposed method had much better performance. The proposed method would be applicable to most satellite sensors with MWIR and thermal infrared channels. Especially for geostationary satellites such as GOES-R, HIMAWARI-8/9 and GeoKompsat-2A, the short acquisition time would greatly improve the performance of the proposed fire detection algorithm because reflected signals in the geostationary satellite images frequently vary according to solar zenith angle.

TI  - The Evolving Role of FDG-PET/CT in the Diagnosis, Staging, and Treatment of Breast Cancer
T2  - MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The applications of 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) in the management of patients with breast cancer have been extensively studied. According to these studies, PET/CT is not routinely performed for the diagnosis of primary breast cancer, although PET/CT in specific subtypes of breast cancer correlates with histopathologic features of the primary tumor. PET/CT can detect metastases to mediastinal, axial, and internal mammary nodes, but it cannot replace the sentinel node biopsy. In detection of distant metastases, this imaging tool may have a better accuracy in detecting lytic bone metastases compared to bone scintigraphy. Thus, PET/CT is recommended when advanced-stage disease is suspected, and conventional modalities are inconclusive. Also, PET/CT has a high sensitivity and specificity to detect loco-regional recurrence and is recommended in asymptomatic patients with rising tumor markers. Numerous studies support the future role of PET/CT in prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). PET/CT has a higher diagnostic value for prognostic risk stratification in comparison with conventional modalities. With the continuing research on the treatment planning and evaluation of patients with breast cancer, the role of PET/CT can be further extended.

T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Oncotype DXA (R) assay has been validated in predicting response to adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Its role in neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) has not been established.The National Cancer Database was used to identify all patients with T1-T3, ER-positive, HER2-negative primary invasive breast cancer diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 who had Oncotype DX recurrence scores (RS) and received NCT. RS were classified as low, intermediate, or high. Unadjusted and adjusted regression analyses were performed to determine the association between pathologic complete response (pCR) and RS.A total of 989 patients (mean age, 54.6 years) with available RS who underwent NCT were identified. RS were low in 227 (23.0%) patients, intermediate in 450 (45.5%) patients, and high in 312 (31.5%) patients. Most patients had a T1 (431 [43.6%]) or T2 tumor (451 [45.6%]). Most had N0 disease (757 [76.5%]). Tumor grades were 1 (123 [12.4%]), 2 (517 [52.3%]), or 3 (349 [35.3%]). pCR was achieved by 42 (4.3%) patients. Adjusted multivariable analysis showed a significant association between pCR and high RS (odds ratio 4.87; 95% confidence interval 2.01-11.82).High Oncotype DX RS was associated with pCR after NCT in this national cohort of ER-positive, HER2-negative patients. Oncotype DX testing could help to identify patients most suited for NCT and should be considered for incorporation into the multidisciplinary decision-making process.

TI  - The ability of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer land surface temperatures to simulate cold air drainage and microclimates in complex Arctic terrain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic has experienced the most rapid warming in the world in recent decades. Complex topography combines with low solar elevation to create distinct microclimates in Arctic regions, and for many applications such as ecological response and cryospheric change it is critical to obtain reliable temperature trends at the local scale. Due to lack of weather stations, satellite land surface temperature (LST) is increasingly important as a proxy for air temperature (T-air), but how accurately it can represent microclimates is unknown. For the first time, we compare 10 years (2007-2017) of T-air recorded over a dense network of 65 sites (25km(2)) around Kevo Subarctic Research Station in Finland with equivalent moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST at 1 km resolution from MOD11A2/MYD11A2 8-day products. We assess whether LST can pick up the extreme local gradients in air temperature (>20 degrees C/km) caused by cold air drainage. Although there is a high correspondence between LST and T-air anomalies on a synoptic timescale, small-scale patterns in T-air (lapse rates, aspect contrasts) are not picked up by LST. Temperature gradients in T-air become positive (temperature inversions) in winter, and at night, but LST gradients show almost the reverse. Aspect contrasts in T-air peak in spring and autumn during the day, but LST shows biggest differences in the evening. Land cover has a large influence on LST, tundra heating up/cooling down more than birch or pine forest. The conflation between land cover and elevation means that differential land-cover response dominates the elevational LST signal. Contrasts between T-air and LST cannot be explained by the number of stations measuring T-air in a pixel, elevation error, timing differences or the frequency of cloud cover within the 8-day composite. Important features of the Arctic climate such as microscale cold air drainage are thus potentially obscured by land-cover effects.

TI  - Management of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Merkel Cell Carcinoma: Completion Lymphadenectomy, Radiation, or Both?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Approximately 30% of patients with clinically localized Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) show nodal involvement on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Optimal management of SLNB-positive disease has not been defined. This study compared outcomes after completion lymphadenectomy (CLND), radiation, and combined CLND plus radiation after a positive SLNB.Methods. All patients treated at a single institution for SLNB-positive MCC (1998-2015) were retrospectively evaluated, with examination of patient demographics, clinicopathologic characteristics, outcomes, and regional toxicity.Results. The study identified 71 evaluable patients with SLNB-positive disease. The median age of these patients was 76 years, and 76.1% were men. Of the 71 patients, 11 (15.5%) underwent CLND, 40 (56.3%) received radiation, and 20 (28.2%) underwent CLND plus postoperative radiation. Lymphovascular invasion was significantly more common in the radiation-alone cohort (p = 0.04). For the three cohorts, the median percentages of nodal involvement were respectively 2, 10, and 30% (p = 0.06). After a median follow-up period of 22.3 months, four patients had recurrence in their regional nodal basin (3 radiation-alone patients and 1 CLND + radiation patient). The three cohorts did not differ significantly in the development of distant metastases (p = 0.68) or overall survival (p = 0.72). Six patients experienced surgical-site infections (2 CLND and 4 CLND + radiation patients), and three patients experienced symptomatic lymphedema (1 CLND patient and 2 CLND + radiation patients).Conclusions. Regional failure was infrequent (<= 10%) regardless of treatment, and morbidity appeared to be low with all approaches. Given that multiple treatment approaches can be successful in treating micrometastatic MCC, future efforts should be directed at refining criteria for allocating patients to a specific method, or possibly no further nodal basin treatment, in an effort to maximize regional control at the lowest cost and morbidity.

TI  - Predicting risk for seroma development after axillary or inguinal sentinel lymph node biopsy in melanoma patients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is currently a routine procedure in the staging of patients with cutaneous melanoma; however, little information is available about the risk factors for postoperative complications, especially for the risk of seroma formation. Methods Medical records of patients undergoing SLNB at the University Hospital of Cologne, Germany, between 2011 and 2016, were reviewed. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the influence of a wide range of variables on seroma development. Results A total of 615 patients were included in the study. Overall, 20.4% of patients developed complications with seroma being the most common postoperative complication. Development of seroma was significantly more common among smokers than nonsmokers (OR = 1.956, P = 0.007). Inguinal localization (OR = 3.644, P < 0.0001) was also associated with seroma formation. Male patients developed a seroma significantly more often than female patients following SLNB (OR = 2.104, P = 0.001). The presence or absence of metastasis in the lymph node did not influence seroma development. Conclusions Male sex, inguinal localization, and smoking are risk factors for the development of seroma.

TI  - MODIS BRDF effects over Brazilian tropical forests and savannahs: a comparative analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects over Brazilian tropical forests (Amazon) and savannahs (Cerrado) were inspected for differences in high-quality pixel retrievals, view direction, view zenith angle (VZA), solar zenith angle (SZA) and relative azimuth angle (RAA). By comparing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, corrected and non-corrected for BRDF effects (2000-2014), we evaluated the magnitude of such effects over reflectance and vegetation indices (VIs). The VIs were the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). From the Amazon to the Cerrado, we observed a higher frequency of high-quality pixel retrievals, a decrease in VZA, and an increase in seasonal SZA amplitude. Brightness increased in the backscattering direction and with shifts in RAA over tropical forests toward the BRDF hotspot at the end of dry season (September). Compared to the savannahs from the Cerrado or those from northern Amazon, stronger BRDF effects were observed for Amazonian tropical forests and for the EVI. BRDF changes in the dry season NDVI amplitude (NDVISept minus NDVIJune) were lower than 5% for both biomes. For the EVI amplitude, we observed changes up to 20% over the savannahs and close to 60% for most of the Amazon. However, even after BRDF correction and in spite of the observed differences close to 0.02, EVI values from June and September were still statistically different from each other.

TI  - Mapping pan-European land cover using Landsat spectral-temporal metrics and the European LUCAS survey
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed, for the first time, the potential of combining the large European-wide land survey LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey) and Landsat-8 data for mapping pan-European land cover and land use. We used annual and seasonal spectral-temporal metrics and environmental features to map 12 land cover and land use classes across Europe. The spectral-temporal metrics provided an efficient means to capture seasonal variations of land surface spectra and to reduce the impact of clouds and cloud-shadows by relaxing the otherwise strong cloud cover limitations imposed by image-based classification methods. The best classification model was based on Landsat-8 data from three years (2014-2016) and achieved an accuracy of 75.1%, nearly 2 percentage points higher than the classification model based on a single year of Landsat data (2015). Our results indicate that annual pan-European land cover maps are feasible, but that temporally dynamic classes like artificial land, cropland, and grassland still benefit from more frequent satellite observations. The produced pan-European land cover map compared favorably to the existing CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) 2012 land cover dataset. The mapped country-wide area proportions strongly correlated with LUCAS-estimated area proportions (r = 0.98). Differences between mapped and LUCAS sample-based area estimates were highest for broadleaved forest (map area was 9% higher). Grassland and seasonal cropland areas were 7% higher than the LUCAS estimate, respectively. In comparison, the correlation between LUCAS and CORINE area proportions was weaker (r = 0.84) and varied strongly by country. CORINE substantially overestimated seasonal croplands by 63% and underestimated grassland proportions by 37%. Our study shows that combining current state-of-the-art remote sensing methods with the large LUCAS database improves pan-European land cover mapping. Although this study focuses on European land cover, the unique combination of large survey data and machine learning of spectral-temporal metrics, may also serve as a reference case for other regions. The pan-European land cover map for 2015 developed in this study is available under https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.896282.

TI  - Quantifying the trade-off between cost and precision in estimating area of forest loss and degradation using probability sampling in Guyana
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Guyana is a high forest cover, low deforestation country. Since 2011-2014 the Guyana Forestry Commission (GFC) has used visual interpretation of 5 m resolution RapidEye imagery to map forest loss and nearby degradation for the entire country. According to the GFC produced national map, 58% of all forest loss events cover less than 1 ha, so forest loss is very rare and occurs at a scale that can be difficult to detect and monitor. Nearly all (similar to 97%) of the forest loss and nearby degradation is due to small-scale mining and its associated infrastructure. For any country wanting to accurately map and monitor forest loss, sample-based area estimation can be considerably less expensive than wall-to-wall mapping. To quantify the tradeoff between precision and cost, we evaluated the standard errors of area estimators for several sample-based strategies using Guyana as a case study. We partitioned Guyana into 374 blocks, with each block 24 km x 24 km to align with the image tiles provided by RapidEye's 3A product. The area of forest loss and area of degradation for each of the 374 blocks were determined from the GFC map to create the population data used to evaluate the precision of different sample-based strategies. We compared the standard errors of estimators of area of forest loss and area of degradation obtained from simple random, stratified random and systematic sampling as applied to these population data. To construct strata for the stratified design, we evaluated two forest loss maps produced from Landsat data, a 30 m global forest loss product and a 30 m national forest loss map produced specifically for Guyana. For both of these maps, several options for defining stratum boundaries and allocating sample size to strata were evaluated. All stratified design options reduced the standard error of the area estimators relative to simple random sampling. The Dalenius-Hodges and Jenks methods for choosing stratum boundaries yielded greater improvements in precision than the Equal Area method. For this Guyana case study, optimal and equal allocation of sample size to strata led to substantially better precision than proportional allocation. Only small improvements in precision were attained by increasing the number of strata from three to five. For simple random sampling, incorporating the global and national forest loss map information in a regression estimator reduced standard errors of estimated area of forest loss and area of degradation relative to the standard error of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator that does not incorporate the forest loss map information. However, the best performing stratified sampling design options had better precision than the regression estimator. RapidEye data cost 800 USD per '3A' tile so the annual imagery cost for mapping Guyana would be 274,000 USD. For an investment of 75,200 USD (the cost of 94 RapidEye tiles, the largest sample size evaluated), the best performing stratified random sample achieved a relative standard error (100% times the standard error divided by area) of 7% for estimating area of forest loss and 6% for estimating area of degradation. This study demonstrates the utility of Landsat-based forest loss maps to provide effective strata to improve precision of area estimators produced from a sample of RapidEye imagery in a country for which forest loss and degradation are very rare features of the landscape.

TI  - Modeling and predicting dengue fever cases in key regions of the Philippines using remote sensing data
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To correlate climatic and environmental factors such as land surface temperature, rainfall, humidity and normalized difference vegetation index with the incidence of dengue to develop prediction models for the Philippines using remote-sensing data. Methods: limeseries analysis was performed using dengue cases in four regions of the Philippines and monthly climatic variables extracted from Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation for rainfall, and MODIS for the land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index from 2008-2015. Consistent dataset during the period of study was utilized in Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models to predict dengue incidence in the four regions being studied. Results: The best-fitting models were selected to characterize the relationship between dengue incidence and climate variables. The predicted cases of dengue for January to December 2015 period fitted well with the actual dengue cases of the same timeframe. It also showed significantly good linear regression with a square of correlation of 0.869 5 for the four regions combined. Conclusion: Climatic and environmental variables are positively associated with dengue incidence and suit best as predictor factors using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models. This finding could be a meaningful tool in developing an early warning model based on weather forecasts to deliver effective public health prevention and mitigation programs.

TI  - Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection Among Transgender Women and Transgender Men Attending Clinics that Provide Sexually Transmitted Disease Services in Six US Cities: Results From the Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Network
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Transgender women and transgender men are disproportionately affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and may be vulnerable to other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), but the lack of surveillance data inclusive of gender identity hinders prevention and intervention strategies.Methods: We analyzed data from506 transgenderwomen (1045 total visits) and 120 transgender men (209 total visits) who attended 26 publicly funded clinics that provide STD services in 6 US cities during a 3.5-year observation period. We used clinical and laboratory data to examine the proportion of transgender women and transgender men who tested positive for urogenital and extragenital chlamydial or gonococcal infections and who self-reported or tested positive for HIV infection during the observation period.Results: Of the transgender women tested, 13.1% tested positive for chlamydia and 12.6% tested positive for gonorrhea at 1 or more anatomic sites, and 14.2% were HIV-infected. Of transgender men tested, 7.7% and 10.5% tested positive for chlamydia and gonorrhea at 1 or more anatomic sites, and 8.3% were HIV-infected. Most transgender women (86.0% and 80.9%, respectively) and more than a quarter of transgender men (28.6% and 28.6%, respectively) with an extragenital chlamydial or gonococcal infection had a negative urogenital test at the same visit.Conclusions: Publicly funded clinics providing STD services are likely an important source of STD care for transgender persons. More data are needed to understand the most effective screening approaches for urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in transgender populations.

TI  - Accounting for low solar resource days to size 100% solar microgrids power systems in Africa
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In many regions worldwide, the electrification of rural areas is expected to be partly achieved through micro power grids. Compliance with the COP21 conference requires that such systems mainly build on renewable energy sources. To deliver a high power and quality service may be difficult to be achieved, especially when micro-grids are based on variable renewable sources. We here explore the multiscale temporal variability of the local solar resource in Africa and its implication for the development of 100% solar systems. Using high resolution satellite data of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) for a 21-year period (1995-2015), we characterize the seasonality and temporal variability of the local resource. We focus on its low percentile values which give a first guess on the size of the solar panels surface required for the micro-grid to achieve a given quality service. We assess the characteristics and especially persistence of the low resource situations, for which the local demand would not be satisfied. We finally assess how the ability of electricity consumers for some day-to-day flexibility (e.g. via the postponement of part of one day as demand to the next), would help to achieve the design level of service quality with a smaller microgrid system.

TI  - The role of lake size and local phenomena for monitoring ground-fast lake ice
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we assess the effect of the lake size on the accuracy of a threshold-based classification of ground-fast and floating lake ice from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. For that purpose, two new methods (flood-fill and watershed method) are introduced and the results between the three classification approaches are compared regarding different lake size classes for a study area covering most of the Yamal Peninsula in Western Siberia. The focus is on April, the stage of maximum lake ice thickness, for the years 2016 and 2017. The results indicate that the largest lakes are likely most prone to errors by the threshold classification. The newly introduced methods seem to improve classification results. The results also show differences in fractions of ground-fast lake ice between 2016 and 2017, which might reflect differences in temperatures between the winters with severe impact on wildlife and freshwater fish resources in the region. Patterns of low backscatter responsible for the classification errors in the centre of the lakes were investigated and compared to the optical Sentinel-2 imagery of late-winter. Strong similarities between some patterns in the optical and SAR data were identified. They might be zones of thin ice, but further research is required for clarification of this phenomenon and its causes.

TI  - Mapping and predicting forest loss in a Sumatran tiger landscape from 2002 to 2050
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Riau Province in central Sumatra, with its peatland, lowland, and montane forest habitats, was once a stronghold for Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) populations. Today, Riau may have one of the highest deforestation rates in the world and wildlife populations are dwindling, with natural forest now comprising approximately only 18% of the province, mostly contained within protected areas. Agriculture (acacia, rubber, and oil palm) makes up the majority of Riau's land cover and deforestation for the creation of new plantations is rampant. Natural forest and tigers still remain in Bukit Tigapuluh National Park and Rimbang Baling Wildlife Reserve, which remain connected to tiger populations in montane forest on the western edge of Sumatra. In this study, using freely available Landsat imagery and a maximum likelihood classification algorithm, we create land cover maps for central Sumatra from 2002 to 2016. We then use current land cover, elevation, and slope variables to predict changes from forest to plantation from 2016 to 2050 at five year intervals using a multilayer perceptron neural network. Finally, we compare connectivity based on a 100 km distance threshold (based on potential tiger dispersal) across the landscape and across years. Land cover maps had 80-90% accuracy, and we predict forest in Tesso Nilo and the western edge of the study area to be lost by 2050 given current rates of deforestation. Our connectivity analysis shows that Tesso Nilo and the area between Rimbang Baling and Bukit Tigapuluh are important components for maintaining connectivity throughout the study area. Focusing conservation and rehabilitation efforts on forests close to plantations in flat areas, including Tesso Nilo, is necessary to maintain forests and increase connectivity in Riau to ensure future habitat connectivity for survival of tigers and Sumatra's other diverse endemic species.

TI  - Optimistic Modeling and Simulation of Complex Hardware Platforms and Embedded Systems on Many-Core HPC Clusters
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The large size and complexity of the modern digital hardware impose great challenges to design and validation. Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and System-Level Description Languages (SLDLs) rely on sequential discrete event semantics. Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) has recently gained extensive attention for parallelizing these languages due to the ever-increasing complexity of embedded and cyber physical systems. However, PDES application has not yet reached acceptable maturity and pervasiveness for accelerating computer architecture problems. This is due to inherent complexity of hardware components that require using different advanced PDES techniques. In this paper, we look at the main problem from a radically different angle. First, we suppose there is only a single universal discrete event model of computation for simulation purely defined by distributed optimistic PDES, i.e., logical-process-based event scheduling worldview. Second, we construct a new parallel system-level simulation language called OSML for ESL. Third, we propose a unified Cloud-based CAD tool called Troodon to automatically parallelize existing hardware languages atop OSML. To the best of our knowledge, OSML is the first work on optimistic synchronization applied to hardware-specific SLDLs and hardware models at different levels of abstraction in ESL, which contain complex data structures by proposing a hybrid checkpointing scheme.

TI  - Controls on Land Surface Temperature in Deserts of Southern California Derived from MODIS Satellite Time Series Analysis, 2000 to 2018
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface temperature (LST) in arid regions is a primary controller of many ecological processes. Consequently, we have developed a framework for detection of LST change on a regional scale using data sets covering all deserts of southern California from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor. The Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) methodology was applied to MODIS 1-km monthly LST data from the years 2000 to 2018 to estimate significant time series shifts (breakpoints) and gradual trends. Area-wide results showed five times more positive LST breakpoints (abrupt temperature warming events) than negative (surface cooling) breakpoints. Cross-correlations with high rainfall periods around Mojave dry lake playas, and comparison with timing of wildfire burns for breakpoint patterns, showed that abrupt shifts in LST had the strongest response to these controllers. We detected negative LST (abrupt cooling) breakpoints as consistently associated with the construction of new solar energy facilities. Over the majority of the study area, BFAST results showed warming LST trends between the years 2000 and 2018. The western-most margins of the study area showed consistent widespread warming trends, whereas the eastern portions of the Mojave and Lower Colorado Deserts showed a mix of positive and neutral LST trends. Long-term cooling LST trends were detected only in some of the largest dry lake formations in the Antelope Valley, Death Valley, and Bristol, Cadiz, and Danby playas.

TI  - Assessment of Coastal Aquaculture for India from Sentinel-1 SAR Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing primary food production sectors in India and ranks second behind China. Due to its growing economic value and global demand, India's aquaculture industry experienced exponential growth for more than one decade. In this study, we extract land-based aquaculture at the pond level for the entire coastal zone of India using large-volume time series Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data at 10-m spatial resolution. Elevation and slope from Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission digital elevation model (SRTM DEM) data were used for masking inappropriate areas, whereas a coastline dataset was used to create a land/ocean mask. The pixel-wise temporal median was calculated from all available Sentinel-1 data to significantly reduce the amount of noise in the SAR data and to reduce confusions with temporary inundated rice fields. More than 3000 aquaculture pond vector samples were collected from high-resolution Google Earth imagery and used in an object-based image classification approach to exploit the characteristic shape information of aquaculture ponds. An open-source connected component segmentation algorithm was used for the extraction of the ponds based on the difference in backscatter intensity of inundated surfaces and shape metrics calculated from aquaculture samples as input parameters. This study, for the first time, provides spatial explicit information on aquaculture distribution at the pond level for the entire coastal zone of India. Quantitative spatial analyses were performed to identify the provincial dominance in aquaculture production, such as that revealed in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat provinces. For accuracy assessment, 2000 random samples were generated based on a stratified random sampling method. The study demonstrates, with an overall accuracy of 0.89, the spatio-temporal transferability of the methodological framework and the high potential for a global-scale application.

TI  - Frequency ratio modelling using geospatial data to predict Kimberlite Clan of rock emplacement zones in Dharwar Craton, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Kimberlite clan of rocks (KCR) comprising of mantle derived ultrabasic rocks such as Kimberlite and related Lamproites and Lamprophyres,are the primary source of diamond. Locating the KCR is first step in the diamond exploration, which is highly challenging in the field due to (i) very small spatial extent of KCR pipes (ii) high susceptibility of KCR to weathering and alteration on exposure to atmosphere, owing to their ultrabasic composition. Predictive statistical models using the geospatial data are often used to minimize the search and the present work attempts to apply the Frequency Ratio (FR) based predictive model in GIS to prepare KCR potential zone maps based on the relationship between the already explored KCR locations and the factors that favour their emplacement. Wajrakarur Kimberlite Field (WKF) in the Dharawar Craton of India, with more than 30 explored kimberlite pipes is selected as the study area. Geospatial technology has been used to generate thematic maps such as known KCR pipe locations, lineament density, lineament buffer zone, lineament intersection buffer zone, drainage anomaly buffer zone, geomorphology, and classified image showing distribution of mineral such as clay, iron oxide and calcrete, which are surface expression of KCR emplacement from various sources. Landsat 8 OLI satellite data, ASTER DEM were used in preparing the geomorphology, lineament map, and band ratio based mineral classified map. The thematic maps were converted to raster grid of 10 sq. m. FR values for each unit in each thematic map were obtained by correlating the spatial relationship between thematic map and the 25 locations of the 33 "known" KCR locations in WKF used for FR modelling. Cumulative FR value were obtained by carrying out overlay analysis of the thematic maps, which are classified into five classes by Natural Breaking method as (i)Very Low Favourable (VLF), (ii) Low Favourable (LF), (iii)Moderate favourable (MF), (iv)High Favourable (HF), and (v)Very High Favourable (VHF). The model was validated by ground verification at random sites and statistical method. During the ground visit, we observed KCR-like lithology's at four new sites that have calcrete exposure at limited spatial extent and also some pieces of ultrabasic rocks similar to the explored sites. To ascertain their chemical composition of the samples were plotted in the MgO-K2O-Al2O3 ternary diagram. All the four samples fall in the Kimberlite/Lamproite field confirming them to be KCR. The FR predictive model was also validated statistically. Total 13 locations, including 8 site out of 33 known KCR locations, one newly discovered pipe by GSI and the four locations discovered during this study were used for the validation. Statistical validation shows that 84% of model accuracy is achieved. The study reveals that Lineament Intersection, and circular drainage anomaly in 3rd order streams, lineament density are significant themes in predicting KCR emplacement zones. The study demonstrates the utility of statistical based model such as FR model in predicting the location of KCR emplacement, even with statistically insignificant distribution of KCRs and can be applied elsewhere in the world to locate the KCRs. In the process, we report discovery of four new KCR pipes in the WKF.

TI  - Spatial assessment of solar energy potential at global scale. A geographical approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Solar energy is a key renewable source for decarbonization and the future sustainable development of human society. However, the success of the worldwide governments in the large-scale implementation of solar technologies largely depends on the in-depth knowledge of global solar radiation distribution and intensity levels, which is a difficult endeavour due to the fact that up-to-date global-scale information is generally limited. This study primarily aims to analyse solar radiation distribution and intensity globally, continentally (all continents, except for Antarctica) and nationally (194 countries), based on the global horizontal irradiation (GHI) and direct normal irradiation (DNI) data, released at the best spatial resolution currently available in reliable international databases. By means of a statistical analysis of seven potential classes, delimited based on established geostatistical methods, the results showed that, globally, there are 6 major CHI hotspots (western South America, northern, eastern and southwestern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Australia), with annual values of >2200 kWh/m(2), and 6 other well-defined DNI hotspots (southwestern North America, western South America, southwestern Africa, northwestern Arabian Peninsula, Tibetan Plateau and Australia), with values of >2500 kWh/m(2). These regions, with the most intense solar radiation values, assigned to the seventh potential class (superb) of the two parameters, comprise most of the total global GHI (similar to 15 mil km(2),10% of the world's land area) and DNI (similar to 8 mil km(2), 5%) superb class areas. Continentally, Africa holds the most considerable GHI solar resources (almost 10 mil km(2) of the superb class, approximately one third of the continental area), while Australia holds the most abundant DNI resources (similar to 4 mil km(2), similar to 50%). Nationally, there are 12 epicentre countries for GHI, considering at least 50% superb potential threshold within national limits (9 in Africa - Namibia, 96%, Sudan, 86%, Niger, 84%, Egypt, 77%, Western Sahara, 72%, Chad, 69%, Eritrea, 58%, Libya, 56%, and Djibouti, 52%, and 3 in Asia - Oman, 92%, Yemen, 87%, and Saudi Arabia, 74%), while for DNI only 3 countries reach this percentual threshold of the maximum solar potential (Namibia, 77%, Jordan, 53%, and Australia, 51%). Our results suggest these epicentre countries (as well as others with extensive absolute GHI and DNI superb class areas, such as the US, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and China) are among the most favourable for the large-scale installation of photovoltaic and concentrating solar power systems, which are currently the most important technologies used in solar energy production.

TI  - Spatial Analysis of Temperate Forest Structure: A Geostatistical Approach to Natural Forest Potential
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems represent an important means of ecosystem services; they are key as carbon sinks, water collectors, soil stabilizers, suppliers of great biological diversity, among other benefits. In addition, regionalization based on forest conditions provides a valuable approach to understanding and analyzing spatial patterns, which is useful as a tool for the implementation of forest ecosystem protection and conservation programs. In this research, the structure of a temperate forest in the western Sierra Madre region of Mexico was analyzed and characterized. The study unit was the watershed and the analysis used a geospatial approach combined with multivariate techniques such as: Principal Component Analysis, Cluster Analysis (CA), Discriminant Analysis (DA) and Multivariate Analysis of Variance. We evaluated the relationships among spectral satellite data, thematic maps and structural forest variables. A total of 345 watersheds were grouped based on these variables. The grouping of watersheds under low, medium and high production conditions was carried out with CA, defining 3 groups. The validation of the grouping was performed through DA, estimating errors with the restitution method, as well as with the cross-validation method. Significant differences were found among the groups. The grouping of watersheds provides observable evidence of the variability of the forest condition throughout the area. This study allows identifying forest areas with different levels of productivity and can help to detect levels of vulnerability and ecological fragility in natural forests in temperate zones.

TI  - Land cover effect on water discharge, matter losses and surface temperature: Results of 20 years monitoring in the Sumava Mts
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Three small catchments (each c. 2 km(2)) with different land cover (drained pasture, wetland and spruce forest) located in the Sumava Mountains in the Czech Republic (altitude 780-1026 m) were monitored continuously for 20 years. The aim of the study was to evaluate the aging of different types of land cover landscape in terms of soil acidification (loss of alkalines). Average annual water discharge from the pasture catchment was c. 60% of annual precipitation, but 38% and 34% of annual precipitation from the wetland and the forest, respectively. The relatively highest water runoff was from the pasture in all months. Daily runoffs during periods of heavy rain were 26mm from the pasture, 16mm from the wetland and 7mm from the forested catchment. Water discharged from the drained pasture had two times higher electrical conductivity than water from the wetland and forest due to higher concentrations of bicarbonate, nitrate, calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium. In the wetland and forest catchments, the amounts of nitrate, sulphate, chloride, TC, TN, TP and ammonium in the precipitated water were higher than that of the discharged with water (soluble matter losses). The amount of soluble matter discharged from the pasture catchment (matter losses) was in all cases higher than the amount in the precipitated water. On sunny days in the vegetation season, the pasture catchment had higher surface temperature than the wetland and forest catchments, which had higher evapotranspiration. Thermal pictures from satellites (e.g. Landsat) or taken by airborne thermal cameras can be used for identification of landscape areas of higher water outflow and higher matter losses.

AB  - A change in urine color is an unusual intraoperative occurrence, which can be distressing for the anesthesia provider. Abnormal changes in color are generally benign effects of medications and foods; however, a change in urine color may be a sign of an underlying pathologic condition. Methylene blue, a nonpathogenic, water-soluble, commonly used dye for diagnostic tests, has on rare occasions, been reported to discolor urine green intraoperatively or postoperatively. We report on a patient who produced green discoloration of urine intraoperatively after methylene blue administration, which was benign and resolved spontaneously.

TI  - Land suitability assessment for cassava production in Indonesia using GIS, remote sensing and multi-criteria analysis
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable land use is essential for increasing the production of cassava as a diversified crop for ensuring food security in Indonesia. Understanding spatial factors and criteria is required for locating suitable production areas to increase cassava production. In this study, a spatial model was developed to assess the suitability of land for supporting sustainable cassava production. The model was divided into three stages considering different criteria. First, satellite digital images were processed from Landsat-4 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Sentinel-2 satellites to create vector data layers and a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) database. Second, a spatial analysis was performed to identify highly suitable areas for cassava production using a geographical information system (GIS) and the multi-criteria analysis. Third, a sustainability evaluation was conducted based on land suitability information for a study period of 5 years. Land suitability assessment was performed to increase cassava production. We found that 43.11% (11094 ha) of the study area was highly suitable for cassava production, whereas 30.87% (8233 ha) was moderately suitable and 9.83% (2623 ha) was marginally suitable with incorporating AHP analysis. Moreover, 17.69% (4718 ha) of the land was occupied by residents and settlements. On the other hand, ANP analysis also conducted to confirm the AHP results. We have found approximate similar results with no significant differences in any of the suitability classes. This research recommends that the integrated approach of GIS-based multi-criteria can be extended with satellite remote sensing vegetation datasets to assess regional production and site-specific management of cassava crops.

TI  - Point-Based Rainfall Intensity Information System in Mt. Merapi Area by X-Band Radar
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An X-band radar was installed in 2014 at Merapi Museum, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, to monitor pyroclastic and rainfall events around Mt. Merapi. This research aims to perform a reliability analysis of the point extracted rainfall data from the aforementioned newly installed radar to improve the performance of the warning system in the future. The radar data was compared with the monitored rain gauge data from Balai Sabo and the IMERG satellite data from NASA and JAXA (The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM), which had not been done before. All of the rainfall data was compared on an hourly interval. The comparisons were conducted based on 11 locations that correspond to the ground rainfall measurement stations. The locations of the rain gauges are spread around Mt. Merapi area. The point rainfall information was extracted from the radar data grid and the satellite data grid, which were compared with the rain gauge data. The data were then calibrated and adjusted up to the optimum state. Based on January 2017-March 2018 data, it was obtained that the optimum state has a NSF value of 0.41 and R-2 value of 0.56. As a result, it was determined that the radar can capture around 79% of the hourly rainfall occurrence around Mt. Merapi area during the chosen calibration period, in comparison with the rain gauge data. The radar was also able to capture nearby 40-50% of the heavy rainfall events that pose risks of lahar. In contrast, the radar data performance in detecting drizzling and light rain types were quite precise (55% of cases), although the satellite data could detect slightly better (60% of cases). These results indicate that the radar sensitivity in detecting the extreme rainfall events must receive higher priority in future developments, especially for applications to the existing Mt. Merapi lahar early warning systems.

TI  - Fusion Feature Multi-Scale Pooling for Water Body Extraction from Optical Panchromatic Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water body extraction is a hot research topic in remote sensing applications. Using panchromatic optical remote sensing images to extract water bodies is a challenging task, because these images have one level of gray information, variable imaging conditions, and complex scene information. Refined water body extraction from optical panchromatic images often experiences serious under- or over-segmentation problems. In this paper, for producing refined water body extraction results from optical panchromatic images, we propose a fusion feature multi-scale pooling for Markov modeling method. Markov modeling includes two aspects: label field initialization and feature field establishment. These two aspects are jointly created by the fusion feature multi-scale pooling process, and this process is proposed to enhance the feature difference between water bodies and land cover. Then, the greedy algorithm in the iteration conditional method is used to extract refined water bodies according to the rebuilt Markov initial label and feature fields. Finally, to prove the effectiveness of proposed method, extensive experiments were used with collected 2.5m SPOT 5 and 1m GF-2 optical panchromatic images and evaluation indexes (precision, recall, overall accuracy, kappa coefficient and boundary detection ratios) to demonstrate that our proposed method can produce more refined water body extraction results than the state-of-the-art methods. The global and local refined indexes are improved by about 7% and 10%, respectively.

TI  - LESS: LargE-Scale remote sensing data and image simulation framework over heterogeneous 3D scenes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer modeling of the transport and interaction of radiation through earth surfaces is challenging due to the complexity of the landscapes as well as the intensive computational cost of 3D radiative transfer simulations. To reduce computation time, current models work with schematic landscapes or with small-scale realistic scenes. The computer graphics community provides the most accurate and efficient models (known as renderers) but they were not designed specifically for performing scientific radiative transfer simulations. In this study, we propose LESS, a new 3D radiative transfer modeling framework. LESS employs a weighted forward photon tracing method to simulate multispectral bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) or flux-related data (e.g., downwelling radiation) and a backward path tracing method to generate sensor images (e.g., fisheye images) or large-scale (e.g. 1 km(2)) spectral images. The backward path tracing also has been extended to simulate thermal infrared radiation by using an on-the-fly computation of the sunlit and shaded scene components. This framework is achieved through the development of a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) and a set of tools to help construct the landscape and set parameters. The accuracy of LESS is evaluated with other models as well as field measurements in terms of directional BREs and pixel-wise simulated image comparisons, which shows very good agreement. LESS has the potential in simulating datasets of realistically reconstructed landscapes. Such simulated datasets can be used as benchmarks for various applications in remote sensing, forestry investigation and photogrammetry.

TI  - Study on Urban Expansion Using the Spatial and Temporal Dynamic Changes in the Impervious Surface in Nanjing
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface area is a key factor affecting urbanization and urban environmental quality. It is of great significance to analysis timely and accurately the dynamic changes of impervious surface for urban development planning. In this study, we use a comprehensive method to extract the time series data on the impervious surface area (ISA) from the multi-temporal Landsat remote sensing images with a high overall accuracy of 90%. The processes and mechanisms of urban expansion at different political administration and direction level in the Nanjing metropolitan area are investigated by using the comprehensive classification method consisting of minimum noise fraction, linear spectral mixture analysis, spectral index, and decision tree classifiers. The expansion of Nanjing is examined by using various ISA indexes and concentric regression analyses. Results indicate that the overall classification accuracy of ISA is higher than 90%. The ISA in Nanjing has dramatically increased in the past three decades from 427.36 km(2) to 1780.21 km(2) and with a high expansion rate of 0.48 from 2000 to 2005. The city sprawls from monocentric to urban core with multiple subcenters in a concentric structure, and the geometric gravity center of construction land moves southward annually. The stages of urbanization in different district levels and the dynamic changes in different direction levels are influenced by the topographic and economic factors.

TI  - Short-Term Phytoplankton Dynamics During Typhoon Season in and Near the Pearl River Estuary, South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect on phytoplankton dynamics of nutrient inputs from rivers within the highly eutrophic Pearl River Estuary (PRE) in China is well understood. However, the role that typhoons play in enhancing or reducing phytoplankton blooms is less well known. The primary factors controlling phytoplankton dynamics in the PRE in June-July 2009 were determined by coupling satellite remote sensing data with field observations during two successive typhoons: Nangka and Soudelor. The results revealed that the magnitude of chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) near the PRE was controlled by several key factors. (1) Vertical mixing of seawater induced by Typhoons Nangka and Soudelor led to a sudden decrease in Chl and phytoplankton abundance near the PRE, especially in picophytoplankton. (2) Following the typhoon events, increased nutrient availability associated with significant freshwater runoff promoted phytoplankton (especially Synechococcus) growth, recovery, and blooms in and near the PRE. (3) Increased freshwater input or easterly winds enhanced the extension of highly abundant phytoplankton with brackish water from the estuary into the adjacent nearshore water. (4) Phycocyanin-rich Synechococcus was endemic and a dominant picophytoplankton group in the estuarial brackish water. We propose a mechanism that describes the interactions of vertical mixing, terrestrial precipitation, freshwater discharge, nutrient inputs, and winds on short-term phytoplankton dynamics in and near the PRE during typhoon season.

AB  - Melanoma is a potentially aggressive skin cancer with a steadily rising incidence. Most melanomas are diagnosed at an early stage and associated with an excellent prognosis when treated appropriately. Primary treatment for melanoma is surgical. Wider surgical margins and a variety of techniques for comprehensive histologic margin assessment may be considered for lentigo maligna type melanoma on the head and neck, due to characteristic broad subclinical extension. For invasive melanoma, sentinel lymph node biopsy may be indicated for staging, and to guide further management and follow-up. Appropriate treatment guidelines for early-stage melanoma are reviewed and discussed.

TI  - A grey approach to predicting healthcare performance
T2  - MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The success of an organization or a particular activity is evaluated through the measurement of key performance indicators (KPIs). The aim of this paper is to analyze and predict the indicators of healthcare performance using grey systems theory. Recent advancements in science and technology have made the healthcare industry extremely efficient at collecting data using electronic claims systems such as electronic health records. Therefore, collecting field level primary data becomes easier and accumulate them to generate secondary data for research purpose and to get an insight of the organization performance is absolutely necessary. Our research analyzes the KPIs of a hospital based on a secondary data source. Since, secondary data contains uncertainty and sometimes poor information, grey prediction model suits best to make a prediction model in this regard. Conventional grey model has considerable drawbacks while making a rigorous prediction model. For this, we apply an improved grey prediction model to predict the KPIs of the healthcare performance indicators. Several error measures in our model give a best fit of the data and allow prediction of the KPIs. The prediction model gives good estimates of the quantitative indicators and produced error rate within an acceptable range. We observe that the KPIs of bed turnover rate (BTR) and bed occupancy rate (BOR) have an increasing trend, whereas the KPIs of average length of stay (ALOS), hospital death rate (HDR) and hospital infection rate (HIR) show a decreasing trend over time. The main contribution of this research is a grey-based prediction model that can provide managers with the information they need to evaluate and predict the performance of a hospital. The research indicates that managers should give greater priority to the indicators which will result in better patients' satisfaction and improved profit margin. Healthcare managers striving towards better performance will now have an empirical basis upon which to formulate and adjust their strategies, after analyzing the predicted value.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF HAEMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Benign neutropenia, observed in different ethnic groups, is the most common form of neutropenia worldwide. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2814778, located at the promoter of the ACKR1 (previously termed DARC) gene, which disrupts a binding site for the GATA1 erythroid transcription factor, resulting in a ACKR1-null phenotype, was found to serve as a predictor of low white blood cell and neutrophil counts in African-Americans and Yemenite Jews. Individuals with benign neutropenia due to the ACKR1-null allele have been found to have an increased susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus infection and, on the other hand, a protective effect against malaria. The associated protective effect may explain the spread of the ACKR1-null allele by natural selection. The reviewed relationships between ACKR1 polymorphism and various pathological states may have important clinical implications to individuals with and without benign neutropenia. Potential mechanisms for ACKR1 (previously termed DARC) modulation during neutrophil recruitment to inflammation, and chemokine bioavailability in the circulation and in local tissue are reviewed and discussed.

TI  - Predicting aboveground biomass in Arctic landscapes using very high spatial resolution satellite imagery and field sampling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing based biomass estimates in Arctic areas are usually produced using coarse spatial resolution satellite imagery, which is incapable of capturing the fragmented nature of tundra vegetation communities. We mapped aboveground biomass using field sampling and very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite images (QuickBird, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3) in four different Arctic tundra or peatland sites with low vegetation located in Russia, Canada, and Finland. We compared site-specific and cross-site empirical regressions. First, we classified species into plant functional types and estimated biomass using easy, non-destructive field measurements (cover, height). Second, we used the cover/height-based biomass as the response variable and used combinations of single bands and vegetation indices in predicting total biomass. We found that plant functional type biomass could be predicted reasonably well in most cases using cover and height as the explanatory variables (adjusted R-2 0.21-0.92), and there was considerable variation in the model fit when the total biomass was predicted with satellite spectra (adjusted R-2 0.33-0.75). There were dissimilarities between cross-site and site-specific regression estimates in satellite spectra based regressions suggesting that the same regression should be used only in areas with similar kinds of vegetation. We discuss the considerable variation in biomass and plant functional type composition within and between different Arctic landscapes and how well this variation can be reproduced using VHSR satellite images. Overall, the usage of VHSR images creates new possibilities but to utilize them to full potential requires similarly more detailed in-situ data related to biomass inventories and other ecosystem change studies and modelling.

TI  - Multi-Sensor Satellite Data Processing for Marine Traffic Understanding
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The work described in this document concerns the estimation of the kinematics of a navigating vessel. This task can be accomplished through the exploitation of satellite-borne systems for Earth observation. Indeed, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical sensors installed aboard satellites (European Space Agency Sentinel, ImageSat International Earth Remote Observation System, Italian Space Agency Constellation of Small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation) return multi-resolution maps providing information about the marine surface. A moving ship represented through satellite imaging results in a bright oblong object, with a peculiar wake pattern generated by the ship's passage throughout the water. By employing specifically tailored computer vision methods, these vessel features can be identified and individually analyzed for what concerns geometrical and radiometric properties, backscatterers spatial distribution and the spectral content of the wake components. This paper proposes a method for the automatic detection of the vessel's motion-related features and their exploitation to provide an estimation of the vessel velocity vector. In particular, the ship's related wake pattern is considered as a crucial target of interest for the purposes mentioned. The corresponding wake detection module has been implemented adopting a novel approach, i.e., by introducing a specifically tailored gradient estimator in the early processing stages. This results in the enhancement of the turbulent wake detection performance. The resulting overall procedure may also be included in marine surveillance systems in charge of detecting illegal maritime traffic, combating unauthorized fishing, irregular migration and related smuggling activities.

TI  - Precise Antenna Pointing Determination in Elevation for Spaceborne SAR Systems Using Coherent Pattern Differences
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The precise determination of the SAR (synthetic aperture radar) antenna pointing is an essential task initially performed during the commissioning phase of a spaceborne SAR system and is permanently monitored during the whole mission life-time. Besides a correct illumination of the scene during data acquisition, antenna pointing is required for proper compensation of the radiation pattern for radiometric correction during SAR data processing. The Amazon rainforest is a well-established target area for antenna pointing estimation in elevation as proven by many past and current SAR missions. Several new SAR systems are now proposed which are using long wavelengths, i.e., L- and P-bands, which will be implemented using reflector-based antenna systems. These reflectors have, in contrast to planar phased array antennas, no completely rigid connection to the satellite body and, hence, a more volatile antenna pointing. Due to the huge dimensions of such reflector antennas required for the envisaged long wavelengths and the finite stiffness of the boom, the antenna pointing may change significantly along the orbit. Such variation cannot be tracked using the common Amazon rainforest approach only, as this measurement opportunity exists only at two positions along the orbit (ascending and descending). Here, the performance of an alternative technique is presented which mitigates the influence of the underlying SAR scene by employing two coherent SAR datasets acquired simultaneously with different antenna patterns. This allows the use of amplitude and phase information for pointing estimation. No assumption upon the homogeneity of the underlying scene is required and, hence, pointing estimation becomes feasible at nearly any point along the orbit. This paper outlines the technique, describes simulation results and presents outcomes from first experimental acquisitions performed with the TerraSAR-X satellite.

TI  - Evaluation of the Effect of Urban Redevelopment on Surface Urban Heat Islands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is a global challenge with multiple consequences. One of its impacts is the increase in heatwave frequency and intensity. The risk is higher for populations living in urban areas, where the highest temperatures are generally identified, due to the urban heat island effect. This phenomenon has recently been taken into account by local elected officials. As a result, developers have decided to use solutions in redevelopment projects to combat high temperatures in urban areas. Consequently, the objective is to study the land-surface temperature evolution of six main urban redevelopments in Lyon, France, from 2000 to 2017. Three of them (the Confluence, Kaplan, and Museum sites) were composed of industrial areas that have undergone major transformations and are now tertiary or residential areas. Two sites have been more lightly transformed, particularly by increasing vegetation to reduce heat stress and urban flooding (Dock and Garibaldi Street). Finally, the Groupama Stadium has been built into agricultural and wooded areas. Changes in vegetation cover (NDVI), water (MNDWI), and moisture (NDMI) content, built areas (NDBI) and bare soil (NDBaI) are also monitored. The results show that the Confluence and Kaplan sites were accompanied by a decrease in surface temperature and an increase in vegetation and moisture, whereas the Groupama Stadium displayed a rise in surface temperature and a decrease in vegetation. On the other hand, the Museum, Dock, and Garibaldi sites did not exhibit clear and uniform trends, although an increase in surface temperature was shown in some statistical tests. The disparity of the results shows the necessity to include a significant amount of vegetation during redevelopment operations in order to reduce heat stress.

TI  - Investigating lake-area dynamics across a permafrost-thaw spectrum using airborne electromagnetic surveys and remote sensing time-series data in Yukon Flats, Alaska
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes in boreal lowlands cycle carbon and supply an important source of freshwater for wildlife and migratory waterfowl. The abundance and distribution of these lakes are supported, in part, by permafrost distribution, which is subject to change. Relationships between permafrost thaw and lake dynamics remain poorly known in most boreal regions. Here, new airborne electromagnetic (AEM) data collected during June 2010 and February 2016 were used to constrain deep permafrost distribution. AEM data were coupled with Landsat-derived lake surface-area data from 1979 through 2011 to inform temporal lake behavior changes in the 35 500-km(2) Yukon Flats ecoregion of Alaska. Together, over 1500 km of AEM data, and roughly 30 years of Landsat data were used to explore processes that drive lake dynamics across a variety of permafrost thaw states not possible in studies conducted with satellite imagery or field measurements alone. Clustered time-series data identified lakes with similar temporal dynamics. Clusters possessed similarities in lake permanence (i.e. ephemeral versus perennial), subsurface permafrost distribution, and proximity to rivers and streams. Of the clustered lakes, similar to 66% are inferred to have at least intermittent connectivity with other surface-water features, similar to 19% are inferred to have shallow subsurface connectivity to other surface water features that served as a low-pass filter for hydroclimatic fluctuations, and similar to 15% appear to be isolated by surrounding permafrost (i.e. no connectivity). Integrated analysis of AEM and Landsat data reveals a progression from relatively synchronous lake dynamics among disconnected lakes in the most spatially continuous, thick permafrost to quite high spatiotemporal heterogeneity in lake behavior among variably-connected lakes in regions with notably less continuous permafrost. Variability can be explained by the preferential development of thawed permeable gravel pathways for lateral water redistribution in this area. The general spatial progression in permafrost thaw state and lake area behavior may be extended to the temporal dimension. However, extensive permafrost thaw, beyond what is currently observed, is expected to promote ubiquitous subsurface connectivity, eventually evolving to a state of increased lake synchronicity.

TI  - Geobotany in a fault in the world's largest continuous wetland in central South America
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal is located in the center of South America in a tectonically active sedimentary basin of Quaternary age. Even though the relief is flat and the diversity of the sediments is low, its vegetation cover has high variability resulting from seasonal fluctuations in water levels and the presence of four surrounding biomes. Changes in elevation of less than 1m influence the length and intensity of floods, powerfully affecting the vegetation. Faults with small vertical displacement can generate abrupt vegetation changes and, consequently, expressive vegetation lineaments. This study characterizes a lineament in the northern Pantanal, considering Land Surface Phenology, estimates of precipitation, and floristic survey. The phenological metrics, obtained from a 15-year time series from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer processed by TIMESAT software, discriminate evergreen forests in the NW of this lineament from savanna-like physiognomies in the SE region. Plant taxonomic identification shows two distinct regional strata with a clear separation between species adapted to prolonged floods in the NW and typical species of the Cerrado biome, mostly xeromorphic, in the SE. Data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission complemented the analysis, showing different dependence on local rains on different sides of the lineament. The entire dataset defines this geological structure as a driver of the Pantanal's plant communities, being a boundary for the extensive establishment of propagules of the Amazon biome. This research, in addition to advancing knowledge of this singular region, which is essential for management studies, can be a stimulus to biological and forest investigations.

TI  - Profile, Level of Vulnerability and Spatial Pattern of Deforestation in Sulawesi Period of 1990 to 2018
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is an event of loss of forest cover to another cover. Sulawesi forests have the potential to be deforested as with Sumatra and Kalimantan. This study aims to provide information on deforestation events in Sulawesi from 1990 to 2018. The data used in this study are (1) land cover in 1990, 2000, 2010; (2) Landsat 8 imagery in 2018; (3) administrative map of BIG in 2018. The methods used are (1) image classification with on-screen digitation techniques following the PPIK land cover classification guidelines, Forestry Planning Agency (2008) using ArcGIS Desktop 10.6 from ESRI; (2) overlapping maps; (3) analysis of deforestation; (4) analysis of deforestation profiles, (5) vulnerability analysis; and (6) analysis of distribution patterns of deforestation. The results showed that the profile of deforestation occurring on Sulawesi Island in the 1990-2018 observation period was dominated by profile 3-1-1 (the proportion of large forest area, the highest incidence of deforestation early stage at the beginning, at a low rate) in 13 districts. The level of vulnerability to deforestation is a non-vulnerable category (37 districts) which is directed to become a priority in handling deforestation in Sulawesi. Spatial patterns of the deforestation that occurred randomly and were scattered are dominated by shrubs, dryland agricultural activities, and small-scale plantations.

TI  - Analysis of Physical and Biogeochemical Control Mechanisms on Summertime Surface Carbonate System Variability in the Western Ross Sea (Antarctica) Using In Situ and Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, carbonate system properties were measured in the western Ross Sea (Antarctica) over the 2005-2006 and 2011-2012 austral summers with the aim of analysing their sensitivity to physical and biogeochemical drivers. Daily Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) sea ice concentration maps, obtained prior to and during the samplings, were used to analyse the sea ice evolution throughout the experiment periods. Monthly means and 8-day composite chlorophyll concentration maps from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua satellite at 4-km resolution were used to investigate inter-annual and basin scale biological variability. Chlorophyll-a concentrations in surface waters estimated by MODIS satellite data contribute to descriptions of the variability of carbonate system properties in surface waters. Mean values of carbonate system properties were comparable across both investigated years; however, the 2012 data displayed larger variability. Sea ice melting also had a pivotal role in controlling the carbonate system chemistry of the mixed layer both directly through dilution processes and indirectly by favouring the development of phytoplankton blooms. This resulted in high pH and Omega(Ar), and in low C-T, particularly in those areas where high chlorophyll concentration was shown by satellite maps.

TI  - Urban object extraction using Dempster Shafer feature-based image analysis from worldview-3 satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A detailed and up-to-date land use of the urban environment is essentially required in many applications. Very high-resolution (VHR), Multispectral Scanner System (MSS) Worldview-3 (WV-3) satellite imagery provides detailed information on urban characteristics, which should be professionally mined. In this research, WV-3 was processed by machine learning (ML) methods to extract the most accurate urban features. Fuze-Go panchromatic sharpening in conjunction with atmospheric and topographic correction was initially utilized to increase the image quality and colour contrast. Three image analysis approaches including, current pixel-based image analysis (PBIA), object-based image analysis (OBIA) and new feature-based image analysis (FBIA) were implemented on WV-3 image. The k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were represented by PBIA, the Decision Tree (DT) classifier was examined as OBIA and the Dempster-Shafer (DS) fusion classifier was manifested for the first time as FBIA. In order to engage DS as FBIA, four types of Belief Masses, namely, Precision, Recall, Overall Accuracy, and kappa coefficient (kappa) were implemented and compared to assign the most likelihood urban features. All the applied classifiers were also trained on the first site and then tested on another site to examine the transferability. The accuracy, reliability, and computational time of all classifiers were examined by confusion matrix and McNemar assessment. Results show improvements on the detailed urban extraction obtained using the proposed FBIA with 92.2% overall accuracy in compared with PBIA and OBIA. The FBIA result of urban extraction is more consistent when transferred to another study area and consumes much lesser time than OBIA. Also, the precision mass belief measurement achieved highest efficiency regarding receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve rate.

TI  - Exposure of black-necked grebes (<i>Podiceps nigricollis</i>) to metal pollution during the moulting period in the Odiel Marshes, Southwest Spain
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - European populations of black-necked grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) congregate every year to moult at the salt ponds of the Odiel Marshes (SW Spain). However, the Odiel Marshes are part of one of the most metal-polluted coastal estuaries in the world, which may pose risks to wildlife. We assessed the exposure of grebes to metal pollution during the critical moulting period in the Odiel Marshes and its potential to cause adverse health effects. Levels of metals in red blood pellet (as a biomarker of exposure), plasma carotenoids, eye redness, and body condition (as biomarkers of effects) were studied. Metal content was also analyzed in the brine shrimp Artemia parthenogenetica, the most important food for grebes in this hypersaline ecosystem during the moulting period. Results showed that, in comparison to toxicity thresholds, grebes had relatively high blood levels of arsenic (As), mercury (Hg) and zinc (Zn). The high loads found in Artemia and the way blood levels vary during the moulting period indicate that shrimp consumption may be the main route of metal exposure for grebes. Plasma carotenoids and body condition showed a positive association with exposure to As, while the relationship of lutein-like carotenoids with Hg accumulation was negative at the beginning of the moulting period to become positive afterwards. Moreover, eye redness was negatively affected by As accumulation. Factors including food resource availability, seasonal fluctuations in physiological status, and interannual variations in the degree of environmental contamination should be considered in monitoring efforts when using moult migrant waterbirds as sentinel species.

TI  - Flood Analysis in Peru using Satellite Image: The Summer 2017 Case
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - At the beginning of the year 2017, different regions of Peru suffered from heavy rains mainly due to the 'El Nino' and 'La Nina' phenomena. As a result of these massive storms, several cities were affected by overflows and landslides. Chosica and Piura were the most affected cities. On the other hand, the satellite images have many applications, one of them is the aid for the better management of the natural disasters (post-disaster management). In this sense, the present work proposes the use of radar satellite images from Sentinel constellation to make an analysis of the most-affected areas by floods in the cities of Chosica and Piura. The applied methodology is to analyse and compare two images (one before and one after the disaster) to identify the affected areas based on differences between both images. The analysing process includes radiometric calibration, speckle filtering, terrain correction, histogram plotting, and image binarization. The results show maps of the analysed cities and identify a significant number of areas flooded according to satellite images from March 2017. Using the resulting maps, authorities can make better decisions. The satellite images used were from the Sentinel 1 satellite belonging to the European Union.

TI  - Influence of Water Content and Temperature on the Dielectric and Radio-Emitting Properties of the Salt Crust of Puffy Solonchak
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote microwave methods for monitoring saline soils is limited by the poor knowledge of the dielectric and microwave emissivity characteristics of salt crusts forming on the surface of solonchaks. The results of multiple studies on the estimation of diurnal variations in the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity of a puffy solonchak are discussed. Samples of the salt crust of the solonchak were taken during the summer period in the Kulunda Steppe (Altai region) from a 2 x 2 m plot for 34 h with a periodicity of 1 h. Under laboratory conditions, their dielectric characteristics were measured, the water content and density were determined, and the chemical analysis of water extract was performed. Laboratory measurements of the dielectric parameters were carried out using bridge circuits at a frequency of 1.41 GHz with the temperature control in the range 265-320 K and the moisture control in the range 0-0.50 cm(3)/cm(3). The dependence of the volumetric water content of the solonchak on the radiation coefficient was obtained. This dependence can be used to estimate the salinity of the soil from remote sensing data in the microwave range. The effect of temperature on the dielectric and emissivity characteristics of the solonchak was also studied. Dependences of the microwave emissivity on the temperature were assigned to intervals with different behaviors of the emissivity characteristics. For each interval, linear dependences of the solonchak emissivity on the temperature were established. Daily variations in the emissivity characteristics of the solonchak surface were also determined. It was shown that the microwave emissivity of the solonchak depends on the soil temperature, water content, and salinity. The studied regularities of microwave radiation from the solonchak can be used in the development of the methods for radiophysical monitoring of saline soils.

T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Analysis of long-term speech and swallowing function and subjective quality of life (QOL) after primary resection and sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in patients with early stage (cT1/T2) oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC).Material and Methods: Eighty-one consecutive patients treated primarily by transoral resection without flap reconstruction and SNB for a cT1/T2 OSCC were included. Completion neck dissection (CND) was indicated in case of occult disease in the sentinel nodes. Adjuvant radiation (aRT) was administered according to the ultimate lymph node status. All patients showed no evidence of disease at time of analysis. Speech and swallowing function were assessed using standardized clinical examinations (11-item, articulation test) and validated questionnaires on subjective QOL (MDADI, FIGS). Median follow-up was 60 months (range 13-159 months) after initial treatment.Results: In all assessments for speech and swallowing, the entire study cohort achieved very high scores, with mean values located in the highest 10% of the scales. Neither tumor size nor site, age, pN-category, CND, and aRT had significant impact on functional outcomes and subjective QOL with the exception of lower scores in the global and physical scores of MDADI after CND or aRT, and articulation in the population over 60 years of age.Conclusion: Transoral resection without reconstruction and SNB for early OSCC achieves excellent outcome with regard to speech, swallowing and subjective QOL.

TI  - Regional Recurrence Risk Following a Negative Sentinel Node Procedure Does Not Approximate the False-Negative Rate of the Sentinel Node Procedure in Breast Cancer Patients Not Receiving Radiotherapy or Systemic Treatment
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the false-negative rate of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer patients is 5-7%, reported regional recurrence (RR) rates after negative SLNB are much lower. Adjuvant treatment modalities probably contribute to this discrepancy. This study assessed the 5-year RR risk after a negative SLNB in the subset of patients who underwent breast amputation without radiotherapy or any adjuvant treatment.All patients operated for primary unilateral invasive breast cancer between 2005 and 2008 were identified in the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patients with a negative SLNB who underwent breast amputation and who were not treated with axillary lymph node dissection, radiotherapy, or any adjuvant systemic treatment were selected. The cumulative 5-year RR rate was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.A total of 13,452 patients were surgically treated for primary breast cancer and had a negative SLNB, and 2012 patients fulfilled the selection criteria. Thirty-eight RRs occurred during follow-up. Multifocal disease was associated with a higher risk of developing RR (P = 0.04). The median time to RR was 27 months and was significantly shorter in patients with estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer (9.5 months; P = 0.003). The 5-year RR rate was 2.4% in the study population compared with 1.1% in the remainder of 11,440 SLNB-negative patients (P = 0.0002).Excluding the effect of radiotherapy and systemic treatment resulted in a twofold 5-year RR risk in breast cancer patients with a tumor-free SLNB. This 5-year RR rate was still much lower than the reported false-negative rate of the SLNB procedure.

TI  - A Comparison of the Signal from Diverse Optical Sensors for Monitoring Alpine Grassland Dynamics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands cover up to 40% of the mountain areas globally and 23% of the European Alps and affect numerous key ecological processes. An increasing number of optical sensors offer a great opportunity to monitor and address dynamic changes in the growth and status of grassland vegetation due to climatic and anthropogenic influences. Vegetation indices (VI) calculated from optical sensor data are a powerful tool in analyzing vegetation dynamics. However, different sensors have their own characteristics, advantages, and challenges in monitoring vegetation over space and time that require special attention when compared to or combined with each other. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from handheld spectrometers, station-based Spectral Reflectance Sensors (SRS), and Phenocams as well as the spaceborne Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) for assessing growth and dynamic changes in four alpine meadows. We analyzed the similarity of the NDVI on diverse spatial scales and to what extent grassland dynamics of alpine meadows can be detected. We found that NDVI across all sensors traces the growing phases of the vegetation although we experienced a notable variability in NDVI signals among sensors and differences among the sites and plots. We noticed differences in signal saturation, sensor specific offsets, and in the detectability of short-term events. These NDVI inconsistencies depended on sensor-specific spatial and spectral resolutions and acquisition geometries, as well as on grassland management activities and vegetation growth during the year. We demonstrated that the combination of multiple-sensors enhanced the possibility for detecting short-term dynamic changes throughout the year for each of the stations. The presented findings are relevant for building and evaluating a combined sensor approach for consistent vegetation monitoring.

TI  - Automated detection of individual clove trees for yield quantification in northeastern Madagascar based on multi-spectral satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing demand for clove products, mainly dried buds and essential oil on global markets. Consequently, the importance of clove trees as a provisioning service is increasing at the local level, particularly for smallholders cultivating clove trees as cash crops. Due to limited availability of data on local production, using remote sensing-based methods to quantify today's clove production is of key interest. We estimated the clove bud yield in a study site in northeastern Madagascar by detecting individual clove trees and determining relevant productio n systems, including pasture and clove, clove plantation and agroforestry systems. We implemented an individual tree detection method based on two machine learning approaches. Specifically, we proposed using a circular Hough transform (CHT) for the automated detection of individual clove trees. Subsequently, we implemented a tree species classification method using a random forests (RF) classifier based on a set of features extracted for relevant trees in the above production systems. Finally, we classified and mapped different production systems. Based on the number of detected clove trees growing in a clove production system, we estimated the production system-dependent clove bud yield. Our results show that 97.9% of all reference clove trees were detected using a CHT. Classifying clove and non-clove trees resulted in a producer accuracy of 70.7% and a user accuracy of 59.2% for clove trees. The classification of the clove production systems resulted in an overall accuracy of 77.9%. By averaging different clove tree yield estimates obtained from the literature, we estimated an average total yield of approximately 575 tons/year for our 25,600 ha study area. With this approach, we demonstrate a first step towards large-scale clove bud yield estimation using remote sensing data and methodologies.

TI  - K<sub><i>d</i>(PAR)</sub> and a Depth Based Model to Estimate the Height of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation in an Oligotrophic Reservoir: A Case Study at Nova Avanhandava
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) carry out important biological functions in freshwater systems, however, uncontrolled growth can lead to many negative ecologic and economic impacts. Radiation availability is the primary limiting factor for SAV and it is a function of water transparency measured by K-d(PAR) (downwelling attenuation coefficient of Photosynthetically Active Radiation) and depth. The aim of this study was to develop a K-d(PAR) and depth based model to estimate the height of submerged aquatic vegetation in a tropical oligotrophic reservoir. This work proposed a new graphical model to represent the SAV height in relation to K-d(PAR) and depth. Based on the visual analysis of the model, it was possible to establish a set of Boolean rules to classify the SAV height and identify regions where SAV can grow with greater or lesser vigor. K-d(PAR) was estimated using a model based on satellite data. Overall, the occurrence and height of SAV were directly influenced by the K-d(PAR), depending on the depth. This study highlights the importance of optical parameters in examining the occurrence and status of SAV in Brazilian Reservoirs. It was concluded that the digital model and its graphical representation overcomes the limitations found by other researchers to understand the SAV behavior in relation to those independent variables: depth and K-d(PAR).

TI  - Tubular and mucinous breast cancer: results of a cohort of 917 patients
T2  - TUMORI JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To analyze axillary lymph node involvement (ALNI) rate and survival for mucinous (MC) and tubular (TC) breast carcinomas considered being of very good prognosis and for which an axillary surgical exploration could be questioned. Methods: Our multicentric cohort consisted of 21,135 patients with clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer, without neoadjuvant therapy, between 1999 and 2013 in 10 French centers. ALNI rate and survival were analyzed according to patient and tumor characteristics. Results: Our cohort consisted of 672 TC and 245 MC. Patients were older and tumor size greater for MC and pathologic factors were more pejorative. The rate of mastectomies and adjuvant chemotherapy was higher in the MC group. Axillary lymph node status was determined by SLNB alone in 71.2% of patients. ALNI rates were 17.9% and 18% for TC and MC, respectively. ALNI rate was lesser for MC (OR 0.503, p = 0.024) and greater in case of lympho-vascular invasion (OR 5.0, p < 0.0001) and for tumors >10 mm (OR 2.17, p = 0.042). Median follow-up was 58 months. The 5- and 7-year overall survival rates were 97.1% and 95% for TC, respectively; 92.3% and 91.2% for MC (p = 0.043); 5- and 7-year disease-free survival rates were 97.9% and 97.2% versus 95.2 and 93.6% (p = 0.041). Lympho-vascular invasion was the only predictive factor for overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.70)' grade 2 (HR = 10) and HR-negative (HR = 4.9) were the two predictive factors for disease-free survival. Conclusion: This study confirms the need for an axillary exploration for these tumors even for a tumor size <10 mm and a favorable prognosis.

TI  - Mapping Cropping Practices on a National Scale Using Intra-Annual Landsat Time Series Binning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit information on cropland use intensity is vital for monitoring land and water resource demands in agricultural systems. Cropping practices underlie substantial spatial and temporal variability, which can be captured through the analysis of image time series. Temporal binning helps to overcome limitations concerning operability and repeatability for mapping large areas and can improve the thematic detail and consistency of maps in agricultural systems. We here assessed the use of annual, quarterly, and eight-day temporal features for mapping five cropping practices on annual croplands across Turkey. We used 2403 atmospherically corrected and topographically normalized Landsat Collection 1 L1TP images of 2015 to compute quarterly best-pixel composites, quarterly and annual spectral-temporal metrics, as well as gap-filled eight-day time series of Tasseled Cap components. We tested 22 feature sets for binary cropland mapping, and subsequent discrimination of five cropping practices: Spring and winter cropping, summer cropping, semi-aquatic cropping, double cropping, and greenhouse cultivation. We evaluated area-adjusted accuracies and compared cropland area estimates at the province-level with official statistics. We achieved overall accuracies above 90%, when using either all quarterly features or the eight-day Tasseled Cap time series, indicating that temporal binning of intra-annual image time-series into multiple temporal features improves representations of cropping practices. Class accuracies of winter and spring, summer, and double cropping were robust, while omission errors for semi-aquatic cropping and greenhouse cultivation were high. Our mapped cropland extent was in good agreement with province-level statistics (r(2) = 0.85, RMSE = 7.2%). Our results indicate that 71.3% (+/- 2.3%) of Turkey's annual croplands were cultivated during winter and spring, 15.8% (+/- 2.2%) during summer, while 8.5% (+/- 1.6%) were double-cropped, 4% (+/- 1.9%) were cultivated under semi-aquatic conditions, and 0.32% (+/- 0.2%) was greenhouse cultivation. Our study presents an open and readily available framework for detailed cropland mapping over large areas, which bears the potential to inform assessments of land use intensity, as well as land and water resource demands.

TI  - Sowing date detection at the field scale using CubeSats remote sensing
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sowing dates have a great influence on crop yields as they affect what environmental conditions the plants will experience. Therefore, sowing dates are important to many individuals and organizations on the food production chain, including food manufacturers and traders. Despite their importance, large-scale comprehensive data on sowing dates are currently rare and often available only as broad estimates at the state, county or district level. Continuously obtaining sowing dates at the field scale is expensive, time-consuming and prone to human errors. Remote sensing on the other hand has the potential of conducting rapid, cost-effective and continuous surveys of farm management practices over large scales. Over the last decade, a new era in Earth observation satellites began with the production and deployment of smaller, lighter and cheaper nano-satellites known as CubeSats. Images from these satellites can potentially be used to capture sowing dates over time. In this study, we developed an innovative semi-automated sowing date detection methodology, which uses high spatio-temporal resolution CubeSat images to detect sowing dates at the field scale. We identified the sowing dates by using Planet's PlanetScope data to detect changes on the fields' surface caused by no-tillage sowing. Our approach overcame the signal inconsistences existing among the numerous sensors in the constellation, and detected 85% of the sown fields with R-2 = 0.99. We succeeded to identify the actual sowing dates of individual fields with a median gap of 0 days within an unparalleled RMSE of 0.9 and 1.9 days in a set of national trials and in fields of a commercial farm, respectively. The methodology presented in this study can be used to produce and update field level crop statistics on a near daily-basis at a low cost. It is robust and simple and can be applied over a wide range of soil types, atmospheric conditions, crop types and sensors, to detect sowing dates in regions where no tillage sowing is practiced.

TI  - UAV-Based High Resolution Thermal Imaging for Vegetation Monitoring, and Plant Phenotyping Using ICI 8640 P, FLIR Vue Pro R 640, and thermoMap Cameras
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing popularity of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in recent years, along with decreased cost and greater accessibility of both UAVs and thermal imaging sensors, has led to the widespread use of this technology, especially for precision agriculture and plant phenotyping. There are several thermal camera systems in the market that are available at a low cost. However, their efficacy and accuracy in various applications has not been tested. In this study, three commercially available UAV thermal cameras, including ICI 8640 P-series (Infrared Cameras Inc., USA), FLIR Vue Pro R 640 (FLIR Systems, USA), and thermoMap (senseFly, Switzerland) have been tested and evaluated for their potential for forest monitoring, vegetation stress detection, and plant phenotyping. Mounted on multi-rotor or fixed wing systems, these cameras were simultaneously flown over different experimental sites located in St. Louis, Missouri (forest environment), Columbia, Missouri (plant stress detection and phenotyping), and Maricopa, Arizona (high throughput phenotyping). Thermal imagery was calibrated using procedures that utilize a blackbody, handheld thermal spot imager, ground thermal targets, emissivity and atmospheric correction. A suite of statistical analyses, including analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation analysis between camera temperature and plant biophysical and biochemical traits, and heritability were utilized in order to examine the sensitivity and utility of the cameras against selected plant phenotypic traits and in the detection of plant water stress. In addition, in reference to quantitative assessment of image quality from different thermal cameras, a non-reference image quality evaluator, which primarily measures image focus that is based on the spatial relationship of pixels in different scales, was developed. Our results show that (1) UAV-based thermal imaging is a viable tool in precision agriculture and (2) the three examined cameras are comparable in terms of their efficacy for plant phenotyping. Overall, accuracy, when compared against field measured ground temperature and estimating power of plant biophysical and biochemical traits, the ICI 8640 P-series performed better than the other two cameras, followed by FLIR Vue Pro R 640 and thermoMap cameras. Our results demonstrated that all three UAV thermal cameras provide useful temperature data for precision agriculture and plant phenotying, with ICI 8640 P-series presenting the best results among the three systems. Cost wise, FLIR Vue Pro R 640 is more affordable than the other two cameras, providing a less expensive option for a wide range of applications.

T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drainages are pulses which in turn help us to understand the ongoing process in the hill ecosystem. The Kalrayan hill is known for its dissected terrain condition, rich biological diversity and depletion of natural resources. Therefore, a study on quantitative geomorphometry was carried out in the Kalrayan Hills, Eastern Ghats, Tamil Nadu, using Indian remote sensing 1D LISSIII satellite data. The study area was divided into 36 watersheds and total area is 1158.4km(2). It covers the upper part of Vellar basin. The linear, aerial and relief aspects and different morphometric parameters such as stream length, bifurcation ratio, drainage density, stream frequency, drainage texture, relief ratio, basin shape, form factor, circularity ratio, elongation ratio and length of overland flow were computed using standard methods, formulae and geo-spatial technologies. Based on the present drainage morphometric study, it is inferred that the watersheds 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 27, 32, 33, 34 and 36 are active with reference to geological processes, mean denudational rate, peak discharge, mean annual run off, dominant watershed process and sediment yield per unit area. Multi-criteria analysis is performed to determine the drainage architecture and hydrogeological processes occurring in the present hill area.

TI  - Automated Classification of Terrestrial Images: The Contribution to the Remote Sensing of Snow Cover
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The relation between the fraction of snow cover and the spectral behavior of the surface is a critical issue that must be approached in order to retrieve the snow cover extent from remotely sensed data. Ground-based cameras are an important source of datasets for the preparation of long time series concerning the snow cover. This study investigates the support provided by terrestrial photography for the estimation of a site-specific threshold to discriminate the snow cover. The case study is located in the Italian Alps (Falcade, Italy). The images taken over a ten-year period were analyzed using an automated snow-not-snow detection algorithm based on Spectral Similarity. The performance of the Spectral Similarity approach was initially investigated comparing the results with different supervised methods on a training dataset, and subsequently through automated procedures on the entire dataset. Finally, the integration with satellite snow products explored the opportunity offered by terrestrial photography for calibrating and validating satellite-based data over a decade.

TI  - Earthquake-Induced Landslide Hazard Assessment of Chamoli District, Uttarakhand Using Relative Frequency Ratio Method
T2  - INDIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a natural hazard that affects at least 15% of the land area of India (>0.49 million km(2)). Landslide induced due to earthquake is one of the most prevalent seismic hazards, which claims hundreds of lives in the Himalayan hilly terrains of India. Uttarakhand state is among the most seismically active parts of India. The objective of this study is to prepare an earthquake-induced landslide hazard map for the Chamoli district, Uttarakhand. Then, compare and validate with existing landslide database. Relative frequency ratio (RFR) method is used to identify the correlation between landslide occurrence and landslide controlling factors. Landslide hazard index (LHI) is calculated by the weighted linear combination of weight of factors. A total five factors, viz. slope angle, slope aspect, slope curvature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and PGA, are used as input geo-factors. CartoDEM and Landsat 8 TM images are considered as basic data source for generating these layers. To assess the earthquake-induced landslide in the considered region, these factors along with landslide inventory are used to calculate ratings and weights. The rating maps were integrated in geographic information system (GIS) to obtain the landslide hazard map. A final landslide hazard map showing five categories, namely very low hazard (VLH), low hazard (LH), moderate hazard (MH), high hazard (HH) and very high hazard (VHH), is presented. The results are important for regional land use planning and disaster risk reduction strategies. The hazard map provides useful information for hazard mitigation and to minimize the impact of earthquake for landslide and efficient planning for evacuation during the disaster. It is the first comprehensive attempt to produce the earthquake-induced landslide hazard map of complete district based on the earthquake-induced landslide inventory using relative frequency ratio method.

TI  - Consistency of satellite-based precipitation products in space and over time compared with gauge observations and snow-hydrological modelling in the Lake Titicaca region
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a protocol to assess the space-time consistency of 12 satellite-based precipitation products (SPPs) according to various indicators, including (i) direct comparison of SPPs with 72 precipitation gauges; (ii) sensitivity of streamflow modelling to SPPs at the outlet of four basins; and (iii) the sensitivity of distributed snow models to SPPs using a MODIS snow product as reference in an un-monitored mountainous area. The protocol was applied successively to four different time windows (2000-2004, 20042008, 2008-2012 and 2000-2012) to account for the space-time variability of the SPPs and to a large dataset composed of 12 SPPs (CMORPH-RAW v.1, CMORPH-CRT v.1, CMORPH-BLD v. 1, CHIRP v.2, CHIRPS v.2, GSMaP v. 6, MSWEP v. 2.1, PERSIANN, PERSIANN-CDR, TMPART v. 7, TMPA-Adj v.7 and SM2Rain-CCI v. 2), an unprecedented comparison. The aim of using different space scales and timescales and indicators was to evaluate whether the efficiency of SPPs varies with the method of assessment, time window and location. Results revealed very high discrepancies between SPPs. Compared to precipitation gauge observations, some SPPs (CMORPH-RAW v. 1, CMORPH-CRT v. 1, GSMaP v. 6, PERSIANN, and TMPA-RT v. 7) are unable to estimate regional precipitation, whereas the others (CHIRP v.2, CHIRPS v.2, CMORPH-BLD v. 1, MSWEP v.2.1, PERSIANN-CDR, and TMPA-Adj v. 7) produce a realistic representation despite recurrent spatial limitation over regions with contrasted emissivity, temperature and orography. In 9 out of 10 of the cases studied, streamflow was more realistically simulated when SPPs were used as forcing precipitation data rather than precipitation derived from the available precipitation gauge networks, whereas the SPP's ability to reproduce the duration of MODIS-based snow cover resulted in poorer simulations than simulation using available precipitation gauges. Interestingly, the potential of the SPPs varied significantly when they were used to reproduce gauge precipitation estimates, streamflow observations or snow cover duration and depending on the time window considered. SPPs thus produce space-time errors that cannot be assessed when a single indicator and/or time window is used, underlining the importance of carefully considering their space-time consistency before using them for hydro-climatic studies. Among all the SPPs assessed, MSWEP v. 2.1 showed the highest space-time accuracy and consistency in reproducing gauge precipitation estimates, streamflow and snow cover duration.

TI  - Clonal heterogeneity of melanoma in a paradigmatic case study: future prospects for circulating melanoma cells
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The management of metastatic melanoma is a difficult matter. Nevertheless, the advent of target therapy has significantly improved patient outcome, provided that tumor molecular characteristics become available: the detection of drug- resistant clones can contribute to understanding the reasons for resistance onset, influencing the choice of subsequent therapy. This work aimed to provide a possible explanation for the early resistance to vemurafenib developed by a patient with melanoma, and concurrently to assess the extent, and role, of the tumor clonal heterogeneity. We analyzed tissue samples from different sites and time points: first/ second primary, three lymph node metastases, and circulating melanoma cells (CMCs). We first investigated these samples by the routine Sanger sequencing for BRAF, NRAS, and KIT, and then, we focused on specific hotspots by droplet digital PCR. We detected a BRAF V600E mutation by Sanger sequencing in the second primary and distant lymph node metastases, but not in the first primary or sentinel lymph node. Interestingly, by droplet digital PCR, the V600E mutation was also detected in the first primary, and the V600K in the second primary and metastases. Moreover, we identified a rare KIT V569G mutation, appearing to be CMC exclusive. This finding confirms the potential of CMCs as a source of tumor material for genetic analysis, reflecting real- time systemic disease evolution and, most likely, the most aggressive, treatment- resistant clones. In summary, this work underlines the importance of CMCs in the early identification of tumor clones putatively responsible for therapy resistance.

TI  - On the separation between inorganic and organic fractions of suspended matter in a marine coastal environment
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - A central aspect of coastal biogeochemistry is to determine how nutrients, lithogenic and organic matter are distributed and transformed within coastal and estuarine environments. Analyses of the spatio-temporal changes of total suspended matter (TSM) concentration indicate strong and variable linkages between intertidal fringes and pelagic regions. In particular, knowledge about the organic fraction of TSM provides insight to how biogenic and lithogenic particulate matter are distributed in suspension. In our study we take advantage of a set of over 3000 in situ Loss on Ignition (LoI) data from the Southern North Sea that represent fractions of particulate organic matter (POM) relative to TSM (LoI = POM:TSM). We introduce a parameterization (POM-TSM model) that distinguishes between two POM fractions incorporated in TSM. One fraction is described in association with mineral particles. The other represents a seasonally varying fresh pool of POM. The performance of the POM-TSM model is tested against data derived from MERIS/ENVISAT-TSM products of the German Bight. Our analysis of remote sensing data exhibits specific qualitative features of TSM that can be attributed to distinct coastal zones. Most interestingly, a transition zone between the Wadden Sea and seasonally stratified regions of the Southern North Sea is identified where mineral associated POM appears in concentrations comparable to those of freshly produced POM. We will discuss how this transition is indicative for a zone of effective particle interaction and sedimentation.The dimension of this transition zone varies between seasons and with location. Our proposed POM-TSM model is generic and can be calibrated against in situ data of other coastal regions.

TI  - The attenuating effect of mortality salience on dishonest behavior
T2  - MOTIVATION AND EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - People are easily tempted to engage in dishonest behavior when an incentive is given and when full anonymity is provided. In the present work, we investigated existential threat as a motivational factor that might reduce dishonest behavior. Research based on terror management theory has found that mortality salience increases the motivation to fulfill salient values of one's cultural worldview. Assuming the concept of honesty is important to human societies, we hypothesized that mortality salience will reduce dishonest behavior when the concept of honesty is salient. In two experiments, we assessed dishonesty under full anonymity by applying a die-under-the-cup paradigm with the expected value serving as a stochastic baseline for honest behavior. Both experiments provided support for our hypothesis. Given an incentive to cheat, when the concept of honesty was cognitively activated by a word-search puzzle (Study 1) or by the name of the dice game (i.e., "honest game"; Study 2), mortality salient participants showed not only less dishonest behavior but actually honest behavior.

TI  - Water use efficiency of corn among the irrigation districts across the Duero river basin (Spain): Estimation of local crop coefficients by satellite images
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation in the Duero river basin accounts for 75% of total water resources. Nevertheless, irrigation in this area is paramount to maintain agricultural production. Within this context, this paper is aimed at assessing the water use efficiency (WUE), for the major crop (corn), among four irrigation districts (IDs) from 2014 to 2017. Since the WUE indicators base upon crop water requirements, these were calculated by estimating the reference evapotranspiration and the local crop coefficients Kc. First, they were estimated by satellite images and then, compared with the recommendation from the Regional Irrigation Advisory Service. Finally, the gross irrigation requirements were compared with the irrigation supply.WUE indicators varied among IDs depending upon the hydrologic year, the water available for irrigation (superficial and subsurface water), and the corn sowing date. Usually, the IDs performed deficit irrigation in the dry years, and either full irrigation or over irrigation in the wet years. The rainfall only fulfilled less than 10% of corn requirements. Small differences in Kc were observed within municipalities (in each ID) and/or among IDs. The pattern of the Kc fitted curves varied among IDs and was affected by sowing dates.Although, the local Kc values were close to the general coefficients recommended by the Irrigation Advisory Service, they affected the determination of gross irrigation requirements which were significant different among IDs. Moreover, it was observed that the FAO recommendation for the duration of the corn growth stages fitted better the estimated Kc than the one from the Advisory Center.The gross irrigation requirements were similar among IDs and years, varying between 6476 and 7646 m(3)/ha. The local Kc estimation could help irrigation managers to adapt the irrigation supply to the actual corn needs.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: People with paraphilias have sexual interests that are unusual, including inanimate objects, places, or individuals (children, corpses). This study explores zoophiles ( = PSA, people who have sex with animals) recruited from the Internet.Method: We administered a survey of own design via the Internet on popular discussion forums targeting the communities of PSA. All responses were quantified as the percentage of agreeing with one of the possible answer choices, plus the interpretation of qualitative data that may have been supplied in additional space.Results: Survey questions were thematically categorized into four groups - worldview, personal space, sex life, and online space. PSA are remarkably self-aware of their sexuality and recognize that their behavior is illegal (even though they perceive it as an expression of love); they often relate their struggles with finding social acceptance to homosexuality, believing that one way of de-stigmatizing them would be to remove zoophilia from the list of disorders listed in the DSM. Concerning sex life, PSA believe that the quality of sex with animals is much higher than with humans, and physical features, such as the presence of a fur, can be sexually arousing to PSA, especially when seeing animals in public. PSA utilize the Internet to network and connect with other PSA; these Internet-based friendships usually do not extend beyond online conversations, given that PSA tend to be mistrustful of other zoophiles particularly in the area of personal safety.Conclusions: One of the most essential basis of zoophilia is relationship seeking behavior as well as interest in forming a long-term relationship with an animal partner.

AB  - Remote sensing data have been used for effective recognition and classification of land use and land cover features on Earth surface. This paper presents a new approach of handling mixed pixel problem present in remote sensing data and nonlinearity between class boundaries through incorporating the kernel functions with noise classifier (NC). Kernel functions have been combined with conventional noise clustering without entropy, classification method (KNC) to classify data obtained from Landsat-8 and Formosat-2 satellites. Simulated image technique has been introduced and used to handle mixed pixel problem and to assess the results of adopted classification method (KNC). The procedure includes optimization of parameters for nine different kernels, finding the best performing kernel, and image to image accuracy assessment using fuzzy error matrix. A comparative analysis of kernel-based noise classifier over conventional NC classifier has also been included in this paper.

TI  - Evaluating the spatial and vertical distribution of agriculturally important nutrients - nitrogen, phosphorous and boron - in North West Iran
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil legacy data is ubiquitous and usually contains routine soil analysis information. In Iran, like most places, legacy soil data constitutes genetic horizon soil information recorded from excavated soil profiles. Describing and sampling from each genetic horizon is assumed to be heterogeneous from site to site. Digital soil mapping (DSM) using observed data is valuable because it provides a means to exploit the available information together with leveraging commonly available information by way of environmental covariates. It creates a much more detailed view of soil at the landscape scale. The purpose of this paper is to model and map the spatial distribution of nitrogen, phosphorous and boron at four standardized depths: 0-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100 cm, in an area of 7300 ha in the north west of Iran, and compare different model types. To circumvent the issue of heterogeneous soil depth observations from site to site, mass-preserving soil depth function splines were used to harmonise the soil profile observed data to the aforementioned standard depths. This facilitated the spatial modelling of each of the target variables for each standard depth with the aim of creating digital soil maps. Twenty-three covariates were extracted from a publically available digital elevation model (DEM) as well as freely available Landsat 8 ETM+ imagery. The DEM-derivative covariates used in this study were divided into three main categories: i) Morphometry; ii) hydrology; and iii) lighting visibility. Both Random Forest and Cubist were assessed as candidate models for predicting each target variable. The results showed that Cubist was the most accurate method. Terrain attributes play an important role in estimating N, P, and B, while optical images do not have significant role. The most important findings of this paper in terms of environmental hazards are that the inundated regions in the west part of the study area are susceptible to boron contamination, providing future guidance for re mediation.

TI  - Buildings Detection in VHR SAR Images Using Fully Convolution Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the highly challenging problem of automatically detecting man-made structures especially buildings in very high-resolution (VHR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In this context, this paper has two major contributions. First, it presents a novel and generic workflow that initially classifies the spaceborne SAR tomography (TomoSAR) point clouds-generated by processing VHR SAR image stacks using advanced interferometric techniques known as TomoSAR-into buildings and nonbuildings with the aid of auxiliary information (i.e., either using openly available 2-D building footprints or adopting an optical image classification scheme) and later back project the extracted building points onto the SAR imaging coordinates to produce automatic largescale benchmark labeled (buildings/nonbuildings) SAR data sets. Second, these labeled data sets (i.e., building masks) have been utilized to construct and train the state-of-the-art deep fully convolution neural networks with an additional conditional random field represented as a recurrent neural network to detect building regions in a single VHR SAR image. Such a cascaded formation has been successfully employed in computer vision and remote sensing fields for optical image classification but, to our knowledge, has not been applied to SAR images. The results of the building detection are illustrated and validated over a TerraSAR-X VHR spotlight SAR image covering approximately 39 km(2)-almost the whole city of Berlin-with the mean pixel accuracies of around 93.84%.

TI  - Evaluation of Wind Retrieval from Co-Polarization Gaofen-3 SAR Imagery Around China Seas
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first Chinese space-borne satellite to carry the C-band multi-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Marine applications, i.e., winds and waves retrieved from GF-3 SAR images, have been operational since January 2017. In this study, we have collected more than 1000 quad-polarization (vertical-vertical (VV); horizontal-horizontal (HH); vertical- horizontal (VH); horizontal-vertical (HV)) GF-3 SAR images, which were acquired around the China Seas from September 2016 to September 2017. Wind streaks were visible in these images in co-polarization (VV and HH) channel. Geophysical model functions (GMFs), including the CMOD5N together with polarization ratio (PR) model and C-SARMOD, were used to retrieve winds from the collected co-polarization GF-3 SAR images. Wind directions were directly obtained from GF-3 SAR images. Then, the SAR-derived wind speeds were compared with the measurements at a 0.25 degrees grid from the Advanced Scatterometer on board the Metop-A/B and microwave radiometer WindSAT. Based on the analysis, empirical corrections are proposed to improve the performance of the two GMFs. Results of this study show that the standard deviation of wind speed is 1.63 m s(-1) with a 0.19 m s(-1) bias and 1.71 m s(-1) with a 0.26 m s(-1) bias for VV- and HH-polarization GF-3 SAR, respectively. Our work not only systematically evaluates wind retrieval by using the two advanced GMFs and PR models but also proposes empirical corrections to improve the accuracy of wind retrievals from GF-3 SAR images around the China Seas and thus enhance the accuracy of near real-time operational SAR-derived wind products.

TI  - Pixel-Based Geometric Assessment of Channel Networks/Orders Derived from Global Spaceborne Digital Elevation Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) contribute to geomorphological and hydrological applications. DEMs can be derived using different remote sensing-based datasets, such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) (e.g., Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band SAR (PALSAR) and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEMs). In addition, there is also the Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from optical tri-stereo ALOS Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) imagery. In this study, we evaluated satellite-based DEMs, SRTM (Global) GL1 DEM V003 28.5 m, ALOS DSM 28.5 m, and PALSAR DEMs 12.5 m and 28.5 m, and their derived channel networks/orders. We carried out these assessments using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) and their derived channel networks and Strahler orders as reference datasets at comparable spatial resolutions. We introduced a pixel-based method for the quantitative horizontal evaluation of the channel networks and Strahler orders derived from global DEMs utilizing confusion matrices at different flow accumulation area thresholds (ATs) and pixel buffer tolerance values (PBTVs) in both +/- X and +/- Y directions. A new Python toolbox for ArcGIS was developed to automate the introduced method. A set of evaluation metrics-(i) producer accuracy (PA), (ii) user accuracy (UA), (iii) F-score (F), and (iv) Cohen's kappa index (KI)-were computed to evaluate the accuracy of the horizontal matching between channel networks/orders extracted from global DEMs and those derived from LiDAR DTMs and DSMs. PALSAR DEM 12.5 m ranked first among the other global DEMs with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and mean difference (MD) values of 4.57 m and 0.78 m, respectively, when compared to the LiDAR DTM 12.5 m. The ALOS DSM 28.5 m had the highest vertical accuracy with the lowest recorded RMSE and MD values of 4.01 m and -0.29 m, respectively, when compared to the LiDAR DSM 28.5 m. PALSAR DEM 12.5 m and ALOS DSM 28.5 m-derived channel networks/orders yielded the highest horizontal accuracy when compared to those delineated from LiDAR DTM 12.5 m and LiDAR DSM 28.5 m, respectively. The number of unmatched channels decreased when the PBTV increased from 0 to 3 pixels using different ATs.

TI  - Near-real-time non-obstructed flood inundation mapping using synthetic aperture radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the event of a flood disaster, first response agencies need inundation maps produced in near real time (NRT). Such maps can be generated using satellite-based information. In this study, we developed mapping techniques that rely on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on-board earth-orbiting platforms. SAR provides valid ground surface measurements through cloud cover with high resolution and sampling frequency that has recently increased through multiple missions. Despite numerous efforts, automatic processing of SAR data to derive accurate inundation maps still poses challenges. To address them, we have developed an NRT system named RAdarProduced Inundation Diary (RAPID). RAPID integrates four processing steps: classification based on statistics, morphological processing, multi-threshold-based compensation, and machine-leaming correction. Besides SAR data, the system integrates multisource remote-sensing data products, including land cover classification, water occurrence, hydrographical, water type, and river width products. In comparison to expert handmade flood maps, the fully-automated RAPID system exhibited "overall," "producer," and "user" accuracies of 93%, 77%, and 75%, respectively. RAPID accommodates commonly encountered over- and under-detections caused by noise-like speckle, water-like radar response areas, strong scatterers, and isolated inundation areas errors that are in common practice to ignore, mask out, or be filtered out by coarsening the effective resolution. RAPID can serve as the kernel algorithm to derive flood inundation products from satellites both existing and to be launched equipped with high-resolution SAR sensors, including Envisat, Radarsat, NISAR, Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS)-1/2, Sentinel-1, and TerraSAR-X.

TI  - Evaluating the spatial distribution and the intensity of urban heat island using remote sensing, case study of Isfahan city in Iran
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, urbanization has widely been developed and resulted in great loss of natural resources on earth and many other consequences such as temperature rise which exposes the cities to a phenomenon called heat island. Urban heat island (UHI) can be identified and analyzed by thermal remote sensing. In the present study, satellite images of Landsat 7 ETM + (1999 and 2006) and Landsat 8 (2013 and 2016) were used to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) of Isfahan in Iran by means of the mono-window algorithm. Analysis of thermal levels showed an increase in the minimum temperature of 2016 compared to 1999. Furthermore, the results revealed that the heat island ratio (URI) in Isfahan in four different years followed a rising trend, moving from 0.16 in 1999 to 0.3 in 2016. The findings of this study indicated that the areas influenced by UHI are often in northern and southern parts of the city where vegetation cover is very sparse, the land is arid, and industrialization and regional settlements are booming.

TI  - Assessment of sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer in two subgroups: Initially node negative and node positive converted to node negative - A systemic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is increasingly used to treat patients with breast cancer, but the reliability of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) following chemotherapy is in doubt. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate studies that examine the results of SLNB after NAC to assess identification rate (IR) and false-negative rate (FNR). Materials and Methods: Systemic searches were performed in the PubMed, ISI Web of Sciences, Scopus, and Cochrane databases from January 1, 2000, to November 30, 2016, for studies of SLNB after NAC for breast cancer and followed by axillary lymph node (LN) dissection in two subgroups: initially node negative and node positive converted to node negative. Two reviewers independently review quality of included studies. A random-effects model was used to pool IR and FNR with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I-2 and Q-test. Results: A total of 23 studies with 1521 patients in the initially node-negative subgroup and 13 studies with 1088 patients in the node-positive converted to node-negative subgroup, were included in this meta-analysis with IR and FNR of 94% (95% CI: 92-96) and 7% (95% CI: 5-9) in the initially node-negative subgroup and 89% (95% CI: 85-94) and 13% (95% CI: 7-18) in the node-positive converted to node-negative subgroup, respectively. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis showed acceptable IR and FNR in initially node-negative group and it seems feasible in these patients, but these parameters did not reach to predefined value in node-positive converted to node-negative group, and thus, it is not recommended in these patients.

TI  - Satellite-based Observational Study of the Tibetan Plateau Vortex: Features of Deep Convective Cloud Tops
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an east-moving Tibetan Plateau vortex (TPV) is analyzed by using the ERA-5 reanalysis and multi-source satellite data, including FengYun-2E, Aqua/MODIS and CALIPSO. The objective is to demonstrate: (i) the usefulness of multi-spectral satellite observations in understanding the evolution of a TPV and the associated rainfall, and (ii) the potential significance of cloud-top quantitative information in improving Southwest China weather forecasts. Results in this study show that the heavy rainfall is caused by the coupling of an east-moving TPV and some low-level weather systems [a Plateau shear line and a Southwest Vortex (SWV)], wherein the TPV is a key component. During the TPV's life cycle, the rainfall and vortex intensity maintain a significant positive correlation with the convective cloud-top fraction and height within a 2.5? radius away from its center. Moreover, its growth is found to be quite sensitive to the cloud phases and particle sizes. In the mature stage when the TPV is coupled with an SWV, an increase of small ice crystal particles and appearance of ring- and U/V-shaped cold cloud-top structures can be seen as the signature of a stronger convection and rainfall enhancement within the TPV. A tropopause folding caused by ageostrophic flows at the upper level may be a key factor in the formation of ring-shaped and U/V-shaped cloud-top structures. Based on these results, we believe that the supplementary quantitative information of an east-moving TPV cloud top collected by multi-spectral satellite observations could help to improve Southwest China short-range/nowcasting weather forecasts.

TI  - Identifying and forecasting potential biophysical risk areas within a tropical mangrove ecosystem using multi-sensor data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are one of the most productive ecosystems known for provisioning of various ecosystem goods and services. They help in sequestering large amounts of carbon, protecting coastline against erosion, and reducing impacts of natural disasters such as hurricanes. Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary in Odisha harbors the second largest mangrove ecosystem in India. This study used Terra, Landsat and Sentinel-1 satellite data for spatio-temporal monitoring of mangrove forest within Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary between 2000 and 2016. Three biophysical parameters were used to assess mangrove ecosystem health: leaf chlorophyll (CHL), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). A long-term analysis of meteorological data such as precipitation and temperature was performed to determine an association between these parameters and mangrove biophysical characteristics. The correlation between meteorological parameters and mangrove biophysical characteristics enabled forecasting of mangrove health and productivity for year 2050 by incorporating IPCC projected climate data. A historical analysis of land cover maps was also performed using Landsat 5 and 8 data to determine changes in mangrove area estimates in years 1995, 2004 and 2017. There was a decrease in dense mangrove extent with an increase in open mangroves and agricultural area. Despite conservation efforts, the current extent of dense mangrove is projected to decrease up to 10% by the year 2050. All three biophysical characteristics including GPP, LAI and CHL, are projected to experience a net decrease of 7.7%, 20.83% and 25.96% respectively by 2050 compared to the mean annual value in 2016. This study will help the Forest Department, Government of Odisha in managing and taking appropriate decisions for conserving and sustaining the remaining mangrove forest under the changing climate and developmental activities.

TI  - Multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR for maize mapping supported by segmentations from high-resolution optical image
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its ability to penetrate the cloud, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been a great resource for crop mapping. Previous research has verified the applicability of SAR imagery in object-oriented crop classification, however, speckle noise limits the generation of optimal segmentation. This paper proposed an innovative SARbased maize mapping method supported by optical image, Gaofen-1 PMS, based segmentation, named as parcel based SAR classification assisted by optical imagery-based segmentation (os-PSC). Polarimetric decomposition was applied to extract polarimetric parameters from multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data. One Gaofen-1 image was then used for parcel extraction, which was the basic unit for SAR image analysis. The final step was a multistep classification for final maize mapping including: the potential maize mask extraction, pure/mixed maize parcel division and an integrated maize map production. Results showed that the overall accuracy of the os-PSC method was 89.1%, higher than those of pixel-level classification and SAR-based segmentation methods. The comparison between optical- and SAR-based segmentation demonstrated that optical-based segmentation would be better at representing maize field boundaries than the SAR-based segmentation. Moreover, the parcel- and pixel-level integrated classification will be suitable for many agricultural systems with small landownership where inter-cropping is common. Through integrating advantages of the SAR and optical data, os-PSC shows promising potentials for crop mapping.

TI  - dPEN: deep Progressively Expanded Network for mapping heterogeneous agricultural landscape using WorldView-3 satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping heterogeneous agricultural landscape is an important prerequisite for agricultural field management (e.g., weed control), plant phenotyping and yield prediction, as well as ecological characterization. Compared to traditional mapping practices that require intensive field surveys, remote sensing technologies offer efficient and cost-effective means for crop type mapping from regional to global scales. However, mapping heterogeneous agricultural landscape is a challenge because of diverse and complex spectral profiles of crops. We propose a novel deep learning method, namely deep progressively expanded network (dPEN), for mapping nineteen different objects including crop types, weeds and crop residues, in a heterogeneous agricultural field using WorldView-3 (WV-3) imagery. To assess the mapping accuracy of dPEN, we created a calibrated WV-3 dataset with the corresponding ground truth. In addition, the suitability of visible/near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1040 nm) and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1195 nm-2365 nm) bands of WV-3 to classification accuracy were examined and discussed in detail. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to explore the significance of all SWIR bands in WV-3 for classification accuracy in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape. The results demonstrated that: (1) The proposed dPEN allows for building a deeper neural network from multi spectral data which was the limitation of many convolutional neural networks; (2) dPEN was able to extract more discriminative features from VNIR and SWIR bands by producing the highest overall accuracy (OA: 86.06%) over competing methods such as support vector machine and random forest; (3) The inclusion of WV-3 SWIR bands greatly improved the classification accuracy; (4) SWIR bands were particularly beneficial to improve the classification accuracy of some individual classes such as weeds, crop residues, and corn and soybean during late developmental stages; (5) The red-edge band (705-745 nm) was identified as the most important band affecting the classification accuracy nearly 10%, whereas the coastal band (400-450 nm) provided the lowest contribution; and (6) SWIR-5 band (2145-2185 nm) contributed most to OA by enhancing it approximately 4% when combined with VNIR bands, while SWIR-1 (1195-1225 nm) yielded the lowest improvement (1.55%) for OA. These research outcomes provide useful information for efficiently mapping agricultural landscape, and indicate the potential practices of dPEN and contributions of spectral bands in WV-3 for plant phenotyping, weed control, and crop residue retention.

T2  - Journal de medecine vasculaire
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In France, breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women. Lymphedema, the main complication, is poorly known. The objective of this study was to assess the state of knowledge of upper limb lymphedema (risk factors, complications, treatment) after treatment of breast cancer among general practitioners from the Haute-Normandie and Ile-de-France regions.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study with 23 closed questions was sent by email to 490 practicing doctors.RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-two questionnaires (33%) could be analyzed. Among the participating physicians (men: 55%), 46% were aged over 50 and 75% were from the Haute-Normandie region; 86% of them followed at least 5 women who had breast cancer. Risk factors for lymphedema were: axillary dissection (89%), risk reduction with sentinel lymph node (82%), radiotherapy (81%), mastectomy (45%) and overweight/obesity (42%). For 54% of physicians, lymphedema appeared within 6 months after cancer treatment and was diagnosed upon examination (clinical signs, perimeter measurements) in 78%, without the need for radiological examinations (100%). Physicians with more than 10 years of experience searched for more lymphedema (86% vs. 62%, P<0.0001). Prescriptions included: elastic compression during the day (77%), manual lymphatic drainage (74%), overnight compression (36%) and consultation in a specialized lymphology department (8%). Six percent of physicians had never managed lymphedema and 22% sent patients to an oncologist. Advice given was: prevention of infectious risk (80%), weight loss (42%), avoidance of sports involving the affected limb (22%), and regular arm elevation (14%). Physicians recommended avoiding blood sampling (75%), measuring blood pressure (66%) on the limb ipsilateral to cancer, while 20% did not prohibit any action on the limb.CONCLUSION: Lymphedema knowledge in general practitioners is generally adequate although the number of women followed by each of them was low. It seems necessary to optimize the training of generalists on lymphedema in order to improve patient management.

TI  - Impact of radiance data assimilation on the prediction performance of cyclonic storm SIDR using WRF-3DVAR modelling system
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study attempts to investigate the impact of assimilation of satellite radiances and its role to improve the model initial condition and forecast of Bay of Bengal cyclone Sidr' by using the weather research and forecasting model and its three-dimensional variational data assimilation system. Results signify that the assimilation of high-resolution satellite radiances of advanced microwave sounding unit B (AMSU-B) data at peak channels has led to significant improvement in the initial fields of the storm structure. It improved the initial condition of moisture profile more significantly than the temperature profile, when radiances are assimilated into the model. In addition, the assimilation of AMSU-B showed a more positive impact on the prediction of the track and intensity of the storm than the assimilation of radiances of advanced microwave sounding unit A (AMSU-A) and high-resolution infra-red sounder (HIRS). The assimilation exercise with all observations (NCEP PREBUFR, AMSU-A, AMSU-B, HIRS, microwave humidity sounder, and atmospheric infra-red sounder) indicate that the track errors are reduced by about 46, 62, 90, and 86%, respectively, at 24, 48, 72, and 96h forecasts compared to the experiment considering without data assimilation. The landfall, intensity, and structure of storm are well captured when all observations are assimilated into the model. Overall, it is concluded that assimilation of radiances is beneficial for the analysis and forecast of the storm. The results suggest that assimilating of both NCEP PREBUFR and radiance observations into the mesoscale model improves the initial condition and forecast of the storm.

TI  - Vegetation and prescribed fire: Implications for stone's sheep and elk
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is the dominant single natural disturbance influencing northern mountain and boreal landscapes. We evaluated fire-induced changes in forage resources for 2 focal ungulates, Stone's sheep (Ovis dalli stonei) and elk (Cervus canadensis), in northern British Columbia, Canada. We implemented 4 prescribed fires and monitored short-term vegetation (quantity and quality) and ungulate (Stone's sheep and elk) responses. We took measurements prior to burning, the year of burning, and 1 year after burning in treatment areas and adjacent unburned control areas in winter and summer at 2 scales. At a fine scale, we used vegetation transects and pellet counts; at the landscape scale, we used Landsat imagery for vegetation and aerial survey flights for animals. Following prescribed fire, shrub cover declined and burned communities increased in herbaceous cover. Plant species diversity also declined but increased to almost that of unburned areas by 1 year after burning. Burning increased quality of forage most (2-7 percentage points more digestibility and 0.3-6.3 percentage points more crude protein than unburned areas) in the summer of the burn. In winter, forage biomass and available digestible dry matter increased to pre-burn levels by 1 year after burning. Stone's sheep and elk always used burned areas more than unburned control areas in winter at both scales. Whereas elk used sites with higher forage quantity, Stone's sheep appeared to respond to forage quality at the fine scale. Ungulate grazing during the 2 years of this study did not alter forage quantity on burned or unburned sites, as determined from range exclosures. Based on our findings in this area, maximum benefits to elk would be achieved from large prescribed fires on south-aspect slopes that result in the greatest amounts of forage biomass. Smaller prescribed fires at high burn intensities on west-aspect slopes intermixed with rocky outcrops and talus scree (less frequented by elk) would most benefit Stone's sheep requirements for high-quality forage and escape terrain.

TI  - Assessing the accuracy of detected breaks in Landsat time series as predictors of small scale deforestation in tropical dry forests of Mexico and Costa Rica
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tracking the occurrence of deforestation events is an essential task in tropical dry forest (TDF) conservation efforts. Ideally, deforestation monitoring systems would identify a TDF clearing with near real time precision and high spatial detail, and alert park managers and environmental practitioners of illegal forest clearings occurring anywhere in a region of interest. Over the past several years there have been significant advances in the design and application of continuous land cover change mapping algorithms with these capabilities, but no studies have implemented such methods over human dominated TDF environments where small scale deforestation (< 5 ha) is widespread and hard to detect with moderate resolution sensors. The general objective for this research was to evaluate the overall accuracy of the BFASTSpatial R Package for detecting and monitoring small-scale deforestation in four sites located in tropical dry forest landscapes of Mexico and Costa Rica using greenness and moisture spectral indices derived from Landsat time series. Results show a high degree of spatial agreement (90%-94%) between the distribution of TDF clearings occurred during the 2013-2016 period (as indicated by VHR imagery interpretation) and BFASTSpatial outputs. NDMI and NBR2 had the best performance than other indices and this is evidenced by the combined overall, user's and producer's accuracies. In particular, NBR2 were the most accurate predictor of deforestation with an overall accuracy of 94.5%. Our results also imply that monitoring sites at an annual basis is feasible using BFASTSpatial and LTS, but that lower confidence should be given to sub-annual products given significant systematic temporal differences between the BFASTSpatial monthly product and reference data. The possibility of including more clear observations at the spatial resolution of Landsat (30-m) or higher will greatly increase the spatial and temporal accuracies of the method. Given its performance, BFASTSpatial can help monitor hotspots of small-scale TDF loss across Central and North America at little or no cost. Users of the method should have a strong knowledge of the local land use and land cover dynamics and the ecophysiology of vegetation types present in the landscape. This local expertise is necessary for interpreting and validating results as well as communicating its output to decision-makers and stakeholders.

TI  - Magma Propagation at Piton de la Fournaise From Joint Inversion of InSAR and GNSS
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Magma propagation is an unsteady process controlled by magma-crust interaction. To provide information on its dynamics, we invert complementary ground deformation data spanning the 8hr preceding the 26 May 2016 eruption at Piton de la Fournaise (PdF) volcano (La Reunion, France). Data are inverted using 3-D boundary element models combined with a Monte Carlo inversion method. The final geometry of the displacement source is determined based on four interferograms spanning the whole propagation phase while the dynamics of the propagation is inferred from temporal inversion of continuous Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data, using the final geometry as an a priori to constrain the source. The best modeled magma path consists in a 2,700-m-long sill located 800m above sea level and connected to the eruptive fissure by a subvertical dike. The quick opening of the horizontal part of the intrusion could have been favored by limited flank sliding during the early stage of propagation. The intrusion then stalled for approximate to 5hr, while pressure increased slightly, until final upward propagation and eruption. Volume budget suggests that the eruption was fed by a single batch of magma quickly disconnected from its source. The delay prior to the eruption may reflect a limited magma supply. Finally, two mechanisms, potentially acting together, might have favored the eruption: a driving role of magmatic gas and/or, as often observed at Piton de la Fournaise, an eastward flank slip.Plain Language Summary Basaltic magma stored beneath volcanoes reaches the surface by fracturing the Earth's crust. As experienced in May 2018 at Kilauea volcano (Hawaii, USA), magma can travel kilometers from the reservoir and fissure opening may threaten man-made structures. Anticipating where and when eruptive fissures open requires better understanding of the factors controlling magma propagation. During the 26 May 2016 eruption of Piton de la Fournaise, Reunion Island,the preeruptive crisis spanned 8hr25min from the first signal recorded by the observatory to the eruption onset.We determine the magma paths and propagation timing, which led to this eruption using complementary satellite data of ground surface displacement, combining radar interferometry, which provides high spatial resolution, with GPS, which provides high temporal resolution. We highlight complex magma propagation within the subareal volcano, showing two direction changes, an arrest and an acceleration. Flank slip and magma degassing seem to play a key role in controlling both the geometry and the timing. Based on this scenario, this event was close to turn into a failed eruption as there was a 5-hr pause in propagation before magma finally reached the surface. Understanding such unusual eruptions is a challenge for observatories as it may lead to repeated false alerts.

TI  - A method for monthly mapping of wet and dry snow using Sentinel-1 and MODIS: Application to a Himalayan river basin
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite Remote Sensing, with both optical and SAR instruments, can provide distributed observations of snow cover over extended and inaccessible areas. Both instruments are complementary, but there have been limited attempts at combining their measurements. We describe a novel approach to produce monthly maps of dry and wet snow areas through application of data fusion techniques to MODIS fractional snow cover and Sentinel-1 wet snow mask, facilitated by Google Earth Engine. The method is demonstrated in a 55,000 km(2) river basin in the Indian Himalayan region over a period of similar to 2.5 years, although it can be applied to any areas of the world where Sentinel-1 data are routinely available. The typical underestimation of wet snow area by SAR is corrected using a digital elevation model to estimate the average melting altitude. We also present an empirical model to derive the fractional cover of wet snow from Sentinel-1. Finally, we demonstrate that Sentinel-1 effectively complements MODIS as it highlights a snowmelt phase which occurs with a decrease in snow depth but no/little decrease in snowpack area. Further developments are now needed to incorporate these high resolution observations of snow areas as inputs to hydrological models for better runoff analysis and improved management of water resources and flood risk.

TI  - Maritime Vessel Classification to Monitor Fisheries with SAR: Demonstration in the North Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Integration of methods based on satellite remote sensing into current maritime monitoring strategies could help tackle the problem of global overfishing. Operational software is now available to perform vessel detection on satellite imagery, but research on vessel classification has mainly focused on bulk carriers, container ships, and oil tankers, using high-resolution commercial Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. Here, we present a method based on Random Forest (RF) to distinguish fishing and non-fishing vessels, and apply it to an area in the North Sea. The RF classifier takes as input the vessel's length, longitude, and latitude, its distance to the nearest shore, and the time of the measurement (am or pm). The classifier is trained and tested on data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). The overall classification accuracy is 91%, but the precision for the fishing class is only 58% because of specific regions in the study area where activities of fishing and non-fishing vessels overlap. We then apply the classifier to a collection of vessel detections obtained by applying the Search for Unidentified Maritime Objects (SUMO) vessel detector to the 2017 Sentinel-1 SAR images of the North Sea. The trend in our monthly fishing-vessel count agrees with data from Global Fishing Watch on fishing-vessel presence. These initial results suggest that our approach could help monitor intensification or reduction of fishing activity, which is critical in the context of the global overfishing problem.

TI  - APPLICATION OF SENTINEL-2 SATELLITE IMAGERY TO ASSESSMENT OF SPATIO-TEMPORAL CHANGES IN THE RESERVOIR OVERGROWTH PROCESS - A CASE STUDY: PRZEBEDOWO, WEST POLAND
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water reservoirs in recent years have been subject to strong anthropogenic pressure leading to their eutrophication and overgrowing processes. The paper analyzes the temporal and spatial changes in overgrowing of the reservoir in order to identify the factors determining the dynamics of this process. The analysis was carried out on the example of Przebedowo reservoir of 12 ha, located in western Poland. 42 Sentinel-2 Level-1C satellite images from the period between the 4rd July, 2015 and 6th April, 2018 were used in the study. The analysis of reservoir overgrowth process was based on the Water Adjusted Vegetation Index (WAVI). Overgrowth process was mapped by the simple segmentation algorithm using a threshold value. The analyzes were carried out using the SNAP and ArcGIS software. The results from 42 satellite images were grouped using cluster analysis (CA). Moreover, in order to indicate the factors determining the overgrowth process in terms of time and space, the main component analysis (PCA) was used. The obtained results show that the reservoir is subject to very intensive overgrowth over the entire surface. On the other hand, the dynamics of reservoir overgrowing in a year is related to thermal conditions and to a lower degree to the water level variability. Assessment of inter-annual changes in reservoir overgrowth was impossible because of the differences in temperature and temperature distribution over the analyzed years. The CA analysis allowed a division of the images into 4 groups, which present respectively the phase of plant growth, the phase of maximum coverage with plants, the phase of plants decline and the phase of minimal coverage with plants. The PCA analysis showed that the overgrowth process is initiated from the reservoir shore, the shallowest places are occupied first. Also, along the reservoir there is a gradient of overgrowth from the inlet to the outlet of the reservoir.

TI  - Performance evaluation of image fusion techniques for Indian remote sensing satellite data using Z-test
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Image fusion is being used since last two to three decades in remote sensing for improving visual appearance of coarse resolution imagery using fine spatial resolution data. The resultant outputs are being used successfully in various applications such as image classification, feature extraction, digital change detection, and many more including multi-temporal and multi-scale change detection. Acceptability of a fusion method for a particular application depends upon various factors; one of them is quality of fused image. In this research paper the four different image fusion techniques namely Ehlers, IHS fusion, Brovey and FuzeGo have been evaluated using IRS-P6 (Cartosat-1) and RESOURCESAT-2 (LISS-IV) images of Bhopal city, India. Quality of fusion results is assessed by performing visual analysis between fused image and multispectral (MS) image along with statistical analysis. Visual comparison is done based on better visibility of different land cover features such as roads, buildings, water body and sharpness of edges present in image. For statistical evaluation of fusion process, six statistical parameters i.e. standard deviation (SD), correlation coefficient (CC), entropy/noise, RMSE and ERGAS have been used. In addition to these traditional statistical measures, Z-test is used for combined assessment of fusion techniques. Visual comparisons of fusion results obtained for test site have shown that FuzeGo algorithm has given comparatively better results than other algorithms. Statistical parameter CC, SD are found highest for IHS method, RMSE, and ERGAS are found highest for Brovey method and least noise is added by FuzeGo algorithm. Overall visual analysis and Z-test indicates that FuzeGo has given better results which are followed by Ehlers as compare to other methods.

TI  - Common identity as a step to civilization longevity
T2  - FUTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - A common identity among humans coupled with existing local identities may be key to the longevity of our civilization. If a proxy for civilization longevity is the stability of a planet's sociopolitical environment, then the longevity of a civilization is tied to the activity and behavior of its inhabitants. We posit that societal stability, defined here as the potential for humans to avoid either physical or ideological conflict with members outside of their group, is enhanced by perception of common identity and a preparation in the personal handling of emotional complexity. These skills can be accommodated for in early education. Teaching the Earth from space as a corner-stone of common identity, leveraging on the "Overview Effect" described by astronauts, can help introduce a neutral worldview to students and offers a framework for cross-cultural exchange. Introducing psychology in the early curriculum provides tools to handle emotional complexity on par with the cognitive development of students. We suggest that a positive outcome in the development of common identity and emotional awareness would lead to the emergence of empathetic behavior and of personally-identified value of self. These foundations of societal stability would enable civilizational longevity.

TI  - Land Cover Classification Map of Northeast Asia Using GOCI Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover (LC) is an important factor in socioeconomic and environmental studies. According to various studies, a number of LC maps, including global land cover (GLC) datasets, are made using polar orbit satellite data. Due to the insufficiencies of reference datasets in Northeast Asia, several LC maps display discrepancies in that region. In this paper, we performed a feasibility assessment of LC mapping using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data over Northeast Asia. To produce the LC map, the GOCI normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used as an input dataset and a level-2 LC map of South Korea was used as a reference dataset to evaluate the LC map. In this paper, 7 LC types (urban, croplands, forest, grasslands, wetlands, barren, and water) were defined to reflect Northeast Asian LC. The LC map was produced via principal component analysis (PCA) with K-means clustering, and a sensitivity analysis was performed. The overall accuracy was calculated to be 77.94%. Furthermore, to assess the accuracy of the LC map not only in South Korea but also in Northeast Asia, 6 GLC datasets (IGBP, UMD, GLC2000, GlobCover2009, MCD12Q1, GlobeLand30) were used as comparison datasets. The accuracy scores for the 6 GLC datasets were calculated to be 59.41%, 56.82%, 60.97%, 51.71%, 70.24%, and 72.80%, respectively. Therefore, the first attempt to produce the LC map using geostationary satellite data is considered to be acceptable.

TI  - Improved t-SNE based manifold dimensional reduction for remote sensing data processing
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In our increasingly data-abundant society, remote sensing big data perform massive, high dimension and heterogeneity features, which could result in dimension disaster to various extent. It is worth mentioning that the past two decades have witnessed a number of dimensional reductions to weak the spatiotemporal redundancy and simplify the calculation in remote sensing information extraction, such as the linear learning methods or the manifold learning methods. However, the crowding and mixing when reducing dimensions of remote sensing categories could degrade the performance of existing techniques. Then in this paper, by analyzing probability distribution of pairwise distances among remote sensing datapoints, we use the 2-mixed Gaussian model(GMM) to improve the effectiveness of the theory of t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). A basic reducing dimensional model is given to test our proposed methods. The experiments show that the new probability distribution capable retains the local structure and significantly reveals differences between categories in a global structure.

TI  - Remote sensing application for the study of rapid flushing to remediate eutrophication in shallow lagoons (Albufera of Valencia)
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Albufera of Valencia shallow lagoon experiences water clarification about once a year. This study aimed to observe the timing of water clarity events and to detect the associated flow during these periods. Spatial variation in chlorophyll a along the Albufera was observed using remote sensing images. Due to the lagoon's spatial complexity and the varying water qualities flowing in from more than 60 tributaries, remote sensing was the only approach that could obtain images simultaneously covering the entire lagoon. The data were used to explore the evolution, duration and intensity of the clear-water phase, and the lagoon's subsequent re-eutrophication. The duration and intensity of the clear-water phase varied across the lagoon, but complete water quality renovation occurred in 1 week. Our analysis demonstrates that rapid flushing could remediate the lagoon eutrophication.

TI  - Identifying European Old-Growth Forests using Remote Sensing: A Study in the Ukrainian Carpathians
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Old-growth forests are an important, rare and endangered habitat in Europe. The ability to identify old-growth forests through remote sensing would be helpful for both conservation and forest management. We used data on beech, Norway spruce and mountain pine old-growth forests in the Ukrainian Carpathians to test whether Sentinel-2 satellite images could be used to correctly identify these forests. We used summer and autumn 2017 Sentinel-2 satellite images comprising 10 and 20 m resolution bands to create 6 vegetation indices and 9 textural features. We used a Random Forest classification model to discriminate between dominant tree species within old-growth forests and between old-growth and other forest types. Beech and Norway spruce were identified with an overall accuracy of around 90%, with a lower performance for mountain pine (70%) and mixed forest (40%). Old-growth forests were identified with an overall classification accuracy of 85%. Adding textural features, band standard deviations and elevation data improved accuracies by 3.3%, 2.1% and 1.8% respectively, while using combined summer and autumn images increased accuracy by 1.2%. We conclude that Random Forest classification combined with Sentinel-2 images can provide an effective option for identifying old-growth forests in Europe.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A study on MODIS (Moderate Resolution imaging Spectroradiometer)-derived chlorophyll-a concentration data was carried out for 12 years (2003 to 2014), to know the reasons for two episodic phytoplankton bloom events occurred in 2005 and 2013. During the month of December 2005 and 2013, magnitude of the production increased to two to three times of climatological value over the south-western Bay of Bengal region. Reasons for the bloom were examined with the available satellite resources and it was identified that the strong cyclonic eddy, with long residence time, caused the increase of the production. This production intensified when cyclones passed through or were close to the eddy. The vertical mixing enhanced (2013) when very severe cyclonic storms passed through or moved close to the eddy compared to depressions passing over it which caused further intensification of the primary production.

TI  - Estimating the Height and Basal Area at Individual Tree and Plot Levels in Canadian Subarctic Lichen Woodlands Using Stereo WorldView-3 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lichen woodlands (LW) are sparse forests that cover extensive areas in remote subarctic regions where warming due to climate change is fastest. They are difficult to study in situ or with airborne remote sensing due to their remoteness. We have tested a method for measuring individual tree heights and predicting basal area at tree and plot levels using WorldView-3 stereo images. Manual stereo measurements of tree heights were performed on short trees (2-12 m) of a LW region of Canada with a residual standard error of approximate to 0.9 m compared to accurate field or UAV height data. The number of detected trees significantly underestimated field counts, especially in peatlands in which the visual contrast between trees and ground cover was low. The heights measured from the WorldView-3 images were used to predict the basal area at individual tree level and summed up at plot level. In the best conditions (high contrast between trees and ground cover), the relationship to field basal area had a R-2 of 0.79. Accurate estimates of above ground biomass should therefore also be possible. This method could be used to calibrate an extensive remote sensing approach without in-situ measurements, e.g., by linking precise structural data to ICESAT-2 footprints.

TI  - Neurofilament is superior to cytokeratin 20 in supporting cutaneous origin for neuroendocrine carcinoma
T2  - HISTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimPrimary cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma, or Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), cannot be distinguished morphologically from small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (SmCC) from other sites. Immunohistochemistry is required to confirm cutaneous origin, and is also used for detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases of MCC. Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) expression is commonly used for these purposes, but is negative in some MCC cases, and has unclear specificity. We evaluated immunohistochemistry for neurofilament and CK20 in MCC compared with SmCC from other sites.Methods and resultsWe evaluated neurofilament expression in 55 MCC specimens from 39 unique patients, including nine CK20-negative MCC tumours. Neurofilament expression was observed in 42 of 55 (76.4%) MCC cases, including seven of nine (77.8%) CK20-negative MCC cases. Neurofilament was expressed in nine of 12 (75%) Merkel cell polyomavirus-positive tumours and five of 10 (50%) virus-negative tumours. Compared to a standard immunohistochemical panel (cytokeratin cocktail and CK20), neurofilament was 87.5% sensitive for detecting SLN metastases. Neurofilament and CK20 expression was also assessed in 61 extracutaneous SmCC from 60 unique patients, with primary sites including lung (27), bladder (18), cervix (3), gastrointestinal tract (3), sinonasal tract (2) and other sites (7). The specificity of neurofilament and CK20 for MCC versus non-cutaneous SmCC was 96.7% and 59.0%, respectively.ConclusionsNeurofilament has superior specificity to CK20 in distinguishing MCC from non-cutaneous SmCC. Neurofilament is frequently expressed in CK20- and virus-negative MCC tumours. Limitations of neurofilament immunohistochemistry include lower sensitivity than CK20 and subtle staining in some tumours. However, our findings indicate that neurofilament is useful for excluding non-cutaneous SmCC.

TI  - The Cynical Genius Illusion: Exploring and Debunking Lay Beliefs About Cynicism and Competence
T2  - PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Cynicism refers to a negative appraisal of human naturea belief that self-interest is the ultimate motive guiding human behavior. We explored laypersons' beliefs about cynicism and competence and to what extent these beliefs correspond to reality. Four studies showed that laypeople tend to believe in cynical individuals' cognitive superiority. A further three studies based on the data of about 200,000 individuals from 30 countries debunked these lay beliefs as illusionary by revealing that cynical (vs. less cynical) individuals generally do worse on cognitive ability and academic competency tasks. Cross-cultural analyses showed that competent individuals held contingent attitudes and endorsed cynicism only if it was warranted in a given sociocultural environment. Less competent individuals embraced cynicism unconditionally, suggesting thatat low levels of competenceholding a cynical worldview might represent an adaptive default strategy to avoid the potential costs of falling prey to others' cunning.

TI  - Sentinel bruising as a presentation of metastatic melanoma
T2  - BMJ CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A 46-year-old man presented with a 4-week history of bruising with subcutaneous nodules and weight loss. He also had a 2-week history of progressive back and hip pain. He had been diagnosed with stage Ib cutaneous melanoma 30 months previously, which had been fully excised. A sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative. On examination, there were five skin lesions at different stages. Each had spontaneously appeared as a bruise with a central subcutaneous nodule, and the bruising then faded to leave a persistent subcutaneous nodule. Excision of one of the nodules demonstrated a 4.5mm diameter partly necrotic melanoma deposit in the dermis. CT scan of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis showed widespread metastases. This rare presentation of cutaneous malignant melanoma metastases has been termed 'sentinel bruising'. There are fewer than 10 cases reported in the literature.

TI  - Unintentionally Retained Guidewires: A Descriptive Study of 73 Sentinel Events
T2  - JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Unintentionally retained foreign objects remain the sentinel events most frequently reported to The Joint Commission. Many of these objects are guidewires used to facilitate placement of catheters, tubes, and other devices. The purpose of this study was to describe reports of unintentionally retained guidewires in order to make recommendations to improve patient safety.Methods: A retrospective review was undertaken of unintentionally retained guidewires voluntarily reported to The Joint Commission from October 2012 through March 2018. Reports included the type of catheter or device, location of insertion, department, contributing factors, discovery period, patient harm, and a narrative description of the event.Results: A total of 73 reports of retained guidewires or parts of guidewires were reviewed. Retention occurred during insertion of vascular catheters, devices used during surgery, and drainage tubes. A total of 285 contributing factors were identified, most frequently within the categories of human factors, leadership, and communication. In the cases in which the discovery period was known, 39.3% were identified after hospital discharge. In 76.7% of reports, the harm was categorized as unexpected additional care or extended stay. Four patients died as a result of the retained guidewire.Conclusion: Unintentionally retained guidewires remain a significant patient safety issue. This study describes retained guidewires used to insert a variety of vascular catheters and devices, in different departments within hospitals. The large number of contributing factors demonstrates the complexity of care and provides new knowledge that can be used for designing interventions for prevention.

TI  - Evaluation of the Influence of Disturbances on Forest Vegetation Using the Time Series of Landsat Data: A Comparison Study of the Low Tatras and Sumava National Parks
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Review
AB  - This study focused on the evaluation of forest vegetation changes from 1992 to 2015 in the Low Tatras National Park (NAPANT) in Slovakia and the Sumava National Park in Czechia using a time series (TS) of Landsat images. The study area was damaged by wind and bark beetle calamities, which strongly influenced the health state of the forest vegetation at the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st century. The analysis of the time series was based on the ten selected vegetation indices in different types of localities selected according to the type of forest disturbances. The Landsat data CDR (Climate Data Record/Level 2) was normalized using the PIF (Pseudo-Invariant Features) method and the results of the Time Series were validated by in-situ data. The results confirmed the high relevance of the vegetation indices based on the SWIR bands (e.g., NDMI) for the purpose of evaluating the individual stages of the disturbance (especially the bark beetle calamity). Usage of the normalized Landsat data Climate Data Record (CDR/Level 2) in the research of long-term forest vegetation changes has a high relevance and perspective due to the free availability of the corrected data.

TI  - Surface mass distribution derived from three-dimensional acceleration point-mass modeling approach with spatial constraint methods
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global mass distribution could be continuously and repeatedly detected by gravity satellites at the same error scale, and great success has been achieved in related work in the past decades. It is valuable to continue studying the refinement methods and related applications of gravity satellite data. In this study, the relationship between the spherical harmonic coefficient variation of time-variable gravity field models and the mass change on the Earth's surface is developed, which is based on the basic principle of three-dimensional acceleration point-mass modeling approach (3D-PMA). The effect of the load deformation caused by the change of the Earth's surface mass distribution can be effectively considered in this method. The uniform-type, linear-type, exponential-type and Gaussian-type spatial constraint methods are introduced to smooth the north-south strip noise and to stabilize the ill-posed problems caused by downward continuation, and at the same time, the four spatial constraint methods are compared with zero-order Tikhonov regularization method. In order to compare and validate the three-dimensional acceleration point-mass modeling approach and four spatial constraint methods, the global mass distribution is computed by simulation data and one-month GRACE time-variable gravity solution (CSR-RL05 version data). The calculation results show that the optimal distance of exponential-type, Gaussian-type and uniform-type, linear-type spatial constraint methods is about 500 km and 600 km when 3-degree equal-area grid is used to arrange mass point on the Earth's surface. The influence of north-south strip noise can be effectively constrained by the spatial constraint methods, and four spatial constraint methods are better than zero-order Tikhonov regularization method. In general, it has provided reference for further use of gravity satellite data to monitor global mass change with relevant methods investigated in this paper.

TI  - The Ozone Water-Land Environmental Transition Study: An Innovative Strategy for Understanding Chesapeake Bay Pollution Events
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal regions have historically represented a significant challenge for air quality investigations because of water-land boundary transition characteristics and a paucity of measurements available over water. Prior studies have identified the formation of high levels of ozone over water bodies, such as the Chesapeake Bay, that can potentially recirculate back over land to significantly impact populated areas. Earth-observing satellites and forecast models face challenges in capturing the coastal transition zone where small-scale meteorological dynamics are complex and large changes in pollutants can occur on very short spatial and temporal scales. An observation strategy is presented to synchronously measure pollutants "over land" and "over water" to provide a more complete picture of chemical gradients across coastal boundaries for both the needs of state and local environmental management and new remote sensing platforms. Intensive vertical profile information from ozone lidar systems and ozonesondes, obtained at two main sites, one over land and the other over water, are complemented by remote sensing and in situ observations of air quality from ground-based, airborne (both personned and unpersonned), and shipborne platforms. These observations, coupled with reliable chemical transport simulations, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Air Quality Forecast Capability (NAQFC), are expected to lead to a more fully characterized and complete land-water interaction observing system that can be used to assess future geostationary air quality instruments, such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO), and current low-Earth-orbiting satellites, such as the European Space Agency's Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5-P) with its Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI).

TI  - Improved Spatiotemporal Representativeness and Bias Reduction of Satellite-Based Evapotranspiration Retrievals via Use of In Situ Meteorology and Constrained Canopy Surface Resistance
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key component of the atmospheric and terrestrial water and energy budgets. Satellite-based vegetation index approaches have used remotely sensed vegetation and reanalysis meteorological properties with surface energy balance models to estimate global ET (MOD16 ET). We reconstructed satellite retrievals using in situ meteorology (Argonne-ET) and evaluated them using a dense network of surface turbulent heat flux measurements. Argonne-ET resolves spatial heterogeneity of ET across the U.S. Southern Great Plains that is not well characterized by MOD16; MOD16 ET exhibits spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I significantly >0 in May-Aug.), whereas in situ and Argonne-ET exhibit characteristics of a random spatial process (Moran's I not significantly different from 0). The skill in resolving ET temporal variability is not significantly different between MOD16 and Argonne-ET (correlation coefficient=0.75 and 0.72, respectively). However, the root-mean-square errors were significantly lower for Argonne-ET (36W/m(2)) than MOD16 (43W/m(2)), and MOD16 exhibits substantial bias in annual ET relative to in situ measurements (-38%). This is attributed to overestimation in the dry canopy surface resistance (r(s)) parameterization. Using r(s) constrained to the range of typical measured values, Argonne-ET substantially reduces the bias in the annual ET (+1%). The improved ET estimates are critical for regional water budget analyses. The methodology presented herein also demonstrates the ability to retrieve high temporally resolved (30min; cf. 8-day MOD16) ET that can be used for development of processed-based diagnostics of model biases and to elucidate avenues to improve ET model parameterizations.Plain Language Summary Evapotranspiration (ET), the cumulative quantities of evaporation and plant transpiration, is a leading mechanism, second only to precipitation, for exchange of water between land and the atmosphere, but measurements of ET are limited. Assuming an energy balance between incoming radiation, heat transfer to the ground, heating of the atmosphere, and energy consumed by ET, previous research has estimated global ET distributions using satellite-based remote sensing of vegetation and data-driven simulations (reanalysis) of meteorological conditions. It is shown here that the use of reanalysis meteorology leads to a substantial bias in annual ET over the U.S. Southern Great Plains, but the bias can be greatly reduced by using actual meteorological measurements and constraining vegetation resistance to transpiration to realistic values. Findings presented herein provide an avenue to evaluate and improve modeling of land-atmosphere interactions and provide a methodology for improved estimation of annual ET for analysis of the water budget over land.

TI  - Single, separate or unified? Exploring Christian academicians' views of the body, sport and religious experience
T2  - SPORT IN SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study addresses the need for increased empirical works within the sport and religion literature by exploring faculty views of embodiment and sport in relation to their Christian worldview. Data were collected through a qualitative method using faculty teaching in sport-related units at universities in the USA and Canada. A grounded theory design was employed to analyse semi-structured interviews related to participants' theological understandings of embodiment and sport. The following themes were identified: persons can be viewed in monistic, dualistic and holistic ways; the body and sport have theological importance; and the body and sport are avenues for religious experience and expression. Participants' views of human personhood influenced their perception of embodiment, as well as the type and quality of religious experience possible within embodied activities such as sport. Findings have implications for religious and nonreligious practitioners interested in how religious faith informs the understanding and practice of sport.

TI  - The influence of slope on vegetation recovery following nonnative grazer removal on Santa Rosa Island, California
T2  - WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem restoration efforts have been ongoing on the Channel Islands of California since the 1980s. Although these island ecosystems evolved without ungulate grazers, large nonnative grazers, including sheep, cattle, feral pigs, deer, and elk, were present on the islands for over 160 years. Intensive grazing led to reductions in the extent of woody vegetation, increases in the area of grassland and bare ground. and widespread Iandsliding and gully erosion. This study focuses on Santa Rosa Island, the second largest (215.3 km(2 )) island in Channel Islands National Park. After the park was created in 1980, the National Park Service progressi removed nonnative grazers to facilitate the restoration of native vegetation and the wildlife communities they support. We constructed a time series (1989 to 2015) of Landsat TM5 and Landsat 7 ETM+ images to evaluate large-scale and long-term vegetation change in response to grazer removal on Santa Rosa Island. We also evaluated the influence of slope percent, which can be an indicator of past grazing accessibility, on ecosystem recovery. Results indicate that removing nonnative grazers led to passive restoration of 42.1 km(2) of scrub, chaparral, and woodland vegetation. In contrast, the area of grassland vegetation decreased by 31.2 km(2) and bare ground decreased by 12.0 km(2 ). The extent of scrub and woodland vegetation recovery was greater on gentle and moderate slopes compared to steep slopes, indicating that terrain does influence passive restoration. Despite changes in vegetation cover, 5.4 km(2) has remained bare. Much of the bare ground is on ridgelines that were denuded down to the bedrock or regolith. Active restoration will be necessary on bare ridgelines, such as erosion control, fog capture, and oak woodland reforestation.

TI  - Combining Physically Based Modeling and Deep Learning for Fusing GRACE Satellite Data: Can We Learn From Mismatch?
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global hydrological and land surface models are increasingly used for tracking terrestrial total water storage (TWS) dynamics, but the utility of existing models is hampered by conceptual and/or data uncertainties related to various underrepresented and unrepresented processes, such as groundwater storage. The gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) satellite mission provided a valuable independent data source for tracking TWS at regional and continental scales. Strong interests exist in fusing GRACE data into global hydrological models to improve their predictive performance. Here we develop and apply deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to learn the spatiotemporal patterns of mismatch between TWS anomalies (TWSA) derived from GRACE and those simulated by NOAH, a widely used land surface model. Once trained, our CNN models can be used to correct the NOAH-simulated TWSA without requiring GRACE data, potentially filling the data gap between GRACE and its follow-on mission, GRACE-FO. Our methodology is demonstrated over India, which has experienced significant groundwater depletion in recent decades that is nevertheless not being captured by the NOAH model. Results show that the CNN models significantly improve the match with GRACE TWSA, achieving a country-average correlation coefficient of 0.94 and Nash-Sutcliff efficient of 0.87, or 14% and 52% improvement, respectively, over the original NOAH TWSA. At the local scale, the learned mismatch pattern correlates well with the observed in situ groundwater storage anomaly data for most parts of India, suggesting that deep learning models effectively compensate for the missing groundwater component in NOAH for this study region.Plain Language Summary Global hydrological models are increasingly being used to assess water availability and sea level rise. Deficiencies in the conceptualization and parameterization in these models may introduce significant uncertainty in model predictions. GRACE satellite senses total water storage at the regional/continental scales. In this study, we applied deep learning to learn the spatial and temporal patterns of mismatch or residual between model simulation and GRACE observations. This hybrid learning approach leverages strengths of data science and hypothesis-driven physical modeling. We show, through three different types of convolution neural network-based deep learning models, that deep learning is a viable approach for improving model-GRACE match. The method can also be used to fill in data gaps between GRACE missions.

TI  - The Modeling of the North Equatorial Countercurrent in the Community Earth System Model and its Oceanic Component
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) simulated by a coupled ocean-atmosphere model and its oceanic component have been investigated and compared against oceanographic observations. Coupled model simulations using the Community Earth System Model version 2 are compared against ocean-ice simulations forced by the second phase of the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments (CORE) data set. The modeled circulation biases behave differently to the west of and to the east of 120 degrees W: the CORE-forced ocean model largely underestimates the NECC transport to the west and the coupled model underestimates it to the east. Further analysis suggests that the surface wind stress and its curl is the most important forcing term for correctly simulating the NECC in both models. West of 120 degrees W, the NECC biases in the ocean model are attributed to the southward movement of the maximum easterly trade winds in the Northern Hemisphere and the associated wind stress curl (WSC) pattern; east of 120 degrees W, the NECC biases in the coupled model are attributed to the weak northward cross-equatorial winds and southwestward gap winds, which lead to a weak WSC gradient at the latitude of NECC. Further analysis confirms that the WSC biases comes mainly from the zonal wind bias, which may in turn relate to the protocol of CORE-II of adjusting reanalysis winds toward satellite data, which include the relative wind effect.

TI  - Routine retrieval of pelvic sentinel lymph nodes for melanoma rarely adds prognostic information or alters management
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are commonly identified during inguinal SLN biopsy for melanoma, but retrieval is not uniform among surgeons/centers. Few studies have assessed rates of micrometastases in pelvic versus superficial inguinal SLNs. Previous studies suggested that presence of pelvic SLNs was predicted by aggressive pathologic features and that their presence portended a worse prognosis. The objectives of this study were to examine presurgical predictors of pelvic SLNs among patients undergoing inguinal SLN biopsy, assess rates of micrometastases in superficial inguinal versus pelvic SLNs, and determine whether presence of pelvic SLNs was associated with long- term outcomes. Multivariable regression was used to assess presurgical factors associated with presence of pelvic SLNs. Rates of micrometastases in superficial inguinal versus pelvic SLNs in patients who had a pelvic SLN were compared with McNemar's test. Groin recurrence, disease- free survival (DFS), and disease- specific survival were analyzed by Kaplan- Meier method. A multivariable Cox model for DFS was performed. Pelvic SLNs were retrieved in 100/537 (18.6%) superficial inguinal SLN biopsies and no preoperative factors predicted their presence. In patients with a pelvic SLN, micrometastases were present in 3.0% of pelvic versus 34.0% of superficial inguinal SLN biopsies (P< 0.001). There were no differences in groin recurrence, DFS, and disease- specific survival for patients with/ without pelvic SLNs in univariate analyses (all P> 0.2) or in the multivariable Cox model for DFS (hazard ratio: 1.1, 95% confidence interval: 0.6- 2.1). In conclusion, pelvic SLNs harbor micrometastases less frequently than superficial inguinal SLNs do, suggesting that omission of pelvic SLN biopsy may be reasonable.

TI  - An Artificial Intelligence Application for Post-Earthquake Damage Mapping in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A Mw 7.4 earthquake hit Donggala County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, on 28 September 2018, triggering a tsunami and liquefaction in Palu City and Donggala. Around 2101 fatalities ensued and 68,451 houses were damaged by the earthquake. In light of this devastating event, a post-earthquake map is required to establish the first step in the evacuation and mitigation plan. In this study, remote sensing imagery from the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites was used. Pre- and post-earthquake satellite images were classified using artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and processed using a decorrelation method to generate the post-earthquake damage map. The affected areas were compared to the field data, the percentage conformity between the ANN and SVM results was analyzed, and four post-earthquake damage maps were generated. Based on the conformity analysis, the Landsat-8 imagery (85.83%) was superior to that of Sentinel-2 (63.88%). The resulting post-earthquake damage map can be used to assess the distribution of seismic damage following the Palu earthquake and may be used to mitigate damage in the event of future earthquakes.

TI  - Object-Based Change Detection Using Multiple Classifiers and Multi-Scale Uncertainty Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The drawback of pixel-based change detection is that it neglects the spatial correlation with neighboring pixels and has a high commission ratio. In contrast, object-based change detection (OBCD) depends on the accuracy of the segmentation scale, which is of great significance in image analysis. Accordingly, an object-based approach for automatic change detection using multiple classifiers and multi-scale uncertainty analysis (OB-MMUA) in high-resolution (HR) remote sensing images is proposed in this paper. In this algorithm, the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), morphological, and Gabor filter texture features are extracted to construct the input data, along with the spectral features, to utilize the respective advantages of the features and to compensate for the insufficient spectral information. In addition, random forest is used to select the features and determine the optimal feature vectors for the change detection. Change vector analysis (CVA) based on uncertainty analysis is then implemented to select the initial training samples. According to the diversity, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and extra-trees (ExT) classifiers are then chosen as the base classifiers for Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory fusion, and unlabeled samples are selected using an active learning method with spatial information. Finally, multi-scale object-based D-S evidence theory fusion and uncertainty analysis is used to classify the difference image. To validate the proposed approach, we conducted experiments using multispectral images collected by the ZY-3 and GF-2 satellites. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach, which integrates the respective advantages of the pixel-based and object-based methods.

TI  - Clinicopathologic features correlated with paradoxical outcomes in stage IIC versus IIIA melanoma patients
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Under current AJCC staging criteria, stage IIC patients paradoxically have worse outcomes than IIIA patients despite the lack of nodal metastatic disease. This study sought to identify additional clinicopathologic characteristics correlated with worse patient outcomes. Retrospective chart review of stage IIC and IIIA melanoma patients were evaluated between 1995 and 2011 with clinical follow-up through 2015. Records were reviewed for demographics, clinical characteristics, and tumor pathology. Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon's rank-sum test were used to assess group differences. Clinicopathologic features were evaluated relative to overall survival (OS), time to distant metastases, and local/regional recurrence. Overall, 128 patients were included (45 stage IIC and 83 stage IIIA) with a median follow-up time of 5.7 years. Compared with stage IIIA patients, stage IIC patients were older, and their melanomas were more likely to be nodular, amelanotic, thicker, have higher mitotic rate, tumor lymphocytic infiltrate, no radial growth phase, and less likely to have associated precursor lesions. Stage IIC patients had shorter OS and time to distant metastases; multivariate regression revealed that older age (>55 years) and mitotic rate (>5 mitoses/mm(2)) were independent predictors of OS. Melanomas in stage IIC disease may be biologically distinct from those that are seen in stage IIIA. While sentinel node biopsies remain the standard-of-care, these results suggest that clinicians may want to assess the clinicopathologic characteristics described above to aggressively counsel, screen for distant disease, and consider adjuvant therapy, in particular for older patients and higher mitotic rates in thicker primary tumors, regardless of nodal status.

TI  - Monitoring of surface instability in tourist zones in Sanya (China) using high-resolution SAR interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sanya City, in China, is experiencing rapid urbanization and expansion of tourism, followed by various geological hazards. In this letter, 25 spotlight-mode TerraSAR-X images (acquired from March 2010 to November 2011) and Multi-temporal spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry were used for the wide-area instability monitoring of a tourist zone in Sanya, China. The Persistent Scatterers (PSs) were first extracted in the settlement region, and then the Distributed Scatterers (DSs) were identified in the suburban and mountain regions to increase the monitoring extent; this was followed by a temporal-spatial filtering to reduce the decorrelation noise. The Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) method was used for the deformation estimation and instability mapping. The results show that several mountain slopes and urban grounds were unstable and subsiding, and potential security risks existed. The main reasons were human activities such as construction, forest harvesting, farming, mining, and even tourism. The findings highlight the effectiveness of PS-DS integrated multi-temporal interferometry in the coastal city and facilitate the hazard prevention, tourism planning and management decisions.

TI  - Opto-mechanical Design of Self-calibraiton Radiometric Reference Source Prototype Based on Spontaneous Parametric Down-conversion
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to meet the requirements of ultra-high precision calibration for global climate observation and quantitative remote sensing, a prototype system based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion self-calibration radiation reference source was developed. The design was fully considered to be modular, lightweight and integrated. The static analysis of the key part of the detector module showed that the position of the detector's photosensitive surface was shifted by 21 mu m, the photosensitive surface of the detector was 180 mu m, and the diameter of the photon spot of the lens was 16 mu m. The spot could be fully detected, which met the design requirements. A low-light camera was used to observe the photon spots in front of each detector, the results showed that the spot shape was regular and the size was complete. The single photon detector was used to collect the relevant photons. The eight-channel four-pair correlated photon matching peaks were drawn by the coincidence measurement, and the principle was verified. The machine structure was well designed to meet the design goals.

TI  - Modeling and Precise Processing for Spaceborne Transmitter/Missile-Borne Receiver SAR Signals
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spaceborne transmitter/missile-borne receiver (ST/MR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) could provide several unique advantages, such as wide coverage, unrestricted geography, a small detection probability of the missile, and forward-looking imaging. However, it is also accompanied by problems in imaging, including geometric model establishment and focusing algorithm design. In this paper, an ST/MR SAR model is first presented and then the flight-path constraint, characterized by geometric configurations, is derived. Considering the impacts brought about by the maneuvers of the missile, a non-"Stop-Go' mathematical model is devised and it can avoid the large errors introduced by the acceleration, which is neglected in the traditional model. Finally, a two-dimensional (2-D) scaling algorithm is developed to focus the ST/MR data. Without introducing any extra operations, it can greatly remove the spatial variations of the range, azimuth, and cross-coupling phases simultaneously and entirely in the 2-D hybrid domain. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and focusing approach.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval From SAR and Optical Data Using a Combined Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing inversion of vegetation-covered soil moisture is often affected by crop canopy, surface roughness, and other factors. In order to eliminate the scattering influence of vegetation effectively, this paper developed a modified vegetation backscattering model to retrieve vegetation-covered soil moisture based on multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data and field measurements. This model combined the advantages of optical and radar methods by considering scattering contributions of underlying bare soil and vegetation canopy. Vegetation coverage was used to separate the scattering mechanism of the vegetation from bare soil component in a pixel. In addition, advanced integral equation method was presented to define the scattering of underlying bare soil. PROSAIL optical model was applied to calculate crown water content, which is an important variable associated with the scattering of vegetation canopy. Results demonstrated that the modified model on March 29, 2014 performed better in soil moisture retrieval than that at other growth stages with R-2 of 0.806 and root-mean-square error of 0.043 m(3).m(-3), respectively. Soil moisture can be effectively retrieved by using the modified model in an agricultural region where the surface type is ranging from relatively sparse to full cover. Overall, the modified model provides an insight into extensive application of vegetation-covered soil moisture retrieval in agricultural regions.

TI  - Mapping forest disturbance intensity in North and South Carolina using annual Landsat observations and field inventory data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbance and regrowth are vital processes in determining the roles of forest ecosystem in the carbon and biogeochemical cycles. Using time series observations, the vegetation change tracker (VCT) algorithm was designed to map the location, timing, and spectral magnitudes of forest disturbance events. While these spectral disturbance magnitudes are indicative of physical changes in tree cover or biomass, their quantitative relationships have yet to be established. This study focuses on estimating disturbance intensity as measured by percent basal area removal using spectral indices from the VCT algorithm over North and South Carolina. Repeat measurements on Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) ground plots, which provide changes in basal area between multiple dates at precise locations, are used for training and validation of the model. The overall R-2 between predicted disturbance intensity and reference data is 0.66, and cross-validation prediction uncertainty is 14% in North Carolina. Possible causes of this uncertainty could be site heterogeneity and the temporal offset between ground measurements and satellite observations. Results show the area of stand clearing disturbances remains relatively stable around 1143 km(2) yr(-1) in North and South Carolina throughout the period of observations (1985-2015). The average amount of forest area affected by partial disturbance is much higher at 3287 km(2) yr The area of partial disturbances has strong inter-annual variability with a high value of 6000 km(2) in 2007 and a low value of 1919 km(2) in 2013.

TI  - Prevalence and anatomy of the axillary arch and its implications in surgical practice: A meta-analysis
T2  - SURGEON-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL COLLEGES OF SURGEONS OF EDINBURGH AND IRELAND
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: The following research aimed to investigate the prevalence and anatomical features of the axillary arch (AA) - a muscular, tendinous or musculotendinous slip arising from the latissimus dorsi and that terminates in various structures around the shoulder girdle. The AA may complicate axillary lymph node biopsy or breast reconstruction surgery and may cause thoracic outlet syndrome.Methods: Major electronic databases were thoroughly searched for studies on the AA and its variations. Data regarding the prevalence, morphology, laterality, origin, insertion and innervation of the AA was extracted and included in this meta-analysis. The AQUA tool was used in order to assess potential risk of bias within the included studies.Results: The AA was reported in 29 studies (10,222 axillas), and its pooled prevalence estimate in this meta-analysis was found to be 5.3% of the axillas: unilaterally (61.6%) and bilaterally (38.4%). It was predominantly muscular (55.1% of the patients with the AA), originated from the latissimus dorsi muscle or tendon (87.3% of the patients with the AA), inserted into the pectoralis major muscle or fascia (35.2% of the patients with the AA), and was most commonly innervated by the thoracodorsal nerve (39.9% of the patients with the AA).Conclusion: The AA is a relatively common variant, hence it should not be neglected. Oncologists and surgeons should consider this variant while diagnosing an unknown palpable mass in the axilla, as the arch might mimic a neoplasm or enlarged lymph nodes.

TI  - BEAUTY IN MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION: SYNERGETIC WORLDVIEW
T2  - OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The most important concepts underlying beauty are the mathematical concepts of symmetry and fractality. These categories are fundamental for modern mathematics, science and culture in general. However, in mathematical education and pedagogical literature, the ratio of these main categories has not been considered yet. Of special interest is the fact that the concepts of fractals, fractality and fractal geometry and fractal graphics are not included in the vast majority of high school programmes, although they have become commonly used among mathematicians and graphic designers.The aims of the article were the following: to demonstrate intersectionality and correlations of the basic concepts of symmetry and fractals from the point of view of synergetics, to establish the relevance of studying these concepts in the course of mathematics for aesthetic education of students and development of their worldview.Methodology and research methods. A significant role in the study is given to post-non-classical methodology based on synergetic worldview. The author employed the provisions of trinitarian methodology: in addition to two binary oppositions, the third element is necessary to solve the problem of contradiction of these oppositions and integration into one coherent whole as the conditions of their coexistence. In the course of the research, analysis and generalisation of pedagogical and methodical literature, methods of comparative, historical and logical types of analysis were used.Results and scientific novelty. For centuries, beauty has been understood as a stable order and symmetry. The synergetrics as a general scientific theory about self-organisation of complex systems allows us to give another interpretation of beauty - as a kind of attractor, the result of self-organisation of nature or the flight of human thought.In the most general view, symmetry can be considered as transformation of similarity, which is also the core of another concept - fractality. On the one hand, fractality can be considered as one of the manifestations of symmetry in the broad sense. On the other hand, symmetry can be considered as a manifestation of fractality with a finite number of iterations. Thus, the concepts of symmetry and fractality are closely interrelated. Symmetry and fractality are two opposites, mutually complementing each other, aesthetically and mathematically mutually passing into each other. Symmetry reveals the beauty of a sustainable order and fractality reflects the beauty of the result of self-organisation of the chaos of nature or the freedom of the human mind. Therefore, symmetry and fractals are the most important concepts for the disclosure of the beauty of the universe, which determines their importance for mathematical learning and for aesthetic education of students.Practical significance. Taking into account the fact that the concepts of symmetry and fractals are directly related to each other, they should be jointly-taught. This will contribute to the development concept of mathematics education: to increase motivation for mathematical studies, to develop cognitive interests and activities, to narrow the gap between education and research processes, to overcome the problems with aesthetic education of students.

TI  - High-resolution remote sensing and advanced classification techniques for the prospection of archaeological sites' markers: The case of dung deposits in the Shashi-Limpopo Confluence area (southern Africa)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Archaeological prospection through remote sensing is based on the contrast between areas of archaeological interest and their surroundings. It has been used as the cheapest and the fastest way of locating and documenting areas of archaeological interest since the 1920s, initially with the aid of film-based aerial photographs. In recent years, there has been a shift towards the use of multispectral satellite data in prospecting for archaeological sites because of their ability to give information on spectral characteristics of archaeological material beyond the visible spectrum. However, spectral signatures for identifying archaeological sites are not universal, and an assessment of the applicability of remote sensing techniques in different archaeological landscapes is needed. This study tests the feasibility of prospecting for archaeological sites previously occupied by farming communities in the Shashi-Limpopo Confluence Area of southern Africa, using very high-resolution satellite WorldView-2 images. It also assesses the performance of advanced classification algorithms (support vector machine and random forest) and the contribution of new WorldView-2 bands in detecting archaeological sites. Two independent accuracy assessments were carried out, using a data set collected by Huffman (2011, 2009a) and a randomly generated holdout test dataset, respectively. The results demonstrate the potential of remote sensing methods in prospecting for archaeological sites previously occupied by farming communities using very high-resolution satellite images and advanced classification algorithms. Very high overall accuracies were achieved by: random forest, 95.29% using holdout sample and 97.71% using independent dataset; support vector machine, 88.82% using holdout sample and 95.88% using independent dataset, respectively. The new WorldView-2 bands were of least importance (compared to traditional bands) in detecting sites in Shashi-Limpopo Confluence Area. Despite high classification accuracies achieved by both classifiers, there were some misclassifications between vitrified dung sites and river sand. Therefore, to address this problem, this study recommends the use of robust classifiers such as object-based algorithms because of their ability to segment an image into homogenous objects and classify them using a combination of spectral, textual, sub-pixels, spatial, relational and contextual methods.

TI  - Toward a sustainable city of tomorrow: a hybrid Markov-Cellular Automata modeling for urban landscape evolution in the Hanoi city (Vietnam) during 1990-2030
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The targets and challenges of the sustainable city of tomorrow are wide. In Hanoi city (Vietnam), the sustainable aspects of the urban landscape evolution are affected by a rapid urbanization, inefficient urban spatial planning, and the pressures of contemporary socioeconomic growth. This paper describes the evolution of urban landscape in Hanoi during the period 1990-2030. The background is the urbanization and the changes in urban planning. Urban land use/land cover of Hanoi city in 1993, 2000, 2007, 2012, and 2015 is described using LANDSAT satellite images. Land use/land cover of Hanoi in 2030 is projected by the Markov-cellular automata, which are a hybrid model of Markov chain analysis, multi-criteria evaluation, and cellular automata. The results show that Hanoi is becoming a metropolis, gradually having more dynamics and more diversity, but having less green in its pattern until 2030. All over Hanoi city, the built-up areas expanded, while the non-built area and water bodies narrowed. Residential, industrial, commercial, and service areas grow increasingly faster and become dense in the southwestern and southeastern parts of the city. New lakescapes and water corridors orient new urban development. Green areas become smaller and more fragmented. Agricultural rings have been cleared and replaced by new urban areas. Planning and managing the urban evolution toward sustainable development are imperative in Hanoi. The methods described in this paper can be effective tools expected to help planners, managers, and residents to deal with these concerns in the future. Moreover, socioeconomic development, environmental protection, improving urban planning efficiency, and integrating local governance into urban planning should be prioritized for a sustainable Hanoi city in the future.

TI  - Remote Sensing Approaches for Monitoring Mangrove Species, Structure, and Biomass: Opportunities and Challenges
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The mangrove ecosystem plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, mangroves have been lost worldwide, resulting in substantial carbon stock losses. Additionally, some aspects of the mangrove ecosystem remain poorly characterized compared to other forest ecosystems due to practical difficulties in measuring and monitoring mangrove biomass and their carbon stocks. Without a quantitative method for effectively monitoring biophysical parameters and carbon stocks in mangroves, robust policies and actions for sustainably conserving mangroves in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation are more difficult. In this context, remote sensing provides an important tool for monitoring mangroves and identifying attributes such as species, biomass, and carbon stocks. A wide range of studies is based on optical imagery (aerial photography, multispectral, and hyperspectral) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Remote sensing approaches have been proven effective for mapping mangrove species, estimating their biomass, and assessing changes in their extent. This review provides an overview of the techniques that are currently being used to map various attributes of mangroves, summarizes the studies that have been undertaken since 2010 on a variety of remote sensing applications for monitoring mangroves, and addresses the limitations of these studies. We see several key future directions for the potential use of remote sensing techniques combined with machine learning techniques for mapping mangrove areas and species, and evaluating their biomass and carbon stocks.

TI  - Hybrid spatiotemporal simulation of future changes in open wetlands: A study of the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region, Quebec, Canada
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the most productive ecosystems around the world, wetlands support a wide range of biodiversity such as waterfowl, fish, amphibians, plants and many other species. They also provide ecosystem services that play important roles in relation to nutrient cycling, climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as food security. In this research, we examined and projected the spatiotemporal trends of change in open wetlands by coupling logistic regression, Markov chain methods and a multi-objective land allocation model into a hybrid geosimulation model. To study the changes in open wetlands we used multi-temporal land cover information interpreted from LANDSAT images (1985, 1995, and 2005). We predicted future spatial distributions of open wetlands in the administrative region of Abitibi-Temiscamingue, Quebec, Canada for 2015, 2025, 2035, 2045 and 2055. A comparison and assessment of the model's outcomes were performed using map-comparison techniques as well as landscape metrics. Change analysis between 1985 and 2005 showed an increase of about 63% in open wetlands, while simulation results indicated that this tendency would persist into 2055 with a continuous augmentation of open wetlands in the region. The spatial distribution of predicted trends in open wetlands could provide support to local biodiversity assessments, management and conservation planning of the open wetlands in Quebec, Canada.

TI  - Approximation of diffuse attenuation, K<sub>d</sub>, for MODIS high-resolution bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A high resolution depth attenuation product (K-d(hires)) was developed using MODIS 500m and 250m spectral bands. The K-d(hires) was compared with Wang's operational K-d for the Chesapeake Bay. Minimal differences were observed between the two methods, with greatest deviation occurring in areas of high turbidity in the tributaries. After tuning the new K-d(hires), the mean absolute error and bias between the two algorithms was 0.22m(-1) and 0.026m(-1), indicating good agreement. Higher spatial resolution provides for improved retrievals along the coast and into the narrow sections of the tributaries, coinciding with areas of concern to estuarine health and coastal management applications.

TI  - Encounters with the Other: Transcultural Possibilities in the Wachowskis' and Tykwer's <i>Cloud Atlas</i>
T2  - OPEN CULTURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Wachowskis' and Tykwer's Cloud Atlas indicates strong potential for an investigation into the advancement of transcultural messages in global cinema because of its conceptual commitment to narrate the story against the backdrop of sexuality, race, gender, and class. By combining critical discourse analysis (Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge, Power/Knowledge) with literary criticisms of postcolonial works (Hall, Hardt and Negri) and transcultural concepts of culture (Welsch, The Puzzling Form of Cultures Today; Rings, The Other in Contemporary Migrant Cinema), this paper investigates how far Cloud Atlas promotes transcultural identity constructs. Upon analysis of central themes and prominent characters Cloud Atlas transmits a message that if the aforementioned socio-cultural barriers can be overcome, we can cultivate something akin to a transcultural society. However, linkages to colonial discourse and quintessential cinematic conventions vis-a-vis white individualistic heroism demonstrate that Cloud Atlas's liberalhumanist worldview is one that can ultimately be branded as compromised by monocultural assumptions of US values and ideals as superior.

TI  - Ecosystem services in different agro-climatic zones in eastern India: impact of land use and land cover change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change have considerable influence on ecosystem services. Assessing change in ecosystem services due to LULC change at different spatial and temporal scales will help to identify suitable management practices for sustaining ecosystem productivity and maintaining the ecological balance. The objective of this study was to investigate variations in ecosystem services in response to LULC change over 27years in four agro-climatic zones (ACZ) of eastern India using satellite imagery for the year 1989, 1996, 2005, 2011 (Landsat TM) and 2016 (Landsat 8 OLI). The satellite images were classified into six LULC classes, agriculture land, forest, waterbody, wasteland, built-up, and mining area. During the study period (1989 to 2016), forest cover reduced by 5.2%, 13.7%, and 3.6% in Sambalpur, Keonjhar, and Kandhamal districts of Odisha, respectively. In Balasore, agricultural land reduced by 17.2% due to its conversion to built-up land. The value of ecosystem services per unit area followed the order of waterbodies > agricultural land > forests. A different set of indicators, e.g., by explicitly including diversity, could change the rank between these land uses, so the temporal trends within a land use are more important than the absolute values. Total ecosystem services increased by US$ 1296.4x10(5) (50.74%), US$ 1100.7x10(5) (98.52%), US$ 1867x10(5) (61.64%), and US$ 1242.6x10(5) (46.13%) for Sambalpur, Balasore, Kandhamal, and Keonjhar, respectively.

TI  - Using MODIS/Terra and Landsat imageries to improve surface water quantification in Sylhet, Bangladesh
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Bangladesh has experienced multiple freshwater issues including salinization from monsoonal floods and groundwater over-pumping that induces severe land subsidence. Therefore, using satellite observations to virtually build a monitoring network becomes an efficient and innovative means. We focus on the Sylhet Mymensingh haor area that has the highest annual precipitation and the largest inundation area in northeastern Bangladesh. The modified normalized difference water index is first used to extract water area from MODIS and Landsat-5/-7/-8 optical imageries. A weekly flood chance model is then created from a sequence of images to recover water extent from the cloud-covered images. Using MODIS images for water identification achieves an overall accuracy of 84% in rainy season and 41% in dry season as validated with Sentinel-1A radar images. This model can be further used to refine the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model (DEM). As compared with ICESat laser altimetry, the root-mean-square of the height difference is improved from 1.65 m to 1.16 m after DEM modification. By combining the recovered water area and the refined DEM, surface water volume (WV) is quantified. A comparison with the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravimetry retrieved equivalent water heights (EWHs) in 2002 - 2015 is conducted, where the correlation coefficient and root-mean-square of the EWH difference are 91.7% and 0.09 m, respectively.

TI  - Positive sentinel node in luminal A-like breast cancer patients-implications for adjuvant chemotherapy?
T2  - ACTA ONCOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In luminal A-like breast cancer, the indication for adjuvant chemotherapy still is largely based on lymph nodestatus. Sentinel node (SN) positive patients who are no longer recommended an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) risk undertreatment, especially if they have >= 4 lymph node metastases (LNMs). Aim: To quantify the group of SN positive luminal A-like patients with >= 4 LNMs and to investigate if the ratio between positive SNs and examined SNs (SN ratio) can provide information of the axillary tumor burden. Material and methods: Nearly 370 patients between 2014-2016 in Western Sweden with a clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer treated with both SNB and subsequent ALND were included. SNB findings were compared to ALND findings and the ability of the SN ratio to describe the axillary tumor burden was evaluated using multivariable analysis. Results: In total,17.6% of patients with luminal A-like tumors had >= 4 LNMs. The SN ratio was statistically significant for predicting >= 4 LNMs among luminal A-like patients (p = .013, OR 1.89 (95% CI 1.14-3.12) per 0.1 increment in SN ratio). Conclusions: One sixth of patients with SN positive luminal A-like tumors risk undertreatment. The SN ratio may aid in identifying many of these patients.

TI  - Identification of Water Body Extent Based on Remote Sensing Data Collected with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents an efficient methodology of water body extent estimation based on remotely sensed data collected with UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). The methodology includes the data collection with selected sensors and processing of remotely sensed data to obtain accurate geospatial products that are finally used to estimate water body extent. Three sensors were investigated: RGB (Red Green Blue) camera, thermal infrared camera, and laser scanner. The platform used to carry each of these sensors was an Aibot X6a multirotor type of UAV. Test data was collected at 6 sites containing different types of water bodies, including 4 river sections, an old river bed, and a part of a lake shore. The processing of collected data resulted in 2.5-D and 2-D geospatial products that were used subsequently for water body extent estimation. Depending on the type of used sensor, the created geospatial product, and the type of the water body and the land cover, three strategies employing image processing tools were developed to estimate water body range. The obtained results were assessed in terms of classification accuracy (distinguishing the water body from the land) and geometrical planar accuracy of the water body extent. The product identified as the most suitable in water body detection was four bands RGB+TIR (Thermal InfraRed) ortho mosaic. It allowed to achieve the average kappa coefficient of the water body identification above 0.9. The planar accuracy of water body extent varied depending on the type of the sensor, the geospatial product, and the test site conditions, but it was comparable with results obtained in similar studies.

TI  - Land-use Assessment and its Influence on Spatial Distribution of Rainfall Erosivity: Case Study of Cameron Highlands Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the years, Cameron Highlands have witnessed extensive land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes due to the massive agricultural and urbanization activities. This significantly contributed to the erosion problems in the area. Rainfall erosivity that measures the aggressiveness of raindrop in triggering soil erosion is one of its major components that could be influenced by the LULC changes in watersheds. However, the research relating to the-LULC changes with the erosivity especially in the complex landscape is scarce. Hence, this study applies geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to assess the LULC changes and their influence on the rainfall erosivity distribution in mountainous watershed of Cameron Highlands. Four Landsat images and the rainfall data from the period of thirty years were analysed for the development of LULC and erosivity maps respectively in ArcGIS environment. The study showed that the study area experienced immense land-use changes especially in agriculture and urbanization which affected the erosivity distribution. The LULC change for agriculture increased linearly in the last 30 years from 7.9% in 1986 to almost 16.4% in 2016. The results showed that urban development increased from 5.1% in 1986 to 11.4% in 2016. The increasing urbanization trend was targeted to meet up with tourism requirement in Cameron Highlands. However, forest class declined tremendously due to the exploration of land for agriculture practice and other various types of development. Watershed managers and other stakeholders should find this study beneficial in tackling erosion and its associated ecological challenges.

TI  - Simulation of regional irrigation requirement with SWAT in different agro-climatic zones driven by observed climate and two reanalysis datasets
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation water is one of the most substantial water uses worldwide. Thus, global simulation studies about water availability and demand typically include irrigation. Nowadays, regional scale is of major interest for water resources management but irrigation lacks attention in many catchment modelling studies. This study evaluated the performance of the agro-hydrological model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) for simulating streamflow, evapotranspiration and irrigation in four catchments of different ago-climatic zones at meso-scale (Baitarani/India: Subtropical monsoon; Ilmenau/Germany: Humid; Rata/Chile: Mediterranean; Thubon/Vietnam: Tropical). The models were calibrated well with Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) varying from 0.74-0.89 and percentage bias (PBIAS) from 5.66-6.43%. The simulated irrigation is higher when irrigation is triggered by soil-water deficit compared to plant-water stress. The simulated irrigation scheduling scenarios showed that a significant amount of water can be saved by applying deficit irrigation (25-48%) with a small reduction in annual average crop yield (0-33%) in all climatic zones.Many catchments with a high share of irrigated agriculture are located in developing countries with a low availability of input data. For that reason, the application of uncorrected and bias-corrected National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and ERA-interim (ERA) reanalysis data was evaluated for all model scenarios. The simulated streamflow under bias-corrected climate variables is close to the observed streamflow with ERA performing better than NCEP. However, the deviation in simulated irrigation between observed and reanalysis climate varies from -25.5-45.3%, whereas the relative irrigation water savings by deficit irrigation could be shown by all climate input data. The overall variability in simulated irrigation requirement depends mainly the climate input data. Studies about irrigation requirement in data scarce areas must address this in particular when using reanalysis data. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Polarimetric Target Decompositions and Light Gradient Boosting Machine for Crop Classification: A Comparative Evaluation
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In terms of providing various scattering mechanisms, polarimetric target decompositions provide certain benefits for the interpretation of PolSAR images. This paper tested the capabilities of different polarimetric target decompositions in crop classification, while using a recently launched ensemble learning algorithm-namely Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). For the classification of different crops (maize, potato, wheat, sunflower, and alfalfa) in the test site, multi-temporal polarimetric C-band RADARSAT-2 images were acquired over an agricultural area near Konya, Turkey. Four different decomposition models (Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden, Van Zyl, and Yamaguchi) were employed to evaluate polarimetric target decomposition for crop classification. Besides the polarimetric target decomposed parameters, the original polarimetric features (linear backscatter coefficients, coherency, and covariance matrices) were also incorporated for crop classification. The experimental results demonstrated that polarimetric target decompositions, with the exception of Cloude-Pottier, were found to be superior to the original features in terms of overall classification accuracy. The highest classification accuracy (92.07%) was achieved by Yamaguchi, whereas the lowest (75.99%) was achieved by the covariance matrix. Model-based decompositions achieved higher performance with respect to eigenvector-based decompositions in terms of class-based accuracies. Furthermore, the results emphasize the added benefits of model-based decompositions for crop classification using PolSAR data.

TI  - Graft dysfunction in simultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation (SPK): Results of concurrent kidney and pancreas allograft biopsies
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPLANTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplants offer significant therapeutic advantages but present a diagnostic approach dilemma in the diagnosis of rejection. Because both organs are from the same donor, the kidney has been treated traditionally as the sentinel organ to biopsy, presumably representing the status of both allografts. Truly concurrent biopsy studies, however, are needed to confirm this hypothesis. We examined 101 concurrent biopsies from 70 patients with dysfunction in either or both organs. Results showed concurrent rejection in 23 of 57 (40%) of cases with rejection; 19 of 57 (33.5%) and 15 of 57 (26.5%) showed kidney or pancreas only rejection, respectively. The degree and type of rejection differed in the majority (13 of 23, 56.5%) of cases with concurrent rejection, with the pancreas more often showing higher rejection grade. Taking into account pancreas dysfunction, a positive kidney biopsy should correctly predict pancreas rejection in 86% of the instances. However, the lack of complete concordance between the 2 organs, the discrepancies in grade and type of rejection, and the tendency for higher rejection grades in concurrent or pancreas only rejections, all support the rationale for pancreas biopsies. The latter provide additional data on the overall status of the organ, as well as information on nonrejection-related pathologies.

TI  - Sinking Tide Gauge Revealed by Space-borne InSAR: Implications for Sea Level Acceleration at Pohang, South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical land motion at tide gauges influences sea level rise acceleration; this must be addressed for interpreting reliable sea level projections. In recent years, tide gauge records for the Eastern coast of Korea have revealed rapid increases in sea level rise compared with the global mean. Pohang Tide Gauge Station has shown a +3.1 cm/year sea level rise since 2013. This study aims to estimate the vertical land motion that influences relative sea level rise observations at Pohang by applying a multi-track Persistent Scatter Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) time-series analysis to Sentinel-1 SAR data acquired during 2015-2017. The results, which were obtained at a high spatial resolution (10 m), indicate vertical ground motion of -2.55 cm/year at the Pohang Tide Gauge Station; this was validated by data from a collocated global positioning system (GPS) station. The subtraction of InSAR-derived subsidence rates from sea level rise at the Pohang Tide Gauge Station is 6 mm/year; thus, vertical land motion significantly dominates the sea level acceleration. Natural hazards related to the sea level rise are primarily assessed by relative sea level changes obtained from tide gauges; therefore, tide gauge records should be reviewed for rapid vertical land motion along the vulnerable coastal areas.

TI  - A novel characterization technique for superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles: The superparamagnetic quantifier, compared with magnetic particle spectroscopy
T2  - REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are used as a tracer material in sentinel node biopsies. The latter is a procedure to analyze if cancer cells have spread to lymph nodes, helping to personalize patient care. To predict SPION behavior in vivo, it is important to analyze their magnetic properties in biological environments. The superparamagnetic quantifier (SPaQ) is a new device to measure the dynamic magnetization curve of SPIONs. The magnetization curve was measured for two types of SPIONs: Resovist and SHP-25. We used three techniques: Vibrating Sample Magnetometry (VSM), Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy (MPS), and our new SPaQ. Furthermore, AC susceptibility (ACS) measurements were performed as part of the evaluation of the three techniques. SPaQ and VSM results were found to be similar. Measurement results were nearly identical in both directions, indicating minor hysteresis. However, in MPS measurements, a clear hysteresis loop was observed. Furthermore, the ACS measurements showed a pronounced Brownian maximum, indicating an optimal response for an AC frequency below 10 kHz for both particle systems. Both the SPaQ and MPS were found to be superior to VSM since measurements are faster, can be performed at room temperature, and are particularly sensitive to particle dynamics. The main difference between the SPaQ and MPS lies in the excitation sequence. The SPaQ combines an alternating magnetic field that has a low amplitude with a gradual DC offset, whereas MPS uses only an alternating field that has a large amplitude. In conclusion, both the SPaQ and MPS are highly suited to improve understanding SPION behavior, which will lead to the radical improvement of sentinel node biopsy accuracy. (C) 2019 Author(s).

TI  - Effect of High Glucose on Human Alveolar Macrophage Phenotype and Phagocytosis of Mycobacteria
T2  - LUNG
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Diabetes mellitus (DBM) reduces immunological activity and increases susceptibility to various infections, including tuberculosis (TB). Human alveolar macrophage (hAM) functions are altered in DBM.Methods To mimic hyperglycemic conditions in the lung alveolus, we co-cultured a hAM cell line (Daisy cell line) with human umbilical vein endothelial cells for 48 h in the presence of culture media alone, normal glucose (5 mM), and high glucose (22 mM). Using flow cytometry, immunophenotype characterization included cell surface markers CD 11c, CD14, CD16, CD86, CD163, CD169, CD206, CX3CR-1, CSF-1R, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9). Phagocytic function was measured by immunofluorescence microscopy at 24 h after inoculation of cells with GFP-expressing Mycobacterium smegmatis.Results Direct exposure of AMs to high glucose and exposure in the co-culture system yield different results for the same phenotypic markers. MMP9 expression was increased under both conditions. CD169 and CX3CR1 expressions were decreased when AMs were exposed directly to high glucose but increased under co-culture. Immunofluorescence assay revealed that phagocytosis decreased in AMs when directly exposed to increased glucose levels from 2.5 mM to normal glucose (5 mM), yet AMs under co-culture did not show decreased phagocytosis until concentrations were raised to 25 mM.Conclusion Alteration in the expression of certain receptors may contribute to defective sentinel function of AMs, promoting susceptibility to TB in a diabetic host. Variability in cell surface marker expression under direct glucose exposure compared to exposure via co-culture reveals that cell signaling between endothelial cells and AMs may play a crucial role in the phenotypic expression of AMs.

TI  - Does the Awareness of Mortality Shape People's Openness to Violence and Conflict? An Examination of Terror Management Theory
T2  - POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terror management theory (TMT) proposes that evoking death-related thoughts (mortality salience; MS) in individuals or groups can lead to stronger worldview defence and greater support for extremist violence. In three experiments, we tested whether an MS manipulation, and associated moderators, increased support for extremist violence. In Australian university students, Study 1 found no statistically significant main or moderated effects for MS on measures of extremist violence. However, participants exposed to the MS manipulation reported increases in conservative religiosity (belief in divine power). In Study 2, the MS manipulation had no significant effect on support for extremist violence for Australian university students primed with an antiviolent extremism norm. And in young Australian Jewish people (Study 3), the MS manipulation did not increase support for violence against migrants. However, there was an increase in support for policies that act to fight against violent extremism in Iraq and Syria in those exposed to the MS manipulation. Across three studies, we find little support for the hypothesis that MS results in increased support for violent extremism. Larger more methodological sound studies are needed to address inconsistencies in the evidence surrounding TMT and the MS hypothesis, at least in regards to violence and extremism.

TI  - Development and validation of a nomogram to predict recurrence and melanoma-specific mortality in patients with negative sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Patients with melanoma and negative sentinel nodes (SNs) have varying outcomes, dependent on several prognostic factors. Considering all these factors in a prediction model might aid in identifying patients who could benefit from a personalized treatment strategy. The objective was to construct and validate a nomogram for recurrence and melanoma-specific mortality (MSM) in patients with melanoma and negative SNs.Methods: A total of 3220 patients with negative SNs were identified from a cohort of 4124 patients from four EORTC Melanoma Group centres who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy. Prognostic factors for recurrence and MSM were studied with Cox regression analysis. Significant factors were incorporated in the models. Performance was assessed by discrimination (c-index) and calibration in cross-validation across the four centres. A nomogram was developed for graphical presentation.Results: There were 3180 eligible patients. The final prediction model for recurrence and the calibrated model for MSM included three independent prognostic factors: ulceration, anatomical location and Breslow thickness. The c-index was 0.74 for recurrence and 0.76 for the calibrated MSM model. Cross-validation across the four centres showed reasonable model performance. A nomogram was developed based on these models. One-third of the patients had a 5-year recurrence probability of 8.2 per cent or less, and one-third had a recurrence probability of 23.0 per cent or more.Conclusion: A nomogram for predicting recurrence and MSM in patients with melanoma and negative SNs was constructed and validated. It could provide personalized estimates useful for tailoring surveillance strategies (reduce or increase intensity), and selection of patients for adjuvant therapy or clinical trials.

TI  - Clinical use of an opto-nuclear probe for hybrid sentinel node biopsy guidance: first results
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionGuidelines advocate the use of combined detection techniques to achieve optimal results for sentinel node (SN) biopsy. The fluorescent and radioactive (dual-) tracer ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid has been shown to facilitate SN biopsy in several indications. It was reported that an opto-nuclear probe permitted the detection of near-infrared fluorescence and gamma-rays. The aim of the current study was to evaluate this device in a large patient group and to test it in both open and laparoscopic surgery implications.MethodsThirty-three patients scheduled for SN biopsy with the dual-tracer were retrospectively analyzed. Pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy was performed in all patients; in 18 patients (55%), a SPECT/CT scan was also performed. Radioactive and fluorescent signatures in the SNs were assessed in vivo and ex vivo using the opto-nuclear probe.ResultsOne or more SNs were identified in all patients (identification rate 100%). Planar lymphoscintigraphic images revealed 95 hot spots that were considered as SNs. This number increased to 103 SNs when SPECT/CT was used. During surgery, 106 SNs were excised. In vivo, the fluorescence mode of the opto-nuclear probe was able to locate 79 SNs (74.5%). When the gamma-ray detection option of the same probe was used, this number increased to 99 SNs (93.3%). Ex vivo analysis revealed fluorescence in 93.3% of the excised nodes and radioactivity in 95.2%.ConclusionsThis study underlines the feasibility of using the dual-tracer/opto-nuclear probe combination for SN resections. The use of the opto-nuclear technology has been extended to laparoscopic surgery. This study also underlines the fluorescence tracing can complement traditional radio-tracing approaches.

TI  - Monitoring of Chilika Lake mouth dynamics and quantifying rate of shoreline change using 30 m multi-temporal Landsat data
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Coastal erosion is one of the major and serious concerns for coastal communities residing in the low lying areas, especially near to estuary delta regions. These regions see lots of anthropogenic activities such as economic development, infrastructure and human settlement especially in rapidly developing countries such as India. Shoreline change is a natural process that occurs in coastal areas. But due to the stresses happening in the coast because of anthropogenic activities, understanding how shorelines change over time is important for sustainable management of coast. A crucial aspect of shoreline change monitoring is to identify the location and change over time which can be achieved by developing monitoring strategies using satellite remote sensing data. Performing shoreline change analysis using long term satellite records will help us to understand how shorelines respond to coastal development over time. In the present study we investigate shoreline erosion and accretion rate using three temporal Landsat scenes acquired over a thirty year period for the years 1988, 2000 and 2017. Digital Shoreline Change Analysis System (DSAS) an extension of ArcGIS software was used to compute rate of change statistics by calculating End Point Rate (EPR) values. We observed that Chilika coast is experiencing both erosion and accretion process with very high erosion rate of -13.6 m/yr and accretion of 13.5 m/yr, at Chilika Lake mouth. The average erosion and accretion rate of -1.13 m/yr and 1.41 m/yr were recorded for the study region. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Long term complications following pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy for endometrial cancer, incidence and potential risk factors: a single institution experience
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To determine the incidence of long term lymphadenectomy complications in primary surgery for endometrial cancer and to elucidate risk factors for these complications.Methods A retrospective chart review was carried out for all patients with endometrial cancer managed at Parma University Hospital Unit of Gynecology and Obstetrics between 2010 and 2016. Inclusion criteria were surgical procedure including hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy (pelvic or pelvic and aortic). We identified patients with postoperative lymphocele and lower extremity lymphedema. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictive factors for postoperative complications.Results Of the 249 patients tested, 198 underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy (79.5%), and 51 (20.5%) of those underwent both pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Among the 249 patients, 92 (36.9 %) developed lymphedema while 43 (17.3%) developed lymphocele. Multivariate analysis showed that addition of para-artic lymphadenectomy was an independent predictor for both lymphedema (odds ratio (OR) 2.764, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.023 to 7.470) and lymphocele (OR 5.066, 95% CI 1.605 to 15.989). Moreover, postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (OR 2.733, 95% CI 1.149 to 6.505) and identification of any positive lymph node (OR 19.391, 95% CI 1.486 to 253.0) were significantly correlated with lymphedema, while removal of circumflex iliac nodes (OR 8.596, 95% CI 1.144 to 65.591) was associated with lymphoceles occurrence.Conclusion Although sentinel lymph node navigation is a promising option, lymphadenectomy represents the primary treatment in many patients with endometrial cancer. However, comprehensive nodal dissection remains associated with a high rate of long term complications, such as lymphedema and lymphocele. Avoiding risk factors that are related to the development of these postoperative complications is often difficult and, therefore, the strategy to assess lymph nodal status in these women must be tailored to obtain the maximum results in terms of oncological and functional outcome.

TI  - Quantification of an overlooked water resource in the tropical rainfed lowlands using RapidEye satellite data: A case of farm ponds and the potential gross value for smallholder production in southern Laos
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In southern Laos, water stored in farm ponds is largely underutilised as it is perceived to be unfit for human consumption; subsequently, groundwater is the preferred source for domestic and agricultural consumption. For the first time, this paper presents the results of a study designed to quantify the total pond water volume within the landscape via remote-sensing methods in two districts in Champasak province that could be used to improve rural household cash income through the expansion of market-oriented dry season crop production. Water bodies were delineated via simple classification of RapidEye data using the Normalised Difference Water Index and a sub-classification was performed to distinguish between ponds and the streamflow network. Final estimates of total pond volume in Sukhuma and Phonthong districts were similar to 2.30 x 10(6) m(3) and 3.55 x 10(6) m(3), respectively; and the average pond volume across both districts was similar to 1987 m(3). Sensitivity analysis of the potential gross value of farm ponds for irrigation of dry season, vegetable production typical of market-oriented smallholder activities in the area indicated that substantial gross economic gains could be made from better use and management of these resources.

TI  - An Overall Evaluation of Water Transparency in Lake Malawi from MERIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Malawi is an important water resource in Africa. However, there is no routine monitoring of water quality in the lake due to financial and institutional constraints in the surrounding countries. A combination of satellite data and a semi-analytical algorithm can provide an alternative for routine monitoring of water quality, especially in developing countries. In this study, we first compared the performance of two semi-analytical algorithms, Doron11 and Lee15, which can estimate Secchi disk depth (SD) from satellite data in Lake Malawi. Our results showed that even though the SD estimations from the two algorithms were very highly correlated, the Lee15 outperformed the Doron11 in Lake Malawi with high estimation accuracy (RMSE = 1.17 m, MAPE = 18.7%, R = 0.66, p < 0.05). We then evaluated water transparency in Lake Malawi using the SD values estimated from nine years of Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) data (2003-2011) with the Lee15 algorithm. Results showed that Lake Malawi maintained four water transparency levels throughout the study period (i.e., level 1: SD > 12 m; level 2: SD between 6-12 m; level 3: SD between 3-6 m; level 4: SD between 1.5-3 m). The level 1 and 2 water areas tended to shift or trade places depending on year or season. In contrast, level 3 and 4 water areas were relatively stable and constantly distributed along the southwestern and southern lakeshores. In general, Lake Malawi is dominated by waters with SD values larger than 6 m (>95%). This study represents the first overall and comprehensive analysis of water transparency status and spatiotemporal variation in Lake Malawi.

TI  - Conflation of expert and crowd reference data to validate global binary thematic maps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the unprecedented availability of satellite data and the rise of global binary maps, the collection of shared reference data sets should be fostered to allow systematic product benchmarking and validation. Authoritative global reference data are generally collected by experts with regional knowledge through photo-interpretation. During the last decade, crowdsourcing has emerged as an attractive alternative for rapid and relatively cheap data collection, beckoning the increasingly relevant question: can these two data sources be combined to validate thematic maps? In this article, we compared expert and crowd data and assessed their relative agreement for cropland identification, a land cover class often reported as difficult to map. Results indicate that observations from experts and volunteers could be partially conflated provided that several consistency checks are performed. We propose that conflation, i.e., replacement and augmentation of expert observations by crowdsourced observations, should be carried out both at the sampling and data analytics levels. The latter allows to evaluate the reliability of crowdsourced observations and to decide whether they should be conflated or discarded. We demonstrate that the standard deviation of crowdsourced contributions is a simple yet robust indicator of reliability which can effectively inform conflation. Following this criterion, we found that 70% of the expert observations could be crowdsourced with little to no effect on accuracy estimates, allowing a strategic reallocation of the spared expert effort to increase the reliability of the remaining 30% at no additional cost. Finally, we provide a collection of evidence-based recommendations for future hybrid reference data collection campaigns.

TI  - The effect of terrain factors on rice production: A case study in Hunan Province
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the most important staple crop of China, and its production is related to both natural condition and human activities. It is fundamental to comprehensively assess the influence of terrain conditions on rice production to ensure a steady increase in rice production. Although many studies have focused on the impact of one or several specific factors on crop production, few studies have investigated the direct influence of terrain conditions on rice production. Therefore, we selected Hunan Province, one of the major rice-producing areas in China, which exhibits complex terrain conditions, as our study area. Based on remote sensing data and statistical data, we applied spatial statistical analysis to explore the effects of terrain factors on rice production in terms of the following three aspects: the spatial patterns of paddy fields, the rice production process and the final yield. We found that 1) terrain has a significant impact on the spatial distribution of paddy fields at both the regional scale and the county scale; 2) terrain controls the distribution of temperature, sunlight and soil, and these three environmental factors consequently directly impact rice growth; 3) compared with the patterns of paddy fields and the rice production process, the influences of terrain factors on the rice yield are not as evident, with the exception of elevation; and 4) the spatial distribution of paddy fields mismatched that of production resources due to terrain factors. Our results strongly suggest that managers should scientifically guide farmers to choose suitable varieties and planting systems and allocate rice production resources in the northern plain regions to ensure food security.

TI  - The synthesis of a new macromolecule for the sentinel node detection: <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-gly-mannosyl-dextran
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective We aimed to design and synthesize a new macromolecule for sentinel node detection to improve the imaging quality and avoid possible adverse effect.Background The imaging of sentinel lymph node has been an important field in the nuclear medicine. A lot of imaging agents have been developed, including Tc-99m-sulfer colloid, Tc-99m-labeled dextrans and the latest Tc-99m-DTPA-mannosyl-dextran. With the technology advanced, the imaging ability of the agents has been better and better. However, there are still some drawbacks.Materials and methods The new macromolecule agent was based on the dextran macromolecule backbone. Then the gly-gly-gly and mannose molecules were conjugated onto the backbone proportionally by targeting two different reaction sites. Once the new macromolecule was labelled with Tc-99m, its imaging ability was tested by single-photon emission computed tomography scanning with Tc-99m-sulfur colloid as the comparison.Results The average numbers of gly-gyl-gyl and mannosyl groups on the dextran backbone are determined to be similar to 1: 2 per dextran. The average molecular diameter and molecular weight are measured to be 5.4 +/- 0.7 nm and 10 324 g/mol, respectively. The macromolecule is labelled by Tc-99m with 93.2 +/- 2.4% radiochemical yield. The lymphatic imaging by single-photon emission computed tomography with the labeled compound showed no worse imaging ability but cost less time than the commercially available Tc-99m-sulfur colloid.Conclusion A new macromolecule imaging agent for sentinel node detection has been synthesized with better imaging ability and less imaging time cost.

TI  - Improving Estimation of Gross Primary Production in Dryland Ecosystems by a Model-Data Fusion Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and continuous monitoring of the production of arid ecosystems is of great importance for global and regional carbon cycle estimation. However, the magnitude of carbon sequestration in arid regions and its contribution to the global carbon cycle is poorly understood due to the worldwide paucity of measurements of carbon exchange in arid ecosystems. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) gross primary productivity (GPP) product provides worldwide high-frequency monitoring of terrestrial GPP. While there have been a large number of studies to validate the MODIS GPP product with ground-based measurements over a range of biome types. Few studies have comprehensively validated the performance of MODIS estimates in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, especially for the newly released Collection 6 GPP products, whose resolution have been improved from 1000 m to 500 m. Thus, this study examined the performance of MODIS-derived GPP by compared with eddy covariance (EC)-observed GPP at different timescales for the main ecosystems in arid and semi-arid regions of China. Meanwhile, we also improved the estimation of MODIS GPP by using in situ meteorological forcing data and optimization of biome-specific parameters with the Bayesian approach. Our results revealed that the current MOD17A2H GPP algorithm could, on the whole, capture the broad trends of GPP at eight-day time scales for the most investigated sites. However, GPP was underestimated in some ecosystems in the arid region, especially for the irrigated cropland and forest ecosystems (with R-2 = 0.80, RMSE = 2.66 gC/m(2)/day and R-2 = 0.53, RMSE = 2.12 gC/m(2)/day, respectively). At the eight-day time scale, the slope of the original MOD17A2H GPP relative to the EC-based GPP was only 0.49, which showed significant underestimation compared with tower-based GPP. However, after using in situ meteorological data to optimize the biome-based parameters of MODIS GPP algorithm, the model could explain 91% of the EC-observed GPP of the sites. Our study revealed that the current MODIS GPP model works well after improving the maximum light-use efficiency (epsilon(max) or LUEmax), as well as the temperature and water-constrained parameters of the main ecosystems in the arid region. Nevertheless, there are still large uncertainties surrounding GPP modelling in dryland ecosystems, especially for desert ecosystems. Further improvements in GPP simulation in dryland ecosystems are needed in future studies, for example, improvements of remote sensing products and the GPP estimation algorithm, implementation of data-driven methods, or physiology models.

TI  - A Recursive Update Model for Estimating High-Resolution LAI Based on the NARX Neural Network and MODIS Times Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) remote sensing data products with a high resolution (HR) and long time series are in demand in a wide variety of applications. Compared with long time series LAI products with 1 km resolution, LAI products with high spatial resolution are difficult to acquire because of the lack of remote sensing observations in long-term sequences and the lack of estimation methods applicable to highly variable land-cover types. To address these problems, we proposed a recursive update model to estimate 30 m resolution LAI based on the updated Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with Exogenous Inputs (NARX) neural network and MODIS time series. First, we used a variety of HR satellite remote sensing observations to produce HR datasets for recent years. Historical low spatial resolution MODIS products were employed as background information and used to calculate the initial parameters of the NARX neural network for each pixel. Subsequently, one year's reflectance from the HR dataset was used as the new observation that was input into the NARX model to estimate the HR LAI of that year, and the background and HR data were then used for remodeling to update the NARX model parameters. This procedure was recursively repeated year by year until both MODIS background data and all HR data were involved in the modeling. Finally, we obtained an LAI time series with 30 m resolution. In the cropland study area in Hebei Province, China, the results were compared with LAI measurements from ground sites in 2013 and 2014. A high degree of similarity existed between the results for the two study years (RMSE2013 = 0.288 and RMSE2014 = 0.296). The HR LAI estimates showed favorable spatiotemporal continuity and were in good agreement with the multisample ground survey LAI measurements. The results indicated that for data with a rapid revisit cycle and high spatial resolution, the recursive update model based on the NARX neural network has excellent LAI estimation performance and fairly strong fault-tolerance capability.

TI  - Selection and Characterization of Glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau as Potential Pseudoinvariant Calibration Sites
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vicarious calibration using pseudoinvariant calibration sites (PICS) has become increasingly popular, as it is the most cost-effective method for on-orbit calibration of space-borne optical sensors. Glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are located at more than 4500 m above sea level. These snow targets, exhibiting much brighter reflectance and less affected by aerosol and water vapor than desert targets, can help to reduce the uncertainties associated with vicarious calibration. In contrast to polar snow, the TP is not limited by polar night, thus ensuring continuous calibration monitoring. This study investigated the potential role of TP glaciers as PICS for the first time. To accomplish this, the coefficient of variation (CV) was applied to characterize the spatial uniformity and temporal stability of five relatively larger and flatter TP glaciers based on several independent Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager datasets over 20 years. The criteria of CV < 3% (both spatial and temporal) through Landsat visible and near-infrared channels were used to identify potential PICS across the candidate glaciers. Finally, three snow PICS with areas of at least 7.2 km(2) and two snow PICS with areas of 1.2-2.1 km(2) were identified. The area of the snow PICS is smaller in autumn and winter due to the snow cover. The feasibility of using these sites for long-term calibration monitoring of satellite sensors is also discussed. Results indicate that although the snow PICS exhibits stronger BRDF than the invariant desert target, the MODIS calibration trends detected from snow PICS are comparable to those from the desert target.

TI  - Superresolution mapping based on hybrid interpolation by parallel paths
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Superresolution mapping (SRM) is a technology to handle mixed pixels in remote sensing image. In this letter, a novel hybrid interpolation-based SRM by parallel paths (HISRM-PP) is proposed. Firstly, the two different high resolution fractional images for each class are respectively derived by parallel paths. Then the two kinds of high resolution fractional images are integrated to produce the higher resolution fractional images by the appropriate weighting parameter. Finally, the higher resolution fractional images are utilized to obtain SRM result by class allocation. Due to the parallel paths in HISRM-PP, the more spatial-spectral information of the original image is utilized to improve the accuracy of SRM result. Experimental results on the two real remote sensing data show that HISRM-PP produces the better SRM result than the existing hybrid interpolation-based SRM (HISRM).

TI  - Was the trend of the net sediment flux in Poyang Lake, China, altered by the Three Gorges Dam or by sand mining?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The net sediment flux in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, converted from positive to negative after 2000. Whether the effect of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) or sand mining caused this change was disputed. We analyzed the trend of sediment input and output in Poyang Lake from 1956 to 2014, determined the annual numbers of sand dredgers by interpreting Landsat ETM+images, and calculated the changes to the annual net sediment flux (Sediment(diff)) after 2000. The decreased sediment input was mainly caused by decreased sediment concentrations in the five tributaries. The increased sediment output was caused by increased sediment concentrations, which was not related to the operation of the TGD, but strongly related to sand mining activities in the northern parts of the lake. The Sediment(diff) variation in different operational periods of the TGD showed that the TGD was not the main driver of the change to the net sediment flux trend in Poyang Lake. The strong positive correlation between the number of sand dredgers and Sediment(diff) indicated that sand mining activities in the northern parts of the lake were important drivers of the changes in the net sediment flux trend in Poyang Lake after 2000. It was sand mining activities, rather than the TGD, that altered the trend of the net sediment flux in Poyang Lake after 2000.

TI  - Variability of the Great Whirl and Its Impacts on Atmospheric Processes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using satellite remote sensing data and re-analysis products for the period of 1993-2015, the variation of a large anticyclonic eddy, the so-called Great Whirl (GW), located in the Northwest Indian Ocean off the coast of Somali, and its impacts on atmosphere were investigated. The GW is generated in early summer and decays in late fall every year. The center of the GW is located at 7.73 degrees N, 53.20 degrees E. The mean lifetime, sea level anomaly (SLA) difference, sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA), radius, normalized vorticity, eddy kinetic energy (EKE), and deformation rate are 169 days, 0.07 m, 0.83 degrees C, 116.86 km, -0.53, 0.08 m(2).s(-2), and 0.58, respectively. All these variables exhibit interannual variations. Composite analyses show that the maximum values of sea surface temperature (SST), wind, and water vapor anomalies occur in the northwest of the GW center. The fitting coefficient between the SST and wind speed anomaly is 1.1, indicating that, corresponding to 1 degrees C increases of the SST, the wind speed increases by about 1.1 m.s(-1), and the fitting coefficient between the SST and water vapor anomaly is 0.45, indicating that water vapor increases by about 0.45 mm in response to 1 degrees C increases in the SST. In the vertical direction, the maximum and minimum values of vertical velocity anomalies and vertical transport of transient zonal momentum occur over the GW at about 900 hPa, and wind speed anomalies occur at about 950 hPa. Both the positive transport anomalies of transient zonal momentum and the positive vertical velocity anomalies on the west side of the GW can accelerate the wind speed in the lower level.

TI  - Estimating the impacts of urban form on CO<sub>2</sub> emission efficiency in the Pearl River Delta, China
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The improvement of CO2 emission efficiency is of great significance to realizing energy-saving and emission reduction targets and achieving low-carbon development. While it is increasingly recognized that urban form could significantly influence the CO2 emissions of urban areas, few studies have been able to quantify the implications of urban form in relation to CO2 emission efficiency. The purpose of this paper is thus to contribute to existing literature by empirically quantifying how urban form influences CO2 emission efficiency. CO2 emission efficiency in this study is presented in terms of CO2 economic efficiency (CEE) and CO2 social efficiency (CSE). Firstly, we calculated the CEE and CSE of nine cities in the Pearl River Delta (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, Huizhou, Dongguan, and Zhongshan) using locally important socio-economic variables over the period 1990-2013. Then, seven landscape metrics were selected in order to quantify three dimensions of urban form (extension, irregularity, and compactness) using remote sensing data. Finally, panel data models were utilized to estimate the associations between urban form and CO2 emission efficiency. We identified a negative correlation between urban sprawl and CEE as well as CSE, a finding that indicates that urban growth decreases CO2 economic efficiency. Further, increasing irregularity in the form of cities was found to decrease both CEE and CSE-a larger degree of irregularity, in other words, results in lower CO2 emission efficiency. Conversely, urban compactness was identified as having a significant positive influence on both CEE and CSE, indicating that the compact development of cities can actually help to improve CO2 emission efficiency. The findings of this study hold important implications for building low-carbon cities in China.

TI  - Coupling Eco-hydrological Model and Multi-source Remote Sensing Data to Simulate Efficiency of Green Water Flows in the Yellow River Basin, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The green water approach is relatively more important in terms of its utilization with different land-use modes. It is necessary to couple eco-hydrological model and multi-source remote sensing parameters to estimate land-use efficiency of green flows. An eco-hydrological model is constructed in this study to simulate the green water flows in the Yellow River Basin, China. The structure of green water flows in the Yellow River Basin was studied using a combination of remote sensing and GIS technology, along with the meteorological data and in situ field, vegetation and soil texture data. The green water flows were found to be decreased, stabilized, and increased due to various land uses and structures of different vegetation types. The estimated cumulative growing season green water flows in 2006 from the woodland, grassland, shrub land, and cropland were 431.7mm, 289.6mm, 322.2mm, and 383.9mm, respectively. The low-utility proportion in the woodland, grassland, shrub land, and cropland was 46.7%, 47.9%, 50.7%, and 66.3%, respectively (forest>grassland>shrub land>cropland). The low utility and the high utility of the forest and grassland were proportional; however, the low utility of the grassland was proportionally higher than that of the forest. Based on these results, the adjustment of vegetation and crop structure to optimize water resource allocation is recommended to improve water and land-use efficiency.

TI  - Unsupervised Sub-Pixel Water Body Mapping with Sentinel-3 OLCI Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping land surface water bodies from satellite images is superior to conventional in situ measurements. With the mission of long-term and high-frequency water quality monitoring, the launch of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B provides the best possible approach for near real-time land surface water body mapping. Sentinel-3 OLCI contains 21 bands ranging from visible to near-infrared, but the spatial resolution is limited to 300 m, which may include lots of mixed pixels around the boundaries. Sub-pixel mapping (SPM) provides a good solution for the mixed pixel problem in water body mapping. In this paper, an unsupervised sub-pixel water body mapping (USWBM) method was proposed particularly for the Sentinel-3 OLCI image, and it aims to produce a finer spatial resolution (e.g., 30 m) water body map from the multispectral image. Instead of using the fraction maps of water/non-water or multispectral images combined with endmembers of water/non-water classes as input, USWBM directly uses the spectral water index images of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) extracted from the Sentinel-3 OLCI image as input and produces a water body map at the target finer spatial resolution. Without the collection of endmembers, USWBM accomplished the unsupervised process by developing a multi-scale spatial dependence based on an unsupervised sub-pixel Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm. In both validations in the Tibet Plate lake and Poyang lake, USWBM produced more accurate water body maps than the other pixel and sub-pixel based water body mapping methods. The proposed USWBM, therefore, has great potential to support near real-time sub-pixel water body mapping with the Sentinel-3 OLCI image.

TI  - Atmospheric Aerosol Multiband Synthesis Imaging Spectrometer
T2  - APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the characteristics of the spectrum distribution for atmospheric aerosol detection, a multiband synthesis imaging spectrometer system based on Czerny-Turner configuration is designed and proposed in this paper. Using a grating array instead of a traditional single grating, and together with a filter array, the proposed configuration can achieve hyperspectral imaging with the spectral resolution of 0.16 nm, 0.24 nm, 0.29 nm, and 2.05 nm in the spectral bands of 370-430 nm, 640-680 nm, 840-880 nm, and 1560-1660 nm, respectively. First, the system aberration caused by the spectral change was eliminated based on Rowland circle theory; then, Zemax software was used to optimize and analyze the optical design. The analysis results show that the root mean square (RMS) of the spot diagram is < 9 mu m in all the working spectral bands, which demonstrates that the aberration has been corrected and a good imaging quality can be achieved. This design of multiband synthesis imaging spectrometer configuration proves to be not only feasible, but also simple and compact, which lays a solid foundation for the practical application in the field of atmospheric aerosol remote sensing spectroscopy.

TI  - Quantitative Evaluation of the Eco-Environment in a Coalfield Based on Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Imagery: A Case Study of Yuxian, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the exploitation of coalfields, the eco-environment around the coalfields can become badly damaged. To address this issue, mine greening has been proposed by the Ministry of Land and Resources of China. The sustainable development of mine environments has now become one of the most prominent issues in China. In this study, we aimed to make use of Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI images obtained between 2005 and 2016 to analyze the eco-environment in a coalfield. Land cover was implemented as the basic evaluation factor to establish the evaluation model for the eco-environment. Analysis and investigation of the eco-environment in the Yuxian coalfield was conducted using a novel evaluation model, based on the biological abundance index, vegetation coverage index, water density index, and natural geographical factors. The weight of each indicator was determined by an analytic hierarchy process. Meanwhile, we also used the classic ecological footprint to calculate the ecological carrying capacity in order to verify the effectiveness of the evaluation model. Results showed that the eco-environment index illustrated a slowly increasing tendency over the study period, and the ecological quality could be considered as good. The results of the evaluation model showed a strong correlation with the ecological carrying capacity with a correlation coefficient of 0.9734. In conclusion, the evaluation method is a supplement to the time-series quantitative evaluation of the eco-environment, and also helps us to explore the eco-environment in the mining area.

TI  - Long-Term Dynamic of Poyang Lake Surface Water: A Mapping Work Based on the Google Earth Engine Cloud Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the shrinkage of Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, has raised concerns for society. The regulation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has been argued to be a cause of the depletion of the lake by previous studies. However, over the past few decades, the lake's surface water dynamic has remained poorly characterized, especially before the regulation of the TGD (2003). By calculating the inundation frequency with an index- and pixel-based water detection algorithm on Google Earth Engine (GEE), this study explored the spatial-temporal variation of the lake during 1988-2016 and compared the differences in Poyang Lake's water body between the pre- and post-TGD periods. The year-long water body area of the lake has shown a significant decreasing trend over the past 29 years and has shifted to a smaller regime since 2006. The inundation frequency of the lake has also generally decreased since 2003, particularly at the central part of the lake, and the effects of this trend have been most severe in the spring and autumn seasons. The lake's area has shown significant correlation with the precipitation of the Poyang Lake Basin on an inner-annual scale. The drivers of and relevant factors relating to the inter-annual variation of the lake's surface water should be further investigated in the future.

TI  - Mapping tropical disturbed forests using multi-decadal 30 m optical satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical disturbed forests play an important role in global carbon sequestration due to their rapid post-disturbance biomass accumulation rates. However, the accurate estimation of the carbon sequestration capacity of disturbed forests is still challenging due to large uncertainties in their spatial distribution. Using Google Earth Engine (GEE), we developed a novel approach to map cumulative disturbed forest areas based on the 27-year time-series of Landsat surface reflectance imagery. This approach integrates single date features with temporal characteristics from six time-series trajectories (two Landsat shortwave infrared bands and four vegetation indices) using a random forest machine learning classification algorithm. We demonstrated the feasibility of this method to map disturbed forests in three different forest ecoregions (seasonal, moist and dry forest) in Mato Grosso, Brazil, and found that the overall mapping accuracy was high, ranging from 81.3% for moist forest to 86.1% for seasonal forest. According to our classification, dry forest ecoregion experienced the most severe disturbances with 41% of forests being disturbed by 2010, followed by seasonal forest and moist forest ecoregions. We further separated disturbed forests into degraded old-growth forests and post-deforestation regrowth forests based on an existing post-deforestation land use map (TerraClass) and found that the area of degraded old-growth forests was up to 62% larger than the extent of post-deforestation regrowth forests, with 18% of old-growth forests actually being degraded. Application of this new classification approach to other tropical areas will provide a better constraint on the spatial extent of disturbed forest areas in Tropics and ultimately towards a better understanding of their importance in the global carbon cycle.

TI  - The Influence of River Channel Occupation on Urban Inundation and Sedimentation Induced by Floodwater in Mountainous Areas: A Case Study in the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - River channel occupation has made cities in the mountainous areas more vulnerable to floodwater out of river channels during rapid global urbanization. A better understanding of the influence of river channel occupation on urban flood disasters can serve as a reference in planning effective urban flood control strategies. In this study, taking a flood event that occurred on July 26th, 2017 in a city on the Loess Plateau as an example, field surveys, dynamics detection of the river channel using remote sensing technology, and scenario simulations with a two-dimensional flow and sediment model were utilized to quantitatively analyze the impacts of river channel occupation on urban inundation and sedimentation. The results show that river channel dynamics reduced by construction can be successfully detected using the combination of high-resolution images and Landsat time-series images. The variation of the water level-discharge relationship caused by the narrowing of the river channel and the increase of the flood-water level caused by water-blocking bridges/houses result in a significant reduction of the flood discharge capacity. The contribution of the narrowing of the river channel was 72.3% for the total area inundated by floodwater, whereas 57.2% of urban sedimentation was caused by the construction of bridges/houses within the river channel. Sustainable flood mitigation measures were also recommended according to the investigations and research findings in this study in order to reduce the social, environmental and economic damages caused by floods.

TI  - Research on Milling Forces During High-speed Milling of Wood-plastic Composites
T2  - BIORESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To analyze the influence of the milling parameters, including the spindle speed, feed rate, axial cutting depth, and radial cutting depth, on the milling force during high-speed milling of wood-plastic composites, an orthogonal test was performed with carbide cutting tools. The results showed that the tangential (F-x) and radial forces (F-y) decreased with an increase in the spindle speed, increased with an increase in the feed rate, and increased with an increase in the axial milling depth. Also, both were influenced by a relatively small amount of change in the axial milling depth. Mathematical models of F-x and F-y during the high-speed milling of wood-plastic composites were established with a multiple linear regression method. The variance analysis showed that the two mathematical models of the milling forces were significant overall.

TI  - Pre-Constrained Machine Learning Method for Multi-Year Mapping of Three Major Crops in a Large Irrigation District
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate mapping of crops can provide effective information for regional agricultural management, which is helpful to improve crop production efficiency. Recently, remote sensing data offers a comprehensive approach to achieve crop identification on a regional scale. However, the classification methods for multi-year mapping needs further study in regions with a complex planting structure, due to the mixed pixels at a spatial distribution and the high error in different years at a temporal scale. The objective of this study is to map the multi-year spatial distribution of three main crops (maize, sunflower, and wheat) in the Hetao irrigation district of China for the period 2012-2016 based on a pre-constrained classification method. The pre-constrained method integrates a parameterized phenology-based vegetation indexes classifier and two non-parametric machine learning algorithms-support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Results indicated that the performance of the pre-constrained classification method was excellent in the multi-year mapping of major crops in the study area, with absolute relative errors mainly less than 14% in the whole irrigation district and less than 20% in the five counties. The corresponding overall accuracy was 87.9%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.80. Mapping results showed that maize is mainly distributed in Hangjinhouqi, southern Linhe, northern Wuyuan, and eastern Wulateqianqi, while wheat is relatively less and scatteredly distributed in Hangjinhouqi and Wuyuan. Moreover, the sunflower planting area increased significantly and expanded spatially from Wuyuan and western Wulateqianqi to northern Hangjinhouqi and Linhe from 2012 to 2016. In addition, the phenology-based vegetation indexes classifier was found to be effective in improving the classification accuracy based on the contribution analysis.

TI  - Quantifying the trophic status of lakes using total light absorption of optically active components
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication of lakes has become one of the world's most serious environmental problems, resulting in an urgent need to monitor and provide safeguards to control water quality. Results from analysis of lake trophic status based on calculated throphic state index (TSI) showed that 69.5% of the surveyed 277 lakes were in a state of eutrophication. Significant logarithmic relationships between light absorption of optically active components (a(OACs)) and TSI (R-2 = 0.78) existed: TSI = 13.64 x In(a(OACs))+43,24, and the regression relationship between a(OACs) and TSI had a better degree of fit (R-2) than the currently used reflectance-TSI relationship. a(OACs) appeared to be a good predictor of TSI estimation in lake ecosystems. The relationship coefficient (a(OACs)-TSI) slightly varied with lake type, and relationships in saline lakes and phy-type lakes were shown to be more robust than the relationship with the total lake data. This study highlights the quantification of the trophic status in lakes using a(OACs), which realized the monitoring of trophic status in lakes using inherent optical properties on a large-scale. To our knowledge this is the first investigation to assess the variability of trophic status in lakes across China. The assessment trophic state of lakes based on a(OACs) provides a new way to monitor the trophic status of lakes, and findings may have applications for monitoring large-scale and long-term trophic patterns in lakes using remote sensing techniques.

TI  - Human expertise in the interpretation of remote sensing data: A cognitive task analysis of forest disturbance attribution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The visual analysis of remote sensing imagery is useful for the extraction of information not readily available through automated image analysis. Previous studies have shown that the replication of human reasoning about image content is difficult due to human creativity and mental flexibility. Development of automated image analysis programs continues; however, geovisual analytics suggests that it may be more beneficial to design symbiotic computer-human interpretation systems. It is imperative to understand the experiences, knowledge, and cognitive processes that image interpreters rely on. Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) is a methodological framework developed from Cognitive Systems Engineering (CSE) where expert users are studied with the goals of explicating their needs, wants, and cognitive abilities for dealing with complex technological systems. Here we report the results of a CTA process carried out with users of a geovisual analytic tool to support forest disturbance detection and signification. These results suggest that different facets of the cognitive processes undertaken by users are not always explicit, and differences in the participant's attentiveness to their mental processes vary greatly. Despite these differences and pathways to their final interpretations, participants were able to successfully come to similar judgments as for their peers.

TI  - Exploring the Place of Animals and Human-Animal Relationships in Hydraulic Fracturing Discourse
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout human history, energy security has been a prominent concern. Historically, animals were used as energy providers and as companions and sentinels in mining operations. While animals are seldom used for these purposes in developed communities today, this legacy of use is likely to have far-reaching consequences for how animals and human-animal relationships are acknowledged in energy development. The US is currently experiencing an energy boom in the form of high volume horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (HVHHF); because animals are the most at risk from this boom, this study uses a thorough content analysis of peer-reviewed HVHHF articles mentioning animals from 2012-2018 to assess how animals and human-animal relationships are discussed. Three dominant article theme classifications emerge: animal-focused articles, animal-observant articles, and animal sentinel articles. Across themes, articles seldom acknowledge the inherent value or the social and psychological importance of animals in human lives; instead, the focus is almost exclusively on the use of animals as sentinels for potential human health risks. Further, what is nearly absent from this body of literature is any social science research. Given that relationships with animals are an integral part of human existence, this study applies environmental justice principles, serving as a call to action for social science scholars to address the impacts of HVHHF on animals and human-animal relationships.

TI  - Boat-based measurement system for longitudinal monitoring of rivers with online sensors
T2  - HYDROLOGIE UND WASSERBEWIRTSCHAFTUNG
M3  - Article
AB  - The abiotic description and evaluation of the state of surface water bodies is a perquisite for an evaluation of the ecological condition of any body of water. It requires extensive data on hydrology, morphology and water quality. The BOOT-Monitoring project developed an integrated, longitudinally continuous data acquisition concept, which combines a boat-based sensor system and remote sensing methods. Configurations of the boat-based sensor system are presented for application conditions in lowland and upland rivers. A quasi continuous representation of the river morphology metrics are determined and assessed from remote sensing data, acoustic Doppler current profiler and echo sounding. A method for continuous interpolation of the riverbed serves as a basis for river cross sections determination. They are combined with longitudinal flow velocity and concentration profiles to quantify discharge and load devolution along the flow course. Longitudinal concentration profiles of nitrate and arsenic exemplify the limitations of conventional stationary site sampling. Based on the examples presented in the text, potentials, challenges, and limitations of the longitudinally continuous data acquisition approach are reflected and future research questions are suggested.

TI  - Satellite-borne detection of high diurnal amplitude of sea surface temperature in the seas west of the Tsugaru Strait, Japan, during Yamase wind season
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the variation of diurnal SST amplitude (SST) in the seas west of the Tsugaru Strait, Japan, which exhibit complex topography that affects the wind pattern during Yamase season, when cold easterly winds blow around northeastern Japan. We used infrared based satellite SSTs to obtain strong SST signals. The objective analysis data on surface wind, air temperature and relative humidity patterns was used to explain possible mechanisms responsible for the observed phenomena. Although easterly winds are frequently accompanied by clouds that hinder frequent observation of SSTs from space, four cases of high SST were obtained under clear sky conditions. The results show that high resolution satellite data can capture SSTs of more than 5 degrees C. Further, the SST variation was strongly influenced by topography. The existence of mountains near the study area have the effect of blocking the easterly winds, creating a low wind speed area on the lee side of the mountain range, which is responsible for the generation of high SST, especially in the offshore area. In addition to the topographic effect, the SST values measured in the in-shore area were influenced by the sea breeze. The warm-dry air mass is advected to the coastal seas by the anti-sea breeze which heats the in-shore area and keeps the SST at the same level as that of the offshore area. This finding highlights the importance of understanding air, sea and land interactions in terms of the variation observed in SST in the study area.

TI  - Spinel assemblages in lunar meteorites Graves Nunataks 06157 and Dhofar 1528: Implications for impact melting and equilibration in the Moon's upper mantle
T2  - METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Magnesium-rich spinel assemblages occur in the two lunar vitric breccia meteorites-Dhofar (Dho) 1528 and Graves Nunataks (GRA) 06157. Dho 1528 contains up to similar to 0.7 mm cumulate Mg-rich spinel crystals associated with Mg-rich olivine, Mg- and Al-rich pyroxene, plagioclase, and rare cordierite. Using thermodynamic calculations of these mineral assemblages, we constrain equilibration depths and discuss an origin of these lithologies in the upper mantle of the Moon. In contrast, small, 10 to 20 mu m spinel phenocryst assemblages in glassy melt rock clasts in Dho 1528 and GRA 06157 formed from the impact melting of Mg-rich rocks. Some of these spinel phenocrysts match compositional constraints for spinel associated with "pink spinel anorthosites" inferred from remote sensing data. However, such spinel phenocrysts in meteorites and Apollo samples are typically associated with significant amounts of olivine +/- pyroxene that exceed the compositional constraints for pink spinel anorthosites. We conclude that the remotely sensed "pink spinel anorthosites" have not been observed in the collections of lunar rocks. Moreover, we discuss impact-excavation scenarios for the spinel-bearing assemblages in Dhofar 1528 and compare the bulk rock composition of Dho 1528 to strikingly similar compositions of Luna 20 samples that contain ejecta from the Crisium impact basin.

TI  - Effect of climate change on land suitability for surface irrigation and irrigation potential of the shallow groundwater in Ghana
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the potential land resources suitable for irrigation and evaluating the possible impact of climate change on land suitability is essential for planning a sustainable agricultural system. This study applied a GIS-based Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) technique to evaluate the suitability of land for irrigation in Ghana for a baseline period (1990 to 2010) and future time horizons 2050s (2041 to 2060) and 2070s (2061 to 2080). Key factors considered to evaluate the suitability of the land for irrigation include biophysical features (such as climate, land use, soil, and slope) and socioeconomic factors (such as proximity to roads and population density). These factors were weighted using a pairwise comparison matrix then reclassified and overlaid on a 30 m grid to estimate the irrigation potential of the country. Groundwater data from the British Geological Survey (BGS) were superimposed onto the land suitability map layer to evaluate the irrigation potential and the accessibility of shallow groundwater with simple water lifting technologies. Downscaled and bias-corrected future climate data from HadGEM2-ES under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 emission scenario were used to represent the future climate horizon. Due to climate change, on average, rainfall will increase by 15 mm and 20 mm from the baseline period in the 2050s and 2070s, respectively. The average temperature shows a consistent increase in the majority of Ghana and a higher rate of increase is expected in the 2070s. Consequently, the rising temperature will increase the potential evapotranspiration by 6.0% and 7.6% in the 2050s and 2070s, respectively. The suitability analysis indicates that approximately 9% of the country is suitable for surface irrigation under the baseline period. A large portion of the potential land is located in the southwestern part of the country. The potential suitable land has an average groundwater access of 12 m from the surface with an average borehole potential yield of 2.5 L/second, which makes it favorable for utilization of simple water lifting technologies. Due to climate change, 9.5% of the suitable land will become unfavorable for irrigation in 2050s, and it is expected to reach 17% in 2070s.

TI  - Remotely sensed estimation and mapping of soil moisture by eliminating the effect of vegetation cover
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM), which plays a crucial role in studies of the climate, ecology, agriculture and the environment, can be estimated and mapped by remote sensing technology over a wide region. However, remotely sensed SM is constrained by its estimation accuracy, which mainly stems from the influence of vegetation cover on soil spectra information in mixed pixels. To overcome the low-accuracy defects of existing surface albedo method for estimating SM, in this paper, Qinghai Lake Basin, an important animal husbandry production area in Qinghai Province, China, was chosen as an empirical research area. Using the surface albedo computed from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance products and the actual measured SM data, an albedo/vegetation coverage trapezoid feature space was constructed. Bare soil albedo was extracted from the surface albedo mainly containing information of soil, vegetation, and both albedo models for estimating SM were constructed separately. The accuracy of the bare soil albedo model (root mean square error=4.20, mean absolute percent error=22.75%, and theil inequality coefficient=0.67) was higher than that of the existing surface albedo model (root mean square error=4.66, mean absolute percent error=25.46% and theil inequality coefficient=0.74). This result indicated that the bare soil albedo greatly improved the accuracy of SM estimation and mapping. As this method eliminated the effect of vegetation cover and restored the inherent soil spectra, it not only quantitatively estimates and maps SM at regional scales with high accuracy, but also provides a new way of improving the accuracy of soil organic matter estimation and mapping.

T2  - Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Downstaging of breast cancer primary lesions and metastatic axillary lymph nodes among patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has raised the new challenges and opportunities on individualized breast cancer surgical treatment. Downstaging of the primary lesion has given patients that were previously deemed inoperable or not suitable for surgery a second chance. While downstaging of the lymph nodes has made it possible for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to safely replace axillary lymph node dissection. However, the detection rate and false negative rate of early breast cancer SLNB technique in post-NAC patients barely meet the standard of clinical practice. Therefore, it is required that SLNB in post-NAC patients to be carried out by a medical team with advanced imaging equipments and extensive experiences in SLNB. Furthermore, they should be able to precisely evaluate axillary lymph node status before and after NAC as well as mark metastatic lymph node before NAC. Indications of SLNB should be restricted to patients that are downstaged from cN0 to ycN0 or from cN1 to ycN0. Particularly, it is only safe for patients whose axillary lymph node status become negative after NAC to receive SLNB when dual tracer (blue dye and radionuclide), removing more than 2 sentinel lymph nodes and targeted axillary dissection technique are used.

AB  - Objectives To explore acute meningitis and encephalitis syndrome (AMES) surveillance in 4 China prefectures, to understand the epidemiological features and disease burden of neisseria meningitides (Nm) meningitis, streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) meningitis, haemophilus influenza type h (Hib) meningitis and Japanese encephalitis and provide evidence for related disease prevention and control. Methods AMES surveillance were conducted in Jinan, Shandong Province and Yichang, Hubei Province in September 2006, and in 13 districts of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province and Guigang City. Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in April 2007. Six hospitals in each city were selected as monitoring pilot hospitals to carry out reports of suspected cases of acute meningitis and encephalitis, case investigation, blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid specimen collection, anti-JEV IgM antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nm, Sp and Hih culture and polymerise chain reaction detection, etc. According to the age group. the incidence of bacterial meningitis and Japanese encephalitis in local residents <20 years old was estimated. Results From 2006 to 2013, a total of 19 423 surveillance cases were reported in four cities, of which 11 071 (56.99%) were reported in the pilot hospitals. Of the 11 071 cases, 5 315 were tested for bacteriology and 9 180 were tested for anti-JEV IgM antibodies. Among the bacteriological tests, 176 cases were positive, including 75 cases of Nm positive, 91 cases of Sp positive and 10 cases of 1E6 positive. The incidence of three bacterial meningitis is estimated for people under 20 years old, with estimated incidence of Nm, Sp and Hib meningitis in children <5 years old was 0.46/100 000-0.71/100 000, 0.34/ 100 000-0.83/100 000 and 0.32/100 000-0.57/100 000 respectively; the estimated incidence of Nm and Sp meningitis in children aged 5-9 years was 0.59/100 000-1.1 4 / 1 00 000 and 0.50/100 000-1.66/100 000 respectively. In 732 cases of positive JE cases, the positive detection rates of <5 years old, 40-49 years old and >= 50 years old were 9.51% (95 / 999), 28.09% (66 / 235) and 33.85% (130 / 384), respectively. The estimated annual incidence rate of JE was 0.12/100 000-0.79/100 000.ratio of cases 1.19 : 1. Most of cases (27.30%) were children and adolescents aged 5-14 years and those (26.84%) aged over 45 year. Conclusion The study found that primary and secondary school students are the key population of Nm meningitis, suggesting that it is necessary to explore the enhanced immunization study of meningococcal vaccine in this population; Sp has the possibility of occurrence in all age groups; <5 years old children are the main population of Hib meningitis.

TI  - Mapping Foliar Nutrition Using WorldView-3 and WorldView-2 to Assess Koala Habitat Suitability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation planning and population assessment for widely-distributed, but vulnerable, arboreal folivore species demands cost-effective mapping of habitat suitability over large areas. This study tested whether multispectral data from WorldView-3 could be used to estimate and map foliar digestible nitrogen (DigN), a nutritional measure superior to total nitrogen for tannin-rich foliage for the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). We acquired two WorldView-3 images (November 2015) and collected leaf samples from Eucalyptus woodlands in semi-arid eastern Australia. Linear regression indicated the normalized difference index using bands "Coastal" and "NIR1" best estimated DigN concentration (% dry matter, R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.19%). Foliar DigN concentration was mapped for multi-species Eucalyptus open woodlands across two landscapes using this index. This mapping method was tested on a WorldView-2 image (October 2012) with associated koala tracking data (August 2010 to November 2011) from a different landscape of the study region. Quantile regression showed significant positive relationship between estimated DigN and occurrence of koalas at 0.999 quantile (R-2 = 0.63). This study reports the first attempt to use a multispectral satellite-derived spectral index for mapping foliar DigN at a landscape-scale (100s km(2)). The mapping method can potentially be incorporated in mapping and monitoring koala habitat suitability for conservation management.

TI  - Reconstructing Geostationary Satellite Land Surface Temperature Imagery Based on a Multiscale Feature Connected Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostationary satellite land surface temperature (GLST) data are important for various dynamic environmental and natural resource applications for terrestrial ecosystems. Due to clouds, shadows, and other atmospheric conditions, the derived LSTs are often missing a large number of values. Reconstructing the missing values is essential for improving the usability of the geostationary satellite LST data. However, current reconstruction methods mainly aim to fill the values of a small number of invalid pixels with many valid pixels, which can provide useful land surface temperature values. When the missing data extent becomes large, the reconstruction effect will worsen because the relationship between different spatiotemporal geostationary satellite LSTs is complex and highly nonlinear. Inspired by the superiority of the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) in solving highly nonlinear and dynamic problems, a multiscale feature connection CNN model is proposed to fill missing LSTs with large missing regions. The proposed method has been tested on both FengYun-2G and Meteosat Second Generation-Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager geostationary satellite LST datasets. The results of simulated and actual experiments show that the proposed method is accurate to within about 1 degrees C, with 70% missing data rates. This is feasible and effective for large regions of LST reconstruction tasks.

TI  - Water Bodies' Cooling Effects on Urban Land Daytime Surface Temperature: Ecosystem Service Reducing Heat Island Effect
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect caused by urbanization is a major environmental concern. Utilizing cooling effects of water bodies as one type of ecosystem service is an important way to mitigate UHI in urban areas during the daytime. This study aims to examine the influence of water bodies' cooling effects on the urban land surface temperature (LST). The potential influence on the relationship between urban land cover and the LST are also discussed. The daytime LST in April was retrieved from Landsat-8 thermal infrared band and the grid-based method was adopted to analyze the potential influence. The results indicated that Suzhou Bay is broadly capable of lowering daytime temperatures. The cooling distance can reach 800 m in horizontal space, and the maximum cooling effect was 3.02 degrees C. Furthermore, the distance to the Suzhou Bay is a great factor for the relationship between land cover and the LST. We found that the cooling effects have weakened the correct quantitative correlation between land cover (e.g., green space and impervious surface) and the LST, particularly green space in the range of 200 m. In addition, the cooling effects have strengthened the cool edge phenomenon when analyzing the relationship between the normal difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the LST. We suggest that the distance to the water bodies should be effectively utilized in the microclimate regulation provided by ecosystem services of water bodies. When investigating the thermal effects of urban land, urban planners and designers should consider water bodies' effects on surrounding areas. These findings have implications for understanding the role of water bodies with ecosystem services of temperature mitigation, which must be fully appreciated for sustainable urban and landscape planning.

TI  - Uncertainty assessment of spatial-scale groundwater recharge estimated from unsaturated flow modelling
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Parameterisation of unsaturated flow models for estimating spatial-scale groundwater recharge is usually reliant on expert knowledge or best-estimated parameters rather than robust uncertainty analysis. This study chose the Campaspe catchment in southeastern Australia as a field example and examined the uncertainty of spatial groundwater recharge by performing uncertainty analysis. The study area was first divided into 13 zones according to different vegetation types, soil groups and precipitation. Individual models were then established for these zones using the biophysically based modelling code WAVES (Water Atmosphere Vegetation Energy and Solutes), which is capable of simulating unsaturated flow. The Monte Carlo method, together with the Latin-Hypercube sampling technique, was employed to perform uncertainty analysis by comparing modelled monthly evapotranspiration (ET) to MODIS ET. The results show that the common one-estimate-per-site approach can still identify the spatial pattern of groundwater recharge in the study area due to the presence of a precipitation pattern. In comparison, the uncertainty analysis not only identifies the spatial pattern, but also provides confidence levels in groundwater recharge that are critical for water resources management. The results also show that recharge absolute uncertainty is directly proportional to the amount of water input, but relative uncertainty in recharge is not. This study indicates that spatial recharge estimation without model calibration or knowledge of model uncertainty could be highly uncertain. MODIS ET can be used to reduce recharge uncertainty, but it is unlikely to lower the recharge uncertainty by a large extent because of the MODIS ET estimation error.

TI  - Modeling Polycentric Urbanization Using Multisource Big Geospatial Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the dynamics of polycentric urbanization is important for urban studies and management. This paper proposes an analytical model that uses multisource big geospatial data to characterize such dynamics to facilitate policy making. There are four main steps: (1) main centers and subcenters are identified using spatial cluster analysis and geographically weighted regression (GWR) based on Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)/NPP and social media check-in data; (2) the built-up areas are extracted by using Defense Meteorological Satellite ProgramOperational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) gradient images; (3) the economic corridors that connect the main center and subcenters are constructed using road network data from Open Street Map (OSM) with the least-cost distance method; and (4) the major urban development direction is identified by analyzing the changes in built-up areas within the economic corridors. The model is applied to three major cities in northeastern, central, and northwestern China (Shenyang, Wuhan, and Xi'an) from 1992 to 2012.

TI  - Insight into the 2016 Menyuan M<sub>w</sub> 5.9 Earthquake with InSAR: A Blind Reverse Event Promoted by Historical Earthquakes
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2016, the M-w 5.9 Menyuan earthquake occurred at the western end of the Tianzhu seismic gap in the middle segment of the left-lateral strike-slip Haiyuan fault system. Studying the focal mechanism of the Menyuan earthquake and its correlation with historical seismicity is of great significance in understanding the tectonic style of the Haiyuan fault system and assessing the Tianzhu gap seismic risk. Using Sentinel-1A radar imagery, we obtain the coseismic deformation field of the Menyuan earthquake in the LOS direction and invert the deformation field slip distribution model. Based on the interseismic deformation field reflected by GPS data and the relocated results of aftershocks provided by previous studies, we then analyze the seismogenic nodal plane of the Menyuan earthquake and consider the west-dipping model to be the most likely seismogenic solution. The west-dipping model indicates that the average slip of the Menyuan earthquake is 0.41m, and the average rake angle is 68 degrees, with a magnitude of M-w 5.905. Considering the historical strong earthquakes and viscoelastic layered crust, the results from Coulomb failure stress modeling indicate that the Coulomb stress loading caused by the historical strong events promoted the occurrence of the 2016 Menyuan earthquake. Both the low seismicity within the Tianzhu gap and the cluster phenomenon of medium earthquakes on the Lao Hu Shan (LHS) and Leng Long Ling (LLL) faults have strong correlations with the stress change distribution resulting from the historical strong earthquakes. A series of medium events occurring on the north side of the LLL fault, represented by the 2016 Menyuan earthquake, would raise the seismic risk on the western end of the Tianzhu gap.

TI  - The Classification of Grassland Types Based on Object-Based Image Analysis with Multisource Data
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of different grassland types is important for effectively analyzing spatial patterns, obtaining key vegetation parameters using remote sensing (e.g., biomass, leaf area index, net primary production), and using and protecting grasslands. Existing classifications of grasslands by remote sensing are mostly divided according to the fractional vegetation cover or biomass, but classifications according to grassland types are scarce. In this study, we focused on the classification of different grassland types using remote sensing based on object-based image analysis (OBIA) with multitemporal images in combination with a 30-m digital elevation model (DEM) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The grasslands were located in Hulunber, Inner Mongolia, and an autonomous region of China. The support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RE) machine learning classifiers were selected for the classification. The results revealed the following: 1) It is feasible to generally extract different grassland types on the basis of OBIA with multisource data; the overall classification accuracy and Kappa value exceeded 90% and 0.9, respectively, using the SVM and RE machine teaming classifiers, and the classification accuracy of the different grassland types ranged from 61.64% to 98.71%; 2) Multitemporal images and auxiliary data (DEM and NDVI) improved the separability of different grassland types. The information in the growing season was conducive for distinguishing temperate meadow steppe from temperate steppe and was favorable for extracting lowland meadow and swamp in the nongrowing season. The DEM and NDVI also effectively reduced the number of image segmentation objects and improved the segmentation effects; 3) Spectral and textural features were more important than geometric features in this study. A few main variables played a major role in the classification, while a large number of variables had either no significant effect or a negative effect on the classification results when the optimal feature subset was determined. This study provides a scientific basis and reference for the classification of various grassland types by remote sensing, including the data selection, image segmentation, feature selection, classifier selection, and parameter settings.

AB  - Smoke aerosol plays an important role in climate change and the Earth's environment. Using multispectral, multiangle, polarized data for detecting small particles has its unique advantages. In this study, two algorithms were developed to detect smoke aerosols and smoke-polluted clouds (SPC). Multidirectional polarized reflectance (R-p) of different aerosol types was simulated by the UNL-VRTM (Unified Linearized Vector Radiative Transfer Model). Compared to dust, urban, rural and oceanic aerosols, the R-p of smoke at 0.490 mu m, 0.670 mu m and 0.865 mu m increased with the aerosol optical depth (AOD), while other types of aerosols showed the opposite trend. Based on the polarized characteristics of the different aerosol types at three single channels, we found that ratios between polarized reflectances R-p of smoke were more distinct from R-p 7ratios of other aerosol types for any aerosol optical depth. The polarized reflectance ratios at wavelengths of 0.490 mu m, 0.670 mu m and 0.865 mu m were chosen to detect smoke. We analyzed the radiative characteristics of SPC and smoke-free clouds. In contrast to smoke-free clouds, the simulated total reflectance of SPC increases with wavelength in the spectral range from the visible (VIS) to the near infrared (NIR) by the UNL-VRTM. Additionally, R-p of SPC is enlarged compared to smoke-free clouds in the scattering angle range of 80 degrees-120 degrees at the wavelength 0.865 mu m. Therefore, two slopes, the slope of the reflectance in the VIS to NIR spectrum and the slope of the R-p at the scattering angle range from 80 to 120, were designed to identify polluted clouds. Finally, the results of the two proposed algorithms were verified in different biomass burning areas by the products of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), demonstrating that smoke and SPC can be well detected. In addition, the proposed algorithm can be applied to a polarized image with channels at 0.490 mu m, 0.670 mu m and 0.865 mu m such as the Chinese Gaofen-5 (or GF-5) satellite. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Addressing Challenges for Mapping Irrigated Fields in Subhumid Temperate Regions by Integrating Remote Sensing and Hydroclimatic Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution mapping of irrigated fields is needed to better estimate water and nutrient fluxes in the landscape, food production, and local to regional climate. However, this remains a challenge in humid to subhumid regions, where irrigation has been expanding into what was largely rainfed agriculture due to trends in climate, crop prices, technologies and practices. One such region is southwestern Michigan, USA, where groundwater is the main source of irrigation water for row crops (primarily corn and soybeans). Remote sensing of irrigated areas can be difficult in these regions as rainfed areas have similar characteristics. We present methods to address this challenge and enhance the contrast between neighboring rainfed and irrigated areas, including weather-sensitive scene selection, applying recently developed composite indices and calculating spatial anomalies. We create annual, 30m-resolution maps of irrigated corn and soybeans for southwestern Michigan from 2001 to 2016 using a machine learning method (random forest). The irrigation maps reasonably capture the spatial and temporal pattern of irrigation, with accuracies that exceed available products. Analysis of the irrigation maps showed that the irrigated area in southwestern Michigan tripled in the last 16 years. We also discuss the remaining challenges for irrigation mapping in humid to subhumid areas.

TI  - Mapping regional turbulent heat fluxes via variational assimilation of land surface temperature data from polar orbiting satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of turbulent heat fluxes by assimilating sequences of land surface temperature (LST) measurements into variational data assimilation (VDA) frameworks has been the subject of several studies. The VDA approaches estimate turbulent heat fluxes by minimizing the difference between LST observations and estimations from the heat diffusion equation. The VDA methods have been tested only with high temporal resolution LST observations (e.g., from geostationary satellites) when applied at regional scales. Geostationary satellites can capture the diurnal cycle of LST, but they have a relatively low spatial resolution and mainly focus on low latitudes. To overcome these shortcomings, this study assimilates high spatial resolution LST data from polar orbiting satellites (e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS) into the combined-source (CS) and dual-source (DS) VDA schemes. An expression is developed to obtain an a priori evaporative fraction (EF) estimate from leaf area index (LAI) or apparent thermal inertia (ATI). The a priori EF estimate is used as an initial guess in the VDA approach. The results indicate that the VDA method is able to find the optimal value of EF by assimilating the low-temporal resolution MODIS LST data. The predicted turbulent heat fluxes from VDA are compared with the measurements from the large-aperture scintillometer at three sites (Arou, Daman, and Sidaoqiao) in the Heihe River Basin (located in northwest China). The findings indicate that the CS and DS VDA models perform well in various hydrological and vegetative conditions. The three-site-average root mean square errors (RMSEs) of sensible and latent heat fluxes estimates from the CS scheme are 37.44 W m(-2) and 94.30 W m(-2), respectively. The DS model reduces the above mentioned RMSEs by 19.82% and 21.37%, respectively. Overall, the results show that using the a priori EF estimate from the proposed expression in the VDA approach eliminates the need for the high resolution LST data from geostationary satellites, and allows the VDA method to estimate turbulent heat fluxes by assimilating LST data from polar orbiting satellites. Finally, several numerical tests are conducted to assess the effect of LST temporal sampling on the turbulent heat fluxes estimates. The results show that the LST measurement at 1400 Local Time (LT) has the most amount of information for partitioning the available energy into sensible and latent heat fluxes.

TI  - An Unmixing-Based Bayesian Model for Spatio-Temporal Satellite Image Fusion in Heterogeneous Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of land surface dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes often require satellite images with a high resolution, both in time and space. However, the design of satellite sensors often inherently limits the availability of such images. Images with high spatial resolution tend to have relatively low temporal resolution, and vice versa. Therefore, fusion of the two types of images provides a useful way to generate data high in both spatial and temporal resolutions. A Bayesian data fusion framework can produce the target high-resolution image based on a rigorous statistical foundation. However, existing Bayesian data fusion algorithms, such as STBDF (spatio-temporal Bayesian data fusion) -I and -II, do not fully incorporate the mixed information contained in low-spatial-resolution pixels, which in turn might limit their fusion ability in heterogeneous landscapes. To enhance the capability of existing STBDF models in handling heterogeneous areas, this study proposes two improved Bayesian data fusion approaches, coined ISTBDF-I and ISTBDF-II, which incorporate an unmixing-based algorithm into the existing STBDF framework. The performance of the proposed algorithms is visually and quantitatively compared with STBDF-II using simulated data and real satellite images. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms generate improved spatio-temporal-resolution images over STBDF-II, especially in heterogeneous areas. They shed light on the way to further enhance our fusion capability.

The advent of immunohistochemistry staining for cytokeratin 20, a shared neuroendocrine marker, greatly improved diagnostic accuracy. Over the past decade, staging, treatment, and surveillance of the cancer have progressed at a remarkably rapid pace. Herein, the authors provide an update on the current guidelines around diagnosis and management and review the exciting advancements on the horizon.

TI  - Quantifying the cooling-effects of urban and peri-urban wetlands using remote sensing data: Case study of cities of Northeast China
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - World urbanization has been increasing at a rapid pace over the past few decades, particularly in developing countries. The urban heat island (UHI) effect, which occurs during rapid urbanization, profoundly affects human life and health. The cooling-effect (CE) of urban wetlands can effectively mitigate the impact of UHI. In this study, we estimated the intensity of UHI and quantitatively assessed the CE of urban wetlands in cities of northeast China by using split-window algorithm (SWA) to estimate land surface temperatures (LST) from Landsat-8 TIRS. We used correlation analysis to examine the relationships between characteristics of wetlands and surrounding buildings and two cooling-effect indices: normalized cooling capability index (NCCI) and normalized cooling efficiency index (NCEI). Our results have shown that the cooling-effect of rivers is much higher than that of other wetlands types and green spaces. The average NCCI of wetlands is 42.3 times higher than that of green spaces. A strong positive relationship exists between the cooling capability of urban wetlands and the area, shape and hydrologic connectivity of wetlands. Wetlands with more complex shape have better cooling-effect. The average NCCI of wetlands connected to other surface waters six times higher than that of isolated wetlands. There is a negative relationship between the cooling capability of urban wetlands and height and density of surrounding buildings. These findings are helpful for designing urban wetlands and for urban planning to minimize the potential environmental impacts of UHI.

AB  - We examine the effect of forest cover change on agricultural productivity using household panel data and remote sensing data on forest change. The focus of the study is rural Indonesia, where deforestation is causing intensive biodiversity loss while agriculture is the main industry. We estimate an agricultural production function and find that farmers in rural Indonesia experienced a reduction in agricultural productivity of 45% between 2001 and 2014 or US$2.63 billion in 2014. In addition, we explore the mechanisms underlying the productivity loss and find that biological pest control is the most plausible explanation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Extraction and Analysis of Natural Vegetation Cover and Soil Moisture Using Landsat TM Data in the Arid Oasis of Xinjiang, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural vegetation cover and soil moisture have significant impacts on the stability of the Arid oasis. In this paper, the 75 Landsat TM images were processed to extract the natural vegetation cover, obtained by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and soil moisture observed by Tasseled Cap Wetness (TCW) during the year 1990-2011 in the Sangong River Basin, Xinjiang, China. Four plots of natural vegetation were selected to measure the average values of NDVI and TCW. The results reflected that the NDVI and TCW kept stable during the past 20years with a strong correlation between each other. The influences of different geographical locations and different cover types on the change of NDVI mean in four plots were different. There was a close relationship between NDVI (or TCW) and precipitation in a short time. On the other hand, the data of groundwater depth measured from 16 groundwater observation wells year from 1998 to 2002 were used to perform spatial interpolation in the study area. Two shrub land plots in northern oasis were selected to extract the values of groundwater depth, vegetation index and soil moisture at each grid pixel (30m) for carrying out the correlation analysis. The results demonstrated that there were obvious correlations among them when the groundwater depth varied in a range of 2.5-4m; otherwise, the growth of vegetation would be inhibited in this area. The remote sensing as an effective way of achieving time series information could provide important data for natural vegetation development and evolution, which could be in favor of oasis' stability and sustainable development.

TI  - Monitoring the Characteristics of the Bohai Sea Ice Using High-Resolution Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing data, such as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometers (MODIS) and advanced very high-resolution radiometers (AVHRR), are being widely used to monitor sea ice conditions and their variability in the Bohai Sea, the southernmost frozen sea in the Northern Hemisphere. Monitoring the characteristics of the Bohai Sea ice can provide crucial information for ice disaster prevention for marine transportation, oil field operation, and regional climate change studies. Although these satellite data cover the study area with fairly high spatial resolution, their typically limited cloudless images pose serious restrictions for continuous observation of short-term dynamics, such as sub-seasonal changes. In this study, high spatiotemporal resolution (500 m and eight images per day) geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) data with a high proportion of cloud-free images were used to monitor the characteristics of the Bohai Sea ice, including area and thickness. An object-based feature extraction method and an albedo-based thickness inversion model were used for estimating sea ice area and thickness, respectively. To demonstrate the efficacy of the new dataset, a total of 68 GOCI images were selected to analyze the evolution of sea ice area and thickness during the winter of 2012-2013 with severe sea ice conditions. The extracted sea ice area was validated using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data with higher spatial resolution, and the estimated sea ice thickness was found to be consistent with in situ observation results. The entire sea ice freezing-melting processes, including the key events such as the day with the maximum ice area and the first and last days of the frozen season, were better resolved by the high temporal-resolution GOCI data compared with MODIS or AVHRR data. Both characteristics were found to be closely correlated with cumulative freezing/melting degree days. Our study demonstrates the applicability of the GOCI data as an improved dataset for studying the Bohai Sea ice, particularly for purposes that require high temporal resolution data, such as sea ice disaster monitoring.

TI  - Soil prediction for coastal wetlands following <i>Spartina</i> <i>alterniflora</i> invasion using Sentinel-1 imagery and structural equation modeling
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, biological invasions have significantly altered soil functions in coastal wetlands such as nutrient cycling and carbon restoration. Although these changes have been explored, the quantitative prediction of soil properties that respond to species invasions have not well been studied. To facilitate development of an invasion specific soil predictive model, we used time series Sentinel-1 data to represent the invasion process regarding species establishment stages and structural equation modeling (SEM) to quantify the interacting relationships within the soil-vegetation system that was assumed to be useful in explaining the spatial variability of soils. By applying the SEM model with time series Sentinel-1 data as covariates, we predicted topsoil properties in the east-central China coast that is impacted by Spartina alternifiora Loisel. An accuracy assessment based on leave one-out cross-validation showed the efficacy of the proposed model to predict soil properties, with a ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of 1.47 for soil salinity, 0.99 for soil pH, and 1 for soil organic carbon (SOC). In the SEM, the plant invasion presented a direct influence on soil salinity that influenced soil pH, whereas SOC was influenced by soil pH, but its effects on soil pH and SOC were not important. These results highlight that the interacting relationships between the plant invasion and the soil system can be modeled. It also highlights the potential utility of time series Sentinel-1 data in capturing the invasion process, providing evidence that Sentinel-1 data might be useful in estimating soil properties in areas with dense natural vegetation cover.

TI  - Retrieving leaf area index in discontinuous forest using ICESat/GLAS full-waveform data based on gap fraction model
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important vegetation structure parameter in terrestrial ecosystem modeling. Although the spaceborne Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on board the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) has been proved to have potential for deriving forest LAI, previous methods were only applicable to estimate the effective LAI. In this study, a physical method based on the gap fraction model was proposed to retrieve the LAI correcting the between-crown clumping in discontinuous forest using GLAS full-waveform data. Landsat TM imagery was utilized as auxiliary data for providing crown cover information within the footprint. Using the gap probability from GLAS data and the crown coverage fraction from Landsat imagery, the method corrects the between-crown clumping, which has been proved to contribute most to the total clumping effect, and accurately estimates the LAI in discontinuous forest (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.39, n = 47). Additionally, the forest LAI underestimation caused by between-crown clumping was analyzed in practice and theory. Results show that the between-crown clumping has a nonnegligible influence on forest LAI estimation in cases that the forest area within the footprint is close to the nonforest area, and the average LAI of individual tree is high. This study may shed some light on the development of clumping effect and quantitative LAI inversion models.

TI  - The NDVI-CV Method for Mapping Evergreen Trees in Complex Urban Areas Using Reconstructed Landsat 8 Time-Series Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evergreen trees play a significant role in urban ecological services, such as air purification, carbon and oxygen balance, and temperature and moisture regulation. Remote sensing represents an essential technology for obtaining spatiotemporal distribution data for evergreen trees in cities. However, highly developed subtropical cities, such as Nanjing, China, have serious land fragmentation problems, which greatly increase the difficulty of extracting evergreen trees information and reduce the extraction precision of remote-sensing methods. This paper introduces a normalized difference vegetation index coefficient of variation (NDVI-CV) method to extract evergreen trees from remote-sensing data by combining the annual minimum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIann-min) with the CV of a Landsat 8 time-series NDVI. To obtain an intra-annual, high-resolution time-series dataset, Landsat 8 cloud-free and partially cloud-free images over a three-year period were collected and reconstructed for the study area. Considering that the characteristic growth of evergreen trees remained nearly unchanged during the phenology cycle, NDVIann-min is the optimal phenological node to separate this information from that of other vegetation types. Furthermore, the CV of time-series NDVI considers all of the phenologically critical phases; therefore, the NDVI-CV method had higher extraction accuracy. As such, the approach presented herein represents a more practical and promising method based on reasonable NDVIann-min and CV thresholds to obtain spatial distribution data for evergreen trees. The experimental verification results indicated a comparable performance since the extraction accuracy of the model was over 85%, which met the classification accuracy requirements. In a cross-validation comparison with other evergreen trees' extraction methods, the NDVI-CV method showed higher sensitivity and stability.

TI  - Evaluating the Effects of Image Texture Analysis on Plastic Greenhouse Segments via Recognition of the OSI-USI-ETA-CEI Pattern
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared to multispectral or panchromatic bands, fusion imagery contains both the spectral content of the former and the spatial resolution of the latter. Even though the Estimation of Scale Parameter (ESP), the ESP 2 tool, and some segmentation evaluation methods have been introduced to simplify the choice of scale parameter (SP), shape, and compactness, many challenges remain, including obtaining the natural border of plastic greenhouses (PGs) from a GaoFen-2 (GF-2) fusion imagery, accelerating the progress of follow-up texture analysis, and accurately evaluating over-segmentation and under-segmentation of PG segments in geographic object-based image analysis. Considering the features of high-resolution images, the heterogeneity of fusion imagery was compressed using texture analysis before calculating the optimal scale parameter in ESP 2 in this study. As a result, we quantified the effects of image texture analysis, including increasing averaging operator size (AOS) and decreasing greyscale quantization level (GQL) on PG segments via recognition of a proposed Over-Segmentation Index (OSI)-Under-Segmentation Index (USI)-Error Index of Total Area (ETA)-Composite Error Index (CEI) pattern. The proposed pattern can be used to reasonably evaluate the quality of PG segments obtained from GF-2 fusion imagery and its derivative images, showing that appropriate texture analysis can effectively change the heterogeneity of a fusion image for better segmentation. The optimum setup of GQL and AOS are determined by comparing CEI and visual analysis.

TI  - Gravity waves in the near space observed by the microwave temperature sounder of the FY-3C meteorology satellite
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave observations in oxygen absorption bands near 50 similar to 60 GHz and 118. 75 GHz of the MicroWave Temperatuer Sounder II (MWTS- II ) on FY-3C can be used to monitor the atmospheric temperature of the near space. This study demonstrates the advantages of the MWTS- II in the observations of the strong Gravity Wave(GW) disturbances in the near space, especially the stratosphere. Meanwhile the capability of different channels to monitor the stratospheric atmospheric temperature disturbance is analyzed based on the statistical results of strong GWs disturbances in the stratosphere. Then, the similarities and differences between the FY-3C microwave temperature sounder and other similar instruments in observing stratospheric GWs perturbations are presented, and the capability of the similar atmospheric microwave channels on different satellites to analyze the stratospheric GWs is discussed. Besides, the frequency distribution of global stratospheric GWs disturbances in the winter from December 2013 to February 2014 and the summer of 2014 (June, July and August) is calculated. A stratospheric GWs process from 7th to 11th January 2014 in Greenland shows that the 50 similar to 60 GHz and 118. 75 GHz bands of the MWTS- II permits to capture the atmospheric temperature disturbances at different heights of the stratosphere. And the detection capability of 50 similar to 60 GHz band is significantly better than the latter. The comparison between AMSU-A of METOP-B and MWTS- II of FY-3C via a GWs process of the stratosphere near the Labrador Peninsula on 11th January 2014 indicates that MWTS- II can detect finer stratospheric gravity waves, and the intensity of the disturbance from MWTS- is also stronger. The analysis of the similar channels of different platforms for a GWs process near the Andes on 10th August 2014 shows that the multi-platform observations can further improve the temporal resolution of the stratospheric GW observations.

TI  - Advancing Short-Term Forecasts of Ice Conditions in the Beaufort Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerical experiments with a regional configuration of the CICE model (Los-Alamos Community sea Ice CodE) in the Beaufort Sea assimilating Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder ice concentration (IC) and CryoSat ice thickness (IT) data acquired for September-December of 2015 are presented. We explore sensitivity of the 24-hr IT/IC forecast skill to the system updates, which include introduction of the IT assimilation capability, flow-dependent correlations, and Gaussianization of IC innovations. Experiments with IC data assimilation have shown that the flow-dependent correlations provide 5-7% improvement of the forecast skill during the freezing period (10 September to 10 November) while Gaussianization contributes an additional improvement of 3-4% in most of the cases. In winter (11 November to 31 December) IC assimilation did not produce any statistically significant improvement of the skill due to the loss of dynamical information in the IC fields associated saturation of the ice cover. In contrast, IT assimilation provides larger improvement in December compared to October-November due to the better coverage of the Beaufort Sea by observations and their higher relative accuracy in winter. Comparison of the IT forecast fields with independent in situ observations by two upward looking sonars demonstrates statistically insignificant improvements. Much better improvement (15-25%) is observed when comparing monthly mean IT assimilation runs against independent Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth observing system (AMSR-E) data. Introduction of the heuristic in situ IC/IT correlations into the background covariance model did not produce any improvements of the forecast skill.Plain Language Summary Four-month-long observations of ice concentration and thickness in the Beaufort Sea are processed using an updated version of the Navy Coastal Ocean Data Assimilation system run at 2-km resolution. The updates include introduction of the ice thickness assimilation capability, flow-dependent correlations, and improvement of the error statistics for ice concentration. We show that daily forecasts of ice conditions improve considerably during the freezing period in September-November. Causes of the improvement are discussed in the context of ice information content of the satellite data.

TI  - Retrieval of High Spatiotemporal Resolution Leaf Area Index with Gaussian Processes, Wireless Sensor Network, and Satellite Data Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many applications, including crop growth and yield monitoring, require accurate long-term time series of leaf area index (LAI) at high spatiotemporal resolution with a quantification of the associated uncertainties. We propose an LAI retrieval approach based on a combination of the LAINet observation system, the Consistent Adjustment of the Climatology to Actual Observations (CACAO) method, and Gaussian process regression (GPR). First, the LAINet wireless sensor network provides temporally continuous field measurements of LAI. Then, the CACAO approach generates synchronous reflectance data at high spatiotemporal resolution (30-m and 8-day) from the fusion of multitemporal MODIS and high spatial resolution Landsat satellite imagery. Finally, the GPR machine learning regression algorithm retrieves the LAI maps and their associated uncertainties. A case study in a cropland site in China showed that the accuracy of LAI retrievals is 0.36 (12.7%) in terms of root mean square error and R-2 = 0.88 correlation with ground measurements as evaluated over the entire growing season. This paper demonstrates the potential of the joint use of newly developed software and hardware technologies in deriving concomitant LAI and uncertainty maps with high spatiotemporal resolution. It will contribute to precision agriculture, as well as to the retrieval and validation of LAI products.

TI  - Short-Term Variations in the Surface Upwelling off Northeastern Taiwan Observed via Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Short-term biweekly variations in the surface upwelling off northeastern Taiwan are well documented. However, due to limitations in the spatiotemporal resolution and coverage of the observed data, the lifecycle and associated dynamics are poorly understood. In this study, a gradient-based edge detection algorithm is proposed to detect the surface upwelling. The sea surface temperature data of geostationary satellite Himawari-8 were used to explore a complete short-term process as a case study. The evolution was analyzed in terms of an upwelling index measured via the temperature difference between upwelled and surrounding water and the area and shape of the surface upwelling. The process lasted approximately 17days as the upwelling moved northeastward under the advection of the Kuroshio Current and included two stages: intensification and decay. The last 8years (2010-2017) of multisatellite combined sea surface temperature data were examined to verify the results obtained in the case study. A statistical analysis shows that most of the short-term processes occur in the summer with an average lifecycle of approximately 155days. The trajectories of the upwelling center can be grouped into three types: quasi-stationary near the shelf break, moving northward across the shelf break, and moving northeastward along the shelf break. A preliminary discussion suggests that the observed variations may be caused by the collective effects of multiple dynamical mechanisms, such as fluctuations in the Kuroshio Current, surface wind curl, and typhoons. This study furthers our knowledge of the surface upwelling off northeastern Taiwan and provides constraints for numerical simulations.Plain Language Summary The upwelling off northeastern Taiwan is an important pathway for shelf-ocean exchanges between the East China Sea and the Kuroshio Current. In this study, we used two satellite data of sea surface temperature to explore the short-term variations of surface upwelling off northeastern Taiwan. In order to quantify the process, we proposed a gradient-based edge detection algorithm to detect the surface upwelling. The results show that the short-term variations are ubiquitous and primarily occur in the summer. The lifecycle lasts about 155days and can be divided into two stages: intensification and decay. The trajectories of the upwelling center over the process can be classified into three types: quasi-stationary, cross-shelf northward, and along the Kuroshio Current northeastward. The latter two types reveal to us a new route of water exchange between the upwelled subsurface Kuroshio waters and the East China Sea shelf waters. A preliminary examination suggests that the observed variations are likely caused by the collective effects of multiple dynamical mechanisms such as fluctuations in the Kuroshio Current, surface wind curl, and typhoons. This study will strengthen our understanding of surface upwelling variations and improve current knowledge on the cross-shelf exchange process of upwelled Kuroshio subsurface waters.

TI  - The Effect of Snow Depth on Spring Wildfires on the Hulunbuir from 2001-2018 Based on MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are one of the important disturbance factors in natural ecosystems and occur frequently around the world. Detailed research on the impact of wildfires is crucial not only for the development of livestock husbandry but also for the sustainable use of natural resources. In this study, based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burned area product MC464A1 and site snow depth measurements, the kernel density estimation method (KDE), unary linear regression analysis, Sen + Mann-Kendall trend analysis, correlation analysis, and R/S analysis were used to evaluate the relationship between snow and spring wildfires (SWFs) in Hulunbuir. Our results indicated that SWFs decreased during the period of 2001-2018, were mainly distributed in the eastern portion of the study area, and that the highest SWF density was 7 events/km(2). In contrast, the maximum snow depth increased during the period of 2001-2018 and the snow depth was deeper in the middle but shallower in the east and west. The SWFs and snow depth have significant negative correlations over space and time. The snow depth mainly affects the occurrence of SWFs indirectly by affecting the land surface temperature (LST) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) in spring. The snow depth was positively correlated with the LSWI in most of Hulunbuir and strongly negatively correlated with the LST, and this correlation was stronger in the eastern and western regions of Hulunbuir. The results of the Hurst exponent indicated that in the future, the snow depth trend will be opposite that of the current state, meaning that the trend of decreasing snow depth will increase dramatically in most of the study area, and SWFs may become more prominent. According to the validation results, the Hurst exponent is a reliable method for predicting the snow depth tendency. This research can be based on the snow conditions of the previous year to identify areas where fires are most likely to occur, enabling an improved and more targeted preparation for spring fire prevention. Additionally, the present study expands the theory and methods of wildfire occurrence research and promotes research on disasters and disaster chains.

M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)preinvasive breast cancerwith lymph node metastasis can clinically be treated as different stages: occult invasive cancer with true metastasis (T1N1) or pure DCIS with iatrogenic dissemination (TisN0). In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to elucidate the prognostic impact and possible pathogenesis of nodal metastasis in DCIS to improve clinical management.MethodsSubjects were comprised of 427 patients with routine postoperative diagnosis of DCIS who underwent sentinel node (SN) biopsy using molecular whole-lymph-node analysis. Clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis were compared between SN-positive and -negative patients. Primary tumour tissues of SN-positive patients were exhaustively step-sectioned to detect occult invasions, and predictive factors for occult invasion were investigated. Median follow-up time was 73.6 months.ResultsOf the 427 patients, 19 (4.4%) were SN-positive and 408 (95.6%) were SN-negative. More SN-positive patients received adjuvant systemic therapy than SN-negative patients (84.2% vs. 5.4%). Seven-year distant disease-free survivals were favourable for both cohorts (SN-positive, 100%; SN-negative, 99.7%). By examining 1421 slides, occult invasion was identified in 9 (47.4%) of the 19 SN-positive patients. Tumour burdens in SN and incidence of non-SN metastasis were similar between patients with and without occult invasion, and no predictive factor for occult invasion was found.ConclusionsNode-positive DCIS has favourable prognosis with adjuvant systemic therapy. Half of the cases may be occult invasive cancer with true metastasis. In practical settings, clinicians may have to treat these tumours as node-positive small invasive cancers because it is difficult to predict the pathogenesis without exhaustive primary tumour sectioning.

TI  - Total cloud cover climatology over the United Arab Emirates
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud climatologies are of great importance in the study of cloud dynamics and interactions with land, oceans and atmosphere. This study analyzes the climatology of Total Cloud Cover (TCC) over the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Monthly mean TCC data between 1984 and 2009 from ground observations at six UAE airport stations and the satellite-based (CLARA A2) product are utilized. The hourly ground observations are first filtered to match the overpass times of CLARA-A2 satellites over the UAE. Comparison between the datasets reveals higher TCC reports by CLARA-A2. These are attributed to several factors, such as the underestimation of TCC by human observers and the region's aerosol loading, surface albedo and emissivity, which impact the quality of remote sensing retrievals. Satellites utilized for CLARA-A2 are known to have undergone changes in their numbers and orbits over the years, prompting an investigation of its homogeneity. Change points are found to occur in 1991 and 1998, related to increased satellite measurements and sensor changes, respectively. Further investigations of the homogeneity of means and variances before and after the change points are also conducted, resulting in confirmation of the inhomogeneity induced by artifacts. Monthly means of hourly ground observations are then used for analysis of TCC climatology over the six stations. Fujairah has the highest TCC on average, due to its proximity to the Hajar mountains and the Oman gulf. Most of the stations exhibit significant decreasing trends, in addition to a change point occurring in 1998. This is theorized to be related to the El Nino Southern Oscillation phase change occurring in the same period. The potential teleconnection is explored further through testing for correlations of TCC with the Oceanic Nino Index, with results showing a strong link in the fall-winter seasons.

TI  - Temporal-spatial analysis of crop residue burning in China and its impact on aerosol pollution
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - China has performed crop residue burning (CRB) for a long time and has suffered from resultant environmental pollution. High temporal resolution has not been fully discussed in attempts to address the temporal and spatial impact of CRB in China on air quality. Our study used the MOD14A1 product of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) to extract the daily CRB for China during the period from 2014 to 2016, and the daily aerosol optical depth (AOD) provided by MODIS Collection 6 was obtained to simultaneously reflect the air pollution. First, the study area was classified into five subregions. A temporal analysis was conducted on the daily variation in the number of CRB events and the regional mean value of AOD, the spatial contribution ratio of CRB on aerosol pollution was then calculated, and finally, a temporal and spatial Pearson correlation was calculated to find the spatially varying relationship between CRB and aerosol. The results suggest the following: (1) CRB possesses seasonal characteristics that are associated with the harvest time or sowing time of major crops in the region. (2) The impact of CRB on aerosol was delayed by 1-6 days. (3) High contribution ratios (70%-90%) occurred in northeast China on a large scale; even when the impact of the CRB on aerosol pollution in the Huang-Huai-Hai river basin occurred on a large scale, the value was merely approximately 30%. Relatively low contributions of CRB have been found in other places, whereas the contribution of CRB was severe in some places with high-density populations. (4) Temporal-spatial correlation provided an accurate index to reflect the correlation of CRB and aerosol in a specific location, which suggests that, in places with large scale and dense CRB, CRB tends to have a high positive correlation with aerosol pollution for each day.

AB  - The study aimed to assess the hydrological impacts of the basin development scenarios-which are BS (baseline scenario), DFS (definite future scenario), and FFS (foreseeable future scenario)-by the Mekong River Commission (MRC) on the hydrological regime between the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake. The proposed CAESAR-LISFLOOD system was applied to analyze flood inundation patterns of the Tonle Sap Lake using satellite images, as well as to compare the simulated inundation maps. The flow duration variability was also analyzed at the outlet point of the Mekong River basin based on the analysis results of CAESAR-LISFLOOD, according to the basin development. The results show that the CAESAR-LISFLOOD model produces acceptable flooding areas (8607 km(2)) compared with the satellite observations (9615 km(2)), and the flood inundation areas decrease gradually from 3.69 (10(3) km(2)) in the BS scenario to 3.54 (10(3) km(2)) in the FFS scenario. However, it was found that the annual average flow duration variability scenario at the Kratie point, presented in the MRC, does not significantly affect the flow duration downstream from the Kratie point.

TI  - An Effective Similar-Pixel Reconstruction of the High-Frequency Cloud-Covered Areas of Southwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With advantages of multispatial resolutions, a high retrieval accuracy, and a high temporal resolution, the satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) products are very important LST sources. However, the greatest barrier to their wide application is the invalid values produced by large quantities of cloudy pixels, especially for regions frequently swathed in clouds. In this study, an effective method based on the land energy balance theory and similar pixels (SP) method was developed to reconstruct the LSTs over cloudy pixels for the widely used MODIS LST (MOD11A1). The southwest region of China was selected as the study area, where extreme drought has frequently occurred in recent years in the context of global climate change and which commonly exhibits cloudy and foggy weather. The validation results compared with in situ LSTs showed that the reconstructed LSTs have an average error < 1.00 K (0.57 K at night and -0.14 K during the day) and an RMSE < 3.20 K (1.90 K at night and 3.16 K in the daytime). The experiment testing the SP interpolation indicated that the spatial structure of the LST has a greater effect on the SP performance than the size of the data-missing area, which benefits the LST reconstruction in the area frequently covered by large clouds.

TI  - Detecting Intensity Evolution of the Western North Pacific Super Typhoons in 2016 Using the Deviation Angle Variance Technique with FY Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes the complete lifecycle of super typhoons in 2016 in the western North Pacific (WNP) using the deviation angle variance technique (DAV-T). Based on the infrared images from Fengyun (FY) satellites, the DAV-T enables quantification of the axisymmetry of tropical cyclones (TCs) by using the DAV values; and thus, it helps improve the capability of TC intensity estimation. Case analyses of Super Typhoons Lionrock and Meranti were performed to explore the distribution characteristics of the DAV values at the various stages of TC evolution. The results show that the minimum DAV values (i.e., map minimum values: MMVs) gradually decreased and their locations constantly approached the circulation center with enhancement of the TC organization; however, when a ring or disk structure was formed around a TC, significant changes in MMV locations were no longer observed. Nonetheless, when large-scale non-closed deep convective cloud clusters appeared at the early stage or the dissipation stage of the typhoon, the axisymmetry of the TC was poor and the MMV locations tended to lie in the most convective region rather than in the TC circulation center. Overall, the MMVs and their locations, respectively, exhibited a strong correlation with the TC intensity and circulation center, and the correlation increased as the TCs became stronger. Combined with the China Meteorological Administration BestTrack dataset (CMA-BestTrack), statistical analysis of all research samples reveals that the correlation coefficient between the MMVs and maximum surface wind speeds (V (max)) was-0.80; the root mean square error (RMSE) of relative distance between the MMV locations and TC centers was 140.3 km; and especially, when the samples below the tropical depression (TD) intensity were removed, the RMSE of the relative distance decreased dramatically to 95.0 km. The value and location of the MMVs could be used as important indicators for estimating TC intensity and center.

TI  - Influence of Oceanographic Parameters on the Seasonal Potential Fishing Grounds of <i>Rastrelliger kanagurta</i> using Maximum Entropy Models and Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - SAINS MALAYSIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding of the spatial distribution of fish habitats is crucial in order to achieve optimum fishing and to increase efficiency of marine resource management. In this study, seasonal potential suitability habitat model for Rastrelliger kanagurta off the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia was derived using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) by utilizing fishing locations and environmental parameters from remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) and chl-a concentration (chl-a) data. The influence of environmental parameters on the formation of the potential fishing zones was also determined. The results showed that all the seasonal models performed significantly better than random with AUC > 0.80, which indicated that the constructed models were applicable with 'good' to 'excellent' predictive accuracy. The model also showed that chl-a influenced R. kanagurta's potential fishing ground during northeast and intermediate monsoon of October. Meanwhile, SST contributed more in defining the potential fishing grounds during southwest and intermediate monsoon period of April. The seasonal and spatial extents of potential fishing grounds were largely explained by chl-a (0.32-0.42 mg/m(3) during northeast, 0.27-0.66 mg/m(3) in April, 0.21-0.30 mg/m(3) during southwest monsoon and 0.22-0.39 mg/m(3) in October) and SST (29.05-29.94 degrees C during northeast monsoon, 31.18-31.47 degrees C in April, 31.17-31.48 degrees C during southwest monsoon and 30.34-31.11 degrees C in October). This indicated that seasonal changes in oceanographic parameters influenced spatial distribution of fish. The results also demonstrated the applicability and potential of MaxEnt in determination of potential fishing grounds and describing the influence of oceanographic factors on the formation of the area.

TI  - Physical mechanisms of submesoscale eddies generation: evidences from laboratory modeling and satellite data in the Black Sea
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The observed evidence of the implementation of three different mechanisms of the submesoscale eddies generation in the Black Sea previously studied by the field research and laboratory modeling is presented. These mechanisms are the following: (1) horizontal shear instability of the surface current; (2) flow separation behind capes and peninsulas; (3) spatial heterogeneity of the wind blowing from the coast to the sea. The first mechanism is implemented both in the open sea and in the coastal zone. The other two operate in the coastal zone. It was found that with the implementation of each from these mechanisms an asymmetry in the formation of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies arises. Particularly, as a result of the flow shear instability, cyclonic vortices are usually observed, anticyclones are formed only in the case of rather weak anticyclonic velocity shear. Due to the alongshore current separation behind capes and peninsulas, the anticyclonic eddies and even the chains of this kind of eddies are predominantly formed. The spatially inhomogeneous wind from the coast to the sea generates eddy dipoles with dominating anticyclones. The joint analysis of surface geostrophic currents calculated using satellite altimetry data, the wind velocity field over the sea (reanalysis data), and satellite images in the optical spectral range for various regions of the Black Sea confirmed the main results of laboratory experiments and field research.

TI  - Acute Tissue Mineral Deposition in Response to a Phosphate Pulse in Experimental CKD
T2  - JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Pathogenic accumulation of calcium (Ca) and phosphate (PO4) in vasculature is a sentinel of advancing cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study sought to characterize acute distribution patterns of radiolabeled (PO4)-P-33 and Ca-45 in cardiovascular tissues of rats with CKD (0.25% dietary adenine). The disposition of (PO4)-P-33 and Ca-45 was assessed in blood and 36 tissues after a 10-minute intravenous infusion of one of the following: (i) PO4 pulse + tracer (PO4)-P-33; (ii) PO4 pulse + tracer Ca-45; or (iii) saline + tracer Ca-45 in CKD and non-CKD animals. After the infusion, (PO4)-P-33 in blood was elevated (2.3x at 10 minutes, 3.5x at 30 minutes, p < 0.05) in CKD compared with non-CKD. In contrast, there was no difference in clearance of Ca-45 from the blood. Compared with controls, CKD rats had a markedly increased (PO4)-P-33 incorporation in several tissues (skeletal muscle, 7.8x; heart, 5.5x), but accrual was most pronounced in the vasculature (24.8x). There was a significant, but smaller, increase in Ca-45 accrual in the vasculature of CKD rats (1.25x), particularly in the calcified rat, in response to the acute phosphate load. Based on the pattern of tissue uptake of (PO4)-P-33 and Ca-45, this study revealed that an increase in circulating PO4 is an important stimulus for the accumulation of these minerals in vascular tissue in CKD. This response is further enhanced when vascular calcification is also present. The finding of enhanced vascular mineral deposition in response to an acute PO4 pulse provides evidence of significant tissue-specific susceptibility to calcification.

TI  - Multilayer Soil Moisture Mapping at a Regional Scale from Multisource Data via a Machine Learning Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture mapping at a regional scale is commonplace since these data are required in many applications, such as hydrological and agricultural analyses. The use of remotely sensed data for the estimation of deep soil moisture at a regional scale has received far less emphasis. The objective of this study was to map the 500-m, 8-day average and daily soil moisture at different soil depths in Oklahoma from remotely sensed and ground-measured data using the random forest (RF) method, which is one of the machine-learning approaches. In order to investigate the estimation accuracy of the RF method at both a spatial and a temporal scale, two independent soil moisture estimation experiments were conducted using data from 2010 to 2014: a year-to-year experiment (with a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.038 to 0.050 m(3)/m(3)) and a station-to-station experiment (with an RMSE ranging from 0.044 to 0.057 m(3)/m(3)). Then, the data requirements, importance factors, and spatial and temporal variations in estimation accuracy were discussed based on the results using the training data selected by iterated random sampling. The highly accurate estimations of both the surface and the deep soil moisture for the study area reveal the potential of RF methods when mapping soil moisture at a regional scale, especially when considering the high heterogeneity of land-cover types and topography in the study area.

TI  - Remote sensing of unhelpful resilience to sea level rise caused by mangrove expansion: A case study of islands in Florida Bay, USA
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have found that vegetated coastal areas can increase their elevation indicating resilience to inundation by sea level rise (SLR), but the potential resilience were ignored or showed controversial results (i.e., soil accretion of vegetated areas vs. SLR). To estimate the resilience influences on 15 islands in Florida Bay (Florida, U.S.), our study used indicators (areas of the 15 islands and their mangrove forests) by analyzing 61-yr high-resolution historical aerial photographs and a 27-yr time-series of Landsat images. In these islands, coastal fringes are dominated by mangroves, and inland parts are dominated by brackish or freshwater species. Our results showed that: (1) despite rising sea levels, these low-lying islands significantly increased in area; (2) all of these islands had significant mangrove expansion, and the landward part of expansion led to the replacement of inland non-mangrove habitats; (3) there was a positive relationship between the increase of island area and mangrove expansion in these islands; (4) without the mangrove expansion, simulations showed that all of the islands had decreased areas by 2014 compared with that in 1953. On the basis of our spatial analyses and previous field studies in our study areas, these islands showed resilience to inundation and the mangrove expansion contributed to processes stabilizing these islands under SLR. Meanwhile, the mangrove expansion were partly at the expense of the habitats previously covered by non-mangrove species, thus potentially leading to a loss of plant diversity. Therefore, the mangrove expansion increased unhelpful resilience to maintain islands in a degraded state losing biodiversity, which should be considered in conservation accounting for future SLR. Moreover, the unhelpful resilience can be monitored by remote sensing based indicators, such as island area.

TI  - Mapping the Yellow River Delta land subsidence with multitemporal SAR interferometry by exploiting both persistent and distributed scatterers
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to highly compressible soil and a large amount of human activity, the costal deltas are more prone to ground subsidence. Many major costal deltas in the world are facing subsidence and are consequently more susceptible to flooding, salinization and seawater infusion or even permanent submergence. Therefore, ground subsidence has been a significant problem in coastal delta areas worldwide. The Yellow River Delta (YRD) is the second largest river delta in China. On the one hand, the YRD contains a large area of wetlands rich in biodiversity, and on the other hand, industrial activities and urbanization are extensive due to abundant underground resources such as oil, gas and brine. Excessive land use has caused different degrees of ground subsidence in this area. However, a detailed and comprehensive description of the ground subsidence pattern over the YRD has not been provided. Also, widespread non-urban area in Yellow River Delta region, such as wetlands, farmland and coastal tidal areas, hinders the application of persistent scatterer interferometry method (PSI) for comprehensive subsidence measurement over the whole area. In this paper, we developed a multitemporal InSAR method to map ground subsidence over the YRD area by exploiting both persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS). This method is characterized by employing the coherence-weighted phase-linking algorithm for fast and reliable optimal phase reconstruction of each DS point and a two-tier network of PS and DS for the robust analysis of land subsidence. To extract the detailed and comprehensive ground subsidence over the whole YRD, we apply our method to 30 ENVISAT ASAR images (2007-2010) and 49 Sentinel-1A (S-1A) images (2015-2018) and obtain measurements of the ground subsidence during these two periods. Forty-one Sentinel-18 (S-1B) images (2016-2018) are also exploited for cross-sensor consistency validation with the result derived from the S-1A dataset. Our method shows a great advantage over the PSI method, providing much higher measuring point (MP) density in mapping land subsidence over the YRD, including 15-fold higher density for the ASAR dataset, 5.1-fold for the S-1A dataset and 5.3-fold for the S-1B dataset, which enables a very detailed description of local ground deformation patterns. Cross-track consistency in the derived measurements from the S-1A and S-1B datasets shows a standard deviation of 9.6 mm/yr for the vertical subsidence rate. A quantitative validation of the derived subsidence results compared with leveling measurements suggests an accuracy of 4.58 mm/yr for the standard deviation term. By comparing the ground deformation over the YRD during the periods of 2015-2018 and 2007-2010, we find that the subsidence in this region shows an overall intensification trend and many new and severe subsidence depressions appear along the coastline, with a maximum vertical subsidence rate of 432 mm/yr. Subsequently, the overextraction of underground brine for salt production is identified as the primary factor causing the ground subsidence near the YRD coastal area.

TI  - Mapping salt marsh soil properties using imaging spectroscopy
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal salt marshes sequester and store blue carbon at both short and long time scales. Marsh soils shape and maintain the ecosystem by supporting complex biogeochemical reactions, deposition of sediment, and accumulation of organic matter. In this study, we examined the potential of imaging spectroscopy techniques to indirectly quantify and map tidal marsh soil properties at a National Estuarine Research Reserve in Georgia, USA. A framework was developed to combine modern digital image processing techniques for marsh soil mapping, including object-based image analysis (OBIA), machine learning modeling, and ensemble analysis. We also evaluated the efficacy of airborne hyperspectral sensors in estimating marsh soil properties compared to spaceborne multispectral sensors, WorldView-2 and QuickBird. The pros and cons of object-based modeling and mapping were assessed and compared with traditional pixel-based mapping methods. The results showed that the designed framework was effective in quantifying and mapping three marsh soil properties using the composite reflectance from salt marsh environment: soil salinity, soil water content, and soil organic matter content. Multispectral sensors were successful in quantifying soil salinity and soil water content but failed to model soil organic matter. The study also demonstrated the value of minimum noise fraction transformation and ensemble analysis techniques for marsh soil mapping. The results suggest that imaging spectroscopy based modeling is a promising tool to quantify and map marsh soil properties at a local scale, and is a potential alternative to traditional soil data acquisition to support carbon cycle research and the conservation and restoration of tidal marshes.

TI  - A soft-classification-based chlorophyll-<i>a</i> estimation method using MERIS data in the highly turbid and eutrophic Taihu Lake
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soft-classification-based methods for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration (Cad.) by satellite remote sensing have shown great potential in turbid coastal and inland waters. However, one of the most important water color sensors, the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), has not been applied to the study of turbid or eutrophic lakes. In this study, we developed a new soft-classification-based C-chla, estimation method using MERIS data for the highly turbid and eutrophic Taihu Lake. We first developed a decision tree to classify Taihu Lake into three optical water types (OWTs) using MERIS reflectance data, which were quasi-synchronous (+/- 3 h) with in situ measured C-chla, data from 91 sample stations. Secondly, we used MERIS reflectance and in situ measured Ca. data in each OWT to calibrate the optimal C-chla, estimation model for each OWT. We then developed a soft classification -based C-chla estimation method, which blends the C-chla , estimation results in each OWT by a weighted average, where the weight for each MERIS spectra in each OWT is the reciprocal value of the spectral angle distance between the MERIS spectra and the centroid spectra of the OWT. Finally, the soft-classification based Cad. estimation algorithm was validated and compared with no-classification and hard-classification based methods by the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method. The soft-classification-based method exhibited the best performance, with a correlation coefficient (R-2), average relative error (ARE), and root-mean square error (RMSE) of 0.81, 33.8%, and 7.0 mu g/L, respectively. Furthermore, the soft- classification-based method displayed smooth values at the edges of OWT boundaries, which resolved the main problem with the hard-classification-based method. The seasonal and annual variations of Cath, were computed in Taihu Lake from 2003 to 2011, and agreed with the results of previous studies, further indicating the stability of the algorithm. We therefore propose that the soft-classification-based method can be effectively used in Taihu Lake, and that it has the potential for use in other optically-similar turbid and eutrophic lakes, and using spectrally-similar satellite sensors.

TI  - On-Orbit Geometric Calibration and Validation of Luojia 1-01 Night-Light Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Luojia 1-01 Satellite (LJ1-01) is the first professional night-light remote-sensing satellite in China, and thus, it is of pioneering significance for the development of night-light remote sensing satellites in China and the application of remote sensing in the social and economic fields. To ensure the application of night-light remote-sensing data, several studies concerning on-orbit geometric calibration and accuracy verification have been carried out for the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) rolling shutter camera of LJ1-01 since the launch of the satellite. Owing to the lack of high-precision nightlight geometric reference at home and abroad, it is difficult to directly calibrate the nighttime light image of LJ1-01. Based on the principle of rolling shutter dynamic imaging, a rigorous geometric imaging model of the time-sharing exposure of the rolling shutter of LJ1-01 is established, and a geometric calibration method for daytime imaging calibration and compensated nighttime light data is proposed. The global public Landsat digital orthophoto image (DOM) with a 15-m resolution and 90-m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model (SRTM-DEM) are used as control data. The images obtained in England, Venezuela, Caracas, Damascus, and Torreon (Mexico) were selected as experimental data. The on-orbit calibration and accuracy verification of LJ1-01 were carried out. Experiments show that after on-orbit geometric calibration, the daytime calibration parameters can effectively compensate for the systematic errors of night-light images. After compensation, the positioning accuracy of night-light images without geometric control points (GCPs) is improved from nearly 20 km to less than 0.65 km. The internal accuracy of the calibrated night-light images is better than 0.3 pixels, which satisfies the requirement of subsequent applications.

TI  - Regional differences of lake evolution across China during 1960s-2015 and its natural and anthropogenic causes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are sensitive indicators of anthropogenic climate change and also respond to direct human activities. Yet, long-term lake inventories and quantitative evaluation of the factors driving observed lake changes across China remain elusive. Here, for the first time, we examined multi-decadal lake area changes in China during 1960s-2015, using historical topographic maps and > 3831 Landsat satellite images, including lakes as fine as km(2) in size. In addition, we quantified the causes of lake changes from climatic and anthropogenic factors. The total area of lakes in China has increased by 5858.06 km(2) (9%) between 1960s and 2015, and with heterogeneous spatial variations. Lake area changes in the Tibetan Plateau, Xinjiang, and Northeast Plain and Mountain regions reveal significant increases of 5676.75, 1417.15, 1134.87 km(2) (>= 15%), respectively, but the Inner-Mongolian Plateau shows an obvious decrease of 1223.76 km(2) (22%). We find that 141 new lakes have appeared predominantly in the arid western China; but 333 lakes, mainly located in the humid eastern China, have disappeared over the past five decades. We conclude that climate factors have played a dominant role in lake changes across China, coupled with noticeable anthropogenic contribution of similar to 35% in the Eastern Plain and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. This study has substantial implications to improve decision support regarding water-resource management strategies and land-use planning throughout China.

TI  - Evaluating the Representation of Vegetation Phenology in the Community Land Model 4.5 in a Temperate Grassland
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays an important role in terrestrial ecosystems and affects both water and carbon cycles. It is crucial to predict vegetation phenology accurately to understand the Earth's ecosystems better. In this study, we evaluated the temperate grassland phenology simulated by the Community Land Model 4.5 for the Northeast China Transect with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer leaf area index (LAI) data set. Results show that although the CLM could partly capture the seasonal patterns of LAI for temperate grasslands, shortcomings lie in a delayed end date of growing season and a problematic senescence existed in early summer. The reason is attributed to the low temperature threshold set for leaf offset and an inaccurate carbon allocation strategy for its display and storage. With the adjusted key phenology parameters, the modeled temperate grassland phenology has been substantially improved for this system: An overestimation of the growing-season LAI as well as the annual gross primary productivity can be constrained. Meanwhile, the modified phenology would effectively change the partition of evapotranspiration in a more reasonable pattern.

TI  - Sea Ice Classification Using TerraSAR-X ScanSAR Data With Removal of Scalloping and Interscan Banding
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective methods of sea ice classification are crucial to regional ice type mapping using spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR), especially in ScanSARmode. However, in TerraSAR-X ScanSAR images of ocean scenes, the scalloping and interscan banding (ISB) artifacts are usually visible. Though these two artifacts could be reduced to a certain degree where residual artifacts do not impede the visual interpretation of SAR images, this is not the case when it comes to sea ice classification. The difficulty mainly comes from the involvement of texture features in sea ice classification. Texture features, especially gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) are useful bases for sea ice classification using SAR data in single or dual polarization. When GLCM is applied to TerraSAR-X ScanSAR data, however, scalloping and ISB artifacts are found to be intensified, further affecting the classification result. How to largely eliminate the effects of scalloping and ISB on sea ice classification has not been studied thoroughly yet. In this paper, an approach combining Kalman filter, GLCM, and support vector machine is proposed. An independent testing shows that this approach is effective at the removal of scalloping and ISB's effects on sea ice classification using TerraSAR-X ScanSAR data, with the overall accuracy of 88.26%. Besides, convolutional neural network is implemented to compare with the proposed approach.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Organic Matter, Total Nitrogen and Total Carbon in Sustainable Coastal Wetlands
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil plays an important role in coastal wetland ecosystems. The estimation of soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), and total carbon (TC) was investigated at the topsoil (0-20 cm) in the coastal wetlands of Dafeng Elk National Nature Reserve in Yancheng, Jiangsu province (China) using hyperspectral remote sensing data. The sensitive bands corresponding to SOM, TN, and TC content were retrieved based on the correlation coefficient after Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filtering and four differential transformations of the first derivative (R), first derivative of reciprocal (1/R), second derivative of reciprocal (1/R), and first derivative of logarithm (lgR) by spectral reflectance (R) as R, (1/R), (1/R), (lgR) of soil samples. The estimation models of SOM, TN, and TC by support vector machine (SVM) and back propagation (BP) neural network were applied. The results indicated that the effective bands can be identified by S-G filtering, differential transformation, and the correlation coefficient methods based on the original spectra of soil samples. The estimation accuracy of SVM is better than that of the BP neural network for SOM, TN, and TC in the Yancheng coastal wetland. The estimation model of SOM by SVM based on (1/R) spectra had the highest accuracy, with the determination coefficients (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.93 and 0.23, respectively. However, the estimation models of TN and TC by using the (1/R) differential transformations of spectra were also high, with determination coefficients R-2 of 0.88 and 0.85, RMSE of 0.17 and 0.26, respectively. The results also show that it is possible to estimate the nutrient contents of topsoil from hyperspectral data in sustainable coastal wetlands.

TI  - Fractional Vegetation Cover Estimation of Different Vegetation Types in the Qaidam Basin
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) by using remote sensing images has become feasible. Based on Landsat8-OLI images and field data obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle, we established an empirical model (EM) and a pixel decomposition model (PDM) of FVC in the desert vegetation region, steppe vegetation region, meadow vegetation region and mixed vegetation region (the three vegetation region types) of the Qaidam Basin, and the inversion accuracies of the models were compared. The results show the following: (1) Vegetation classification inversion (VCI) provides a promising approach for FVC estimation. The accuracy of FVC by VCI was obviously better than that achieved using vegetation mixed inversion (VMI); (2) Differences were observed in the FVC estimation between VCI and VMI by the EM in areas with relatively high-density vegetation cover (FVC > 60%). The FVC in some parts of steppe region in the basin was slightly overestimated by VMI of the EM; 3) VCI estimated by the PDM resulted in lower inversion values for extremely low-density vegetation cover (FVC 10%) and higher inversion values for high-density vegetation cover (FVC > 80%). The FVC inversion was underestimated by the PDM in steppe and meadow regions with FVC > 15% in the basin. The application of VCI in different models can provide new ideas for the sustainable study of vegetation in arid regions.

TI  - Potential Bands of Sentinel-2A Satellite for Classification Problems in Precision Agriculture
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMATION AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Various indices are used for assessing vegetation and soil properties in satellite remote sensing applications. Some indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), are capable of simply differentiating crop vitality and water stress. Nowadays, remote sensing capabilities with high spectral, spatial and temporal resolution are available to analyse classification problems in precision agriculture. Many challenges in precision agriculture can be addressed by supervised classification, such as crop type classification, disease and stress (e.g., grass, water and nitrogen) monitoring. Instead of performing classification based on designated indices, this paper explores direct classification using different bands information as features. Land cover classification by using the recently launched Sentinel-2A image is adopted as a case study to validate our method. Four approaches of featured band selection are compared to classify five classes (crop, tree, soil, water and road) with the support vector machines (SVMs) algorithm, where the first approach utilizes traditional empirical indices as features and the latter three approaches adopt specific bands (red, near infrared and short wave infrared) related to indices, specific bands after ranking by mutual information (MI), and full bands of on board sensors as features, respectively. It is shown that a better classification performance can be achieved by directly using the selected bands after MI ranking compared with the one using empirical indices and specific bands related to indices, while the use of all 13 bands can marginally improve the classification accuracy than MI based one. Therefore, it is recommended that this approach can be applied for specific Sentinel-2A image classification problems in precision agriculture.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To analyze epidemiological and clinical characteristics of laboratory confirmed epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis eases.Methods Epidemiological and clinical informations and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and bloat specimens of AMES (wide meningitis / encephalitis syndrome ) cases were collected in the six sentinel hospitals from 2007 to 2016. neisseria meningitides (Nm) species and serogroup identification were detected by the methods of real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Real-time PCR) and bacterial culture, and epidemiological and clinical characteristics of laboratory confirmed epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis cases were analyzed.Results 6 809 AMES cases were reported from 2007 to 2016. Total 4 422 cases were detected, and 90 cases were Nm positive. Through the methods of Real-time PCR, bacterial blood culture and CSF culture, the numbers of Nm positive cases were 90, 2 and 1 respectively. Twenty-two Nm cases were identified from 2007 to 2011 (4 cases were ungrouped), which with the highest incidence in serogroup C cases (17 /18), and one cases was ungroupable Nm. Nm laboratory confirmed cases (68 cases) were increased dramatically and mainly occurred in serogroup B cases (43/67, 64.2%) from 2012 to 2016, with serogroup C cases highly decreased (5/67, 7.5%) and ungroupable Nm cases increased (13/67, 19.4%) meanwhile. Serogroup W135 and X cases were first detected at 2012 and 2014, and serogroup A remaining a low level which only detected one case at 2013. The morbidity of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis was occured in the whole year, and mainly in winter and spring. The ratio of Nm laboratory confirmed cases to AMES cases during November to May (3.5%, 6 7/1 920) was higher than that during June to October (0.9%,23/2 502) (chi(2)=34.45, P<0.001). Most Nm cases were children, students and farmers, and account for 30.0% (27/90), 31.1% (28/90), 18.9% (17/90), respectively. The majority of Nm cases were under 20 years old (60/90, 66.67%), and serogroup C cases (17/22, 77.3%) mainly occurred in over 12 years old population, while serogroup B (24/43, 55.8%) and ungroupable (6/ 14) cases mainly occurred in under 12 years old population. The main clinical symptoms of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis cases were fever (78/90, 86.7%), headache (59/90, 65.6%) and vomiting (51/90, 56.7%). Misdiagnosis rate of admitting diagnosis was up to 87.8% (79/90) for the reason of atypical features in specific symptoms and blood or CSF positive index. The well-healed ratio in correct diagnosed group (7/11) was higher than that in misdiagnosed group (2.5%, 2 / 7 9) (chi(2)=40.61,P<0.001).Conclusion The clinical symptoms of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis cases were atypical, and the diagnosed sensitivity and accuracy would be improved by enhanced molecular biology detection. The predominant epidemic serogroup of Nm switched from serogroup C to B, and the key work was surveaylance of serogroup transition.

AB  - Objective To analyze epidemiological characteristics of acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) cases and the common pathogens infected in Jinan, Shandong Province. Methods Epidemiological and clinical informations and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood specimens of acute meningitis/encephalitis syndrome (AMES) cases (total 3 918 cases) were collected in the six sentinel hospitals from 2013 to 2016. neisseria meningitidis (Nm), streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) and haemophilus influenza (Hi) were detected by the methods of real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Real-time PCR), bacterial culture and latex agglutination. chi(2) Lest was used to compare ABM cases with different feasures, and compare the difference of Nm, Sp and Hi cases in clinical and epidemiological characteristics. Results A total of 479 cases were diagnosed as ABM from 2013 to 2016, 82 cases of which were laboratory confirmed, including 54 cases infected with Nm, 25 cases infected with Sp, and 3 cases infected with Hi. The disease course in different age groups of ABM cases has statistically difference (chi(2)=40.95, P<0.001). The disease course of under 6 (63.6%, 161/253) and 7 to 17 (55.9%, 33/59) years old ABM cases mainly required 14-28 days, and over 18 years old cases mainly required less than 14 days (59.9%, 100/167).

TI  - Monitoring Land Subsidence in Wuhan City (China) using the SBAS-InSAR Method with Radarsat-2 Imagery Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wuhan city is the biggest city in central China and has suffered subsidence problems in recent years because of its rapid urban construction. However, longtime and wide range monitoring of land subsidence is lacking. The causes of subsidence also require further study, such as natural conditions and human activities. We use small baseline subset (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method and high-resolution RADARSAT-2 images acquired between 2015 and 2018 to derive subsidence. The SBAS-InSAR results are validated by 56 leveling benchmarks where two readings of elevation were recorded. Two natural factors (carbonate rock and soft soils) and three human factors (groundwater exploitation, subway excavation and urban construction) are investigated for their relationships with land subsidence. Results show that four major areas of subsidence are detected and the subsidence rate varies from -51.56 to 27.80 millimeters per year (mm/yr) with an average of -0.03 mm/yr. More than 83.81% of persistent scattered (PS) points obtain a standard deviation of less than -6 mm/yr, and the difference between SBAS-InSAR method and leveling data is less than 5 mm/yr. Thus, we conclude that SBAS-InSAR method with Radarsat-2 data is reliable for longtime monitoring of land subsidence covering a large area in Wuhan city. In addition, land subsidence is caused by a combination of natural conditions and human activities. Natural conditions provide a basis for subsidence and make subsidence possible. Human activities are driving factors and make subsidence happen. Moreover, subsidence information could be used in disaster prevention, urban planning, and hydrological modeling.

TI  - Ecotoxicology: A Review of Multi-Toxicity in Marine Bivalve Induced by Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons
T2  - Asian Journal of Ecotoxicology
M3  - Article
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of xenobiotic compounds that distribute widely in marine environment. PAHs exposure induces toxicity in many non-target organisms, marine bivalve being one of the most prominent among these. The marine bivalve is a sentinel and filter-feeding organism with a worldwide distribution and has been applied largely as a model organism in marine ecotoxicology researches. PAHs can be bio-accumulated in the tissues and lead to mortality while sub-lethal doses change in marine bivalve since PAHs can be transferred to higher level of organism through the food chain. This article focuses on the ecotoxicology of PAHs, especially in individual physiological changes, histopathological damages, cellular toxicity and genotoxicity. The most applied testing techniques are also reviewed for the better utilization of marine bivalve in the analysis of toxicity effects as well as the underlined mechanisms related to PAHs contamination in the environment.

TI  - Evaluating the Estimation of Net Radiation Based on MODIS Data and CoLM: A Case Study in the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of net radiation is essential for characterization of the land-atmosphere energy and water exchange processes of the Tibetan Plateau. Two methods are commonly used to estimate the net radiation. Method 1 relies on ground measurements and earth satellite observations, and method 2 relies on the use of a land surface model. Currently, there is no consensus on regarding which of these two methods is the most accurate. In this study, we evaluated net radiation calculated by MODIS land surface temperature products, combined with ground-based incoming shortwave and longwave radiation and albedo measurements, and compare this to performance of the common land model for modeling surface net radiation for the Muztaga site located in the northwest of the Tibetan Plateau at three timescales (half-hourly, hourly, and daily). The results show that the two methods provide similar results, and both methods provide estimates that are notably higher than ground-measured net radiation validations at three different timescales. Estimates of net radiation obtained at half-hourly and hourly timescales closely match the fluctuations in the reference data. However, the daily timescale is too coarse to capture the short-term fluctuations. Thus, this study demonstrates that the shorter timescales are preferred in determining surface net radiation. In addition, compared with method 2, method 1 is more accurate for each of the different timescales.

TI  - A practical method for reducing terrain effect on land surface temperature using random forest regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays a key role in connecting land surface energy and water exchanges with near-surface atmosphere. However, the spatial distribution of LST over mountainous areas is not only strongly affected by the differences in surface thermal properties but also by the differences in thermal or radiative environment induced by the topographic variations, presenting significant terrain effect. This effect greatly hinders researches on surface energy fluxes and soil moisture estimation in these regions. To normalize the terrain effect, a random forest (RF)-based normalization approach was developed in this study and applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over a typical mountain region in the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, China. An LST linking model was first constructed to express the complicated interrelationship between LST and other surface variables, including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index (LAI), surface albedo (ALB), cumulative incident solar radiation (CSR), normalized difference water index (NDWI), surface elevation (ELV), and surface slope (SLP). The estimation results well indicated the good accuracy of the model with the coefficient of determination (R-2) above 0.92 for 90 selected days in 2015. Based on the good LST linking model, the LST normalization was achieved by replacing the topography affected factors (CSR, ELV, and SLP) with reference values for each pixel when keeping the rest status factors as their original values. The normalization result was indirectly validated by the normalization results with the traditional method based on the linear correction upon the regression between surface elevation and LST. The cross-validation clearly indicated the proposed method had an obvious advantage in reducing the topography-induced LST difference based on the average decrease in the temperature range (9.51 K) and the standard deviation (1.09 K) for the images on the 90 selected days over the study area. In contrast, the traditional method was hard to capture the terrain effect only based on the relationship between LST and surface elevation due to the complex interaction between LST and other factors. Overall, the proposed method shows a good application potential for normalizing the terrain effect on LST, and the results will be helpful for the LST-based estimation of surface energy fluxes or soil moisture over mountainous areas.

TI  - Deep learning based multi-temporal crop classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to develop a deep learning based classification framework for remotely sensed time series. The experiment was carried out in Yolo County, California, which has a very diverse irrigated agricultural system dominated by economic crops. For the challenging task of classifying summer crops using Landsat Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series, two types of deep learning models were designed: one is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the other is based on one-dimensional convolutional (Conv1D) layers. Three widely-used classifiers were also tested for comparison, including a gradient boosting machine called XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Although LSTM is widely used for sequential data representation, in this study its accuracy (82.41%) and F1 score (0.67) were the lowest among all the classifiers. Among non-deep-learning classifiers, XGBoost achieved the best result with 84.17% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.69. The highest accuracy (85.54%) and F1 score (0.73) were achieved by the Conv1D-based model, which mainly consists of a stack of Conv1D layers and an inception module. The behavior of the Conv1D-based model was inspected by visualizing the activation on different layers. The model employs EVI time series by examining shapes at various scales in a hierarchical manner. Lower Conv1D layers of the optimized model capture small scale temporal variations, while upper layers focus on overall seasonal patterns. Conv1D layers were used as an embedded multi-level feature extractor in the classification model which automatically extracts features from input time series during training. The automated feature extraction reduces the dependency on manual feature engineering and pre-defined equations of crop growing cycles. This study shows that the Conv1D-based deep learning framework provides an effective and efficient method of time series representation in multi-temporal classification tasks.

TI  - Distribution and Susceptibility Assessment of Collapses and Landslides in the Riparian Zone of the Xiaowan Reservoir
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The southwest alpine gorge region is the major state base of hydropower energy development in China and hence planned many cascading hydropower stations. After the reservoir impoundment, the intense water level fluctuations under the interaction of cascade dams operating and the mountainous flooding, usually cause bank collapse, landslide and debris flow hazards. The Xiaowan reservoir (XWR), for example, as the dragon head' meg reservoir located in the middle mainstream of Lancang River, have resulted in a series of geohazards during its building and operating. In this study, we investigated the number and surface area of collapses and landslides (CLs) occurred in the water level fluctuations zone (WLFZ) of XWR using remote sensing images of Gaofen-1 and Google Earth; evaluated the CLs susceptibility using information value method. The results presented that the total WLFZ area of 87.03 km(2) and 804 CLs masses with a total area of 1.98 km(2) were identified in the riparian zone of XWR. CLs mainly occurred at an elevation of 1190-1240 m, and the CLs density increased with an increase in altitude. The WLFZ with a slope gradient of 25 degrees-45 degrees is the main CLs distribution area that accounts for more than half of the total CLs area. The susceptibility assessment revealed that high and very high susceptibility zones are generally distributed along zones with an elevation of 1210-1240 m, a slope degree of 25 degrees-45 degrees and a slope aspect perpendicular to the direction of Lancang River. Furthermore, these susceptible zones are close in distance to the dam site and tend to be in the riparian zones with the formation lithology of Silurian strata. These results provide a valuable contribution to prevent and control geohazards in the XWR area. Moreover, this study offers a constructive sample of geohazards assessment in the riparian zone of large reservoirs throughout the mountains of southwest China.

TI  - Assimilating Remote Sensing Phenological Information into the WOFOST Model for Rice Growth Simulation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise simulation of crop growth is crucial to yield estimation, agricultural field management, and climate change. Although assimilation of crop model and remote sensing data has been applied in crop growth simulation, few studies have considered optimizing the crop model with respect to phenology. In this study, we assimilated phenological information obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data into the World Food Study (WOFOST) model to improve the accuracy of rice growth simulation at the regional scale. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was implemented to optimize the initial phenology development stage (IDVS) and transplanting date (TD) in the WOFOST model by minimizing the difference between simulated and observed phenology, including heading and maturity date. Assimilating phenology improved the accuracy of the rice growth simulation, with correlation coefficients (R) equal to 0.793, 0822, and 0.813 at three fieldwork dates. The performance of the proposed strategy is comparable with that of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series assimilation strategy, with less computation time. Additionally, the result confirms that the proposed strategy could be applied with different spatial resolution images and the difference of simulated LAI(mean) is less than 0.35 in three experimental areas. This study offers a novel assimilation strategy with regard to the phenology development process, which is efficient and scalable for crop growth simulation.

TI  - The GLASS Land Surface Temperature Product
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the most important geophysical parameters at the earth's surface. Satellite LST products are beneficial for scientific communities with a variety of applications. The Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) LST product has been generated for 1983, 1993, 2003, and 2013 from historical NOAA-7 and NOAA-14 AVHRR data and recent Terra/Aqua MODIS data. The spatial resolution of the instantaneous GLASS LST product is 0.05 degrees for 1983 and 1993 and is 1 km for 2003 and 2013. The algorithm for generating the GLASS LST product is based on a multialgorithm ensemble approach, which combines nine split-window algorithms with good performance in training, testing, and sensitivity analysis. The validation results based on in situ measurements demonstrate that the GLASS-AVHRR LST product has an accuracy of 2.89 K at Barrow site; the GLASS-MODIS LST product has an accuracy of 1.82-2.15 K at six grassland/cropland SURFRAD sites at nighttime, which is a similar accuracy to the official MODIS LST product. Systematic underestimation of LST at Desert Rock, NV (arid shrubland) has been found and has been attributed to uncertainties associated with land surface emissivities and other input datasets. Further intercomparison indicates that the GLASS-MODIS LST product agrees well with the official MODIS LST, with mean bias deviations/root mean square deviations of -1.19 K/1.87 K and 1.89 K/2.27 K for the two granules under examination. Nevertheless, the validation of the GLASS LST product is currently in a preliminary stage, and more in-depth examinations are still needed .

TI  - Monitoring Landscape Dynamics in Central US Grasslands with Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Time Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely monitoring changes in central U.S. grasslands is challenging because these landscapes tend to respond quickly to disturbances and changes in weather. Such dynamic responses influence nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas contributions, habitat availability for wildlife, and other ecosystem processes and services. Traditionally, coarse-resolution satellite data acquired at daily intervals have been used for monitoring. Recently, the harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data increased the temporal frequency of the data. Here we investigated if the increased data frequency provided adequate observations to characterize highly dynamic grassland processes. We evaluated HLS data available for 2016 to (1) determine if data from Sentinel-2 contributed to an improvement in characterizing landscape processes over Landsat-8 data alone, and (2) quantify how observation frequency impacted results. Specifically, we investigated into estimating annual vegetation phenology, detecting burn scars from fire, and modeling within-season wetland hydroperiod and growth of aquatic vegetation. We observed increased sensitivity to the start of the growing season (SOST) with the HLS data. Our estimates of the grassland SOST compared well with ground estimates collected at a phenological camera site. We used the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm to assess if the HLS data improved our detection of burn scars following grassland fires and found that detection was considerably influenced by the seasonal timing of the fires. The grassland burned in early spring recovered too quickly to be detected as change events by CCDC; instead, the spectral characteristics following these fires were incorporated as part of the ongoing time-series models. In contrast, the spectral effects from late-season fires were detected both by Landsat-8 data and HLS data. For wetland-rich areas, we used a modified version of the CCDC algorithm to track within-season dynamics of water and aquatic vegetation. The addition of Sentinel-2 data provided the potential to build full time series models to better distinguish different wetland types, suggesting that the temporal density of data was sufficient for within-season characterization of wetland dynamics. Although the different data frequency, in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, could cause inconsistent model estimation or sensitivity sometimes; overall, the temporal frequency of the HLS data improved our ability to track within-season grassland dynamics and improved results for areas prone to cloud contamination. The results suggest a greater frequency of observations, such as from harmonizing data across all comparable Landsat and Sentinel sensors, is still needed. For our study areas, at least a 3-day revisit interval during the early growing season (weeks 14-17) is required to provide a >50% probability of obtaining weekly clear observations.

TI  - Clear-Sky Longwave Downward Radiation Estimation by Integrating MODIS Data and Ground-Based Measurements
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface energy budget has great influence on earth surface biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes. As one of the components of surface energy budget, the longwave downward radiation (LWDR) is essential to many land applications. In this research, a new LWDR estimation scheme under clear sky by integrating MODIS thermal bands radiance and in situ measurements through the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) has been proposed. The MODIS products and corresponding multi-network in situ LWDR observations under clear skies in 2004 were extracted for model training and cross-validation. The in situ LWDR observations from seven SURFRAD sites in 2008 were used to test the new method. In training phase, the cross-validation RMSE, bias, and R-square of the new method are, respectively, 24.66 W/m(2), -0.446 W/m(2), and 0.88 in the daytime and 23.16 W/m(2), -0.272 W/m(2), and 0.92 in the nighttime. The test results at the seven SURFRAD sites show that the proposed method has good performance, with RMSE, bias, and R-square of 17.15 W/m(2), 0.028 W/m(2), and 0.91 in the daytime and 14.08 W/m(2), -3.609 W/m(2), and 0.94 in the nighttime, respectively. More importantly, the error analysis reveals that the predicted residual errors of the proposed method have a weak correlation with related meteorological parameters at global scale, which reflects the stability and robustness of the new method.

TI  - Improving satellite-based modelling of gross primary production in deciduous broadleaf forests by accounting for seasonality in light use efficiency
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation gross primary production (GPP), the photosynthetic yields by green plants per unit area per unit time, is a key metric of carbon flux in understanding the land-atmosphere interactions and terrestrial carbon cycles. Satellite-based light use efficiency (LUE) models are valuable methods to retrieve large-scale terrestrial GPP using remote sensing data. As studies have reported that maximum light use efficiency, a key parameter that is often assumed to be constant in the LUE models, there is a need to explore the effects of LUE seasonality on GPP simulation and ways for correction. This study proposes a method based on leaf area index to account for LUE seasonality and applies it to four different light use efficiency models (i.e., the MOD17 algorithm, the vegetation photosynthesis model, the radiation partitioning model, and the vegetation index model) for comparisons. Based on 59 site-years flux tower data from deciduous broadleaf forest sites in the United States, the results show that all models could simulate daily GPP time series well and explain more than 85.0% variance of tower-based GPP. There is, however, a tendency to overestimate GPP during the non-growing season but underestimate GPP during the growing season. By applying the correction function, GPP simulation using the LUE models improved in all experiments as indicated by increased correlation coefficients, the index of agreement and decreased root-mean-square errors. Among all models, the radiation partitioning model achieves the highest correlation coefficients between modelled and observed daily GPP likely because it considers the influences of direct and diffuse radiation partitioning on daily canopy photosynthesis. Our study indicates that satellite-based light use efficiency models could be successfully applied for deriving daily vegetation GPP and potentially producing daily routine satellite products, while considering the effects of LUE seasonality on canopy could help improve significantly the simulation accuracy of daily GPP in phenology.

TI  - Biotic and abiotic influences on monthly variation in carbon fluxes in on-year and off-year Moso bamboo forest
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Key messageMonthly variation in gross primary productivity (GPP) between on-years and off-years were different. Main drivers of GPP in on-years were abiotic. In off-years drivers were biotic and abiotic.AbstractUnderstanding biotic (living or once-living organisms) and abiotic (non-living physical and chemical elements) influences on seasonal variation in carbon fluxes in Moso bamboo forest is important for predicting future carbon sequestration under climate change. Although differing physiological and ecological characteristics of Moso bamboo forest between on-years and off-years have been observed, the drivers of annual differences in carbon fluxes remain unknown. In this study, drivers of variation in carbon fluxes were analyzed based on gross primary productivity (GPP) and biotic factors (leaf area and chlorophyll content here, represented by vegetation indicesVIs) and abiotic factors. Results showed that average monthly GPP between on-years and off-years was significantly different from January to June, mainly due to natural variation in biotic factors. The monthly variation in GPP during on-years was mainly influenced by abiotic factors, whereas that in off-years was determined by the combination of biotic and abiotic factors. Monthly variation and differences in GPP between on-years and off-years were well represented by VIs. The GPP was more strongly correlated with VIs in off-years than in on-years, owing to large seasonal variation in canopy chlorophyll content. Hence, GPP estimated from both air temperature and simple ratio was more accurate than that estimated from air temperature alone. Overall, the difference in GPP between on-years and off-years and its underlying mechanisms can be used to accurately estimate carbon fluxes in Moso forest and predict carbon fluxes under future climate warming.

TI  - Community-scale multi-level post-hurricane damage assessment of residential buildings using multi-temporal airborne LiDAR data
T2  - AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Building damage assessment is a critical task following major hurricane events. Use of remotely sensed data to support building damage assessment is a logical choice considering the difficulty of gaining ground access to the impacted areas immediately after hurricane events. However, a remote sensing based damage assessment approach is often only capable of detecting severely damaged buildings. In this study, an airborne LiDAR based approach is proposed to assess multi-level hurricane damage at the community scale. In the proposed approach, building clusters are first extracted using a density-based algorithm. A novel cluster matching algorithm is proposed to robustly match post-event and pre-event building clusters. Multiple features including roof area and volume, roof orientation, and roof shape are computed as building damage indicators. A hierarchical determination process is then employed to identify the extent of damage to each building object. The results of this study suggest that our proposed approach is capable of 1) recognizing building objects, 2) extracting damage features, and 3) characterizing the extent of damage to individual building properties.

TI  - Vertical gradients of water supply and demand in Taihang Mountains, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Taihang Mountains plays a key role in water supply for the North China Plain, even though it has the ecological disadvantages of less water and soil. Research on the vertical characteristics of water supply and demand in Taihang Mountains is beneficial for the sustainable management of the mountain ecosystem. Here, we quantitatively evaluated water provision in the Taihang Mountains using remote sensing data and InVEST model. Water consumption was calculated according to the index of per capita comprehensive water use in different areas. The supply and benefit areas were scientifically demarcated based on water supply to demand ratios at different altitudes. The results showed that, from 2005 to 2014, the average volume of water yield and water consumption were 65.94 x 10(8) and 45.32 x 10(8) m(3), respectively, with a surplus water volume of 20.62 x 10(8) m(3). On the county and catchment scales, there were water shortages in the low-altitude peripheral areas of the Taihang Mountains. However, the water shortage problem was inconspicuous for the overall mountain area, with a water supply to demand ratio of 1.53. Based on the variations in the water supply to demand ratio with respect to altitude, Taihang Mountains could be divided into three vertical bands. Areas with the altitude range of 0-300 m were water recharge areas, which were recommended for development as a complex agroforestry transition zone. Areas with the 300-950 m altitude range were water transfer balance areas, which were suggested as a maintenance zone retaining current levels of water production and consumption. Areas with altitudes greater than 950 m were water spillover areas, which should be designated for water conservation reserves with strict prohibitions regarding destruction.

TI  - New Approaches for Robust and Efficient Detection of Persistent Scatterers in SAR Tomography
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) has the ability to acquire submeter-scale digital elevation model (DEM) and millimeter-scale deformation. A limitation to the application of PSI is that only single persistent scatterers (SPSs) are detected, and pixels with multiple dominant scatterers from different sources are discarded in PSI processing. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography is a promising technique capable of resolving layovers. In this paper, new approaches based on a novel two-tier network aimed at robust and efficient detection of persistent scatterers (PSs) are presented. The calibration of atmospheric phase screen (APS) and the detection of PSs can be jointly implemented in the novel two-tier network. A residue-to-signal ratio (RSR) estimator is proposed to evaluate whether the APS is effectively calibrated and to select reliable PSs with accurate estimation. In the first-tier network, a Delaunay triangulation network is constructed for APS calibration and SPS detection. RSR thresholding is used to adjust the first-tier network by discarding arcs and SPS candidates (SPSCs) with inaccurate estimation, yielding more than one main network in the first-tier network. After network adjustment, we attempt to establish reliable SPS arcs to connect the main isolated networks, and the expanded largest connected network is then formed with more manual structure information subtracted. Furthermore, rather than the weighted least square (WLS) estimator, a network decomposition WLS (ND-WLS) estimator is proposed to accelerate the retrieval of absolute parameters from the expanded largest connected network, which is quite useful for large network inversion. In the second-tier network, the remaining SPSs and all the double PSs (DPSs) are detected and estimated with reference to the expanded largest connected network. Compared with traditional two-tier network-based methods, more PSs can be robustly and efficiently detected by the proposed new approaches. Experiments on interferometric high resolution TerraSAR-X SAR images are given to demonstrate the merits of the new approaches.

TI  - Performance evaluation of GIMMS NDVI based on MODIS NDVI and SPOT NDVI data
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The study evaluated GIMMS NDVI based on MODIS NDVI and SPOT NDVI over the same period from 2000 to 2015. We assessed their absolute values , dynamics , trends and cross-relationships between any two of the NDVIs for the national scale , as well as four separate land use types , i.e. , paddy field , dry land , forest , and grassland. GIMMS NDVI was numerically greater than MODIS NDVI and SPOT NDVI. The three NDVIs exhibited equal capability of capturing monthly phenological variations. During the study period , the three NDVIs showed increasing trends in most re g ions, with GIMMS NDVI showing the smallest increment. Pronounced differences were identified in trends between GIMMS NDVI and MODIS NDVI or SPOT NDVI in the northwest, northeast, south-central China, Tibetan Plateau and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, implying that GIMMS NDVI trends in these re g ions should be interpreted with caution. High correlations existed between the three datasets. MODIS NDVI and SPOT NDVI showed stronger correlations at national scale. The GIMMS NDVI and MODIS NDVI were in highest accordance for dry land, while MODIS NDVI and SPOT NDVI were in higher accordance for the paddy field, forest, and grassland than dry lands.

TI  - Evaluation of Fengyun-3C Soil Moisture Products Using In-Situ Data from the Chinese Automatic Soil Moisture Observation Stations: A Case Study in Henan Province, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) products derived from passive satellite missions are playing an increasingly important role in agricultural applications, especially crop monitoring and disaster warning. Evaluating the dependability of satellite-derived soil moisture products on a large scale is crucial. In this study, we assessed the level 2 (L2) SM product from the Chinese Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) radiometer against in-situ measurements collected from the Chinese Automatic Soil Moisture Observation Stations (CASMOS) during a one-year period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016 across Henan in China. In contrast, we also investigated the skill of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) SM products simultaneously. Four statistical parameters were used to evaluate these products' reliability: mean difference, root-mean-square error (RMSE), unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE), and the correlation coefficient. Our assessment results revealed that the FY-3C L2 SM product generally showed a poor correlation with the in-situ SM data from CASMOS on both temporal and spatial scales. The AMSR2 L3 SM product of JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) algorithm had a similar level of skill as FY-3C in the study area. The SMAP L3 SM product outperformed the FY-3C temporally but showed lower performance in capturing the SM spatial variation. A time-series analysis indicated that the correlations and estimated error varied systematically through the growing periods of the key crops in our study area. FY-3C L2 SM data tended to overestimate soil moisture during May, August, and September when the crops reached maximum vegetation density and tended to underestimate the soil moisture content during the rest of the year. The comparison between the statistical parameters and the ground vegetation water content (VWC) further showed that the FY-3C SM product performed much better under a low VWC condition (<0.3 kg/m(2)) than a high VWC condition (>0.3 kg/m(2)), and the performance generally decreased with increased VWC. To improve the accuracy of the FY-3C SM product, an improved algorithm that can better characterize the variations of the ground VWC should be applied in the future.

TI  - Hierarchical Bayesian Model Based on Robust Fixed Rank Filter for Fusing MODIS SST and AMSR-E SST
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal complete sea surface temperature (SST) dataset with higher accuracy and resolution is desirable for many studies in atmospheric science and climate change. The purpose of this study is to establish the spatiotemporal data fusion model, the Hierarchical Bayesian Model (HBM) based on Robust Fixed Rank Filter (R-FRF), that merge Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST with 4-km resolution and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) SST with 25-km resolution through their spatiotemporal complementarity to obtain fusion SST with complete coverage, high spatial resolution, and fine spatial pattern. First, a bias correction model was applied to correct satellite SST. Second, a spatiotemporal model called R-FRF was established to model potential spatiotemporal process of SST. Third, the R-FRF model was embedded in the hierarchical Bayesian framework, and the corrected MODIS and AMSR-E SST are merged. Finally, the accuracy, spatial pattern and spatial completeness of the fusion SST were assessed. The results of this study are the following: (a) It is necessary to carry out bias correction before data fusion. (b) The R-FRF model could simulate SST spatiotemporal trend well. (c) Fusion SST has similar accuracy and spatial pattern to MODIS SST. Though the accuracy is lower than that of the AMSR-E SST, the fusion SST has more local detail information. The results indicated that fusion SST with higher accuracy, finer spatial pattern, and complete coverage can be obtained through HBM based on R-FRF.

TI  - Failure to identify sentinel lymph nodes for malignant melanoma - Outcome after over 10 years median follow up
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is routinely performed during surgery for malignant melanoma, using double mapping. Still, in some cases, a sentinel lymph node identified pre-operatively by lymphoscintigraphy is not identified during surgery. We hypothesized that disease specific survival would not be significantly impacted by intra-operative lymph node mapping (IOLM) failure.Methods: The patient population study included 1300 malignant melanomas operated on by a single surgical oncologist (H.G.) after sentinel lymph node scintigraphy. Patients were included in the analysis if intra-operative lymph node (IOLM) mapping failed.Results: Among 1300 patients who underwent surgery for malignant melanoma during the study period and after median follow up of >10 years, 33/36 lymphatic drainage basins with failed sentinel node identification were free of disease. Disease specific survival for the entire group of 33 patients with IOLM failure was 91.0%, which is comparable to previously published disease specific survival for all melanoma patients.Conclusion: We conclude that failure to identify a pre-operatively marked sentinel lymph node by an experienced melanoma surgeon has, generally, no impact on disease specific survival, as demonstrated in this review of a series of surgical melanoma patients.

TI  - A Framework for Rice Heavy Metal Stress Monitoring Based on Phenological Phase Space and Temporal Profile Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies make it possible to use remote sensing techniques to monitor heavy metal stress of rice synchronously and continuously. However, most studies mainly focus on the analysis of rice's visual symptoms and physiological functions rather than temporal information during the growth period, which may reflect significant changes of rice under heavy metal stress. In this paper, an enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model was used to generate synthetic Landsat time series. A normalized difference water index and an enhanced vegetation index were employed to build phenological phase space. Then, the ratio of the rice growth rate fluctuation (GRFI Ratio) was constructed for discriminating the different heavy metal stress levels on rice. Results suggested that the trajectories of rice growth in phenological phase space can depict the similarities and differences of rice growth under different heavy metal stress levels. The most common phenological parameters in the phase space cannot accurately discriminate the heavy metal stress level. However, the GRFI Ratio that we proposed outperformed in discriminating different levels of heavy metal stress. This study suggests that this framework of detecting the heavy metal pollution in paddy filed based on phenological phase space and temporal profile analysis is promising.

TI  - Interannual variation of the South China Sea circulation during winter: intensified in the southern basin
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface geostrophic current derived from altimetry remote sensing data, and current profiles observed from in-situ Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) mooring in the northern South China Sea (NSCS) and southern South China Sea (SSCS) are utilized to study the kinetic and energetic interannual variability of the circulation in the South China Sea (SCS) during winter. Results reveal a more significant interannual variation of the circulation and water mass properties in the SSCS than that in the NSCS. Composite ananlysis shows a significantly reduced western boundary current (WBC) and a closed cyclonic eddy in the SSCS at the mature phase of El Nino event, but a strong WBC and an unclosed cyclonic circulation in winter at normal or La Nina years. The SST is warmer while the subsurface water is colder and fresher in the mature phase of El Nino event than that in the normal or La Nina years in the SSCS. Numerical experiments and energy analysis suggest that both local and remote wind stress change are important for the interannual variation in the SSCS, remote wind forcing and Kuroshio intrusion affect the circulation and water mass properties in the SSCS through WBC advection.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive molecular epidemiological study using next-generation sequencing technology was conducted on 333 rotavirus A (RVA)-positive specimens collected from six sentinel hospitals across Japan over three consecutive seasons (2012-2014). The majority of the RVA isolates were grouped into five genotype constellations: Wa-like G1P[8], DS-1-like G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8] and G9P[8]. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the distribution of strains varied by geographical locations and epidemic seasons. The VP7 genes of different G types were estimated to evolve at 7.26 x 10(-4) - 1.04 x 10(-3) nucleotide substitutions per site per year. The Bayesian time-scaled tree of VP7 showed that the time to the most recent common ancestor of epidemic strains within a region was 1-3 years, whereas that of the epidemic strains across the country was 2-6 years. This study provided, for the first time, the timeframe during which an epidemic strain spread locally and within the country and baseline information needed to predict how rapidly RVAs spread.

TI  - Bacterial sexually transmitted infections in France: recent trends and patients' characteristics in 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Diagnoses of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STI) have been increasing in France since their resurgence in the late 1990s. This article presents recent epidemiological trends until 2016 and the patients' characteristics. STI surveillance relies on sentinel networks: a clinician-based network ResIST (clinical, biological and behavioural data for early syphilis and gonorrhoea), the lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) network (clinical, biological and behavioural data for rectal LGV, and the laboratory networks Renachla and Renago (demographic and biological data for chlamydial infections and gonorrhoea, respectively). Here we describe trends between 2014 and 2016, using data from diagnostic centres which participated regularly during the study period. The number of early syphilis, gonorrhoea and LGV diagnoses increased between 2014 and 2016, particularly in men who have sex with men. An increase in syphilis and gonorrhoea cases was also observed in heterosexuals. Nevertheless, we observed a drop in 2016 for syphilis and chlamydial infections after two decades of increases. Under-reporting and shortage of benzathine penicillin in 2016 may explain this latest evolution. Regular screening of patients and partners, followed by prompt treatment, remains essential to interrupt STI transmission in a context where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention has expanded towards biomedical prophylaxis.

TI  - Malaria in Eritrean migrants newly arrived in seven European countries, 2011 to 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global migration has resulted in a large number of asylum applications in Europe. In 2014, clusters of Plasmodium vivax cases were reported among newly arrived Eritreans. This study aimed to assess malaria among Eritrean migrants in Europe from 2011 to 2016. We reviewed European migration numbers and malaria surveillance data for seven countries (Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) which received 44,050 (94.3%) of 46,730 Eritreans seeking asylum in Europe in 2014. The overall number of malaria cases, predominantly P. vivax, increased significantly in 2014 compared to previous years, with the largest increases in Germany (44 P. vivax cases in 2013 vs 294 in 2014, p < 0.001) and Sweden (18 in 2013 vs 205 in 2014, p < 0.001). Overall, malaria incidence in Eritreans increased from 1-5 to 25 cases per 1,000, and was highest in male teenagers (50 cases/1,000). In conclusion, an exceptional increase of malaria cases occurred in Europe in 2014 and 2015, due to rising numbers of Eritreans with high incidence of P. vivax arriving in Europe. Our results demonstrate potential for rapid changes in imported malaria patterns, highlighting the need for improved awareness, surveillance efforts and timely healthcare in migrants.

TI  - Soil erosion from urbanization processes in the Sonoran Desert, Arizona, USA
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cattle stock ponds on the fringe of metropolitan Phoenix, USA, experienced a wide range of land-use changes over the period from 1989 to 2009. This research measures soil erosion from watersheds of different rock types, variable relief, and land uses. Monitoring sediment accumulation behind 18 earthen berms at each major land-use transition enabled calculations of soil erosion rates. Compared with the first decade of study with more precipitation and cattle grazing, accelerated urbanization in the drier second decade increased soil erosion from wildfires by up to 4.2x, from exposure of bare ground due to building construction by up to 3.4x, and from bare ground exposure due to road and pipeline construction by up to 3.1x overgrazing alone. Stock pond watersheds underlain by granite experienced statistically significant higher erosion rates compared with watersheds underlain by metamorphic, basalt, and other rock types. Global sediment yield data for warm desert (BWh Koppen-Geiger) sites reveal that our data plot consistently with other grazed study areas with a tendency for higher area-specific sediment yields in smaller drainage areas. These sediment yield data, however, do not support previously published generalizations of anomalously high or low sediment yields from warm desert settings. Desert urbanization processes accelerate soil erosion, resulting in the need for regulatory agencies to impose new erosion mitigation strategies.

TI  - Cloud feedbacks in extratropical cyclones: insight from long-term satellite data and high-resolution global simulations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A negative extratropical shortwave cloud feedback driven by changes in cloud optical depth is a feature of global climate models (GCMs). A robust positive trend in observed liquid water path (LWP) over the last two decades across the warming Southern Ocean supports the negative shortwave cloud feedback predicted by GCMs. This feature has been proposed to be due to transitions from ice to liquid with warming. To gain insight into the shortwave cloud feedback we examine extratropical cyclone variability and the response of extratropical cyclones to transient warming in GCM simulations. Multi-Sensor Advanced Climatology Liquid Water Path (MAC-LWP) microwave observations of cyclone properties from the period 1992-2015 are contrasted with GCM simulations, with horizontal resolutions ranging from 7 km to hundreds of kilometers. We find that inter-cyclone variability in LWP in both observations and models is strongly driven by the moisture flux along the cyclone's warm conveyor belt (WCB). Stronger WCB moisture flux enhances the LWP within cyclones. This relation-ship is replicated in GCMs, although its strength varies substantially across models. It is found that more than 80% of the enhancement in Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropical cyclone LWP in GCMs in response to a transient 4K warming can be predicted based on the relationship between the WCB moisture flux and cyclone LWP in the historical climate and their change in moisture flux between the historical and warmed climates. Further, it is found that that the robust trend in cyclone LWP over the Southern Ocean in observations and GCMs is consistent with changes in the moisture flux. We propose two cloud feedbacks acting within extratropical cyclones: a negative feedback driven by Clausius-Clapeyron increasing water vapor path (WVP), which enhances the amount of water vapor available to be fluxed into the cyclone, and a feedback moderated by changes in the life cycle and vorticity of cyclones under warming, which changes the rate at which existing moisture is imported into the cyclone. Both terms contribute to increasing LWP within the cyclone. While changes in moisture flux predict cyclone LWP trends in the current climate and the majority of changes in LWP in transient warming simulations, a portion of the LWP increase in response to climate change that is unexplained by increasing moisture fluxes may be due to phase transitions. The variability in LWP within cyclone composites is examined to understand what cyclonic regimes the mixed-phase cloud feedback is relevant to. At a fixed WCB moisture flux cyclone LWP increases with increasing sea surface temperature (SST) in the half of the composite poleward of the low and decreases in the half equatorward of the low in both GCMs and observations. Cloud-top phase partitioning observed by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) indicates that phase transitions may be driving increases in LWP in the poleward half of cyclones.

TI  - TROPOMI enables high resolution SO<sub>2</sub> flux observations from Mt. Etna, Italy, and beyond
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The newly launched imaging spectrometer TROPOMI onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite provides atmospheric column measurements of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and other gases with a pixel resolution of 3.5 x 7 km(2). This permits mapping emission plumes from a vast number of natural and anthropogenic emitters with unprecedented sensitivity, revealing sources which were previously undetectable from space. Novel analysis using back-trajectory modelling of satellite-based SO2 columns allows calculation of SO2 flux time series, which would be of great utility and scientific interest if applied globally. Volcanic SO2 emission time series reflect magma dynamics and are used for risk assessment and calculation of the global volcanic CO2 gas flux. TROPOMI data make this flux time series reconstruction approach possible with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, but these new data must be tested and validated against ground-based observations. Mt. Etna (Italy) emits SO2 with fluxes ranging typically between 500 and 5000 t/day, measured automatically by the largest network of scanning UV spectrometers in the world, providing the ideal test-bed for this validation. A comparison of three SO2 flux datasets, TROPOMI (one month), ground-network (one month), and ground-traverse (two days) shows acceptable to excellent agreement for most days. The result demonstrates that reliable, nearly real-time, high temporal resolution SO2 flux time series from TROPOMI measurements are possible for Etna and, by extension, other volcanic and anthropogenic sources globally. This suggests that global automated real-time measurements of large numbers of degassing volcanoes world-wide are now possible, revolutionizing the quantity and quality of magmatic degassing data available and insights into volcanic processes to the volcanological community.

TI  - Comparative analysis of MODIS, MISR, and AERONET climatology over the Middle East and North Africa
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparative analysis of Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) aerosol optical depth (AOD) products is performed over seven AERONET stations located in the Middle East and North Africa for the period of 2000-2015. Sites are categorized into dust, biomass burning, and mixed aerosol conditions. MISR and MODIS AOD agree during high-dust seasons but MODIS tends to underestimate AOD during low-dust seasons. Over dust-dominated sites, MODIS/Terra AODs indicate a negative trend over time, while MODIS/Aqua, MISR, and AERONET depict a positive trend. A deviation between MODIS/Aqua and MODIS/Terra was observed regardless of the geographic location and data sampling. The performance of MODIS is similar over the entire region with similar to 64% of AOD within the Delta tau = +/- 0.05 +/- 0.15 tau(AERO) confidence range. MISR AOD retrievals fall within 84% of the same confidence range for all sites examined here. Both MISR and MODIS capture aerosol climatology; however few cases were observed where one of the two sensors better captures the climatology over a certain location or AOD range than the other sensor. AERONET Level 2.0 version 3, MODIS Collection 6.1, and MISR V23 data have been used in analyzing the results presented in this study.

TI  - Increasing human papillomavirus vaccination at the recommended age
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the United States, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been recommended for females since 2006 and for males since 2011. However, national HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents is lower than national targets, and many adolescents initiate HPV vaccination later than the recommended age. We analyzed records for >2 million persons born during 1996-2000 who initiated HPV vaccination at age 9 through 16 years from six Immunization Information Systems Sentinel Sites, displayed the distribution of HPV vaccination initiation age, and calculated HPV vaccination coverage. More adolescents in recent cohorts initiated HPV vaccination at the recommended age of 11-12 years, the majority of whom received another recommended vaccine on the same day. However, >40% of all vaccinated adolescents did not initiate the HPV vaccination until age 13 years or later. Continued efforts are needed to increase HPV vaccination initiation at the recommended age. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Accommodation space indicates dune development potential along an urbanized and frequently nourished coastline
T2  - EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With densely populated areas well below mean sea level, the Netherlands relies heavily on its dunes to ensure coastal safety. About half of the sandy coastline, however, is subject to structural marine erosion and requires frequent sand nourishment as a counteractive measure. A key component of present-day coastal safety policy is creating favorable conditions for natural dune development. These conditions essentially involve (1) a steady supply of wind-blown sand towards (2) a wide accommodation space where sand can accumulate and dunes are sheltered from frequent storm surge impacts. This paper examines to what extent an experimental mega-scale beach nourishment (termed Zandmotor in Dutch) has contributed to creating accommodation space favorable for dune development. Using publicly available airborne tidal - data and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, favorable accommodation space is identified by comparing recent changes in coastal morphology against dune vegetation-cover dynamics With a focus on European marram grass (Ammophila arenaria) as the most prominent dune-building species, this paper demonstrates that the Zandmotor supports an especially high potential for incipient (embryo) dunes to develop as most of its favorable accommodation space is located on the beach. However, considering the conditions required for successful marram grass establishment as well as persistent anthropogenic disturbances arising from recreation and nature management practices, it is not likely that dune development along this urbanized coastline reaches its full potential.

TI  - Estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness using data routinely available in electronic primary care records
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To support timely, annual estimation of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), we explored the use of automated data extraction from general practice records to estimate VE over four consecutive southern hemisphere influenza seasons.Methods: A software tool installed at 130 practices in Western Australia identified all outpatients tested for influenza by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) during annual influenza seasons occurring 2012-2015. Laboratory test results were collated with any existing record of influenza vaccine administered in the same year; limited patient demographic and clinical information was also collected. A case test-negative control analysis compared the odds of seasonal influenza vaccination between patients positive or negative for influenza by PCR with VE =1 - the odds ratio.Results: A total of 7270 influenza PCR test results were identified of which 1907 (26.2%) were positive; 9.4% of patients with a positive result had received contemporaneous influenza vaccination >= 14 days prior to specimen collection, compared to 17.9% of those with a negative result. Overall VE was 52% (95% CI, 43-60%); annual VE estimates ranged from 46% (95% CI, 22-63%) in 2012 to 60% (95% CI, 41-73%) in 2014.Conclusion: Electronic records routinely maintained by general practice provide a promising opportunity for estimating annual influenza VE in a timely and resource-efficient manner.

TI  - Soil organic carbon mapping using remote sensing techniques and multivariate regression model
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important aspect of soil quality and plays an imperative role in soil productivity in the agriculture ecosystems. The present study was applied to estimate the SOC stock using space-borne satellite data (Landsat 4-5 Thematic Mapper [TM]) and ground verification in the Medinipur Block, Paschim Medinipur District and West Bengal in India. In total, 50 soil samples were collected randomly from the region according to field surveys using a hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) unit to estimate the surface SOC concentrations in the laboratory. Bare soil index (BSI) and normalized difference vegetation ndex (NDVI) were explored from TM data. The satellite data-derived indices were used to estimate spatial distribution of SOC using multivariate regression model. The regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between SOC and spectral indices (NDVI and BSI) and compared the observed SOC (field measure) to predict SOC (estimated from satellite images). Goodness fit test was performed to determine the significance of the relationship between observed and predicted SOC at p <= 0.05 level. The results of regression analysis between observed SOC and NDVI values showed significant relationship (R-2 = 0.54; p < 0.0075). A significant statistical relationship (r = -0.72) was also observed between SOC and BSI. Finally, our model showed nearly 71% of the variance of SOC distribution could be explained by SOC and NDVI values. The information from this study has advanced our understanding of the ongoing ecological development that affects SOC dissemination and might be valuable for effective soil management.

TI  - Sensing Heavy Precipitation With GNSS Polarimetric Radio Occultations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents, for the first time ever, occulting signals of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) acquired at two polarizations from a Low Earth Orbiter, and it shows that they sense heavy precipitation. The data sets are obtained from early stages of the Radio Occultation and Heavy Precipitation experiment aboard the PAZ satellite, launched in February 2018 and activated in May 2018. Preliminary calibration algorithms are applied to remove other systematic effects, and the resulting vertical profiles of polarimetric phase shift observations are compared to precipitation information from other missions. The analysis of the data shows consistency between Radio Occultation and Heavy Precipitation experiment aboard the PAZ satellite polarimetric phase shift measurements and presence of hydrometeors, with strong signatures from heavy precipitation. The polarimetric measurements also capture vertical features consistent with the vertical structures of precipitation.Plain Language Summary When the satellites of the navigation systems (like GPS) set below the horizon, their signals can be used to measure temperature, pressure, and humidity of the atmosphere at different altitudes (an observation called radio occultation). For the first time, a satellite has collected these setting GPS signals at two polarizations, that is, separating two different orientations of the electromagnetic field (horizontal and vertical with respect to the receiving antenna). It is the Radio Occultation and Heavy Precipitation experiment aboard PAZ satellite, launched in February 2018 and activated in May 2018. Previous theoretical studies have shown that intense rain crossing the path of the GPS signals would introduce a delay of the horizontal component with respect to the vertical one. This study shows the analysis of the polarimetric delays, and it confirms that they are related to the presence of rain, in particular intense precipitation. The measurement of polarimetric delays at different altitudes is consistent with the presence of rain structures at different heights. No other technique captures profiles of both thermodynamics and hydrometeor content in intense rain phenomena, and therefore, the Radio Occultation and Heavy Precipitation experiment aboard the PAZ satellite data could provide a new tool to understand extreme precipitation, with potential to improve its difficult prediction.

TI  - High-Resolution Mapping of Nitrogen Dioxide With TROPOMI: First Results and Validation Over the Canadian Oil Sands
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), on-board the Sentinel-5 Precurser satellite, is a nadir-viewing spectrometer measuring reflected sunlight in the ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared. From these spectra several important air quality and climate-related atmospheric constituents are retrieved, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at unprecedented spatial resolution from a satellite platform. We present the first retrievals of TROPOMI NO2 over the Canadian Oil Sands, contrasting them with observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument satellite instrument, and demonstrate TROPOMI's ability to resolve individual plumes and highlight its potential for deriving emissions from individual mining facilities. Further, the first TROPOMI NO2 validation is presented, consisting of aircraft and surface in situ NO2 observations, and ground-based remote-sensing measurements between March and May 2018. Our comparisons show that the TROPOMI NO2 vertical column densities are highly correlated with the aircraft and surface in situ NO2 observations, and the ground-based remote-sensing measurements with a low bias (15-30 %); this bias can be reduced by improved air mass factors.Plain Language Summary Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a pollutant that is linked to respiratory health issues and has negative environmental impacts such as soil and water acidification. Near the surface the most significant sources of NO2 are fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning. With a recently launched satellite instrument (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument [TROPOMI]), NO2 can be measured with an unprecedented combination of accuracy, spatial coverage, and resolution. This work presents the first TROPOMI NO2 measurements near the Canadian Oil Sands and shows that these measurements have an outstanding ability to detect NO2 on a very high horizontal resolution that is unprecedented for satellite NO2 observations. Further, these satellite measurements are in excellent agreement with aircraft and ground-based measurements.

TI  - Characterizing Vertical particle Structure of precipitating Cloud System From Multiplatform Measurements of A-Train Constellation
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiplatform measurements of the active and passive instruments from A-Train were employed to observationally characterize particle structures over a spectrum of precipitating clouds from shallow cumulus to deep convection. Radar reflectivity profiles were composited as a function of temperature, with particle type superimposed to depict how storm regimes exert different particle habit structures. The deep convective system was found to have a relatively simple structure, which is dominated by randomly oriented ice, followed by snow and rain at the bottom, whereas the shallow cold system consisting high cloud tops with precipitation far below contains various hydrometeors, such as ice plates and drizzles. The deep convective system was further analyzed to demonstrate how the vertical microphysical structure tends to systematically transition from nonprecipitating to precipitating characteristics with differing cloud top buoyancies indicative of the "life stage" of convective development. The analysis offers a link between dynamical characteristics of convective systems and their inner hydrometeors structures.Plain Language Summary Clouds are composed of liquid water droplets and condensed ice crystals or a mixture of both. Compared to liquid droplets, ice crystals are generally larger in size and, even with the same mass, allow more sunlight to reach the Earth's surface. Ice crystals also grow faster and end up falling as snow or melted rain, shortening the lifetime of a cloud. The phase states of these liquid and ice particles do not only persist over the lifetime of the cloud, but thermodynamic transitions between them often occur. Although these cloud-precipitation and thermodynamic phase processes occur in the vertical direction of the atmosphere, the vertical internal phase compositions of cloud-precipitation systems are still an open question in the atmospheric sciences, resulting in uncertainties in the surface temperature estimations in warmed atmospheres. In our study, we integrated independent measurements from space, analyzed various precipitating clouds from shallow to towering convective systems, and revealed variabilities in the vertical particle constituents among the precipitating cloud regimes. Studying the "static" measurement in a more "dynamical" context, we also show the observational insight of how the vertical structure of deep convective systems changes from "cloud mode" to "precipitation mode" during the course of their development.

TI  - Forecasting dryland vegetation condition months in advance through satellite data assimilation
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dryland ecosystems are characterised by rainfall variability and strong vegetation response to changes in water availability over a range of timescales. Forecasting dryland vegetation condition can be of great value in planning agricultural decisions, drought relief, land management and fire preparedness. At monthly to seasonal time scales, knowledge of water stored in the system contributes more to predictability than knowledge of the climate system state. However, realising forecast skill requires knowledge of the vertical distribution of moisture below the surface and the capacity of the vegetation to access this moisture. Here, we demonstrate that contrasting satellite observations of water presence over different vertical domains can be assimilated into an eco-hydrological model and combined with vegetation observations to infer an apparent vegetation-accessible water storage (hereafter called accessible storage). Provided this variable is considered explicitly, skilful forecasts of vegetation condition are achievable several months in advance for most of the world's drylands.

TI  - Synergetic efficiency of Lidar and WorldView-2 for 3D urban cartography in Northeast Mexico
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional urban cartography is needed for city changes' assessment. The variety of studies using 3D calculations of urban elements grows each year. Building and vegetation volumes are necessary to assess and understand spatio-temporal urban changeable environments. However, there are technical questions as to which method can improve 3D urban cartographic accuracy. The innovative part of this current study is the creation of a six-band hybrid obtained from LIDAR and WorldView2 synergy. Two different enhancement algorithms demonstrated the most important spectral features for the urban development and vegetation classes. Results indicated an improvement in accuracy by up to 21.3%, according to the Kappa coefficient. Both infra-red band and intensity band were the most significant, according to the principal components analysis. The synergy delimited classes and polygons, as well as the direct display of information regarding heights of elements and improving the extraction of roads, buildings and vegetation classes.

TI  - Subgrid variations of the cloud water and droplet number concentration over the tropical ocean: satellite observations and implications for warm rain simulations in climate models
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the challenges in representing warm rain processes in global climate models (GCMs) is related to the representation of the subgrid variability of cloud properties, such as cloud water and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), and the effect thereof on individual precipitation processes such as autoconversion. This effect is conventionally treated by multiplying the resolved-scale warm rain process rates by an enhancement factor (E-q) which is derived from integrating over an assumed subgrid cloud water distribution. The assumed subgrid cloud distribution remains highly uncertain. In this study, we derive the subgrid variations of liquid-phase cloud properties over the tropical ocean using the satellite remote sensing products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and investigate the corresponding enhancement factors for the GCM parameterization of autoconversion rate. We find that the conventional approach of using only subgrid variability of cloud water is insufficient and that the subgrid variability of CDNC, as well as the correlation between the two, is also important for correctly simulating the autoconversion process in GCMs. Using the MODIS data which have near-global data coverage, we find that Eq shows a strong dependence on cloud regimes due to the fact that the subgrid variability of cloud water and CDNC is regime dependent. Our analysis shows a significant increase of Eq from the stratocumulus (Sc) to cumulus (Cu) regions. Furthermore, the enhancement factor E-N due to the subgrid variation of CDNC is derived from satellite observation for the first time, and results reveal several regions downwind of biomass burning aerosols (e. g., Gulf of Guinea, east coast of South Africa), air pollution (i. e., East China Sea), and active volcanos (e. g., Kilauea, Hawaii, and Ambae, Vanuatu), where the E-N is comparable to or even larger than E-q, suggesting an important role of aerosol in influencing the EN. MODIS observations suggest that the subgrid variations of cloud liquid water path (LWP) and CDNC are generally positively correlated. As a result, the combined enhancement factor, including the effect of LWP and CDNC correlation, is significantly smaller than the simple product of E-q center dot E-N. Given the importance of warm rain processes in understanding the Earth's system dynamics and water cycle, we conclude that more observational studies are needed to provide a better constraint on the warm rain processes in GCMs.

TI  - Variations of Lake Ice Phenology on the Tibetan Plateau From 2001 to 2017 Based on MODIS Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice is a robust indicator of climate change. The availability of information contained in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer daily snow products from 2000 to 2017 could be greatly improved after cloud removal by gap filling. Thresholds based on open water pixel numbers are used to extract the freezeup start and breakup end dates for 58 lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP); 18 lakes are also selected to extract the freezeup end and breakup start dates. The lake ice durations are further calculated based on freezeup and breakup dates. Lakes on the TP begin to freezeup in late October and all the lakes start the ice cover period in mid-January of the following year. In late March, some lakes begin to break up, and all the lakes end the ice cover period in early July. Generally, the lakes in the northern Inner-TP have earlier freezeup dates and later breakup dates (i.e., longer ice cover durations) than those in the southern Inner-TP. Over 17years, the mean ice cover duration of 58 lakes is 157.78days, 18 (31%) lakes have a mean extending rate of 1.11day/year, and 40 (69%) lakes have a mean shortening rate of 0.80day/year. Geographical location and climate conditions determine the spatial heterogeneity of the lake ice phenology, especially the ones of breakup dates, while the physico-chemical characteristics mainly affect the freezeup dates of the lake ice in this study. Ice cover duration is affected by both climatic and lake specific physico-chemical factors, which can reflect the climatic and environmental change for lakes on the TP.

TI  - 11 Years of Rayleigh Lidar Observations of Gravity Wave Activity Above the Southern Tip of South America
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Gravity wave (GW) activity is analyzed using temperature (T) data retrieved from a Rayleigh light detection and ranging (lidar) at Rio Gallegos, Argentina (51.6 degrees S, 69.3 degrees W). GW characteristics are derived from 302 nights of observations providing more than 1,018hr of high-resolution lidar data between 20- and 56-km height from August 2005 to December 2015. T measurements are performed by a Differential Absorption Lidar instrument. This lidar was the southernmost outside Antarctica until the end of 2017. Rio Gallegos is an exceptional place to observe large amplitude GW. Every lidar measurement is classified according to its relative position to the polar vortex. The lidar measurements are compared with collocated Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry and Global Positioning System-Radio Occultation data. The different instruments show different windows of the GW spectrum, providing complementary observations. In general, the geometric mean of the specific GW potential energy (PE) is larger during winter and spring than during summer and autumn. The largest geometric mean of PE is found inside the vortex and decreases monotonically at its edge, outside it and when there is no vortex. The same behavior is observed with satellite data. On average, it can be seen that lidar observations provide larger PE values than limb sounding measurements. From a Morlet continuous wavelet transform analysis, three distinct modes are captured from Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry and from Global Positioning System-Radio Occultation data at the upper and lower stratosphere, respectively. In particular, a systematic 3.5- to 4-year oscillation, possibly related to El Nino-Southern Oscillation is observed.

TI  - Downscaling Satellite Precipitation Estimates With Multiple Linear Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, and Spline Interpolation Techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite precipitation estimates (SPEs) have been widely used in various applications. However, when applied to small basins and regions, the spatial resolution of SPEs is too coarse. In this study, we present three downscaling algorithms based upon the relationships between SPEs and cloud optical and microphysical properties in northeast Austria. Different downscaling techniques, namely, multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and spline interpolation, were adopted for the downscaling of Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation data. In this respect, linear and nonlinear relationship among IMERG data and different cloud variables, such as cloud effective radius, cloud optical thickness, and cloud water path, was evaluated. Downscaled SPEs, as well as the original IMERG product, were subsequently validated using 54 rain gauges at a daily timescale. According to the results, all downscaled products were more accurate than the original IMERG data. Furthermore, all downscaling techniques captured the spatial patterns of precipitation reasonably well with more detailed information when compared with the original IMERG precipitation. However, the spline interpolation slightly outperformed the other techniques, followed by multiple linear regression and artificial neural network, respectively. Moreover, the proposed methods, which consistently showed increased correlation (e.g., from 0.30 to 0.56 for spline interpolation) and reduced mean absolute error and root-mean-square error (e.g., from 10.14 to 6.55mm and 13.5 to 8.76mm, respectively) for average of all events, can more accurately produce downscaled precipitation data.

TI  - Retreating rate of Chaturangi glacier, Garhwal Himalaya, India derived from kinematic GPS survey and satellite data
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The regular monitoring of glaciers is important to determine their retreating rate and mass balance for overall glacier health. Chaturangi glacier, a major inactive tributary of the Gangotri glacier system was selected for the present study due to its dynamic nature and also because there are no previous records of its retreating rates. In order to reconstruct past retreating rates, total area loss, volume change and shift in snout position were measured through multi-temporal satellite data from 1989 to 2016 and kinematic GPS survey from 2015 to 2016. The results obtained from satellite data indicate that in the last 27 years Chaturangi glacier snout has retreated 1172.57 +/- 38.3 m (average = 45.07 +/- 4.31 m/year) with a total area and volume loss of 0.626 +/- 0.001 sq. km and 0.139 km(3) respectively. The field measurements through differential global positioning system survey revealed that the annual retreating rate was 22.84 +/- 0.05 m/year. The large variations in results derived from both the methods are probably because of higher difference in their accuracy. Nevertheless, the results derived from both the methods are in agreement that Chaturangi glacier is retreating at a considerable rate.

TI  - Minimizing aerosol effects on the OMI tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> retrieval - An improved use of the 477 nm O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>2</sub> band and an estimation of the aerosol correction uncertainty
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Global mapping of satellite tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD), a key gas in air quality monitoring, requires accurate retrievals over complex urban and industrialized areas and under any atmospheric conditions. The high abundance of aerosol particles in regions dominated by anthropogenic fossil fuel combustion, e.g. megacities, and/or biomass-burning episodes, affects the space-borne spectral measurement. Minimizing the tropospheric NO2 VCD biases caused by aerosol scattering and absorption effects is one of the main retrieval challenges from air quality satellite instruments. In this study, the reference Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) DOMINO-v2 product was reprocessed over cloud-free scenes, by applying new aerosol correction parameters retrieved from the 477 nm O-2-O-2 band, over eastern China and South America for 2 years (2006-2007). These new parameters are based on two different and separate algorithms developed during the last 2 years in view of an improved use of the OMI 477 nm O-2-O-2 band:1. the updated OMCLDO2 algorithm, which derives improved effective cloud parameters,2. the aerosol neural network (NN), which retrieves explicit aerosol parameters by assuming a more physical aerosol model.The OMI aerosol NN is a step ahead of OMCLDO2 because it primarily estimates an explicit aerosol layer height (ALH), and secondly an aerosol optical thickness tau for cloud-free observations. Overall, it was found that all the considered aerosol correction parameters reduce the biases identified in DOMINO-v2 over scenes in China with high aerosol abundance dominated by fine scattering and weakly absorbing particles, e.g. from [-20%: -40%] to [0%: 20%] in summertime. The use of the retrieved OMI aerosol parameters leads in general to a more explicit aerosol correction and higher tropospheric NO2 VCD values, in the range of [0%: 40%], than from the implicit correction with the updated OMCLDO2. This number overall represents an estimation of the aerosol correction strategy uncertainty nowadays for tropospheric NO2 VCD retrieval from space-borne visible measurements. The explicit aerosol correction theoretically includes a more realistic consideration of aerosol multiple scattering and absorption effects, especially over scenes dominated by strongly absorbing particles, where the correction based on OMCLDO2 seems to remain insufficient. However, the use of ALH and tau from the OMI NN aerosol algorithm is not a straightforward operation and future studies are required to identify the optimal methodology. For that purpose, several elements are recommended in this paper. Overall, we demonstrate the possibility of applying a more explicit aerosol correction by considering aerosol parameters directly derived from the 477 nm O-2-O-2 spectral band, measured by the same satellite instrument. Such an approach can, in theory, easily be transposed to the new-generation of space-borne instruments (e.g. TROPOMI on board Sentinel-5 Precursor), enabling a fast reprocessing of tropospheric NO2 data over cloud-free scenes (cloudy pixels need to be filtered out), as well as for other trace gas retrievals (e.g. SO2, HCHO).

TI  - [Endoscopic Diagnosis of Aortoesophageal Fistula Not Presenting Hematemesis].
T2  - The Korean journal of gastroenterology = Taehan Sohwagi Hakhoe chi
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) is an extremely rare but lethal cause of massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Characteristic symptoms are mid-thoracic pain, sentinel minor hemorrhage, and massive hemorrhage after a symptom-free interval. Prompt diagnosis and immediate treatments are necessary to reduce mortality. However, AEF is difficult to diagnose because it is uncommon and often leads to death with massive bleeding before proper evaluation. We report a case of endoscopic diagnosis of AEF that did not present with hematemesis; it was treated with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and surgery. A 71-year-old female presented to the emergency department with epigastric discomfort. Endoscopy demonstrated a submucosal tumor-like protrusion and pulsating mass with blood clots. Contrast-enhanced chest CT confirmed AEF due to descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. The patient immediately underwent TEVAR to prevent massive bleeding and subsequently underwent surgery. Endoscopists should consider AEF if they see a submucosal tumor-like mass with a central ulcerative lesion or a pulsating protrusion covered with blood clots in mid-esophagus during an endoscopy.

T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Facing the severe ecological problems brought by the increasing land degradation in the coal mining areas and the difficulties on the defining of the scope of coal-covered surface in the open-pit mining areas, a normalized difference coal mine index ( NDCMI) was proposed based on the spectral characteristics of typical water bodies, vegetation, bare land and coal piles in the coal mining areas as well as the band characteristics of Landsat 8 remote sensing data. The NDCMI value of the ground object samples was used to set the threshold value to distinguish and identify the ground object information of the coal pile and the mining area. The results show that : First, consisting of blue, red, near-infrared and midinfrared bands of Landsat 8, the NDCMI method was applicative to the Xiaolongtan mining area; Second, from 2013 to 2018, the area of the Buzhaoba open-pit mining area increased by 1. 03 times, while the area of Xiaolongtan open-pit mining area decreased by 42%; The gravity of coal mining activities in Xiaolongtan mining area showed a spatial trend from northeast to southwest and the trend from Xiaolongtan open-pit mining area to Buzhaoba open-pit mining area, which greatly increased the pressure on ecology and environment of the Buzhaoba open pit mining area.

TI  - Mapping spring canola and spring wheat using Radarsat-2 and Landsat-8 images with Google Earth Engine
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remote sensing, it is difficult to accurately extract spring canola and wheat planting area with only optical images because both crops have the same growth period and similar spectral characteristics. Besides, optical images are susceptible to cloud contamination. Synthetic aperture radar is sensitive to canopy structure and is hardly influenced by weather; however, it is difficult to distinguish spring wheat and grass due to the similarity of both canopy structures during the major growth cycle. In order to resolve this problem, the present study proposed a method to extract spring canola and wheat by combining Radarsat-2 and Landsat-8 images based on Google Earth Engine. First, spring canola, forest, water and spring wheat and grass (both were regarded as one object) were extracted from Radarsat-2 image. Second, the cropland was extracted from Landsat-8 image. Third, synthetic mapping was carried out to achieve spring canola and wheat extraction. The result demonstrates that spring canola and wheat were successfully extracted with an overall accuracy of 96.04%.

TI  - A simple time-stepping scheme to simulate leaf area index, phenology, and gross primary production across deciduous broadleaf forests in the eastern United States
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial plants play a key role in regulating the exchange of energy and materials between the land surface and the atmosphere. Robust models that simulate both leaf dynamics and canopy photosynthesis are required to understand vegetation-climate interactions. This study proposes a simple time-stepping scheme to simulate leaf area index (LAI), phenology, and gross primary production (GPP) when forced with climate variables. The method establishes a linear function between steady-state LAI and the corresponding GPP. The method applies the established function and the MOD17 algorithm to form simultaneous equations, which can be solved together numerically. To account for the time-lagged responses of plant growth to environmental conditions, a time-stepping scheme is developed to simulate the LAI time series based on the solved steady-state LAI. The simulated LAI time series is then used to derive the timing of key phenophases and simulate canopy GPP with the MOD17 algorithm. The developed method is applied to deciduous broadleaf forests in the eastern United States and is found to perform well for simulating canopy LAI and GPP at the site scale as evaluated using both flux tower and satellite data. The method also captures the spatiotemporal variation of vegetation LAI and phenology across the eastern United States compared with satellite observations. The developed time-stepping scheme provides a simplified and improved version of our previous modeling approach to simulate leaf phenology and can potentially be applied at regional to global scales in future studies.

T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSeasonal patterns of influenza A subtypes and B lineages in tropical/subtropical regions across age have remained to be explored. The impact of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic on seasonal influenza activity havenot beenwell understood.MethodsBased on a national sentinel hospital-based influenza surveillance system, the epidemiology of influenza virus during 2006/07-2015/16 was characterized in the subtropical city, Chengdu. Chengdu is one of the most populous cities in southwestern China,where the first reported case of A/H1N1pdm09 in mainland China was identified. Wavelet analysis was applied to identify the periodicities of A/H3N2, seasonal A/H1N1, A/H1N1pdm09, Victoria, and Yamagata across age, respectively. The persistence and age distribution patterns were described during the pre-pandemic (2006/07-2008/09), pandemic (2009/10), and post-pandemic (2010/11-2015/16) seasons.ResultsA total of 10,981 respiratory specimens were collected, of which 2516 influenza cases were identified. Periodicity transition from semi-annual cycles to an annual cycle was observed for composite influenza virus as well as A/H3N2 along in Chengdu since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Semi-annual cycles of composite influenza virus and A/H3N2 along were observed again during 2014/15-2015/16, coinciding with the emergence and predominance of A/H3N2 significant antigenic drift groups. However, A/H1N1pdm09, Victoria, and Yamagata generally demonstrated an annual winter-spring peak in non-pandemic seasons. Along with periodicity transitions, age groups with higher positive rates shifted from school-aged children and adults to adults and the elderly for A/H1N1pdm09 during 2009/10-2010/11 and for A/H3N2 during 2014/15-2015/16.ConclusionsDifferences in periodicity and age distribution by subtype/lineage and byseason highlight the importance of increasing year-round influenza surveillance and developing subtype/lineage- and age-specific prevention and control measures. Changes of periodicity and age shifts should be considered in public health response to influenza pandemics and epidemics. In addition, it is suggested to use quadrivalent influenza vaccines to provide protection against both influenza B lineages.

TI  - Whole genome sequencing-based analysis of tuberculosis (TB) in migrants: rapid tools for cross-border surveillance and to distinguish between recent transmission in the host country and new importations
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The analysis of transmission of tuberculosis (TB) is challenging in areas with a large migrant population. Standard genotyping may fail to differentiate transmission within the host country from new importations, which is key from an epidemiological perspective. Aim: To propose a new strategy to simplify and optimise cross-border surveillance of tuberculosis and to distinguish between recent transmission in the host country and new importations. Methods: We selected 10 clusters, defined by 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR), from a population in Spain rich in migrants from eastern Europe, north Africa and west Africa and reanalysed 66 isolates by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). A multiplex-allele-specific PCR was designed to target strain-specific marker single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), identified from WGS data, to optimise the surveillance of the most complex cluster. Results: In five of 10 clusters not all isolates showed the short genetic distances expected for recent transmission and revealed a higher number of SNPs, thus suggesting independent importations of prevalent strains in the country of origin. In the most complex cluster, rich in Moroccan cases, a multiplex allele-specific oligonucleotide-PCR (ASO-PCR) targeting the marker SNPs for the transmission subcluster enabled us to prospectively identify new secondary cases. The ASO-PCR-based strategy was transferred and applied in Morocco, demonstrating that the strain was prevalent in the country. Conclusion: We provide a new model for optimising the analysis of cross-border surveillance of TB transmission in the scenario of global migration.

TI  - The value of satellite observations in the analysis and short-range prediction of Asian dust
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Asian dust is a seasonal meteorological phenomenon which affects east Asia, and has severe consequences on the air quality of China, North and South Korea and Japan. Despite the continental extent, the prediction of severe episodes and the anticipation of their consequences is challenging. Three 1-year experiments were run to assess the skill of the model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in monitoring Asian dust and understand its relative contribution to the aerosol load over China. Data used were the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Dark Target and the Deep Blue aerosol optical depth (AOD). In particular the experiments aimed at understanding the added value of data assimilation runs over a model run without any aerosol data. The year 2013 was chosen as representative of the availability of independent AOD data from two established ground-based networks (AERONET, Aerosol Robotic Network, and CARSNET, China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network), which could be used to evaluate experiments. Particulate matter (PM) data from the China Environmental Protection Agency were also used in the evaluation. Results show that the assimilation of satellite AOD data is beneficial to predict the extent and magnitude of desert dust events and to improve the short-range forecast of such events. The availability of observations from the MODIS Deep Blue algorithm over bright surfaces is an asset, allowing for a better localization of the sources and definition of the dust events. In general both experiments constrained by data assimilation perform better than the unconstrained experiment, generally showing smaller normalized mean bias and fractional gross error with respect to the independent verification datasets. The impact of the assimilated satellite observations is larger at analysis time, but lasts into the forecast up to 48 h. The performance of the global model in terms of particulate matter does not show the same degree of skill as the performance in terms of optical depth. Despite this, the global model is able to capture some regional pollution patterns. This indicates that the global model analyses may be used as boundary conditions for regional air quality models at higher resolution, enhancing their performance in situations in which part of the pollution may have originated from large-scale mechanisms. While assimilation is not a substitute for model development and characterization of the emission sources, results indicate that it can play a role in delivering improved monitoring of Asian dust optical depth.

TI  - Biotope conservation in a Mediterranean agricultural land by incorporating crop modelling
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to develop a decision support system based on the conservation of biotopes within a Mediterranean agricultural landscape through the optimization of agricultural productivity. The first stage of this research includes mapping crop patterns using medium-resolution satellite sensor data recorded by LANDSAT and Sentinel-2 over Lower Seyhan Plain (LSP) located at the Eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey between 2010 and 2016. In the second stage, crop productivity of three major crops namely winter wheat, corn, and cotton derived from image classification was modelled spatially and temporally through the CropSyst model. Additionally, the model was also revealed irrigation return flow from the drainage and the related N load. In the last stage, conservation principles and policies were recommended to diminish the detrimental impacts of agricultural fertilizer loads to the biotopes through drainage channels. The model results indicated that crop productivity of wheat, cotton, first crop corn, and second crop corn 21%, 28%, 47%, and 4% of total production in LSP, respectively. The average annual crop production of the wetlands region was 161,548 tons and equal to 16,5% of the total plain area. The largest amount of drainage water comes from cotton and second crop corn cultivation; the smallest amount comes from wheat and first crop corn cultivation. The largest amount of nitrogen remaining within the system was from second-crop corn, whereas, the smallest amount from wheat. It can be concluded that nitrogen fertilizer should be applied according to the soil characteristics, reduced by 5% for wheat, 10% for first crop corn, and 50% for second crop corn. As a result of this reduction fertilizer uptake efficiency will increase and N load to the wetlands will decrease.

TI  - Simplified Approach to Operational InSAR Monitoring of Volcano Deformation in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Case Study of Rabaul Caldera, Papua New Guinea
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary goal of operational volcano monitoring is the timely identification of volcanic unrest. This provides critical information to decision makers tasked with mitigating the societal impacts of volcanic eruptions. Volcano deformation is recognized as a key indicator of unrest at many active volcanoes and can be used to provide insight into the depth and geometry of the magma source. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing technique that has detected deformation at many volcanoes globally, but most often with hindsight. To date, the use of InSAR for operational volcano monitoring has been limited to a few cases and only in high income countries. Yet a vast number of active volcanoes are located in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where resources for operational monitoring are constrained. In these countries, InSAR could provide deformation monitoring at many active volcanoes, including those that have no existing ground monitoring infrastructure. Several barriers combine to make uptake of InSAR into operational volcano monitoring difficult in most countries, but particularly in resource-constrained environments. To overcome some of these limiting factors, we propose a simplified processing chain to better incorporate InSAR and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) data into the decision-making process at volcano observatories. To combine the InSAR and GNSS data we use a joint modelling procedure that infers volume changes of a spherical source beneath the volcano. The benefits of our approach for operational use include that the algorithm is computationally lightweight and can be run quickly on a standard desktop or laptop PC. This enables a volcano observatory to interpret geodetic data in a timely fashion, and use the information as part of frequent reporting procedures. To demonstrate our approach we combine ALOS-PALSAR InSAR data and continuous GNSS data from the Rabaul Caldera, Papua New Guinea between 2007 and 2011. Joint inversion of the two datasets indicates volume loss of similar to 1 x 107 m(3) (deflation) occurring between February 2008 and November 2009, followed by volume gain of similar to 2.5 x 106 m(3) (inflation) until February 2011 in a magma body situated similar to 1.5 km beneath the caldera.

TI  - A synthetic satellite dataset of the spatio-temporal distributions of <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i> blooms and their impacts on Arctic and sub-Arctic marine environments (1998-2016)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - A 19-year (1998-2016) continuous dataset is presented of coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi distributions and activity, i.e. the release of CaCO3 in water and the decrease of uptake of dissolved CO2 by Emiliania huxleyi cells (e.g. Kondrik et al., 2018a), in Arctic and sub-Arctic seas. The dataset is based on optical remote-sensing data (mostly OC CCI data) with assimilation of different relevant in situ observations, preprocessed with authorial algorithms. Alongside bloom locations, we provide both detailed information on E. huxleyi impacts on carbon balance and the sub-datasets of quantified coccolith concentrations, particulate inorganic carbon content and CO2 partial pressure in water driven by coccolithophores. All data are presented on a regular 4 x 4 km grid at a temporal resolution of 8 days. The paper describes the theoretical and methodological basis for all processing and modelling steps.

TI  - Characterizing the behaviour of surge-and non-surge-type glaciers in the Kingata Mountains, eastern Pamir, from 1999 to 2016
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the Pamir Mountains are generally acknowledged to be in a stable state and show the least glacial retreat in high-mountain Asia; however, they are also some of the most dynamic glaciers in the region and their behaviour has been spatially variable in recent decades. Few data exist for these glaciers, in particular relating to how they are responding to recent climatic changes. Here, we utilize Land-sat 7 (ETM+), Landsat 8 (OLI), ASTER, and Google Earth optical images acquired between 1999 and 2016 to characterize the dynamics of the glaciers in the Kingata Mountains, located in the eastern Pamir Mountains. We quantify the velocity, areal, and frontal changes of these glaciers, which provide us with valuable data on their recent dynamic evolution and an indication of how they may evolve in future years. We highlight 28 glaciers among which 17 have changed markedly over the study period. We identify four advancing glaciers and 13 surge-type glaciers. The dynamic evolution of the glacier surges shows some similarity with those of the nearby Karakoram, suggesting that both hydrological and thermal controls are important for surge initiation and recession. Topography seems to be a dominant control on non-surge glacier behaviour in the Kingata Mountains, with the north side of the divide characterized by steep, avalanchefed basins and glacier tongues now approaching recession in contrast to those on the south side of the divide that capture the majority of precipitation and have much broader plateau-like accumulation zones. This study is the first synthesis of glacial motion across this region and provides a baseline with which to compare future changes.

TI  - Mapping the spatial distribution of <i>Lippia javanica</i> (Burm. f.) Spreng using Sentinel-2 and SRTM-derived topographic data in malaria endemic environment
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lippia javanica (L. javanica) is one of the commonly used ethnobotanical plant species for controlling malaria globally. Accurate mapping of L. javanica species is important for malaria control interventions that require geospatial information for the assessment of malaria distribution and monitoring especially in communities that have limited access to western malaria medicine. Currently, high spatial resolution information pertaining the distribution and habitat suitability of L. javanica species is very rare. The high resolution mapping could assist in identifying potential niche areas of ethnobotanically important species and to facilitate community health and wellness against malaria. In this study, we tested the ability of high spatial resolution Sentinel-2 (S-2) derived variables and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)-derived topographic variables to predict the distribution of L. javanica in the Vhembe District Municipality (South Africa). The relationship between remote sensing variables and the occurrence data of L. javanica was assessed using coefficient of determination (R-2). Here, for the first time we compared three commonly used species distribution models (logistic regression, Maxent and ensemble models) to derive the best possible subsets of environmental predictors, and to produce the species distribution map that could aid in identifying areas were L. javanica occurs for use against malaria vectors. Various validation matrices such as the overall accuracy (OA), model sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp), and the true skill statistics (TSS) were employed to test the robustness of the resultant models. The results showed a superior performance of weighted ensemble model, which yielded higher overall accuracy (91.3%, TSS = 0.66) than both logistic regression (OA = 84.4%, TSS = 0.42) and Maxent (95.6%, TSS = 0.73). The indices derived from the Sentinel's red edge bands were the most contributory variables in both logistic regression and Maxent. The normalized difference averaged red edge vegetation index (NDARVI) and the normalized difference red edge1 vegetation index (NDVIre) contributed 39.25% (p = 0.0002) and 32.50% in LR and Maxent models respectively. Slope was the most significant SRTM-derived variable correlated to L. javanica occurrence in all models. The results of this study show that high resolution Sentinel-2 data can be used to map hardy shrub species at higher accuracies using ensemble model. The derived occurrence map of L. javanica could assist in updating the currently coarse resolution distribution map of species required for its aromatic ecological service against malaria vectors.

TI  - Regulating Ecosystem Services and Green Infrastructure: assessment of Urban Heat Island effect mitigation in the municipality of Rome, Italy
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is one of the main environmental impacts of urbanization, affecting directly human health and well-being of the city dwellers, and also contributing to worsen environmental quality. As a key strategy to address sustainable urban development, the EU has advocated the development of Nature-Based solutions, such as the implementation of Green Infrastructure (GI), which can deliver a wide range of Regulating Ecosystem Services (ES). In this article, the ES of climate regulation provided by GI has been analyzed in the Municipality of Rome, Italy, characterized by a complex territory and by a Mediterranean climate. The methodological approach allowed to characterize the UHI and to analyze its features in a spatially explicit way and on a seasonal basis, through the Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from Landsat-8 data. The cooling capacity of different GI elements (peri-urban forest, urban forest, street trees), as well as the effect of vegetation cover and tree diversity on the provision of this regulating ES were assessed. The results show that GI significantly mitigates the hot urban climate during summer, with an effect that is dependent on the GI element and the environmental constrains to which it is exposed. NDVI and tree cover resulted the main indicators of the provision of the ES of climate regulation, highlighting that GI elements such as urban and peri-urban forests have the highest potential to provide this ES in a Mediterranean city. In the context of the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) process, our results lend support to claims that GI is important for an ecosystem-based climate adaptation strategy in urban environments, contributing to the definition of knowledge based criteria and indicators, relevant for decision-making in Mediterranean cities.

TI  - Impact and sustainability of centralising acute stroke services in English metropolitan areas: retrospective analysis of hospital episode statistics and stroke national audit data
T2  - BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVESTo investigate whether further centralisation of acute stroke services in Greater Manchester in 2015 was associated with changes in outcomes and whether the effects of centralisation of acute stroke services in London in 2010 were sustained.DESIGNRetrospective analyses of patient level data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database linked to mortality data from the Office for National Statistics, and the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP).SETTINGAcute stroke services in Greater Manchester and London, England.PARTICIPANTS509 182 stroke patients in HES living in urban areas admitted between January 2008 and March 2016; 218 120 stroke patients in SSNAP between April 2013 and March 2016.INTERVENTIONSHub and spoke models for acute stroke care.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESMortality at 90 days after hospital admission; length of acute hospital stay; treatment in a hyperacute stroke unit; 19 evidence based clinical interventions.RESULTSIn Greater Manchester, borderline evidence suggested that risk adjusted mortality at 90 days declined overall; a significant decline in mortality was seen among patients treated at a hyperacute stroke unit (difference-in-differences -1.8% (95% confidence interval -3.4 to -0.2)), indicating 69 fewer deaths per year. A significant decline was seen in risk adjusted length of acute hospital stay overall (-1.5 (-2.5 to -0.4) days; P<0.01), indicating 6750 fewer bed days a year. The number of patients treated in a hyperacute stroke unit increased from 39% in 2010-12 to 86% in 2015/16. In London, the 90 day mortality rate was sustained (P> 0.05), length of hospital stay declined (P< 0.01), and more than 90% of patients were treated in a hyperacute stroke unit. Achievement of evidence based clinical interventions generally remained constant or improved in both areas.CONCLUSIONSCentralised models of acute stroke care, in which all stroke patients receive hyperacute care, can reduce mortality and length of acute hospital stay and improve provision of evidence based clinical interventions. Effects can be sustained over time.

TI  - 5 GHz laterally-excited bulk-wave resonators (XBARs) based on thin platelets of lithium niobate
T2  - ELECTRONICS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In a free-standing 400-nm-thick platelet of crystalline ZY-LiNbO3, narrow electrodes (500 nm) placed periodically with a pitch of a few microns can eXcite standing shear-wave bulk acoustic resonances (XBARs), by utilising lateral electric fields oriented parallel to the crystalline Y-axis and parallel to the plane of the platelet. The resonance frequency of similar to 4800 MHz is determined mainly by the platelet thickness and only weakly depends on the electrode width and the pitch. Simulations show quality-factors (Q) at resonance and anti-resonance higher than 1000. Measurements of the first fabricated devices show a resonance Q-factor similar to 300, strong piezoelectric coupling similar to 25%, (indicated by the large Resonance-antiResonance frequency spacing, similar to 11%) and an impedance at resonance of a few ohms. The static capacitance of the devices, corresponds to the imaginary part of the impedance similar to 100 omega. This device opens the possibility for the development of low-loss, wide band, RF filters in the 3-6 GHz range for 4th and 5th generation (4G/5G) mobile phones. XBARs can be produced using standard optical photolithography and MEMS processes. The 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th harmonics were observed, up to 38 GHz, and are also promising for high frequency filter design.

TI  - Decolonizing Research Paradigms in the Context of Settler Colonialism: An Unsettling, Mutual, and Collaborative Effort
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - All research is guided by a set of philosophical underpinnings. Indigenous methodologies are in line with an Indigenous paradigm, while critical and liberatory methodologies fit with the transformative paradigm. Yet Indigenous and transformative methodologies share an emancipatory and critical stance and thus are increasingly used in tandem by both Western and Indigenous scholars in an attempt to decolonize methodologies, research, and the academy as a whole. However, these multiparadigmatic spaces only superficially support decolonization which, in the Canadian context of settler colonialism, is a radical and unsettling prospect that is about land, resources, and sovereignty. Applying this definition of decolonization to the decolonization of research paradigms, this article suggests that such paradigms must be developed, from scratch, conjointly between Indigenous and Western researchers.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity-based Voronoi matching method for GlobeLand30 data inconsistency detection: a case study of Linqu County, Shandong, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data have become a valuable source of data for mapping regional or global land cover. Referable to the spectral complexity and the quality of remotely sensed data selected, classification errors usually occurred in land cover mapping, where the errors occurred can result in an issue in which the spatial heterogeneity in remotely sensed data is inconsistent with that in land cover data. To ensure data quality, land cover data checking mainly depends on manual labor, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To tackle this issue, a spatial heterogeneity-based Voronoi matching method for automated detection of land cover data inconsistency is proposed. First, Harris corner-based Voronoi diagrams (HCVDs) are constructed utilizing the image noise filter and Harris corner detector. Second, the regional statistics of range on land cover data using HCVDs is calculated. Ultimately, by matching the heterogeneity in HCVDs and using HCVDs-based first-order neighbor filter, where inconsistent spatial heterogeneity occurs in land cover data can be found. A GlobeLand30 case study from Linqu County, Shandong, for the year 2010 in China is carried out. After detection and validation, this method is shown to be workable for detecting spatial regions where inconsistent spatial heterogeneity occurs in land cover data, and the data quality is improved by 6.3% in this study area after manual verification.

TI  - Sensitivity of active-layer freezing process to snow cover in Arctic Alaska
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution of cold-season soil respiration to the Arctic-boreal carbon cycle and its potential feedback to the global climate remain poorly quantified, partly due to a poor understanding of changes in the soil thermal regime and liquid water content during the soil-freezing process. Here, we characterized the processes controlling active-layer freezing in Arctic Alaska using an integrated approach combining in situ soil measurements, local-scale (similar to 50 m) long-wave radar retrievals from NASA airborne P-band polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) and a remote-sensing-driven permafrost model. To better capture landscape variability in snow cover and its influence on the soil thermal regime, we downscaled global coarse-resolution (similar to 0.5 degrees) MERRA-2 reanalysis snow depth data using finer-scale (500 m) MODIS snow cover extent (SCE) observations. The downscaled 1 km snow depth data were used as key inputs to the permafrost model, capturing finer-scale variability associated with local topography and with favorable accuracy relative to the SNOTEL site measurements in Arctic Alaska (mean RMSE = 0.16 m, bias = 0.01 m). In situ tundra soil dielectric constant (epsilon) profile measurements were used for model parameterization of the soil organic layer and unfrozen-water content curve. The resulting model-simulated mean zero-curtain period was generally consistent with in situ observations spanning a 2 degrees latitudinal transect along the Alaska North Slope (R: 0.6 +/- 0.2; RMSE: 19 +/- 6 days), with an estimated mean zero-curtain period ranging from 61 +/- 11 to 73 +/- 15 days at 0.25 to 0.45m depths. Along the same transect, both the observed and model-simulated zero-curtain periods were positively correlated (R > 0.55, p < 0.01) with a MODIS-derived snow cover fraction (SCF) from September to October. We also examined the airborne P-band radar-retrieved epsilon profile along this transect in 2014 and 2015, which is sensitive to near-surface soil liquid water content and freezethaw status. The epsilon difference in radar retrievals for the surface (similar to<0.1 m) soil between late August and early October was negatively correlated with SCF in September (R = 0.77, p < 0.01); areas with lower SCF generally showed larger epsilon reductions, indicating earlier surface soil freezing. On regional scales, the simulated zero curtain in the upper (< 0.4 m) soils showed large variability and was closely associated with variations in early cold-season snow cover. Areas with earlier snow onset generally showed a longer zero-curtain period; however, the soil freeze onset and zero-curtain period in deeper (> 0.5 m) soils were more closely linked to maximum thaw depth. Our findings indicate that a deepening active layer associated with climate warming will lead to persistent unfrozen conditions in deeper soils, promoting greater cold-season soil carbon loss.

M3  - Review
AB  - Three-field lymph node dissection improved the postoperative survival and accuracy of pathological staging of patients with esophageal cancer, and reduced the postoperative local recurrence rate of esophageal cancer patients. However, this surgical procedure enlarged the trauma, cansed more complications, prolonged postoperative hospital stays, and seriously impaired the postoperative adjuvant therapy. Therefore, selection of patients who are suitable for three-field lymph node dissection is extremely important. The special anatomical location of recurrent laryngeal nerve lymph nodes is potentially suitable for it to serve as sentinel lymph node for the evacuation of cervical lymph nodes dissection in esophageal cancer. The guiding value of recurrent laryngeal nerve lymph node metastasis in cervical lymph node dissection of thoracic esophageal cancer is reviewed.

TI  - Changing Patterns of Tree Cover in a Tropical Highland Region and Implications for Food, Energy, and Water Resources
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Blue Nile Highlands of Ethiopia are a densely populated, predominantly rural region dominated by smallholder crop-livestock mixed farming systems. Population growth, coupled with low productivity, have long posed a threat to natural forest ecosystems in the region, as trees have been removed for fuelwood and to clear area for grazing or crop production. In recent years, however, there has been a trend to replace cropland with eucalyptus plantations. This change has major implications for the hydrology, soils, and agricultural economy of the region. This study examines changes in tree cover for a highland area at the center of the Blue Nile Highlands. Landsat imagery from 1986 to 2017 is applied to characterize changing tree cover patterns over space and time. We find that total tree cover in this highland region has shifted dramatically over the past 30 years. Between 1987 and 1999 there was dramatic loss of tree cover, particularly in areas of natural vegetation at high and low elevation. This period coincided with the fall of the Derg government and the transition to the current political system. In the period since 1999 there has been an increase in tree cover, with rapid gains in recent years. This increase has taken two distinct forms: regrowth in previously forested areas, due in part to active conservation measures, and the establishment of eucalyptus plantations in mid-elevation zones. The ecological and economic implications of these two types of tree cover-protected forest vs. woodlot plantations-are quite distinct, with plantation forestry providing biomass energy at a cost to food production and water resources. Mapping cropland conversion to eucalyptus in recent years makes it possible to quantify the net impacts that this trend has had on local production of energy and food, and to estimate implications for water consumption. Effective monitoring of these changes is important for the ongoing development and implementation of effective land use policy in the region.

TI  - From high to low malaria transmission in Zanzibar-challenges and opportunities to achieve elimination
T2  - BMC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Substantial global progress in the control of malaria in recent years has led to increased commitment to its potential elimination. Whether this is possible in high transmission areas of sub-Saharan Africa remains unclear. Zanzibar represents a unique case study of such attempt, where modern tools and strategies for malaria treatment and vector control have been deployed since 2003.We have studied temporal trends of comprehensive malariometric indices in two districts with over 100,000 inhabitants each. The analyses included triangulation of data from annual community-based cross-sectional surveys, health management information systems, vital registry and entomological sentinel surveys.The interventions, with sustained high-community uptake, were temporally associated with a major malaria decline, most pronounced between 2004 and 2007 and followed by a sustained state of low transmission. In 2015, the Plasmodium falciparum community prevalence of 0.43% (95% CI 0.23-0.73) by microscopy or rapid diagnostic test represented 96% reduction compared with that in 2003. The P. falciparum and P. malariae prevalence by PCR was 1.8% (95% CI 1.3-2.3), and the annual P. falciparum incidence was estimated to 8 infections including 2.8 clinical episodes per 1000 inhabitants. The total parasite load decreased over 1000-fold (99.9%) between 2003 and 2015. The incidence of symptomatic malaria at health facilities decreased by 94% with a trend towards relatively higher incidence in age groups > 5 years, a more pronounced seasonality and with reported travel history to/from Tanzania mainland as a higher risk factor. All-cause mortality among children < 5 years decreased by 72% between 2002 and 2007 mainly following the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapies whereas the main reduction in malaria incidence followed upon the vector control interventions from 2006. Human biting rates decreased by 98% with a major shift towards outdoor biting by Anopheles arabiensis.Zanzibar provides new evidence of the feasibility of reaching uniquely significant and sustainable malaria reduction (pre-elimination) in a previously high endemic region in sub-Saharan Africa. The data highlight constraints of optimistic prognostic modelling studies. New challenges, mainly with outdoor transmission, a large asymptomatic parasite reservoir and imported infections, require novel tools and reoriented strategies to prevent a rebound effect and achieve elimination.

TI  - Waterhole detection using a vegetation index in desert bighorn sheep (<i>Ovis canadensis cremnobates</i>) habitat
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid ecosystems, desert bighorn sheep are dependent on natural waterholes, particularly in summer when forage is scarce and environmental temperatures are high. To detect waterholes in Sierra Santa Isabel, which is the largest area of desert bighorn sheep habitat in the state of Baja California, Mexico, we used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) from Sentinel-2 satellite images. Waterhole detection was based on the premise that sites with greater water availability, where NDVI was higher, can be identified by their density of vegetation greenness. For the detected waterholes, we estimated the escape terrain (presence of cliffs or steep, rocky slopes) around each by the vector ruggedness measure to determine their potential use by desert bighorn sheep based on the animals' presence as documented by camera traps. We detected 14 waterholes with the NDVI of which 11 were known by land owners and 3 were unrecorded. Desert bighorn were not detected in waterholes with high values of escape terrain, i.e., flat areas. Waterhole detection by NDVI is a simple method, and with the assistance and knowledge of the inhabitants of the Sierra, it was possible to confirm the presence each waterhole in the field.

TI  - Use of Mastectomy for Overdiagnosed Breast Cancer in the United States: Analysis of the SEER 9 Cancer Registries
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. We investigated use of mastectomy as treatment for early breast cancer in the US and applied the resulting information to estimate the minimum and maximum rates at which mastectomy could plausibly be undergone by patients with overdiagnosed breast cancer. Little is currently known about overtreatments undergone by overdiagnosed patients. Methods. In the US, screening is often recommended at ages >= 40. The study population was women age >= 40 diagnosed with breast cancer in the US SEER 9 cancer registries during 2013 (n=26,017). We evaluated first-course surgical treatments and their associations with case characteristics. Additionally, a model was developed to estimate probability of mastectomy conditional on observed case characteristics. The model was then applied to evaluate possible rates of mastectomy in overdiagnosed patients. To obtain minimum and maximum plausible rates of this overtreatment, we respectively assumed the cases that were least and most likely to be treated by mastectomy had been overdiagnosed. Results. Of women diagnosed with breast cancer at age >= 40 in 2013, 33.8% received mastectomy. Mastectomy was common for most investigated breast cancer types, including for the early breast cancers among which overdiagnosis is thought to be most widespread: mastectomy was undergone in 26.4% of in situ and 28.0% of AJCC stage-I cases. These rates are substantively higher than in many European nations. The probability-based model indicated that between >0% and <18% of the study population could plausibly have undergone mastectomy for overdiagnosed cancer. This range reduced depending on the overdiagnosis rate, shrinking to >0% and <7% if 10% of breast cancers were overdiagnosed and >3% and <15% if 30% were overdiagnosed. Conclusions. Screening-associated overtreatment by mastectomy is considerably less common than overdiagnosis itself but should not be assumed to be negligible. Screening can prompt or prevent mastectomy, and the balance of this harm-benefit tradeoff is currently unclear.

TI  - Varying relationships between fire radiative power and fire size at a global scale
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation fires are an important process in the Earth system. Fire intensity locally impacts fuel consumption, damage to the vegetation, chemical composition of fire emissions and also how fires spread across landscapes. It has been observed that fire occurrence, defined as the frequency of active fires detected by the MODIS sensor, is related to intensity with a hump-shaped empirical relation, meaning that occurrence reaches a maximum at intermediate fire intensity. Raw burned area products obtained from remote sensing can not discriminate between ignition and propagation processes. To go beyond burned area and to test if fire size is driven by fire intensity at a global scale as expected from empirical fire spread models, we used the newly delivered global FRY database, which provides fire patch functional traits based on satellite observation, including fire patch size, and the fire radiative power measures from the MCD14ML dataset. This paper describes the varying relationships between fire size and fire radiative power across biomes at a global scale. We show that in most fire regions of the world defined by the GFED database, the linear relationship between fire radiative power and fire patch size saturates for a threshold of intermediate-intensity fires. The value of this threshold differs from one region to another and depends on vegetation type. In the most fire-prone savanna regions, once this threshold is reached, fire size decreases for the most intense fires, which mostly happen in the late fire season. According to the percolation theory, we suggest that the decrease in fire size for more intense late season fires is a consequence of the in-creasing fragmentation of fuel continuity throughout the fire season and suggest that landscape-scale feedbacks should be developed in global fire modules.

TI  - Techniques and Current Role of Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) Concept in Gastric Cancer Surgery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Gastric cancer patients represent a rather divergent patient group and in certain carefully selected cases of early forms of gastric cancer the D2 gastrectomy could be considered a more radical procedure than the biological and oncological characteristics of the primary tumor on the gastric wall would require. As any unnecessary dissection increases morbidity without always respective survival benefits, an approach that could accurately predict and actually dictate the exact extent of lymph node dissection would be ideal. It is more than logical the assumption that the standard D2 lymphadenectomy could represent an overtreatment in distinct patients groups such as patients with early gastric cancer with favorable pathological characteristics and clinically negative nodes not suitable for endoscopic treatment because this early stage disease shows limited lymph node metastasis incidence and excellent overall survival. Considering that the D2 gastrectomy has a negative impact on the quality of life of gastric cancer patients due to the post-gastrectomy functional results, a concept of a more targeted lymph node dissection, when appropriate, is certainly appealing. It is yet to be proven whether sentinel lymph node navigation surgery can fulfill such expectations providing the appropriate balance between morbidity and oncological safety in selected gastric cancer patients.

TI  - Socioecologically informed use of remote sensing data to predict rural household poverty
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tracking the progress of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targeting interventions requires frequent, up-to-date data on social, economic, and ecosystem conditions. Monitoring socioeconomic targets using household survey data would require census enumeration combined with annual sample surveys on consumption and socioeconomic trends. Such surveys could cost up to $253 billion globally during the lifetime of the SDGs, almost double the global development assistance budget for 2013. We examine the role that satellite data could have in monitoring progress toward reducing poverty in rural areas by asking two questions: (i) Can household wealth be predicted from satellite data? (ii) Can a socioecologically informed multilevel treatment of the satellite data increase the ability to explain variance in household wealth? We found that satellite data explained up to 62% of the variation in household level wealth in a rural area of western Kenya when using a multilevel approach. This was a 10% increase compared with previously used single-level methods, which do not consider details of spatial landscape use. The size of buildings within a family compound (homestead), amount of bare agricultural land surrounding a homestead, amount of bare ground inside the homestead, and the length of growing season were important predictor variables. Our results show that a multilevel approach linking satellite and household data allows improved mapping of homestead characteristics, local land uses, and agricultural productivity, illustrating that satellite data can support the data revolution required for monitoring SDGs, especially those related to poverty and leaving no one behind.

TI  - Monitoring changes in forestry and seasonal snow using surface albedo during 1982-2016 as an indicator
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface albedo time series, CLARA-A2 SAL, was used to study trends in the snowmelt start and end dates, the melting season length and the albedo value preceding the melt onset in Finland during 1982-2016. In addition, the melt onset from the JSBACH land surface model was compared with the timing of green-up estimated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Moreover, the melt onset was compared with the timing of the greening up based on MODIS data. Similarly, the end of snowmelt timing predicted by JSBACH was compared with the melt-off dates based on the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) operational in situ measurements and the Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) time-series product provided by the EU FP7 CryoLand project. It was found that the snowmelt date estimated using the 20% threshold of the albedo range during the melting period corresponded well to the melt estimate of the permanent snow layer. The longest period, during which the ground is continuously half or more covered by snow, defines the permanent snow layer (Solantie et al., 1996). The greening up followed within 5-13 days the date when the albedo reached the 1% threshold of the albedo dynamic range during the melting period. The time difference between greening up and complete snowmelt was smaller in mountainous areas than in coastal areas. In two northern vegetation map areas (Northern Karelia-Kainuu and Southwestern Lapland), a clear trend towards earlier snowmelt onset (5-6 days per decade) and increasing melting season length (6-7 days per decade) was observed. In the forested part of northern Finland, a clear decreasing trend in albedo (2%-3% per decade in absolute albedo percentage) before the start of the melt onset was observed. The decreasing albedo trend was found to be due to the increased stem volume.

TI  - The Advanced Infra-Red WAter Vapour Estimator (AIRWAVE) version 2: algorithm evolution, dataset description and performance improvements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Total column water vapour (TCWV) is a key atmospheric variable which is generally evaluated on global scales through the use of satellite data. Recently a new algorithm, called AIRWAVE (Advanced Infra-Red WAter Vapour Estimator), has been developed for the retrieval of the TCWV from the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) instrument series. The AIRWAVE algorithm retrieves TCWV by exploiting the dual view of the ATSR instruments using the infrared channels at 10.8 and 12 mu m and nadir and forward observation geometries. The algorithm was used to produce a TCWV database over sea from the whole ATSR mission. When compared to independent TCWV products, the AIRWAVE version 1 (AIRWAVEv1) database shows very good agreement with an overall bias of 3% all over the ATSR missions. A large contribution to this bias comes from the polar and the coastal regions, where AIRWAVE underestimates the TCWV amount. In this paper we describe an updated version of the algorithm, specifically developed to reduce the bias in these regions. The AIRWAVE version 2 (AIRWAVEv2) accounts for the atmospheric variability at different latitudes and the associated seasonality. In addition, the dependency of the retrieval parameters on satellite across-track viewing angles is now explicitly handled. With the new algorithm we produced a second version of the AIRWAVE dataset. As for AIRWAVEv1, the quality of the AIRWAVEv2 dataset is assessed through the comparison with the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and with the Analyzed RadioSounding Archive (ARSA) TCWV data. Results show significant improvements in both biases (from 0.72 to 0.02 kgm 2) and standard deviations (from 5.75 to 4.69 kgm 2), especially in polar and coastal regions. A qualitative and quantitative estimate of the main error sources affecting the AIRWAVEv2 TCWV dataset is also given. The new dataset has also been used to estimate the water vapour climatology from the 1991-2012 time series.

TI  - Does the number of removed axillary lymphnodes in high risk breast cancer patients influence the survival?
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe decision making process for axillary dissection has changed in recent years for patients with early breast cancer and positive sentinel lymph nodes (LN). The question now arises, what is the optimal surgical treatment for patients with positive axillary LN (pN+). This article tries to answer the following questions:Is there a survival benefit for breast cancer patients with 3 or more positive LN (pN3+) and with more than 10 removed LN?Is there a survival benefit for high risk breast cancer patients (triple negative or Her2+breast cancer) and with 3 or more positive LN (pN3+) with more than 10 removed LN?In pN+patients is the prognostic value of the lymph node ratio (LNR) of pN+/pN removed impaired if 10 or less LN are removed?MethodsA retrospective database analysis of the multi center cohort database BRENDA (breast cancer under evidence based guidelines) with data from 9625 patients from 17 breast centers was carried out. Guideline adherence was defined by the 2008 German National consensus guidelines.Results2992 out of 9625 patients had histological confirmed positive lymph nodes. The most important factors for survival were intrinsic sub types, tumor size and guideline adherent chemo- and hormonal treatment (and age at diagnosis for overall survival (OAS)). Uni-and multivariable analyses for recurrence free survival (RFS) and OAS showed no significant survival benefit when removing more than 10 lymph nodes even for high-risk patients. The mean and median of LNR were significantly higher in the pN+ patients with 10 excised LN compared to patients with >10 excised LN. LNR was in both, uni-and multivariable, analysis a highly significant prognostic factor for RFS and OAS in both subgroups of pN+patients with less respective more than 10 excised LN. Multivariable COX regression analysis was adjusted by age, tumor size, intrinsic sub types and guideline adherent adjuvant systemic therapy.ConclusionThe removal of more than 10 LN did not result in a significant survival benefit even in high risk pN+breast cancer patients.

TI  - Remote Thermal Sensing by Integration of Corner-Cube Optics and Thermochromic Materials
T2  - ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermochromic materials (TCMs) change their color in response to temperature variations. Here, presented is a rare combination of TCMs with conventional corner-cube retroreflectors (CCRs) that are widely used in industry for their ability to return an incident beam of light directly back toward its source. The TCM quoted CCR (TCR sensor) allows remote measurements of the quantitative thermal information of the environment to which the TCR sensor is subjected. Two different commercially available thermochromic systems, a leuco dye and liquid crystals, are utilized as sensing materials. Since the incident (probe) beam and reflected (sensing) beam always follow the opposite directions 180 degrees, this allows the probing and sensing to be carried out remotely from the same spot. Therefore, such remote sensing mechanism is virtually independent of the incident and detection beam angles. The TCR sensor has potential application in the space research, mining, power generation facilities, radioactive environments, and other industries where remote temperature sensing is a stringent requirement.

TI  - Comparison of techniques for missing lines reconstruction of RapidEye imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to sensor or ground station failure and poor atmospheric conditions, missing information is a common problem that reduces the usage of optical remote sensing data. A large number of algorithms have been developed to reconstruct missing information. Simple methods are compared for filling missing data in the case that one spectral band presents missing information but the other bands are complete. The methods are (1) spatial convolution filtering, (2) unsupervised classification using the complete bands and assignment of the cluster's average value to missing stripe pixels, (3) global regression models, (4) geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, and (5) a combination of classification and linear models. To evaluate the performance of the different methods, missing line stripes of different sizes are simulated and reconstructed using the five methods. Then, root mean square error (RMSE), correlation, maximum deviance, and bias are computed. To identify the conditions related to the performance of each method, some characteristics of the missing lines, as correlation between spectral bands and spatial autocorrelation, are also calculated. The unsupervised classification based on the larger number of clusters, in particular when combined with linear regression, presents a low RMSE due to its ability to identify the spectral signature of the objects present in the scene. The GWR model performs better than global regression model because it is able to fit the relationship between the missing band and the complete bands locally, which is an important advantage in heterogeneous landscape. Spatial filtering is the most inaccurate method except for one pixel-width missing line. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - 4DVAR assimilation of GNSS zenith path delays and precipitable water into a numerical weather prediction model WRF
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The GNSS data assimilation is currently widely discussed in the literature with respect to the various applications for meteorology and numerical weather models. Data assimilation combines atmospheric measurements with knowledge of atmospheric behavior as codified in computer models. With this approach, the "best" estimate of current conditions consistent with both information sources is produced. Some approaches also allow assimilating the nonprognostic variables, including remote sensing data from radar or GNSS (global navigation satellite system). These techniques are named variational data assimilation schemes and are based on a minimization of the cost function, which contains the differences between the model state (background) and the observations. The variational assimilation is the first choice for data assimilation in the weather forecast centers, however, current research is consequently looking into use of an iterative, filtering approach such as an extended Kalman filter (EKF).This paper shows the results of assimilation of the GNSS data into numerical weather prediction (NWP) model WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting). The WRF model offers two different variational approaches: 3DVAR and 4DVAR, both available through the WRF data assimilation (WRFDA) package. The WRFDA assimilation procedure was modified to correct for bias and observation errors. We assimilated the zenith total delay (ZTD), precipitable water (PW), radiosonde (RS) and surface synoptic observations (SYNOP) using a 4DVAR assimilation scheme. Three experiments have been performed: (1) assimilation of PW and ZTD for May and June 2013, (2) assimilation of PW alone; PW, with RS and SYNOP; ZTD alone; and finally ZTD, with RS and SYNOP for 5-23 May 2013, and (3) assimilation of PW or ZTD during severe weather events in June 2013. Once the initial conditions were established, the forecast was run for 24 h.The major conclusion of this study is that for all analyzed cases, there are two parameters significantly changed once GNSS data are assimilated in the WRF model using GPSPW operator and these are moisture fields and rain. The GNSS observations improves forecast in the first 24 h, with the strongest impact starting from a 9 h lead time. The relative humidity forecast in a vertical profile after assimilation of ZTD shows an over 20% decrease of mean error starting from 2.5 km upward. Assimilation of PW alone does not bring such a spectacular improvement. However, combination of PW, SYNOP and radiosonde improves distribution of humidity in the vertical profile by maximum of 12 %. In the three analyzed severe weather cases PW always improved the rain forecast and ZTD always reduced the humidity field bias. Binary rain analysis shows that GNSS parameters have significant impact on the rain forecast in the class above 1mmh(-1).

TI  - Selection and evaluation of optimal segmentation scale for high-resolution remote sensing images based on prior thematic maps and image features
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiscale segmentation is the premise and key step of geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), but scale selection remains a challenge in multiscale segmentation. Over the years, scale selection and evaluation in image segmentation has been extensively explored and many methods have been developed. In these methods, when a scale is chosen or evaluated, all the features are generally extracted from images. In addition, an optimal scale is generally selected based on the pre-estimation of the statistical variance in remote sensing images or determined based on the postsegmentation evaluation of segmented results. In this study, a method was proposed to identify the optimal scale of each segmented object during the segmentation through combining the a priori thematic map knowledge with image features. First, 25 image segmentations were obtained using multiresolution segmentation algorithm of Definiens Professional 9.0 with different scales. A global score (GS) value was assigned to each segmentation based on the calculation results of the weighted variance and global Moran's I and the single-scale optimal segmentation result was determined according to each GS of 25 segmentation scales. Second, the image feature complexity information and the a priori thematic map complexity information of each segmentation object were extracted to calculate complexity values for each object. Third, the optimal scale of each segmentation object was determined through the iterative calculation with the multithreshold method. Finally, the segmentation results of the proposed method were evaluated. The proposed method was applied to process Gaofen-2 (GF-2), GF-1, Korea Multipurpose Satellite (KOMPSAT-2), IKONOS, QuickBird and WorldView-2 high resolution satellite images to obtain the segmentation results and classification results, compared with results obtained of the optimal singlescale segmentation and the unsupervised evaluation method. The experimental results of GEOBIA showed that the method was helpful for generating the segmentation object with the optimal scale. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Comparison of hyperspectral HJ-1A/HSI and multispectral Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A imagery for estimating alpine grassland coverage in the Three-River Headwaters region
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of grassland coverage is important in both monitoring grassland growth and promoting grassland management. This study, for the first time, aims to evaluate the alpine grassland coverage estimation performances of four widely used methods [i.e., random forest classification (RFC), regression analysis (RA), multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), and support vector machine regression (SVMR)] from three typical remote sensing images [i.e., hyperspectral (HJ-1A/HSI) image and multispectral (Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A) images] in the Three-River Headwaters region, China. The total grassland coverage and three levels of grassland subcoverage (i.e., low, moderate, and high coverage) are estimated from the three images by each method. Meanwhile, the overall accuracy (OA) and root-meansquare error (RMSE) of each coverage result are assessed. The experimental results show that (1) for the total grassland coverage estimation, RFC method combined with Sentinel-2A data and RA method used both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A data generated the highest OA of 79.4%, whereas the highest OAs of SVMR and MESMA methods are 3% to 14.7% lower than those of RFC and RA methods, (2) for three grassland subcoverage estimation, Landsat 8 data combined with RFC method generated the greatest OAs (100%) and the lowest RMSEs (7.34%) for low grassland coverage and Sentinel-2A data combined with SVMR method obtained the highest OAs (>83.3%) for moderate and high grassland coverage, (3) Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 data generated higher OAs than HJ-1A/HSI data in estimating the total coverage while Sentinel-2A produced better performance than Landsat 8 in estimating the grassland subcoverage, and (4) SVMR method performed more stably than other methods in estimating alpine grassland coverage.

TI  - Inland surface waters in protected areas globally: Current coverage and 30-year trends
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland waters are unique ecosystems offering services and habitat resources upon which many species depend. Despite the importance of, and threats to, inland water, global assessments of protected area (PA) coverage and trends have focused on land habitats or have assessed land and inland waters together. We here provide the first assessment of the level of protection of inland open surface waters and their trends (1984-2015) within PAs for all countries, using a globally consistent, high-resolution (30 m) and validated dataset on permanent and seasonal surface waters based on Landsat images. Globally, 15% of inland surface waters are covered by PAs with mapped boundaries. Estimated inland water protection increases to 16.4% if PAs with reported area but delineated only as points are included as circular buffers. These coverage estimates slightly exceed the comparable figure for land but fall below the 17% goal of the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 11 for 2020. Protection levels are very uneven across countries, half of which do not yet meet the 17% target. The lowest coverage of surface water by PAs (<5%) was found in Africa and in parts of Asia. There was a global trend of permanent water losses and seasonal water gains within PAs, concomitant with an increase of both water types outside PAs. In 38% of countries, PAs lost over 5% of permanent water. Global protection targets for inland waters may well be met by 2020, but much stronger efforts are required to ensure their effective conservation, which will depend not only on sound PA governance and management but also on the sustainable use of water resources outside PAs. Given the pressures on water in a rapidly changing world, integrated management planning of water resources involving multiple sectors and entire basins is therefore necessary.

In these years, all five donations reactive in WNV nucleic acid amplification tests harboured instead Usutu virus (USUV). Clade 'Europe 2' was identified in four blood donations and a 2018 mosquito pool. The cocirculation of WNV and USUV in Lazio warrants increased laboratory support and awareness of possible virus misidentification.

TI  - Characterizing multi-decadal, annual land cover change dynamics in Houston, TX based on automated classification of Landsat imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2017, Hurricane Harvey caused substantial loss of life and property in the swiftly urbanizing region of Houston, TX. Now in its wake, researchers are tasked with investigating how to plan for and mitigate the impact of similar events in the future, despite expectations of increased storm intensity and frequency as well as accelerating urbanization trends. Critical to this task is the development of automated workflows for producing accurate and consistent land cover maps of sufficiently fine spatio-temporal resolution over large areas and long timespans. In this study, we developed an innovative automated classification algorithm that overcomes some of the traditional trade-offs between fine spatio-temporal resolution and extent - to produce a multi-scene, 30m annual land cover time series characterizing 21 years of land cover dynamics in the 35,000 km2 Greater Houston area. The ensemble algorithm takes advantage of the synergistic value of employing all acceptable Landsat imagery in a given year, using aggregate votes from the posterior predictive distributions of multiple image composites to mitigate against misclassifications in any one image, and fill gaps due to missing and contaminated data, such as those from clouds and cloud shadows. The procedure is fully automated, combining adaptive signature generalization and spatio-temporal stabilization for consistency across sensors and scenes. The land cover time series is validated using independent, multi-temporal fine-resolution imagery, achieving crisp overall accuracies between 78-86% and fuzzy overall accuracies between 91-94%. Validated maps and corresponding areal cover estimates corroborate what census and economic data from the Greater Houston area likewise indicate: rapid growth from 1997-2017, demonstrated by the conversion of 2,040 km(2) (+/- 400 km(2)) to developed land cover, 14% of which resulted from the conversion of wetlands. Beyond its implications for urbanization trends in Greater Houston, this study demonstrates the potential for automated approaches to quantifying large extent, fine resolution land cover change, as well as the added value of temporally-dense time series for characterizing higher-order spatio-temporal dynamics of land cover, including periodicity, abrupt transitions, and time lags from underlying demographic and socio-economic trends.

TI  - Coseismic deformation and source model of the 12 November 2017 M<sub>W</sub> 7.3 Kermanshah Earthquake (Iran-Iraq border) investigated through DInSAR measurements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A large earthquake with a magnitude of M-W 7.3 struck the border of Iran and Iraq at the province of Kermanshah, Iran. In our study, coseismic deformation and source model of the 12 November 2017 Kermanshah Earthquake are investigated using ALOS-2 ScanSAR and Sentinel-1A/B TOPSAR Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) techniques. Geodetic inversion has been performed to constrain source parameters and invert slip distribution on the fault plane. The optimised source model from joint inversion shows a blind reverse fault with a relatively large right-lateral component, striking 353.5 degrees NNW-SSE and dipping 16.3 degrees NE. The maximum slip is up to 3.8 m at 12-14 km depth and the inferred seismic moment is 1.01 x 10(20) Nm, corresponding to M-W 7.3, consistent with seismological solutions. The high-resolution optical images from SuperView-1 satellite suggest that most of the linear surface features mapped by DInSAR measurements are landslides or surface cracks triggered by the earthquake. Coulomb stress changes on the source fault indicating consistency between aftershock distribution and high loaded stress zones. Based on the stress change on neighbouring active faults around this area, the Kermanshah Earthquake has brought two segments of the Zagros Mountain Front Fault (MFF), MFF-1 and MFF-2, 0.5-3.1 MPa and 0.5-1.96 MPa closer to failure, respectively, suggesting the risk of future earthquakes. Recent major aftershocks (M-W >= 5.0) could probably ease the seismic hazard on MFF-2, but the risk of earthquakes on MFF-2 is still increasing.

TI  - Mapping glacial lakes partially obscured by mountain shadows for time series and regional mapping applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain shadows in optical satellite images complicate the mapping of glacial lakes. Due to the rugged topography in periglacial alpine regions, many glacial lakes, especially smaller lakes, are partially shaded by mountain shadows in remotely sensed images. Shadows not only reduce the accuracy of lake mapping but also make changes in lake area hard to detect. In this paper, the characteristics of mountain shadows in remotely sensed imagery are explored, and their spatial relationships with regards to glacial lakes are modelled. Building on the previously developed Glacial Lakes Iterative Local Mapping (GLILM) method, a new water mapping approach is presented. The new method utilizes log-transformed spectral data and a normalized difference water index, NDWIblue, for delineating the boundaries of lakes within shadowed regions. The application of this approach is explored within the context of mapping lakes across space and time using Landsat images in the glacially dominated Tianshan mountainous of Central Asia. The results demonstrate that glacial lakes, both in sunlit and in shaded areas, can be mapped reliably, and that the results are useful for lake change analysis studies.

TI  - Achieving the end game: employing "vaccine diplomacy" to eradicate polio in Pakistan
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundOn April 28, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared polio a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHIC) under the authority of the International Health Regulations. Although polio has been eradicated from nearly every nation on earth, Pakistan is one of three countries where wild polio and vaccine-derived polio strains remain, thwarting global eradication efforts.AimsPolio eradication progress is complicated by security and conflict issues at the border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan. In addition to security issues,other critical challenges, such as maintaining cold supply chain for vaccines, active and sentinel surveillance, false beliefs about vaccines, distrust of healthcare workers, and accessibility to conflict areas due to terrorist activities, all play a role in the continued persistence of Polio. In response to these challenges, weassess the local and international policy environment and its impact on polio eradication in Pakistan.FindingsBased on our analysis of existing barriers and challenges associated with polio eradication in Pakistan, this study discusses why employing vaccine diplomacy represents a key policy and advocacy strategic approach to achieve the overall end game of polio eradication. Specifically, we identify a set of concrete public health, international development, and diplomatic and policy recommendations that can act synergistically under the umbrella of health and vaccine diplomacy to finally put an end to polio.

TI  - Mapping and quantification of ferruginous outcrop savannas in the Brazilian Amazon: A challenge for biodiversity conservation
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern Brazilian Amazon contains many isolated ferruginous savanna ecosystem patches (locally known as 'canga vegetation') located on ironstone rocky outcrops on the top of plateaus and ridges, surrounded by tropical rainforests. In the Caraja's Mineral Province (CMP), these outcrops contain large iron ore reserves that have been exploited by opencast mining since the 1980s. The canga vegetation is particularly impacted by mining, since the iron ores that occur are associated with this type of vegetation and currently, little is known regarding the extent of canga vegetation patches before mining activities began. This information is important for quantifying the impact of mining, in addition to helping plan conservation programmes. Here, land cover changes of the Canga area in the CMP are evaluated by estimating the pre-mining area of canga patches and comparing it to the actual extent of canga patches. We mapped canga vegetation using geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) from 1973 Landsat-1 MSS, 1984 and 2001 Landsat-5 TM, and 2016 Landsat-8 OLI images, and found that canga vegetation originally occupied an area of 144.2 km(2) before mining exploitation. By 2016, 19.6% of the canga area was lost in the CMP due to conversion to other land-use types (mining areas, pasturelands). In the Caraja's National Forest (CNF), located within the CMP, the original canga vegetation covered 105.2 km(2) (2.55% of the CNF total area), and in 2016, canga vegetation occupied an area of 77.2 km(2) (1.87%). Therefore, after more than three decades of mineral exploitation, less than 20% of the total canga area was lost. Currently, 21% of the canga area in the CMP is protected by the Campos Ferruginosos National Park. By documenting the initial extent of canga vegetation in the eastern Amazon and the extent to which it has been lost due to mining operations, the results of this work are the first step towards conserving this ecosystem.

TI  - Using long short-term memory recurrent neural network in land cover classification on Landsat and Cropland data layer time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover maps are significant in assisting agricultural decision making. However, the existing workflow of producing land cover maps is very complicated and the result accuracy is ambiguous. This work builds a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) model to take advantage of the temporal pattern of crops across image time series to improve the accuracy and reduce the complexity. An end-to-end framework is proposed to train and test the model. Landsat scenes are used as Earth observations, and some field-measured data together with CDL (Cropland Data Layer) datasets are used as reference data. The network is thoroughly trained using state-of-the-art techniques of deep learning. Finally, we tested the network on multiple Landsat scenes to produce five-class and all-class land cover maps. The maps are visualized and compared with ground truth, CDL, and the results of SegNet CNN (convolutional neural network). The results show a satisfactory overall accuracy (> 97% for five-class and > 88% for all-class) and validate the feasibility of the proposed method. This study paves a promising way for using LSTM RNN in the classification of remote sensing image time series.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Evaluation: What the Radiologist Needs to Know
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Axillary lymph node status is the single most important prognostic indicator in patients with breast cancer. Axillary lymph node dissection, the traditional method of staging breast cancer, is associated with significant morbidity. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has become standard in patients being treated for breast cancer with clinically negative lymph nodes. There is considerable variation in the medical literature regarding technical approaches to sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with breast cancer. The purpose of this article is to describe our preferred approaches to sentinel lymph node biopsy with a review of the literature.

TI  - A time-series analysis of urbanization-induced impervious surface area extent in the Dianchi Lake watershed from 1988-2017
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chinese urbanization has drawn widespread attention since the 21st century. Understanding urban expansion at a watershed scale including cities of different sizes is important for improving our current knowledge of the urban extent and its impact on the hydrological cycle, water management, surface energy balances, and biodiversity. Impervious surface area (ISA) can be used as a synthesized quantifiable index to reflect the intensity of natural ecosystems changing into urban ecosystems. It is important to understand ISA patterns and characteristics, which requires long-term impervious surface data at a high spatial and temporal resolution. Previous methods of ISA estimation mainly focused on the spectral differences between ISA and other land covers, and most studies were inclined to use one or a few images without fully considering the long time series of the temporal domain of the reflective data on remote-sensing images. This assessed the Dianchi Lake watershed as a case study area to illustrate ISA change characteristics in the context of natural and cultural conditions. Firstly, more than two hundred Landsat images (from 1988 to 2017) were downloaded through the United States Geological Survey (USGS) online portal. Secondly, the improved normalized difference build-up index (INDBI) and linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) algorithm were combined to apply the method to a series of ISA maps of the Dianchi Lake watershed at an annual resolution. Thirdly, ISA extent characteristics of the Dianchi Lake watershed were analysed from trend and pattern aspects. The results show that the proposed method was highly reliable for detecting and characterizing change, with an extracted ISA accuracy of 92.51%, based on a sample of independent validation points. The Dianchi Lake watershed has begun to adopt 'Rashly Advancing' and 'Great Leap Forward' strategies of urbanization.

TI  - Estimating crown diameters in urban forests with Unmanned Aerial System-based photogrammetric point clouds
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Field measurements are the main source of information when determining stand parameters, which are essential to produce an effective forest management plan. However, conducting terrestrial measurements is neither time- nor cost-efficient in most cases. In recent years, the advent of sophisticated remote sensing technologies has enabled the extraction of accurate and robust information about the physical characteristics of trees. Crown diameter is one of the most important stand parameters that should be measured or estimated. This study proposes a Polynomial Fitting Based (PFB) methodology to estimate crown diameters of urban trees with Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)-based data. Crown diameters estimated with the PFB methodology were compared not only to a reference data but also to those estimated based on five widely used image segmentation algorithms, which were the Mean Shift Segmentation (MSS), Morphological Profiles Based Segmentation (MPBS), Multiresolution Segmentation (MRS), Seeded Region Growing Segmentation (SRGS) and Watershed Segmentation (WS). Quantitative investigations revealed that the PFB approach outperformed the other segmentation-based approaches. The PFB approach estimated the crown diameters with root-mean-square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.69 m to 0.92 m. The PFB methodology was found to be a practical and robust approach for the estimation of crown diameters, which plays a very significant role in effective forest management.

TI  - Water-volume variations of Lake Hulun estimated from serial Jason altimeters and Landsat TM/ETM plus images from 2002 to 2017
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Hulun is the fifth largest lake in China. The dramatic water-volume variations since the 21th century has aroused concerns from local and transboundary water resource authorities. To track its dynamics during the past sixteen years with no aid of in-situ data, serial Jason altimeters and optical remote sensing images were integrated to reconstruct the time series of the water-volume variations. We developed a workflow consisting of four procedures: 1) Deriving the water-level time series using Jason-1, Jason-2 and Jason-3 after applying a feature-based waveform classification method and a targeted waveform retracking strategy; 2) Extracting the water-area by using Landsat images; 3) Establishing the relationship between water-level and water-area; and 4) Reconstructing the water-volume variation time series by integrating the water-level time series and the relationship derived from 3). We found that Lake Hulun has gone through three stages of changes: 1) Period one (2002-2009), water-level and volume dropped significantly at a rate of -0.40 m yr(-1) and -0.73 km(3) yr(-1), respectively. 2) Period two (2010-2012), the water-level and volume were relatively stable. 3) Period three (2013-2015), the water-level and volume began to rise rapidly at the rates of 1.09 m yr(-1) and 1.99 km(3) yr(-1), respectively. In addition, two significant change years (2007 and 2013) were detected, which corresponded well with extreme climatic conditions. Preliminary analyses indicate that the water-volume variations are closely related to precipitation and temperature anomalies in wet seasons.

TI  - Detecting dark spots from SAR intensity images by a point process with irregular geometry marks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the difficulties to determine the geometric shape of dark spots, this paper proposes an Irregular Geometry Marked Point Process (IGMPP) to detect dark spots from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Firstly, a series of random points used to define the locations of dark spots in the SAR image domain, and an irregular polygon mark associated with each random point indicates the shape of each dark spot. Subsequently, the pixels intensities in and out of the polygons are characterized with independent and identical Gamma distributions, respectively. By Bayesian paradigm, the number, sites, and geometry parameters of polygons are modelled with a posterior distribution. In order to simulate the posterior, a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) strategy is developed. Then, the optimal parameters concerning the dark spots can be obtained by a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) scheme. Experiments are performed by simulated SAR images. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effectively and efficiently applied to detect the dark spots.

TI  - Balance of Emission and Dynamical Controls on Ozone During the Korea-United States Air Quality Campaign From Multiconstituent Satellite Data Assimilation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Global multiconstituent concentration and emission fields obtained from the assimilation of the satellite retrievals of ozone, CO, NO2, HNO3, and SO2 from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2, Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere, Microwave Limb Sounder, and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS)/OMI are used to understand the processes controlling air pollution during the Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign. Estimated emissions in South Korea were 0.42TgN for NOx and 1.1Tg CO for CO, which were 40% and 83% higher, respectively, than the a priori bottom-up inventories, and increased mean ozone concentration by up to 7.51.6ppbv. The observed boundary layer ozone exceeded 90ppbv over Seoul under stagnant phases, whereas it was approximately 60ppbv during dynamical conditions given equivalent emissions. Chemical reanalysis showed that mean ozone concentration was persistently higher over Seoul (75.107.6ppbv) than the broader KORUS-AQ domain (70.59.2ppbv) at 700hPa. Large bias reductions (>75%) in the free tropospheric OH show that multiple-species assimilation is critical for balanced tropospheric chemistry analysis and emissions. The assimilation performance was dependent on the particular phase. While the evaluation of data assimilation fields shows an improved agreement with aircraft measurements in ozone (to less than 5ppbv biases), CO, NO2, SO2, PAN, and OH profiles, lower tropospheric ozone analysis error was largest at stagnant conditions, whereas the model errors were mostly removed by data assimilation under dynamic weather conditions. Assimilation of new AIRS/OMI ozone profiles allowed for additional error reductions, especially under dynamic weather conditions. Our results show the important balance of dynamics and emissions both on pollution and the chemical assimilation system performance.Plain Language Summary Global multi-constituent concentration and emission fields obtained from the assimilation of the satellite retrievals are used to understand the processes controlling air pollution during the Korea U.S.-Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign. Our results show the important balance of dynamics and emissions both on pollution and the chemical assimilation system performance.

TI  - Coastal Land Use in Northeast Brazil: Mangrove Coverage Evolution Over Three Decades
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is essential to monitor both the mangrove coverage and the encroachment of anthropogenic activities to assess the evolution of these highly valuable and threatened ecosystems. Using the grid technique, Landsat images of three estuaries in Pernambuco, northeast Brazil, were analyzed to track changes in land use over the past three decades. This study is the first time the grid technique has been used as a precise method to quantify and localize the mangrove coverage changes at local scale. We found that the technique was a synthetical and cost-effective way of observing land-use changes over the study period, and its precision was evident for local-scale study. An increasing trend of mangrove coverage was observed and can be related to the salinization. This increase in salinization is a result of anthropogenic activities and climate change. We also found that differences in geometrical properties influenced the spatiotemporal patterns of mangroves. To mitigate adequately the negative impacts induced by anthropization and climate change, the characteristics of mangrove forest configuration and human activities should therefore both be considered.

TI  - Foraging habitat choice of White-tailed Tropicbirds revealed by fine-scale GPS tracking and remote sensing
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The introduction of animal tracking technology has rapidly advanced our understanding of seabird foraging ecology. Tracking data is particularly powerful when combined with oceanographic information derived from satellite remote sensing, allowing insights into the functional mechanisms of marine ecosystems. While this framework has been used extensively over the last two decades, there are still vast ocean regions and many seabird species for which information is scarce, particularly in tropical oceans.Methods. In this study we tracked the movement at high GPS recording frequency of 15 White-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon lepturus) during chick-rearing from a colony in Fernando de Noronha (offshore of Northeast Brazil). Flight behaviours of travelling and searching for food were derived from GPS data and examined in relation to satellite-sensed oceanographic variables (sea surface temperature, turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentration).Results. White-tailed Tropicbirds showed marked preference for clear and warm sea surface waters, which are indicative of low primary productivity but are likely the best habitat for preying upon flying fish.Discussion. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that foraging habitat choices of tropical seabirds may not be driven by primary productivity, as has been widely shown for non-tropical species.

TI  - A Practical Single-Channel Algorithm for Land Surface Temperature Retrieval: Application to Landsat Series Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The single-channel (SC) algorithm has been widely used to retrieve land surface temperature from Landsat series data for its simplicity and requirement of only one thermal infrared channel. The main error sources of the existing SC algorithms are the linearization of the Planck's function and atmospheric correction. This paper proposed a practical SC (PSC) algorithm to retrieve land surface temperature from Landsat series data aiming at avoiding the aforementioned error sources. The sensitivity of the PSC algorithm to the input parameters was analyzed. The performance of the proposed PSC algorithm was compared with the most commonly used SC algorithm (the generalized SC, GSC) using a simulation data set and satellite measurements. Results showed that the PSC algorithm was less sensitive to uncertainties in the input parameters than the GSC algorithm. When validated with the simulation data set, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the PSC algorithm was 1.23K, with an improvement by 0.57K compared with the GSC algorithm. For the validation with 71 clear-sky Landsat 8 images, the RMSE of the PSC algorithm was 1.77K when using the measurements from U.S. surface radiation budget network as real values. Compared with the GSC algorithm, the RMSE improvement for the PSC algorithm was 0.47K. We conclude that the PSC algorithm is more accurate than the GSC algorithm and the sensitivity to input parameters in the PSC algorithm is weaker than in the GSC algorithm.

TI  - SBAS interferometric analysis for volcanic eruption of Hawaii island
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kilauea volcano on the Hawaii island started erupting on 3rd May 2018 after an earthquake of magnitude 5.0. The initial volcano eruption and the subsequent earthquakes resulted in the opening of new volcanic fissures, continuous lava flow at the lower east rift zone and the collapse of the summit caldera floor. All these activities continued until the 1st week of August 2018. The Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) technique is an advanced form of Differential Interferometry (DInSAR) which is capable of monitoring surface deformations with millimetre level accuracy. SBAS technique was utilised here for estimating the surface deformation on Hawaii island due to the volcanic episode. InSAR coherence technique was also utilised in this study for localised analysis at the summit and at the lower east rift zone to detect the time series deformation information and lava flow patterns. 14 interferometric datasets acquired by the ESA's Sentinel-1 C-band satellite from April 2018 to September 2018 were used in this study. The data acquired by the seismometers installed at Kilauea by Hawaii Volcano Observatory, the SWIR band of Sentinel-2 and the thermal band of Landsat-8 were used to correlate and verify the results obtained through the SBAS and InSAR coherence analysis. The combined interpretation of results obtained from all the sources gave insights about the underground magma conduit system, surface deformations, lava flow channels and the correlation between the magmatic and seismic activity happened there which are discussed in detail in this paper.

TI  - The importance of small fire refugia in the central Sierra Nevada, California, USA
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire refugia - the unburned areas within fire perimeters - are important to the survival of many taxa through fire events and the revegetation of post-fire landscapes. Previous work has shown that species use and benefit from small-scale fire refugia (1-1000 m(2)), but our understanding of where and how fire refugia form is largely limited to the scale of remotely sensed data (i.e., 900 m(2) Landsat pixels). To examine the causes and consequences of small fire refugia, we field-mapped all unburned patches >= 1 m(2 )within a contiguous 25.6ha forest plot that burned at generally low-to-moderate severity in the 2013 Yosemite Rim Fire, California, USA. Within the Yosemite Forest Dynamics Plot (YFDP), there were 685 unburned patches >= 1 m(2), covering a total unburned area of 12,597 m(2) (4.9%). Small refugia occurred in all fire severity classifications. Random forest models showed that the proportion of unburned area of 100 m(2) grid cells corresponded to pre-fire density and basal area of trees, distance to the nearest stream, and immediate fire mortality, but the relationships were complex and model accuracy was variable. From a pre-fire population of 34,061 total trees >= 1 cm diameter at breast height (1.37 m; DBH) within the plot (1330 trees ha(-1)), trees of all five of the most common species and those DBH < 30 cm had higher immediate survival rates if their boles were wholly or partially within an unburned patch (P <= 0.001). Trees 1 cm <= DBH < 10 cm that survived were located closer to the center of the unburned patch than the edge (mean 1.1m versus 0.6 m; ANOVA; P <= 0.001). Four-year survival rates for trees 1 cm <= DBH < 10 cm were 58.8% within small refugia and 2.7% in burned areas (P <= 0.001). Species richness and the Shannon Diversity Index were associated with unburned quadrats in NMDS ordinations 3 years post-fire. Bum heterogeneity in mixed-conifer forests likely exists at all scales and small refugia contribute to diversity of forest species and structures. Thus, managers may wish to consider scales from 1-m(2) to the landscape when designing fuel reduction prescriptions. The partial predictability of refugia location suggests that further work may lead to predictive models of refugial presence that have considerable potential to preserve ecological function or human habitation in fire-frequent forests.

TI  - Validation of a modified QuEChERS method for the analysis of organochlorine pesticides in fatty biological tissues using two-dimensional gas chromatography
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL AND LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of organic contaminants in the environment has gained tremendous traction in recent times, however, little attention has focused on the development of appropriate methods for the analysis of biological tissues from key sentinel species. In this study, a rapid, low-cost method is presented for the analysis of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in fatty biological tissues using a modified QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Efficient, Rugged and Safe) approach. The adapted extraction procedure is tested on biological samples of varying fat content, including fish muscle tissue and two previously untested matrices; coral and adipose tissue. Residue analyses were conducted by two-dimensional gas chromatography - time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOF-MS). The method was fully validated through the evaluation of recoveries, limits of detection, linearity and precision. Mean recoveries (n = 3) for all 18 target compounds ranged between 69 and 102% across all matrices, with relative standard deviations (RSD) < 10% in most cases, Limits of detection (LOD) ranged from 0.1 to 2.0 ng g(-1). The method was successfully applied to the analysis of real samples collected from iSimangaliso Wetland Park World Heritage Site, South Africa.

TI  - Monitoring and Analysis of the Spatio-temporal Change Characteristics of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration Over Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Its Surrounding Regions Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - To analyze the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of PM2.5 in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and its surrounding regions, a 1 km resolution AOT product was retrieved from MODIS data and the remote sensing inversion of the PM2.5 concentration in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and its surrounding regions was realized using the geographically weighted regression model. On this basis, the synthesis results of multi-timescale PM2.5 concentrations were verified and analyzed. Finally, the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of PM2.5 in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and its surrounding regions between 2016 and 2017 were compared and analyzed using different time scales. The results show that the verification of the PM2.5 concentration products of the average daily, monthly, and annual averages are in general good. The larger the time scale is, the better is the PM2.5 effect of the remote sensing estimation. The relative accuracy of the annual average PM2.5 products is higher than 80%. However, the precision of the PM2.5 remote sensing results for 2016 and 2017 is relatively close (at the same time scales). The PM2.5 distribution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and its surrounding regions shows a seasonal variation (winter > autum approximate to spring > summer). The spatial distribution is high in the southern but low in the northern part. Compared with 2016, the average PM2.5 concentration decreased by similar to 9.2% in 2017. The area with high values was significantly reduced. High PM2.5 concentrations occurred in November and December and low concentrations were observed in August. The PM2.5 concentration change between 2017 and 2016 is closely related to the comprehensive control crucial action and specific inspection activities of air pollution in 2017, which indirectly account for the effect of the reduction of the atmospheric pollution.

TI  - Land-use change from arable lands to orchards reduced soil erosion and increased nutrient loss in a small catchment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - China has been undergoing dramatic land-use change since the 1980s. More arable lands have been converted to orchards to produce high-value fruits. There is an urgent need to assess the effects of these land-use changes on soil erosion and nutrient loss in the country. In this study, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation model, geographical information systems, and, remote sensing data were used to evaluate the effects of land-use change on soil erosion and nutrient loss in the Yujiahe Catchment, where a significant portion of the arable land that grew wheat and maize between 1957 and 1989 was converted to kiwifruit orchards between 1990 and 2013. The total soil erosion from the catchment during 1957-2013 was in line with the sediments in the reservoir at the catchment outlet. Arable land was the major source of soil erosion and its erosion intensity was approximately ten times that of the orchards. The land-use change from arable land to orchard land since 1990 has reduced soil erosion intensity from severe to moderate. The arable land covering 28% of the catchment contributed to 81.3% of total organic matter loss and 80.4% of total nitrogen loss. However, the loss of available phosphorus mainly occurred in the orchards, representing 66.7% of the available phosphorus loss in the catchment. The soil erosion intensity of the arable land was highly sensitive to the land slope. We concluded that land use change from arable land to orchard land reduced soil erosion and increased the risk of nutrient loss from the catchment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impacts of a newly-developed aerosol climatology on numerical weather prediction using a global atmospheric forecasting model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - New four-dimensional aerosol climatology for global weather forecasting model is developed to take aerosol direct effect into account and its impacts on numerical weather prediction are investigated. The proposed aerosol climatology provides the global distribution of monthly-varying species-wise aerosol optical depths with more realistic aerosol vertical profiles. Including aerosol climatology enhances vertical stratification by surface cooling and atmospheric heating through the lower atmosphere by affecting radiation budget. Weakened vertical mixing and reduced surface fluxes related to aerosol loading result in decreased cloud fraction, particularly in the lower atmosphere. Evaluation of medium-range forecasts using the proposed aerosol climatology shows the overall improvement statistically for large-scale variable with reducing their biases, and the alleviation of systematic biases of overestimated light precipitation over the northern hemisphere.

TI  - A spatio-temporal analysis of canopy dynamics and intra-stand competition in a riparian forest, south-eastern Australia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread high stem density stands of riparian River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh.) (RRG) result from land management legacies in inland riverine ecosystems of Australia. These stands generally exhibit reduced structural complexity with many slender stems and few large trees. Higher competition for water among populations of RRG in dense stands may affect stand-level canopy condition, particularly when water is scarce. We investigated whether stem density and water availability affected canopy condition dynamics in RRG forests of Murray Valley National Park, New South Wales. We collected eight years of satellite derived Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) data (Landsat 5 TM (2008-2011) and Landsat 8 OLI (2013-2016)) encompassing some of the driest and wettest years on record in south-eastern Australia. We used Generalised Linear Mixed Effects Modelling to investigate the drivers of RRG canopy condition at the plot-level. Canopy condition dynamics were driven by different sets of variables under different climatic phases, with water availability at the plot and regional scale, as well as climate, being the primary drivers of trends in RRG canopy condition. Stem density was not found to be a significant predictor of overall RRG stand canopy condition, although results suggested that individuals in higher density stands have lower canopy condition on average. Live basal area (LBA) was positively correlated with FPC in all climatic phases, and stands with high LBA tended to have a greater abundance of large trees than low LBA stands. Research efforts should be made towards integrating site-specific tree size class distributions with remotely sensed metrics to guide management for biodiversity. Findings from this study provide a baseline understanding against which ecological restoration actions can be evaluated and a foundation upon which an ongoing monitoring program can be developed.

TI  - A multi-technology analysis of the 2017 North Korean nuclear test
T2  - SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - On 3 September 2017 official channels of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced the successful test of a thermonuclear device. Only seconds to minutes after the alleged nuclear explosion at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in the mountainous region in the country's northeast at 03:30:02 (UTC), hundreds of seismic stations distributed all around the globe picked up strong and distinct signals associated with an explosion. Different seismological agencies reported body wave magnitudes of well above 6.0, consequently estimating the explosive yield of the device on the order of hundreds of kT TNT equivalent. The 2017 event can therefore be assessed as being multiple times larger in energy than the two preceding North Korean events in January and September 2016.This study provides a multi-technology analysis of the 2017 North Korean event and its aftermath using a wide array of geophysical methods. Seismological investigations locate the event within the test site at a depth of approximately 0.6 km below the surface. The radiation and generation of P- and S-wave energy in the source region are significantly influenced by the topography of the Mt. Mantap massif. Inversions for the full moment tensor of the main event reveal a dominant isotropic component accompanied by significant amounts of double couple and compensated linear vector dipole terms, confirming the explosive character of the event. The analysis of the source mechanism of an aftershock that occurred around 8 min after the test in the direct vicinity suggest a cavity collapse. Measurements at seismic stations of the International Monitoring System result in a body wave magnitude of 6.2, which translates to an yield estimate of around 400 kT TNT equivalent. The explosive yield is possibly overestimated, since topography and depth phases both tend to enhance the peak amplitudes of teleseismic P waves. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar analysis using data from the ALOS-2 satellite reveal strong surface deformations in the epicenter region. Additional multispectral optical data from the Pleiades satellite show clear landslide activity at the test site. The strong surface deformations generated large acoustic pressure peaks, which were observed as infra-sound signals with distinctive waveforms even at distances of 401 km. In the aftermath of the 2017 event, atmospheric traces of the fission product Xe-133 were detected at various locations in the wider region. While for Xe-133 measurements in September 2017, the Punggye-ri test site is disfavored as a source by means of atmospheric transport modeling, detections in October 2017 at the International Monitoring System station RN58 in Russia indicate a potential delayed leakage of Xe-133 at the test site from the 2017 North Korean nuclear test.

TI  - Towards rapid assessments of tree species diversity and structure in fragmented tropical forests: A review of perspectives offered by remotely-sensed and field-based data
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - With forest fragmentation continuing in many parts of the tropics, it is likely that fragmented forests will become the rule for most remaining global tropical forests in the next decades. In this context, there is a need for practical tools to assess and monitor fragmented forests if we are to conserve tree species diversity as much as possible. Several methods, either using (1) field-based or (2) remote-sensing approaches could be used to achieve this goal. This paper aims at providing a state-of-the-art review of both approaches in order to make recommendations for rapid and cost-effective assessments of tree species diversity and forest structure, with specific applications in studies of fragmented tropical forests. Overall both methods have pros and cons, depending on the type of data needed to address the research objectives and the quantity of resources available. We suggest combining the use of both field-based and remotely-sensed methods as they can be complementary. Remote-sensing data should be used to predict and map the tree species diversity and stand structure at regional scales, while field-inventories provide accurate information at local scales and allow validation of remotely sensed data. For field-inventories, we recommend the use of small (e.g. 20 x 50 m) plots with a 10 cm DBH minimum measurement. In terms of remotely-sensed techniques, if funding is sufficient, airborne imagery seems the best regarding the quality of information (i.e. hyperspectral and hyperspatial imagery, LiDAR). If funding is limited, a cost-effective alternative providing reasonably accurate estimates would be the use of high-resolution satellite imagery such as Worldview. Ultimately, for studies where data accessible for free is the only possible option, we recommend the use of Sentinel-2, although it is relatively coarser in terms of quality. However, further research needs to be done to validate these approaches in fragmented tropical forests.

T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article compares the attitude estimated by nonlinear estimator Cubature Kalman Filter with results obtained by the Extended Kalman Filter and Unscented Kalman Filter. Currently these estimators are the subject of great interest in attitude estimation problems, however, mostly the Extended Kalman Filter has been applied to real problems of this nature. In order to evaluate the behavior of the Extended Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter and Cubature Kalman Filter algorithms when submitted to realistic situations, this paper uses real data of sensors on-board the CBERS-2 remote sensing satellite (China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite). It is observed that, for the case studied in this article, the filters are very competitive and present advantages and disadvantages that should be dealt with according to the requirements of the problem.

TI  - Estimating capacity of managed pine forests in the southeastern US to provide open pine woodland condition and gopher tortoise habitat
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Pine forests managed for economic return comprise 19% of southeastern U.S. forests and can provide vegetation structure and composition necessary for many wildlife species adapted to open pine conditions. However, in the absence of frequent fire and other disturbance in southeastern pine (Pinus spp.) forests, midstory hardwoods create closed canopy conditions limiting value of pine stands for many endemic, disturbance-adapted wildlife species. Limitations of past research investigating exact mechanisms for producing and maintaining open pine conditions in managed pine systems have led to a paucity of information regarding ecoregion applications and outcomes. This study evaluated (1) to what extent managed pine stands replicate open pine structural conditions and (2) to what extent managed pine stands provide habitat for the gopher tortoise, an open pine keystone species. We used summary statistics from existing literature to identify structural metrics provided by managed loblolly pine (P. taeda) stands and compared them to disturbance-maintained open pine woodlands. We used spatially-explicit forest management simulations to determine amount and configuration of open pine woodland conditions within two large (> 9000 ha), economically-feasible managed pine landscapes in the East and West Gulf Coastal Plains ecoregions. As a case study, we estimated availability and connectivity of gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) habitat, in managed pine stands of the East Gulf Coastal Plains. Pine stands planted at <= 1310 stems/ha (<= 530 stems/ac) provide up to four years of "excellent" open pine condition for wildlife following commercial thinning, based on desired conditions for southern pine forests, with temporal availability depending on site quality. Mid-rotation applications of prescribed fire and selective herbicide can extend "excellent" open pine condition initiated by commercial thinning up to an additional four years. Landscape metrics indicated that, under typical management practices, open pine stands can be spatially and temporally connected to the extent necessary to facilitate among-patch movement for many open pine-adapted species of conservation concern. Our landscape analyses indicated tortoises using primarily regenerating and thinned stands potentially can have a relatively even flow of suitable habitat conditions and opportunities to move to adjacent or nearby open stands when currently-occupied stands reach canopy closure. The disturbance regimes inherent in pine plantation management create diverse landscapes that conserve plant and wildlife biodiversity while meeting economic objectives. Therefore, pine plantations may complement current conservation efforts for open pine woodland species dependent on or tolerant of large-scale disturbance and shifting habitat conditions while offering refuge for high vagility species.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This article presents a cloud-free snow cover dataset with a daily temporal resolution and 0.05 degrees spatial resolution from March 2000 to February 2017 over the contiguous United States (CONUS). The dataset was developed by completely removing clouds from the original NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Snow Cover Area product (MOD10C1) through a series of spatiotemporal filters followed by the Variational Interpolation (VI) algorithm; the filters and VI algorithm were evaluated using bootstrapping test. The dataset was validated over the period with the Landsat 7 ETM+ snow cover maps in the Seattle, Minneapolis, Rocky Mountains, and Sierra Nevada regions. The resulting cloud-free snow cover captured accurately dynamic changes of snow throughout the period in terms of Probability of Detection (POD) and False Alarm Ratio (FAR) with average values of 0.955 and 0.179 for POD and FAR, respectively. The dataset provides continuous inputs of snow cover area for hydrologic studies for almost two decades. The VI algorithm can be applied in other regions given that a proper validation can be performed.

TI  - Lineament mapping and fractal analysis using SPOT-ASTER satellite imagery for evaluating the severity of slope weathering process
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study describes a remote sensing approach for preparing lineament map that subsequently indicates the influence of lineament density in the severity of weathering development. In this study, SPOT-5 data, the integration of SPOT-ASTER and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data were used and processed. The existence of an active fault system in the south of Mashhad city, NE Iran and presence of schistose rocks in this area result in the development of numerous lineament features. This region was selected for this research. Lineament features including fractures, bedding plane, cleavage, shear zones and schistosity were mapped in the study area. The results indicate that the highest concentration of lineaments occurred in the central-western and south-eastern parts of the study area, which coincide with metamorphic outcrops and NW-SE trending fault system. A comparison of lineament statistical analysis and field survey demonstrated that the structural discontinuities have a significant effect on forming and distribution of weathering profiles. It was observed that increasing the number, length and density of structural discontinuities led to strong severity in weathering, which can produce deep residual soils susceptible to landslide occurrence. The remote sensing approach developed in this study can be applicable for preparing lineament maps and evaluating the severity of weathering development in other active fault zones around the world.

T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Different types of classification techniques are available in the literature for the classification of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data into various land cover classes. Various SAR images are available for land cover classification such as ALOS PALSAR (PALSAR-1, PALSAR-2), RADARSAT and ENVISAT. In this paper, we have attempted to explore probability distribution function (pdf) based land cover classification using PALSAR-2 data. Over 20 different statistical distribution functions are analyzed for different classes based on statistical parameters. Probability distribution functions are selected based on Chi-squared goodness of fit test for each individual class. A decision tree based classifier is developed for classification based on the selected pdf functions and its statistical parameters. The proposed classification approach has an accuracy of 83.93%.

TI  - Monitoring river channel dynamics using remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - River channel dynamics are natural autogenic occurrences for fluvial rivers with influences from human modifications and climatic factors. Remote sensing and geographic information system tools and techniques, aerial photographs, and satellite imagery have been used to determine epochal channel erosion, accretion, and unchanged locations along Tana River, Kenya's longest river. Six reaches within a 142-km Saka-Mnazini stretch were studied by comparing sequential changes in the position of the channel in 1975-1986, 1986-2000, 2000-2017, and 1975-2017 epochs. Manual and automatic digital processing procedures and GIS tools were applied to visualize and quantify the reach-wise spatial and temporal morphological changes. The erosion and accretion channel changes over the study period were observed and quantified at all reaches. Meandering and switching off or abandoning the main active channel was also illustrated. The potential driving forces of morphological changes included varying hydrological regime, upstream land use practices, nature of channel gradient, and riparian vegetation occurrence changes. We found no clear evidence to link river regulation with the river channel dynamics. Results deliver the latest evidence on the dynamics of Tana River. This information is crucial for understanding river evolution characteristics and aid in planning and management at the lower reaches which has remained poorly understood. Use of remote sensing data in concert with GIS provides efficient and economical quantitative spatial and temporal analysis of river channel changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Satellite-based regional warming hiatus in China and its implication
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The slowdown in global warming since 1998, often termed the global warming hiatus. Reconciling the "hiatus" is a main focus in the 2013 climate change conference. Accurately characterizing the spatiotemporal trends in surface air temperature (SAT) is helps to better understand the "hiatus" during the period. This article presents a satellite-based regional warming simulation to diagnose the "hiatus" for 2001-2015 in China. Results show that the rapid warming is mainly in western and southern China, such as Yunnan (mean +/- standard deviation: 0.39 +/- 0.26 degrees C (10 yr)(-1)), Tibet (0.22 +/- 0.25 degrees C (10 yr)(-1)), Taiwan (0.21 +/- 0.25 degrees C (10 yr)(-1)), and Sichuan (0.19 +/- 0.25 degrees C (10 yr)(-1)). On the contrary, there is a cooling trend by 0.29 +/- 0.26 degrees C (10 yr)(-1) in northern China during the recent 15 yr, where awarming rate about 0.38 +/- 0.11 degrees C (10 yr)(-1) happened for 1960-2000. Overall, satellite simulation shows that the warming rate is reduced to -0.02 degrees C (10 yr)(-1). The changes in underlying surface, Earth's orbit, solar radiation and atmospheric counter radiation (USEOSRACR) cause China's temperature rise about 0.02 degrees C (10 yr)(-1). A combination of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other natural forcing (ONAT, predominately volcanic activity, and atmosphere and ocean circulation) explain another part of temperature trend by approximately -0.04 degrees C (10 yr)(-1). We conclude that there is a regional warming hiatus, a pause or a slowdown in China, and imply that GHGs-induced warming is suppressed by ONAT in the early 21st century. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Reconstruction of Water Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Reflectance Based on Sparse Representation and Its Application
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral satellite sensor have several limitations with respect to capturing the target's spectral information due to their band setting and numbers of bands. The hyperspectral reconstruction technique is an effective method to obtain hyperspectral information from multispectral data. In this study, we propose a hyperspectral reconstruction algorithm based on the sparse representation of water reroute sensing reflectance. The proposed algorithm was validated for five ocean color sensors ( Sentinel-2A MSI, MERIS, MODIS Aqua, GOCI, and VIIRS) using in situ measured above-water remote sensing reflectance. The mean absolute percentage error ( MAPE) and root mean square error ( RMSE) of the reconstructed and measured spectra for five ocean color sensors were less than 10% and 0. 005 sr(-1), respectively. Compared with the spectra reconstruction algorithm based on multi-variable linear regression, the proposed algorithm can obtain the features of complex water remote sensing reflectance without using in situ-measured reflectance for algorithm tuning. In addition, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is better than the spectra reconstruction algorithm based on multi-variable linear regression. Two spectra reconstruction algorithms were applied to five ocean color sensors to test the applicability of the remotely estimated water constituent concentration. The statistical results for the reconstructed spectral factors and in situ water constituent concentration suggest that the reconstructed reflectance derived by the proposed algorithm has a performance similar to that of in situ-measured hyperspectral reflectance. The reconstructed reflectance derived by the proposed algorithm performs better than the spectra reconstruction algorithm based on multi-variable linear regression. Finally, the proposed algorithm was applied to GOCI data to remotely estimate the chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter concentrations. The accuracy of the water constituent concentration estimated from reconstructed images is better than that using original multispectral images. For the estimation of the chlorophyll-a concentration, the MAPE improved from 80. 6% to 51. 5% and the RMSE improved from 12. 175 mu g.L(-1 )to 7. 125 mu g.L-1. For the estimation of total suspended matter, the MAPE improved from 19. 1% to 18. 8% and the RMSE improved from 29. 048 mg.L-1 to 28. 596 mg.L-1.

TI  - Detection of the dispersion and residence of volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> and sulfate aerosol from Nabro in 2011
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous detection of dispersion and residence of volcanic plumes in troposphere and lower stratosphere is vitally important for improving the understanding on the role of volcano eruptions in climate change. We report a 3-month continuous detection of dispersion and residence of volcanic plumes in the troposphere and stratosphere generated from the volcanic SO2 erupted by Nabro in Eritrea on June 12th, 2011 observed by the OMI sensor. The background SO2 concentration of 3 different height layers in troposphere and lower stratosphere were estimated by the 3-year-average daily concentration of monthly SO2 in 2005, 2007 and 2013, when there were no large explosive volcanic eruptions occurring. We also traced the diffusion path and the concentration of volcanic SO2 for the first 3 months after Nabro's eruption, and detected the appearance and dissipation of sulfate aerosols, which is a product converted from volcanic SO2. The results show that after Nabro erupted on June 12th, the volcanic plumes spread to middle latitudes (30 degrees N -60 degrees N) of Northern Hemisphere and loading by westerly jet. The volcanic SO2 in middle troposphere layer (TRM) and lower troposphere layer (TRL) stopped eastward spreading, and dissipated over the western Pacific Ocean on June 23rd. On June 26th, the volcanic SO2 in upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (STL) reached Mexico in Central America, and almost encircled the low latitudes and parts of middle latitudes. On June 28th, the volcanic SO2 plume showed an even distribution in STL. 37 days after the eruption, the volcanic SO2 in STL encircled the Northern Hemisphere evenly, sulfate aerosols in STL largely covered the low and middle latitudes and the daily concentration of SO2 was still higher than the background value. One month after the eruption, the global mean daily concentration of SO2 dropped to the normal value, but the daily concentration of SO2 and sulfate aerosols in low latitudes remained high, and dissipated not earlier than 3 months after the eruption of Nabro.

TI  - Biophysical feedback of global forest fires on surface temperature
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The biophysical feedbacks of forest fire on Earth's surface radiative budget remain uncertain at the global scale. Using satellite observations, we show that fire-induced forest loss accounts for about 15% of global forest loss, mostly in northern high latitudes. Forest fire increases surface temperature by 0.15 K (0.12 to 0.19 K) one year following fire in burned area globally. In high-latitudes, the initial positive climate-fire feedback was mainly attributed to reduced evapotranspiration and sustained for approximately 5 years. Over longer-term (>5 years), increases in albedo dominated the surface radiative budget resulting in a net cooling effect. In tropical regions, fire had a long-term weaker warming effect mainly due to reduced evaporative cooling. Globally, biophysical feedbacks of fire-induced surface warming one year after fire are equivalent to 62% of warming due to annual fire-related CO2 emissions. Our results suggest that changes in the severity and/or frequency of fire disturbance may have strong impacts on Earth's surface radiative budget and climate, especially at high latitudes.

TI  - Source characteristics of the 2017 M<sub>w</sub>6.4 Moijabana, Botswana earthquake, a rare lower-crustal event within an ancient zone of weakness
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2017 Moijabana earthquake in central Botswana (M(w)6.4) was a large and deep event for a continental interior and occurred in a region with little historical seismicity. Based on InSAR measurements of surface deformation spanning the event and teleseismic observations, we determine the ruptured fault plane and finite rupture model of the earthquake. Although this oblique normal-faulting earthquake is too deep to uniquely determine the rupture plane geometry from InSAR alone, the best-fitting fault plane constrained by the joint inversion of teleseismic waveforms and InSAR data has a southwest dip and a strike of 126 degrees, roughly consistent with the geologically mapped strike of the Kaapvaal craton's northern edge. Our results indicate that the earthquake had a total duration of similar to 10 s, characterized by two major asperities. The first asperity nucleated in the lower crust and then the rupture propagated up-dip. The lower crustal asperity shows a much shorter rise time compared with the shallower asperity, indicating that contrasts in stress or material properties may have played an important role in the rupture process. The earthquake appears to have occurred in the Limpopo belt, a Proterozoic orogenic belt that represents an ancient zone of weakness between the Archean Zimbabwe and Kaapvaal cratons. In the present day, this zone of weakness may be responding to the stress field imposed by the East African Rift System. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Short-term climate trends and the Swiss needle cast epidemic in Oregon's public and private coastal forestlands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Swiss needle cast (SNC) is a fungal disease of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) that is having important consequences on tree growth in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region of the USA. Once considered innocuous in PNW forests, SNC symptom expression has increased rapidly in extent and intensity in recent decades. Previous research has linked the disease epidemiology of SNC to climate, and observations indicate a link with forestry practices of the 20th century as well, particularly with the conversion of old growth and mature mixed-conifer forests to young monocultures of Douglas-fir on private forestlands. Given the sensitivity of SNC intensification to forestry practices and changing climatic conditions, it seems plausible that disease behavior response to short-term directional climate changes could differ between contrasting forest management regimes. We compared the relationship between trends in canopy energy and water flux parameters detected during the spring and summer months (May-August) along the Pacific Coast of Oregon from 2003 to 2012, and the distribution of SNC symptoms in 2012 on private and public lands. Canopy energy and water exchange parameters were calculated with MODIS Land Surface Temperature (1ST), and evapotranspiration (ET) data, and with Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) precipitation data. We found that a higher level of deviance in SNC presence/absence could be explained on private land compared with public land. Proximity to coast explained 9.3% of the deviance on private land and 6.7% on public land. Trends in LST during May and August emerged as important and explained 7% of the deviance in SNC symptom distribution on private land compared with 2% on public land. When combined with proximity to coast, May and August LST explained 14% of the deviance in SNC symptom expression on private land and 8.7% on public land. We found a significant difference between public and private ownership for the proportion of SNC (p = 0.0006), and a significant interaction between ownership and distance to coast (p = 0.0019), such that across public and private ownership, distance to coast has a different effect. LST may provide valuable information on leaf wetness, or thermal properties of the canopy, possibly capturing both early season and late season dynamics important to SNC epidemiology. We find evidence that recent short-term directional climate changes may have contributed to differences in symptom development in Douglas-fir forests on private and public land, with symptoms more prevalent on private land.

TI  - A fine-scale state-space model to understand drivers of forest fires in the Himalayan foothills
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical forests situated in the Himalayan foothills (terai) experience frequent wildfires which can alter the vegetation structure and composition, challenging tiger conservation efforts in this region. Hence, there is a need for better understanding of the drivers of forest fire to aid efficient management, but these efforts are hampered by the deficiency of spatial and temporal data on fire incidences. Advancement in remote sensing technology provides an opportunity to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of wildfires in relation to anthropogenic, ecological, and environmental drivers. We used MODIS fire data from 2001 to 2015 to understand fire incidences in Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR), an important tiger habitat area in the Himalayan terai region. We analyzed fire incidences to understand monthly and inter-annual variation of fire incidences at two spatial scales: first, using only climatic variables considering VTR as a single spatial unit and the second, to understand the fire dynamics at 1 km(2) spatial resolution using climatic, ecological, and anthropogenic variables. The results show that fire incidences occurred from January to May, 88% of which occurred in March and April. Overall, different variables affected fire incidences in March and April for both the temporal models. Precipitation had a significant negative effect on fire incidences in both March and April, but temperature had a positive effect only in March. Similarly, the fine scale temporal model showed that while ecological (litter load, NPP) and anthropogenic (distance to villages and roads) variables influenced fire incidences in March, altitude and village area surrounding the forest affected fires in April. Litter input, distance to nearest villages, and village area had a nonlinear relationship with fire incidences indicating a few inconsistencies with the global patterns of fire with human activity. We show that the Sal dominated forests and terai grasslands at low altitudes (200 m), falling within a zone of 2.5-3 km from villages and with good road connectivity are more prone to fire. The fine-scale fire prediction map of VTR will be helpful to the Tiger Reserve management in developing appropriate strategies for the fire prone areas.

TI  - Simulation of the land surface temperature from moon-based Earth observations
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter for the Earth's energy balance. As a natural satellite of the Earth, the orbital of the moon differs from that of current Earth observation satellites. It is a new way to measure the land surface temperature from the moon and has many advantages compared with artificial satellites. In this paper, we present a new method for simulating the LST measured by moon-based Earth observations. Firstly, a modified land-surface diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) method is applied to obtain the global LST at the same coordinated universal time (UTC) using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products. The lunar elevation angles calculated using the ephemeris data (DE405) from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) were then applied to simulate the Earth coverage observed from the moon. At the same time, the modified DTC model was validated using in situ data, MODIS LST products, and the FengYun-2F (FY-2F) LST, respectively. The results show that the fitting accuracy (root-mean-square error, RMSE) of the modified DTC model is not greater than 0.72 degrees C for eight in situ stations with different land cover types, and the maximum fitting RMSE of the modified model is smaller than that of current DTC models. By the comparison of the simulated LST with MODIS and FY-2F LST products, the errors of the results were feasible and accredited, and the simulated global LST has a reasonable spatiotemporal distribution and change trend. The simulated LST data can therefore be used as base datasets to simulate the thermal infrared imagery from moon-based Earth observations in future research. (C) 2018 COSPAR.

TI  - A pink enlarging plaque on the plantar foot: amelanotic acral lentiginous melanoma.
T2  - Dermatology online journal
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Acral lentiginous melanomas account for less than 5% of all melanomas, whereas amelanotic melanomas account for around 2-8% of all melanomas. Amelanotic acral lentiginous melanomas are even less common and can often be mistaken for other clinical entities, including pyogenic granulomas, non-melanoma skin cancers, and warts. We describe a man in his 50s with a twenty-year history of a skin-colored plaque on the right plantar foot; after enlargement and failure of wart treatment, a shave biopsy revealed an amelanotic melanoma. A subsequent wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy revealed melanoma in 4 lymph nodes and the patient underwent an abbreviated course of interferon-alpha therapy. The patient remained stable until 2 ? years after diagnosis, at which time he presented with in-transit metastases on the foot and right thigh; he has since been stable on nivolumab. This case represents the challenge of diagnosing amelanotic melanomas on acral surfaces and highlights the importance of considering a skin biopsy for diagnosis of any changing, atypical amelanotic lesions on the feet or hands.

TI  - Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells: Development, Regulation, and Function
T2  - IMMUNITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a unique sentinel cell type that can detect pathogen-derived nucleic acids and respond with rapid and massive production of type I interferon. This review summarizes our current understanding of pDC biology, including transcriptional regulation, heterogeneity, role in antiviral immune responses, and involvement in immune pathology, particularly in autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency, and cancer. We also highlight the remaining gaps in our knowledge and important questions for the field, such as the molecular basis of unique interferon-producing capacity of pDCs. A better understanding of cell type-specific positive and negative control of pDC function should pave the way for translational applications focused on this immune cell type.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study aimed to comprehensively assess the potential watershed health (WH) using an adapted reliability, resilience and vulnerability (RelResVul) framework for the 24 sub-watersheds of Shazand, Markazi Province, Iran. Towards this goal, the appropriate criteria and acceptable corresponding thresholds were adapted to calculate the main WH indictors of reliability (R-el), resilience (R-es) and vulnerability (V-ul). Accordingly, the RelResVul framework was conceptualized and customized for five criteria of standardized precipitation index (SPI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil erosion, and low and high flow discharges. The effect sizes of used criteria and indicators on the Shazand WH status were also determined. Consequently, the status of R-el, R-es and V-ul indicators and integrated WH status were mapped for four years of 1986, 1998, 2008 and 2014 and for the whole watershed by developing an integrated watershed health index (IWHI). Finally, the change detection approachwas applied to determine the trend of changes in IWHI during last three decades. The results approved the high variability in effectability of R-el, R-es and V-ul indicators and integrated health status of the Shazand Watershed from the selected criteria in study four years. The results revealed that in the all study years, the Rel indicator almost had the higher contribution rate (>= 34%) in the ShazandWH. None of sub-watersheds in the study years were assessed in a healthy status in terms of IWHI based on the RelResVul framework. In terms of WH change detection over the study periods, WH was found to declining by some 4% in the periods of 1986-1998 and 1986-2008 due to impact of industrialization and urban development. Whilst, the health status was non-significantly improved in other study periods. The present procedure can be supposed as a screening tool for a directive and efficient management of the watersheds.

T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture deficit is a key variable used in operational fire prediction and management applications. In Australia, operational fire management practices use simple, empirical water balances models to estimate soil moisture deficit. The Bureau of Meteorology has recently developed a prototype, high-resolution, land surface modelling based, state-of-the-art soil moisture analyses for Australia. The present study examines this new product for use in operational fire prediction and management practices in Australia. The approach used is twofold. First, the new soil moisture product is evaluated against observations from ground based networks. Among the results, the mean Pearson's correlation for surface soil moisture across the three in-situ networks is found to be between 0.78 and 0.85. Secondly, the study evaluate a few different calibration methods to facilitate the ready utilization of the new soil moisture product in the current operational fire prediction framework. The calibration approaches investigated here are: minimum-maximum matching, mean-variance matching and, cumulative distribution function matching. Validation of the calibrated products using extended triple collocation technique shows that the minimum-maximum method has the highest skill. Evaluation of the calibrated products against MODIS fire radiative power data highlights that large fires correspond to a drier soil in minimum-maximum outputs compared to other calibration results and the current operational method.

M3  - Article
AB  - By fitting with the aerosol optical depth ( AOD) from AERONET ground observations at sites in Beijing, Xianghe, and Xinglong with different environmental backgrounds, MODIS C051 Dark Target ( DT C051) , C006 Dark Target ( DT C006) , C006 Deep Blue (DB C006) , and C006 Deep Blue/Dark Target merged AOD products were compared and evaluated to understand their applicability in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The main conclusions are as follows : (1) The comparison of the C051 and C006 algorithms shows that the accuracy of the AOD at the Beijing and Xianghe sites notably improved, while an improvement was not observed at the Xinglong site; the DB C006 AOD is closest to the AERONET AOD at the Beijing site and the DT C006 AOD is closest to the AERONET AOD at the Xianghe site; the combined C006 AOD is closest to the AERONET AOD at the Xinglong site. (2) The inversion error of the MODIS DT C006 at the Beijing site is caused by the improper selection of the aerosol model and surface reflectance; the inversion error of the MODIS DB C006 is mainly due to surface reflectance in spring and the aerosol model in winter. (3) Compared with the DT C051 AOD, the effective data coverage of the DT C006 is reduced, but that of DB C006 and the combined C006 increased; the combined C006 AOD data have the largest coverage. The results show that the application of the combined AOD product is best for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.

TI  - The impact of crop farmers' decisions on future land use, land cover changes in Kintampo North Municipality of Ghana
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to assess the rate and land category contributing to the changes in seven land-uses in the Kintampo North Municipality of Ghana and the effect of the decisions of land users on future landscapes. Design/methodology/approach LANDSAT images were classified to generate land use/cover maps to detect changes that had occurred between 1986 and 2014. In total, 120 farmers were also interviewed to determine their perceptions on land use changes. Interval, category and transition levels of changes were determined. Savanna woodland, settlement and forest were mostly converted to farmland in both intervals (1986-2001 and 2001-2014). Findings Results showed that rock outcrop, plantation, cropland and savanna woodland increased at an annual rate of 13.86, 1.57, 0.82 and 0.33 per cent, respectively, whilst forest, settlement and water body decreased at 4.90, 1.84 and 1.17 per cent annual rate of change, respectively. Approximately, 74 per cent of farmers will not change land use in the future, while 84.2 per cent plan to increase farm sizes. Research limitations/implications The study shows that more land cover will be targeted for conversion as farmers expand their farmlands. There is the need for strict implementation of appropriate land use/cover policies to sustain food production in the region in this era of changing climate and population increase. Originality/value This research assessed the land use changes in the Kintampo North Municipality and its impacts on agriculture and carbon stocks release via land use changes. It identified how the decisions of the local farmers on land management will affect future landscape.

TI  - Assessment of the effectiveness of supervised and unsupervised methods: maximizing land-cover classification accuracy with spectral indices data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of different supervised and unsupervised methods with information derived from Landsat satellite images and fieldwork in order to maximize the land cover classification accuracy in an area with geomorphologic differences and heterogeneous edaphic characteristics located in the southwest of the Pampas (Argentina). We test two datasets: bands-based and indices-based and also we analyze the spectral behavior of each land cover identified by field trips and surveys with farmers to improve the spatial samples employed in the digital processing. Complementarily, we study the spatial and temporal information about the land cover changes during 2000 to 2016. The classification based on indices widely outperforms the analyses based on bands. The best methods to classify the land cover are the Mahalanobis distance and the maximum likelihood. The values of kappa coefficient and overall accuracy obtain from these two methods allow us to realize a multitemporal study. This study provides essential information for semiarid regions with rain-fed agriculture and livestock activities worldwide. The knowledge obtained quickly and accurately about the land covers and their changes provides essential information about the past and current situations and can be used to predict likely future trends.

TI  - Optimizing Monitoring Programs: A Case Study Based on the OSPAR Eutrophication Assessment for UK Waters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The data and results of the UK second application of the OSPAR Common Procedure (COMP) for eutrophication were used as a case study to develop a generic system (i) to evaluate an observational network from a multi-variable point of view, (ii) to introduce additional datasets in the assessment, and (iii) to propose an optimized monitoring program to help reduce monitoring costs. The method consisted of tools to analyse, by means of simple statistical techniques, if any reduction of the available datasets could provide results comparable with the published assessments, and support a reduced monitoring program (and limited loss in confidence). The data reduction scenarios included the removal of an existing dataset or the inclusion of freely available third-party data (FerryBox, satellite observations) with existing datasets. Merging different datasets was problematic due to the heterogeneity of the techniques, sensors and scales, and a cross validation was carried out to assess possible biases between the different datasets. The results showed that there was little margin to remove any of the available datasets and that the use of extensive datasets, such as satellite data, has an important effect, often leading to a change in assessment results with respect to the thresholds, generally moving from threshold exceedance to non-exceedance. This suggested that the results of the original assessment might be biased toward sampling location and time and emphasized the importance of monitoring programmes providing better coverage over large spatial and temporal scales, and the opportunity to improve assessments by combining observations, satellite data, and model results.

TI  - Resisting hostility generated by terror: An agent-based study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose an agent-based model leading to a decrease or an increase of hostility between agents after a major cultural threat such as a terrorist attack. The model is inspired from the Terror Management Theory and the Social Judgement Theory. An agent has a cultural identity defined through its acceptance segments about each of three different cultural worldviews (i.e., Atheist, Muslim, Christian) of the considered society. An agent's acceptance segment is composed from its acceptable positions toward a cultural worldview, including its most acceptable position. An agent forms an attitude about another agent depending on the similarity between their cultural identities. When a terrorist attack is perpetrated in the name of an extreme cultural identity, the negatively perceived agents from this extreme cultural identity point of view tend to decrease the width of their acceptance segments in order to differentiate themselves more from the threatening cultural identity. We generated a set of populations with cultural identities compatible with data from a survey on attitudes among a large sample representative of the population of France; we then simulated the reaction of these agents facing a terrorist attack from Muslim extremists. For most populations, the average attitude toward Muslims becomes more negative. However, for some specific populations, we noticed the opposite effect as the average attitude of the population toward Muslims becomes less negative. In these populations, the Muslim agents strongly differentiate themselves from the terrorists' extreme cultural identity, and the other agents are aware of these changes. These reactions are due to particular properties of their cultural identities that are identified in this paper.

TI  - Impact of mineral dust on shortwave and longwave radiation: evaluation of different vertically resolved parameterizations in 1-D radiative transfer computations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol radiative properties are investigated in southeastern Spain during a dust event on 16-17 June 2013 in the framework of the ChArMEx/ADRIMED (Chemistry-Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment/Aerosol Direct Radiative Impact on the regional climate in the MEDiterranean region) campaign. Particle optical and microphysical properties from ground-based sun/sky photometer and lidar measurements, as well as in situ measurements on board the SAFIRE ATR 42 French research aircraft, are used to create a set of different levels of input parameterizations, which feed the 1-D radiative transfer model (RTM) GAME (Global Atmospheric ModEl). We consider three datasets: (1) a first parameterization based on the retrievals by an advanced aerosol inversion code (GRASP; Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties) applied to combined photometer and lidar data, (2) a parameterization based on the photometer columnar optical properties and vertically resolved lidar retrievals with the two-component Klett-Fernald algorithm, and (3) a parameterization based on vertically resolved optical and microphysical aerosol properties measured in situ by the aircraft instrumentation. Once retrieved, the outputs of the RTM in terms of both shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes are compared against ground and in situ airborne measurements. In addition, the outputs of the model in terms of the aerosol direct radiative effect are discussed with respect to the different input parameterizations. Results show that calculated atmospheric radiative fluxes differ no more than 7% from the measured ones. The three parameterization datasets produce a cooling effect due to mineral dust both at the surface and the top of the atmosphere. Aerosol radiative effects with differences of up to 10 Wm(-2) in the shortwave spectral range (mostly due to differences in the aerosol optical depth) and 2 Wm(-2) for the longwave spectral range (mainly due to differences in the aerosol optical depth but also to the coarse mode radius used to calculate the radiative properties) are obtained when comparing the three parameterizations. The study reveals the complexity of parameterizing 1-D RTMs as sizing and characterizing the optical properties of mineral dust is challenging. The use of advanced remote sensing data and processing, in combination with closure studies on the optical and microphysical properties from in situ aircraft measurements when available, is recommended.

TI  - Impact of experience in breast cancer surgery on survival: the role of quality of care in a registry-based cohort
T2  - SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - AIMS OF THE STUDY: Previous studies have suggested that the surgeon's experience in breast cancer surgery may affect patient survival. In this registry-based retrospective cohort study, we examined whether quality of care could partly explain this association.METHODS: All invasive breast cancers operated on in the private sector between 2000 and 2009 were identified in the Geneva Cancer Registry and followed up for 5 years. Surgeons were classified according to their experience into three categories: <= 5, 6-10, >10 breast cancer operations performed per year. We extracted patient and tumour characteristics. Quality of care was scored as the proportion of 11 quality indicators correctly fulfilled for each patient. Breast cancer-specific mortality was examined with a Cox model adjusted for variables known to affect survival, surgeon experience, and quality of care.RESULTS: A total of 1489 patients were operated on by 88 surgeons; 50 patients (3.4%) died from breast cancer during the 5 years of follow-up. Socioeconomic status and country of birth of the patients, as well as period of diagnosis, differed according to the surgeons' experience. Quality of care provided improved with surgeon's experience. Surgeons performing >10 operations/year more frequently assessed histology before surgery, excised sentinel lymph nodes, removed >= 10 lymph nodes, and prescribed adjuvant radiotherapy when indicated. Crude breast cancer-specific mortality was lower in patients treated by surgeons performing > 10 compared with <= 5 operations/year (hazard ratio [HR] 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.67; p = 0.002). The strength of the association decreased after adjustment for patient and tumour characteristics (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.94; p = 0.034) and decreased further after adjustment for quality of care (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.24-1.08, p = 0.078).CONCLUSIONS: The association between surgeon's experience and 5-year breast cancer survival is at least partly explained by quality of care, patient and tumour characteristics. Further investigations on the impact of other quality indicators such as multidisciplinary networks are needed.

TI  - Poor Readability of Online Patient Resources Regarding Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Melanoma
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundEstablished guidelines recommend that patient educational materials should be set at no higher than a sixth-grade reading level to be considered adequately comprehensible to the general public. Our study objective was to assess the readability of online patient resources related to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as part of treatment for melanoma.Materials and methodsThe top 50 results from a Google search (search terms: "sentinel lymph node biopsy melanoma") were analyzed using seven established readability formulae in order to determine their level of adherence to current guidelines.ResultsWe found that the readability of available online patient resources is currently very poor, with only 12% of the websites meeting the sixth-grade reading level criteria according to at least one measure, and 0% meeting the criteria according to all seven assessment tools. Furthermore, half of search results were peer-reviewed academic journal articles not intended for the general public.Discussion and conclusionsOnline patient resources related to SLNB carried out as part of melanoma treatment have poor readability. Several simple measures may be taken in order to make these resources more accessible and comprehensible to a broader audience. These resources should undergo ongoing evaluation, with the ultimate goal being improved readability and patient education.

TI  - Object-based image analysis approach for vessel detection on optical and radar images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Commercial satellites for Earth observation can integrate conventional positioning and tracking systems for monitoring legal and illegal activities by sea, in order to effectively detect and prevent events threatening human life and environment. This study describes an object-oriented approach to detect vessels combining high- and medium-resolution optical and radar images. Once detected, the algorithm estimates their position, length, and heading and assigns a speed range. Tests are done using WorldView-2, QuickBird, GeoEye-1, Sentinel-2A, COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1 data imaged in several test sites including China, Australia, Italy, Hong Kong, and the western Mediterranean Sea. Validation of results with data from the automatic identification system shows that the estimates for length and heading have R-2 = 0.85 and R-2 = 0.92, respectively. Tests for evaluating speed from Sentinel-2 time-lag image displacement show encouraging results, with 70% of estimates' residuals within +/- 2 m/s. Finally, our method is compared to the state-of-the-art search for unidentified maritime object (SUMO), provided by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. Finally, our method is compared to the state-of-the-art SUMO. Tests with Sentinel-1 data show similar results in terms of correct detections. Nevertheless, our method returns a smaller number of false alarms compared to SUMO. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Enhanced normalized difference index for impervious surface area estimation at the plateau basin scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface (IS) area is an important indicator of ecological environment condition in the basin. We propose an index for IS extraction [i.e., enhanced normalized difference impervious surfaces index (ENDISI)] by integrating the spectrum character of Landsat-operational land imager (OLI) images, and an automatic threshold selection method using the generalized Gaussian model. Dianchi and Erhai Basin are employed as study areas to test the ENDISI method at the plateau basin scale. The results show that: (1) the ENDISI can reduce the impacts of arid land, bare rock, and bare soil on IS extraction effectively; (2) ENDISI had a much higher separability degree between ISs and pervious surfaces compared with normalized difference built-up index, modified normalized difference IS index, and combinational biophysical composition index; and (3) the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient values of IS extraction via automatic threshold selection exceed 93.9% and 82.4%, respectively. Therefore, the ENDISI can serve as an effective index algorithm for rapid and high-precision IS extraction at the plateau basin scale. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Individual tree crown delineation and tree species classification with hyperspectral and LiDAR data
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - An international data science challenge, called National Ecological Observatory Network-National Institute of Standards and Technology data science evaluation, was set up in autumn 2017 with the goal to improve the use of remote sensing data in ecological applications. The competition was divided into three tasks: (1) individual tree crown (ITC) delineation, for identifying the location and size of individual trees; (2) alignment between field surveyed trees and ITCs delineated on remote sensing data; and (3) tree species classification. In this paper, the methods and results of team Fondazione Edmund Mach (FEM) are presented. The ITC delineation (Task 1 of the challenge) was done using a region growing method applied to a near-infrared band of the hyperspectral images. The optimization of the parameters of the delineation algorithm was done in a supervised way on the basis of the Jaccard score using the training set provided by the organizers. The alignment (Task 2) between the delineated ITCs and the field surveyed trees was done using the Euclidean distance among the position, the height, and the crown radius of the ITCs and the field surveyed trees. The classification (Task 3) was performed using a support vector machine classifier applied to a selection of the hyperspectral bands and the canopy height model. The selection of the bands was done using the sequential forward floating selection method and the Jeffries Matusita distance. The results of the three tasks were very promising: team FEM ranked first in the data science competition in Task 1 and 2, and second in Task 3. The Jaccard score of the delineated crowns was 0.3402, and the results showed that the proposed approach delineated both small and large crowns. The alignment was correctly done for all the test samples. The classification results were good (overall accuracy of 88.1%, kappa accuracy of 75.7%, and mean class accuracy of 61.5%), although the accuracy was biased toward the most represented species.

TI  - Utilizing Flood Inundation Observations to Obtain Floodplain Topography in Data-Scarce Regions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood models predict inundation extents, and can be an important source of information for flood risk studies. Accurate flood models require high resolution and high accuracy digital elevation models (DEM); current global DEMs do not capture the topographic details in floodplains, and this often leads to inaccurate prediction of flood extents by flood models. Flood extents obtained from remotely sensed data provide indirect information about topography. Here, we attempt to use this information along with model predictions to produce better floodplain topography. The algorithm we describe is a two-step process: first, we reduce the noise along the observed flood boundaries for all particles. Then, the model predictions from these modified DEMs are assimilated with observations using a particle batch smoother. We implemented the algorithm for a synthetic test case. For the nominal case, we observed a significant improvement in accuracy in terms of RMSE (35% reduction), bias (20%), and standard deviation (40%). We conducted sensitivity analysis by using priors of varying bias (0.5, 1, and 2 m) and standard deviation (1, 2, and 4 m). The bias reduced to similar to 0.5 m or below in all the cases: the reduction in bias varied from 11 to 76%. The standard deviation of errors in the final estimate was almost half of the prior: the reduction varied from 40 to 49%. The reduction in RMSE ranged between 35 and 67%. For the case with 2 m bias and 4 m standard deviation (SRTM-like error levels), bias went down to 0.48 m (76% reduction), and standard deviation reduced to 2.24 m (44% reduction). Flood inundation maps produced from the final estimate DEMs also improved on its prior. For the 2 m bias cases, true positive rate (TPR) for peak inundation went from similar to 30% to more than 57% in all three cases. The algorithm produces promising results, and this type of analysis can be performed in data-poor floodplains where high resolution DEMs do not exist.

TI  - General Comparison of FY-4A/AGRI With Other GEO/LEO Instruments and Its Potential and Challenges in Non-meteorological Applications
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological satellites have become an indispensable tool for weather and land observation. Traditionally, geostationary (GEO) satellites have been used in operational meteorological services due to their high temporal resolution, while polar-orbiting satellites, with their high spatial resolution, are applied more to monitor environmental change and natural disasters. The development of China's next-generation geostationary meteorological satellites (the FY-4 series) represents an exciting expansion of Chinese non-meteorological remote sensing capabilities. The first satellite (FY-4A) of the FY-4 series was launched on 11 December 2016. The Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) on board FY-4A has 14 spectral bands (increased from the 5 bands of FY-2) that are quantized with 12 bits per pixel (up from 10 bits for FY-2) and sampled at 1 km at nadir in the visible (VIS), 2 km in the near-infrared (NIR), and 4 km in the remaining IR spectral bands (compared with 1.25 km for VIS, no NIR, and 5 km for IR of FY-2). In later satellites in the FY-4A series, the AGRI channel number will be gradually increased from 14 to 18 with IR spatial resolution of 2 km, and the full-disk temporal resolution will be enhanced from 15 to 5 min. With their improved spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution properties, the FY-4 series will gradually approach low earth orbiting (LEO) sensors in spatial and spectral resolution, which will offer greater opportunity and capability for observing small objects and rapid changes in land, ocean, and atmosphere. This review paper provides an introduction to the Chinese FY-4 observation capabilities, a comparison of FY-4 with other new-generation GEO and LEO weather satellites, and associated non-meteorological applications. A series of typical examples based on recent and on-going operational work in National Satellite Meteorological Center of China Meteorological Administration (NSMC/CMA) that use FY-4A data for non-meteorological applications are demonstrated and discussed, including (i) aerosol monitoring, (ii) dust monitoring, (iii) volcanic ash detection and aviation applications, (iv) fire detection and dynamical evaluation, (v) water body detection, and (vi) floating algae monitoring. The paper concludes with a synthesis of these application areas and the challenges that CMA has to address for future research, technological innovation, and in-depth applications.

T2  - Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To understand the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in 5 populations in China during 2016-2017 and provide evidence for the estimation of prevalence trend of hepatitis C and evaluation on the prevention and control effect. Methods: A total of 87 national sentinel surveillance sites for hepatitis C were set up in 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) of China to obtain the information about HCV infection prevalence in 5 populations, including volunteer blood donors, people receiving physical examination, patients receiving invasive diagnosis and treatment, patients receiving hemodialysis, and clients visiting family planning outpatient clinics. From April to June, 2016 and 2017, cross-sectional surveys were repeatedly conducted in the 5 populations and blood samples were collected from them for HCV antibody detection. Results: In 2016, 86 sentinel sites completed the surveillance (one sentinel site was not investigated), and 115 841 persons were surveyed. The overall HCV positive rate was 0.38% (442/115 841, 95%CI: 0.23%-0.53%). In 2017, all the 87 sentinel sites completed the surveillance, and 120 486 persons were surveyed. The overall HCV positive rate was 0.37% (449/120 486, 95%CI: 0.23%-0.52%). In 2016 and 2017, the anti-HCV positive rates were 4.46% (223/5 005, 95%CI: 2.18%-6.73%) and 4.39% (216/4 919, 95%CI: 2.29%-6.50%) respectively in hemodialysis patients, 0.85% (44/5 200, 95%CI: 0.27%-1.42%) and 0.70% (36/5 150, 95%CI: 0.15%-1.24%) respectively in patients receiving invasive diagnosis and treatment and remained to be ≤0.25% in volunteer blood donors, people receiving physical examination and clients visiting family planning outpatient clinics. Results for the comparison of the anti-HCV positive rates in the 5 populations indicated that the differences were significant (F=23.091, P<0.001 in 2016 and F=20.181, P<0.001 in 2017). Conclusions: Data from the sentinel surveillance of HCV infection on prevalence in China showed that the anti-HCV positive rates varied in the 5 populations during 2016-2017. The anti-HCV positive rate appeared the highest in the hemodialysis patients, followed by that in the patients receiving invasive diagnosis and treatment, and the prevalence of HCV infection in other 3 populations were at low levels.

TI  - Temporal resolution of internal magnetic field modes from satellite data
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We aim to obtain a modal decomposition of the internal geomagnetic field. In order to do so, we perform a principal component analysis of two virtual observatory datasets, with 4-month sampling time, from the CHAMP (2001-2009) and Swarm (2014-2017) satellite records. The spatial patterns of well-resolved modes calculated from the three field components all have internal origin as expected for these datasets, except for one Swarm mode. For both datasets, we find that the modes with the shortest timescales have also the smallest length scales as expected from a physical standpoint. Also, the energy ordering of the modes is from the least to the most variable, in agreement with independent results on the main field data spectrum. This is not achieved in regularised inversions of geomagnetic field data into time-varying spherical harmonic decomposition, where the highest degree terms have also the poorest time resolution. The improved accuracy of Swarm data is reflected in the lower level of the noise variance.

TI  - Detection of illicit sand mining and the associated environmental effects in China's fourth largest freshwater lake using daytime and nighttime satellite images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Illegal sand mining activities are rampant in coastal and inland water around the world and result in increased water turbidity, reduced water transparency, damage to fish spawning sites and adverse effects on the health of aquatic ecosystems. However, many sand dredging vessels hide during the day and work at night, rendering conventional monitoring measures ineffective. In this study, illegal sand dredging activities and the associated aquatic environmental effects were investigated in Lake Hongze (the fourth largest freshwater lake in China) using both conventional daytime satellite data, including MODIS/Aqua and Landsat TM/ETM data as well as VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB) nighttime light (NTL) data, the following results were obtained. (1) The Landsat data revealed that sand dredging vessels first appeared in February 2012 and their number (monthly average: 658) peaked in 2016, and sand dredging stopped after March 2017. (2) The VIIRS NTL data were satisfactory for monitoring nighttime illegal dredging activities, and they more accurately reflected the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of dredging vessels due to their high frequency. (3) Observations from the MODIS data acquired since 2002 showed three distinct stages of changes in the suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations of Lake Hongze that were consistent with the temporal distributions of sand dredging vessels. (4) The contribution of dredging vessels to the increases in SPM concentration was quantitatively determined, and night times and dredging activities were found to have disturbed the waters more significantly. (5) The effectiveness of government measures implemented at various stages to control illegal sand dredging activities were scientifically evaluated. This study provides technological support for government monitoring and the control of illegal sand dredging activities and can serve as a valuable reference for water bodies similar to Lake Hongze worldwide.

TI  - Cloud Detection Based on Multi-Scale Dilation Convolutional Neural Network for ZY-3 Satellite Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the accuracy of cloud detection, we propose a multi-scale dilation convolutional neural network method. Combining with the characteristic of satellite images, we design the deep convolution network structure, which includes a deep-feature coding module, a local dilation perception module, and a cloud-dense decoding module. First, the deep-features of cloud arc obtained by the basic convolutional layer in conjunction with the coding module. Second, multi-scale dilation convolution layers jointed with pooling layers arc used to perceive corporately. A nonlinear function is employed in each block to improve the effectiveness of network model expression. Finally, the cloud-dense decoding module integrate the features corresponding to those included in the coding module and then utilize the L1 regularization upsampling algorithm to accomplish the end-to-end pixel-level cloud detection task. Cloud detection experiments arc performed in the typical cloud mask areas; the results arc compared with those of the Otsu algorithm and the FCN-8S method. The results indicate that the accuracy of proposed method is higher and the Kappa coefficient is effectively improved.

TI  - Geostatistical prediction of water lead levels in Flint, Michigan: A multivariate approach
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite several environmental crises, little research has been conducted on citywide geospatial modeling of water lead levels (WLL) in public distribution systems. This paper presents the first application of multivariate geostatistics to lead in drinking water within a distribution system, specifically in Flint, Michigan. One of the key features of the Flint data is their collection through two different sampling initiatives: (i) voluntary or homeowner-driven sampling where by concerned citizens decided to acquire a testing kit and conduct sampling on their own (10,717 sites), and (ii) State administered sampling where data were collected bi-weekly at 809 selected sites after training of residents by technical teams (sentinel sites). These two datasets were first averaged over the 41-week sampling period and each tax parcel to attenuate sampling fluctuations and create a set of 420 tax parcels sampled by both protocols. Both variables displayed a correlation of 0.62 while their direct and cross-semivariograms showed substantial nugget effect and a long range of 7.5 km. WLLs recorded at sentinel sites and deemed more reliable by city officials were then interpolated using cokriging to account for the more densely sampled voluntary data and information on service line composition (lead, other, or unknown) available for each of 51,045 residential tax parcels. Cross-validation demonstrated the greater prediction accuracy of the multivariate geostatistical approach relative to kriging and inverse square distance weighting interpolation using only sentinel data. This general procedure is applicable to other cities with aging infrastructure where lead in drinking water is a concern. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lymph node positivity in different early breast carcinoma phenotypes: a predictive model
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundA strong correlation between breast cancer (BC) molecular subtypes and axillary status has been shown. It would be useful to predict the probability of lymph node (LN) positivity. Objective: To develop the performance of multivariable models to predict LN metastases, including nomograms derived from logistic regression with clinical, pathologic variables provided by tumor surgical results or only by biopsy.MethodsA retrospective cohort was randomly divided into two separate patient sets: a training set and a validation set. In the training set, we used multivariable logistic regression techniques to build different predictive nomograms for the risk of developing LN metastases. The discrimination ability and calibration accuracy of the resulting nomograms were evaluated on the training and validation set.ResultsConsecutive sample of 12,572 early BC patients with sentinel node biopsies and no neoadjuvant therapy. In our predictive macro metastases LN model, the areas under curve (AUC) values were 0.780 and 0.717 respectively for pathologic and pre-operative model, with a good calibration, and results with validation data set were similar: AUC respectively of 0.796 and 0.725.Among the list of candidate's regression variables, on the training set we identified age, tumor size, LVI, and molecular subtype as statistically significant factors for predicting the risk of LN metastases.ConclusionsSeveral nomograms were reported to predict risk of SLN involvement and NSN involvement. We propose a new calculation model to assess this risk of positive LN with similar performance which could be useful to choose management strategies, to avoid axillary LN staging or to propose ALND for patients with high level probability of major axillary LN involvement but also to propose immediate breast reconstruction when post mastectomy radiotherapy is not required for patients without LN macro metastasis.

TI  - Assessing data assimilation frameworks for using multi-mission satellite products in a hydrological context
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With a growing number of available datasets especially from satellite remote sensing, there is a great opportunity to improve our knowledge of the state of the hydrological processes via data assimilation. Observations can be assimilated into numerical models using dynamics and data-driven approaches. The present study aims to assess these assimilation frameworks for integrating different sets of satellite measurements in a hydrological context. To this end, we implement a traditional data assimilation system based on the Square Root Analysis (SQRA) filtering scheme and the newly developed data-driven Kalman-Takens technique to update the water components of a hydrological model with the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage (TWS), and soil moisture products from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) in a 5-day temporal scale. While SQRA relies on a physical model for forecasting, the Kalman-Takens only requires a trajectory of the system based on past data. We are particularly interested in testing both methods for assimilating different combination of the satellite data. In most of the cases, simultaneous assimilation of the satellite data by either standard SQRA or Kalman-Takens achieves the largest improvements in the hydrological state, in terms of the agreement with independent in-situ measurements. Furthermore, the Kalman-Takens approach performs comparably well to dynamical method at a fraction of the computational cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The application of multi-mission satellite data assimilation for studying water storage changes over South America
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Constant monitoring of total water storage (TWS; surface, groundwater, and soil moisture) is essential for water management and policy decisions, especially due to the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic factors. Moreover, for most countries in Africa, Asia, and South America that depend on soil moisture and groundwater for agricultural productivity, monitoring of climate change and anthropogenic impacts on TWS becomes crucial. Hydrological models are widely being used to monitor water storage changes in various regions around the world. Such models, however, comes with uncertainties mainly due to data limitations that warrant enhancement from remotely sensed satellite products. In this study over South America, remotely sensed TWS from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission is used to constrain the World-Wide Water Resources Assessment (W3RA) model estimates in order to improve their reliabilities. To this end, GRACE-derived TWS and soil moisture observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) are assimilated into W3RA using the Ensemble Square-Root Filter (EnSRF) in order to separately analyze groundwater and soil moisture changes for the period 2002-2013. Following the assimilation analysis, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)'s rainfall data over 15 major basins of South America and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) data are employed to demonstrate the advantages gained by the model from the assimilation of GRACE TWS and satellite soil moisture products in studying climatically induced TWS changes. From the results, it can be seen that assimilating these observations improves the performance of W3RA hydrological model. Significant improvements are also achieved as seen from increased correlations between TWS products and both precipitation and ENSO over a majority of basins. The improved knowledge of sub-surface water storages, especially groundwater and soil moisture variations, can be largely helpful for agricultural productivity over South America.

TI  - Gaussian Mixture Model and Classification of Polarimetric Features for SAR Images
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the various statistical characteristics such as peak tailing presented in the high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, we model the polarimetric features according to the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and come up with a constrained distance estimation algorithm for the parameters of multivariate Gaussian mixture distribution. Under the framework of greedy expectation maximum algorithm, a constraint distance function is designed and the number of mixed components and model parameters arc automatically estimated in this parameter estimation algorithm. Consequently the classification of polarimetric SAR images is realized under the Bayesian framework. The classification results of three groups of image data from Radarsat-2 in San Francisco and other places indicate that the proposed GMM classification algorithm possesses an overall accuracy higher by 7% -10% comparing with those by the classical classification algorithms. Moreover, its dependence on sample number is small. The more accurate classification results can be obtained in heterogeneous regions such as urban and farmland.

TI  - Could axillary clearance be avoided in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients with positive nodes diagnosed by ultrasound guided biopsy in the post-ACOSOG Z0011 era?
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectivesThe role of ultrasound (US) guided biopsy in selecting patients for an upfront lymph node dissection (ALND) has been controversial following the publication of the American College of Surgeons (ACOSOG) Z0011 data. The purpose of this study was to investigate if patients with positive axillary lymph nodes (LNs) proven by US guided biopsy should be recommended for ALND and to analyze the utility of preoperative US and US guided biopsy in planning axillary surgery to avoid both unnecessary ALND and unnecessary SLNB.MethodsPatients with a positive preoperative LN biopsy were identified and evaluated to determine their suitability for inclusion according to the criteria proposed in the Z0011 data. The correlation of the number of suspicious nodes found using US with the number of positive nodes on ALND was studied.ResultsA total of 261 breast cancer patients who had a positive preoperative LN needle biopsy were identified, among them, 79 patients with cT1-2N0 breast cancer and ALND were enrolled in the study. Thirty-one patients (39.2%) had <= 2 positive nodes identified in pathology and 10 patients (12.7%) met all of the Z0011 criteria and might have been spared ALND. A significantly greater proportion of women with. 3 positive nodes during ALND had > 1 abnormal LN identified using US compared to women with <= 2 positive LNs found using ALND (66.7% vs. 6.5%, p<0.0001).ConclusionUS with needle biopsy is valuable to patients with multiple suspicious nodes found using US while SLND without US guided needle biopsy is suggested if only one abnormal LN is detected on US in the post-Z0011 era.

T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-4 (GF-4) satellite is the first geosynchronous high-resolution optical imaging satellite developed by China, and it has high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution. Aiming at the characteristics of GF-4 satellite data, we propose a cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithm combining spectral analysis and geometrical algorithms. Geometrically corrected and radiometrically calibrated GF-4 images arc used to identify potential cloud pixels using spectral difference analysis techniques based on the spectral characteristics of clouds and typical land surfaces. The cloud probability is calculated according to the difference of spectral variability rate of clouds and cloudless features. The geometrical relationship between clouds and cloud shadows is combined with the sensor parameters to identify the projective regions of cloud shadows. Then the image-based dynamic thresholds arc set in the projection regions based on the spectral characteristics of the shadows to detect cloud shadows. This algorithm can better identify thin clouds, and significantly improve the cloud shadow detection accuracy. The visual interpretation method is used to verify the detection accuracy. It finds that cloud pixels recognition in different regions arc more accurate and the shapes arc relatively complete. Compared with the method of cloud and cloud shadow matching, the dynamic-spectral -threshold algorithm proposed in this paper is more accurate in detecting cloud shadows.

TI  - Oil palm expansion and deforestation in Southwest Cameroon associated with proliferation of informal mills
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm expansion resulted in 2 million hectares (Mha) of forest loss globally in 2000-2010. Despite accounting for 24% (4.5 Mha) of the world's total oil palm cultivated area, expansion dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa have been overlooked. We show that in Southwest Cameroon, a top producing region of Africa, 67% of oil palm expansion from 2000-2015 occurred at the expense of forest. Contrary to the publicized narrative of industrial-scale expansion, most oil palm expansion and associated deforestation is occurring outside large agro-industrial concessions. Expansion and deforestation carried out by non-industrial producers is occurring near low-efficiency informal mills, unconstrained by the location of high efficiency company-owned mills. These results highlight the key role of a booming informal economic sector in driving rapid land use change. High per capita consumption and rising palm oil demands in sub-Saharan Africa spotlight the need to consider informal economies when identifying regionally relevant sustainability pathways.

TI  - Improving estimates of built-up area from night time light across globally distributed cities through hierarchical modeling
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Built-up area has become an important indicator for studying urban environments, but mapping built-up area at the regional/global scale remains challenging due to the complexity of impervious surface features. Nighttime light data (NTL) is one of the major remote sensing data sources for regional/global built-up or impervious surface mapping. A single regression relationship between fractional built-up/impervious area and NTL or various indices derived based on NTL and vegetation index (e.g., NDVI) data had been established in many previous studies. However, due to the varying geographical, climatic, and socio-economic characteristics of cities, the same regression relationship may vary significantly across cities. In this study, we examined the regression relationship between percentage of built-up area (pBUA) and vegetation adjusted nighttime light urban index (VANUI) for 120 randomly selected cities around the world with a hierarchical hockey-stick regression model. We found that there is a substantial variability in the slope (0.658 +/- 0.318), the threshold VANUI (-1.92 +/- 0.769, log scale) after which the linear relationship holds, and the coefficient of determination R-2 (0.71 +/- 0.14) among globally distributed cities. A small proportion of this substantial variability can be attributed to socio-economic status (e.g., total population, GDP per capita) and landscape structures (e.g., compactness and fragmentation). Due to these variations, our hierarchical model or no-pooling model (i.e., fit each city individually) can significantly improve model prediction accuracy (17% in terms of root mean squared error) over a complete-pooling model. We, however, recommend hierarchical models as they can provide meaningful priors for future modeling under a Bayesian framework, and achieve higher prediction accuracy than no-pooling models when sample size is small.

TI  - Forest floor temperature and greenness link significantly to canopy attributes in South Africa's fragmented coastal forests
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical landscapes are changing rapidly due to changes in land use and land management. Being able to predict and monitor land use change impacts on species for conservation or food security concerns requires the use of habitat quality metrics, that are consistent, can be mapped using above-ground sensor data and are relevant for species performance. Here, we focus on ground surface temperature (Thermal(ground)) and ground vegetation greenness (NDVIdown) as potentially suitable metrics of habitat quality. Both have been linked to species demography and community structure in the literature. We test whether they can be measured consistently from the ground and whether they can be up-scaled indirectly using canopy structure maps (Leaf Area Index, LAI, and Fractional vegetation cover, FCover) developed from Landsat remote sensing data. We measured Thermal(ground) and NDVIdown across habitats differing in tree cover (natural grassland to forest edges to forests and tree plantations) in the human-modifiedcoastal forested landscapes of Kwa-Zulua Natal, South Africa. We show that both metrics decline significantly with increasing canopy closure and leaf area, implying a potential pathway for upscaling both metrics using canopy structure maps derived using earth observation. Specifically, our findings suggest that opening forest canopies by 20% or decreasing forest canopy LAI by one unit would result in increases of Thermal(ground) by 1.2 degrees C across the range of observations studied. NDVIdown appears to decline by 0.1 in response to an increase in canopy LAI by 1 unit and declines nonlinearly with canopy closure. Accounting for micro-scale variation in temperature and resources is seen as essential to improve biodiversity impact predictions. Our study suggests that mapping ground surface temperature and ground vegetation greenness utilising remotely sensed canopy cover maps could provide a useful tool for mapping habitat quality metrics that matter to species. However, this approach will be constrained by the predictive capacity of models used to map field-derived forest canopy attributes. Furthermore, sampling efforts are needed to capture spatial and temporal variation in Thermal(ground) within and across days and seasons to validate the transferability of our findings. Finally, whilst our approach shows that surface temperature and ground vegetation greenness might be suitable habitat quality metric used in biodiversity monitoring, the next step requires that we map demographic traits of species of different threat status onto maps of these metrics in landscapes differing in disturbance and management histories. The derived understanding could then be exploited for targeted landscape restoration that benefits biodiversity conservation at the landscape scale.

TI  - Rafting behaviour of seabirds as a proxy to describe surface ocean currents in the Balearic Sea
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal variability of surface geostrophic mesoscale currents in the Balearic Sea (western Mediterranean) is characterized from satellite altimetry in combination with in-situ velocity measurements collected, among others, by drifting buoys, gliders and high-frequency radar. Here, we explore the use of tracking data from living organisms in the Balearic Sea as an alternative way to acquire in-situ velocity measurements. Specifically, we use GPS-tracks of resting Scopoli's shearwaters Calonectris diomedea, that act as passive drifters, and compare them with satellite-derived velocity patterns. Results suggest that animal-borne GPS data can be used to identify rafting behaviour outside of the breeding colonies and, furthermore, as a proxy to describe local sea surface currents. Four rafting patterns were identified according to the prevailing driving forces responsible for the observed trajectories. We find that 76% of the bird trajectories are associated with the combined effects of slippage and Ekman drift and/or surface drag; 59% are directly driven by the sea surface currents. Shearwaters are therefore likely to be passively transported by these driving forces while resting. The tracks are generally consistent with the mesoscale features observed in satellite data and identified with eddy-tracking software.

TI  - ProGeM: a framework for the prioritization of candidate causal genes at molecular quantitative trait loci
T2  - NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of molecular phenotypes such as metabolites, lipids and proteins through genome-wide association studies represents a powerful means of highlighting molecular mechanisms relevant to human diseases. However, a major challenge of this approach is to identify the causal gene(s) at the observed QTLs. Here, we present a framework for the Prioritization of candidate causal Genes at Molecular QTLs' (ProGeM), which incorporates biological domain-specific annotation data alongside genome annotation data from multiple repositories. We assessed the performance of ProGeM using a reference set of 227 previously reported and extensively curated metabolite QTLs. For 98% of these loci, the expert-curated gene was one of the candidate causal genes prioritized by ProGeM. Benchmarking analyses revealed that 69% of the causal candidates were nearest to the sentinel variant at the investigated molecular QTLs, indicating that genomic proximity is the most reliable indicator of true positive' causal genes. In contrast, cis-gene expression QTL data led to three false positive candidate causal gene assignments for every one true positive assignment. We provide evidence that these conclusions also apply to other molecular phenotypes, suggesting that ProGeM is a powerful and versatile tool for annotating molecular QTLs. ProGeM is freely available via GitHub.

TI  - Representation of fire, land-use change and vegetation dynamics in the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator vn4.9 (JULES)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbance of vegetation is a critical component of land cover, but is generally poorly constrained in land surface and carbon cycle models. In particular, land-use change and fire can be treated as large-scale disturbances without full representation of their underlying complexities and interactions. Here we describe developments to the land surface model JULES (Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) to represent land-use change and fire as distinct processes which interact with simulated vegetation dynamics. We couple the fire model INFERNO (INteractive Fire and Emission algoRithm for Natural envirOnments) to dynamic vegetation within JULES and use the HYDE (History Database of the Global Environment) land cover dataset to analyse the impact of land-use change on the simulation of present day vegetation. We evaluate the inclusion of land use and fire disturbance against standard benchmarks. Using the Manhattan metric, results show improved simulation of vegetation cover across all observed datasets. Overall, disturbance improves the simulation of vegetation cover by 35% compared to vegetation continuous field (VCF) observations from MODIS and 13% compared to the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) from the ESA. Biases in grass extent are reduced from -66% to 13 %. Total woody cover improves by 55% compared to VCF and 20% compared to CCI from a reduction in forest extent in the tropics, although simulated tree cover is now too sparse in some areas. Explicitly modelling fire and land use generally decreases tree and shrub cover and increases grasses. The results show that the disturbances provide important contributions to the realistic modelling of vegetation on a global scale, although in some areas fire and land use together result in too much disturbance. This work provides a substantial contribution towards representing the full complexity and interactions between land-use change and fire that could be used in Earth system models.

T2  - BMC GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundOptimum flowering time is a key agronomic trait in Brassica napus. To investigate the genetic architecture and genetic regulation of flowering time in this important crop, we conducted quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of flowering time in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, including lines with extreme differences in flowering time, in six environments, along with RNA-Seq analysis.ResultsWe detected 27 QTLs distributed on eight chromosomes among six environments, including one major QTL on chromosome C02 that explained 11-25% of the phenotypic variation and was stably detected in all six environments. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 105 flowering time-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that play roles in the circadian clock/photoperiod, autonomous pathway, and hormone and vernalization pathways. We focused on DEGs related to the regulation of flowering time, especially DEGs in QTL regions.ConclusionsWe identified 45 flowering time-related genes in these QTL regions, eight of which are DEGs, including key flowering time genes PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (PRR7) and FY (located in a major QTL region on C02). These findings provide insights into the genetic architecture of flowering time in B. napus.

TI  - Autism Pathogenesis: The Superior Colliculus
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - After been exposed to the visual input, in the first year of life, the brain experiences subtle but massive changes apparently crucial for communicative/emotional and social human development. Its lack could be the explanation of the very high prevalence of autism in children with total congenital blindness. The present theory postulates that the superior colliculus is the key structure for such changes for several reasons: it dominates visual behavior during the first months of life; it is ready at birth for complex visual tasks; it has a significant influence on several hemispheric regions; it is the main brain hub that permanently integrates visual and non-visual, external and internal information (bottom-up and top-down respectively); and it owns the enigmatic ability to take non-conscious decisions about where to focus attention. It is also a sentinel that triggers the subcortical mechanisms which drive social motivation to follow faces from birth and to react automatically to emotional stimuli. Through indirect connections it also activates simultaneously several cortical structures necessary to develop social cognition and to accomplish the multiattentional task required for conscious social interaction in real life settings. Genetic or non-genetic prenatal or early postnatal factors could disrupt the SC functions resulting in autism. The timing of postnatal biological disruption matches the timing of clinical autism manifestations. Astonishing coincidences between etiologies, clinical manifestations, cognitive and pathogenic autism theories on one side and SC functions on the other are disclosed in this review. Although the visual system dependent of the SC is usually considered as accessory of the LGN canonical pathway, its imprinting gives the brain a qualitatively specific functions not supplied by any other brain structure.

TI  - Summer Distribution of Total Suspended Matter Across the Baltic Sea
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There are three optical in-water components that, besides water itself, govern the under-water light field: phytoplankton, total suspended matter (TSM), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). In essence, it is the spectral absorption and scattering properties of each optical component that govern the underwater light field, and also the color of the sea that we can perceive, and that can also be measured remotely from space. The Baltic Sea is optically dominated by CDOM, apart fromcyanobacteria blooms that often cover most of the Baltic proper during summer. Remote sensing images of TSM reveal large-and mesoscale features and currents, especially in the Southern Baltic, which are influenced both by atmospheric Rossby waves and the Coriolis force. In coastal waters, the optical properties are strongly influenced by inorganic suspended matter, which may originate from coastal erosion and from run-off from land, streams, and rivers. In this paper, we evaluate the distribution of TSM across the Baltic Sea using remote sensing data and statistically compare the TSM loads in the different Helsinki Commission (HELCOM)-defined basins. The total suspended matter (TSM) loads during summer vary substantially in the different basins, with the south-eastern Baltic overall being most influenced by cyanobacteria blooms. The Gdansk basin and the Gulf of Riga were distinguished both by relatively high TSM loads with high standard deviations, indicating strong fluvial input and/or resuspension of sediments. We also evaluate a coastal TSM transect in Himmerfjarden bay, which is located at the Swedish East coast in the Western Gotland Basin. The effect of wind-wave stirring on the distribution of TSM from source (shore) to sink (open sea) can be assessed using satellite data from European Space Agency's (ESA) MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) mission (2002-2012) with 300m resolution. The TSM transect data from areas with low wind exposure and a stable thermocline showed a gradient distribution perpendicular to the coast for summer seasons 2009, 2010, 2011, and a 3-year summer composite, confirming a previous bio-optical study from the Western Gotland basin.

TI  - Version 2 of the EUMETSAT OSI SAF and ESA CCI sea-ice concentration climate data records
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce the OSI-450, the SICCI-25km and the SICCI-50km climate data records of gridded global sea-ice concentration. These three records are derived from passive microwave satellite data and offer three distinct advantages compared to existing records: first, all three records provide quantitative information on uncertainty and possibly applied filtering at every grid point and every time step. Second, they are based on dynamic tie points, which capture the time evolution of surface characteristics of the ice cover and accommodate potential calibration differences between satellite missions. Third, they are produced in the context of sustained services offering committed extension, documentation, traceability, and user support. The three records differ in the underlying satellite data (SMMR & SSM/I & SSMIS or AMSR-E & AMSR2), in the imaging frequency channels (37 GHz and either 6 or 19 GHz), in their horizontal resolution (25 or 50 km), and in the time period they cover. We introduce the underlying algorithms and provide an evaluation. We find that all three records compare well with independent estimates of sea-ice concentration both in regions with very high sea-ice concentration and in regions with very low sea-ice concentration. We hence trust that these records will prove helpful for a better understanding of the evolution of the Earth's sea-ice cover.

TI  - A Protective Role for the Lectin CD169/Siglec-1 against a Pathogenic Murine Retrovirus
T2  - CELL HOST & MICROBE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph- and blood-borne retroviruses exploit CD169/Siglec-1-mediated capture by subcapsular sinus and marginal zone metallophilic macrophages for trans-infection of permissive lymphocytes. However, the impact of CD169-mediated virus capture on retrovirus dissemination and pathogenesis in vivo is unknown. In a murine model of the splenomegaly-inducing retrovirus Friend virus complex (FVC) infection, we find that while CD169 promoted draining lymph node infection, it limited systemic spread to the spleen. At the spleen, CD169-expressing macrophages captured incoming blood-borne retroviruses and limited their spread to the erythroblasts in the red pulp where FVC manifests its pathogenesis. CD169-mediated retroviral capture activated conventional dendritic cells 1 (cDC1s) and promoted cytotoxic CDS(+)8 cell responses, resulting in efficient clearing of FVC-infected cells. Accordingly, CD169 blockade led to higher viral loads and accelerated death in susceptible mouse strains. Thus, CD169 plays a protective role during FVC pathogenesis by reducing viral dissemination to erythroblasts and eliciting an effective cytotoxic T lymphocyte response via cDC1s.

TI  - Predictive Value of Preoperative Multidetector-Row Computed Tomography for Axillary Lymph Nodes Metastasis in Patients With Breast Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Axillary lymph nodes (ALN) status is an essential component in tumor staging and treatment planning for patients with breast cancer. The aim of present study was to evaluate the predictive value of preoperative multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) for ALN metastasis in breast cancer patients.Methods: A total of 148 cases underwent preoperative MDCT examination and ALN surgery were eligible for the study. Logistic regression analysis of MDCT variates was used to estimate independent predictive factors for ALN metastasis. The prediction of ALN metastasis was determined with MDCT variates through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.Results: Among the 148 cases, 61 (41.2%) cases had ALN metastasis. The cortical thickness in metastatic ALN was significantly thicker than that in non-metastatic ALN (7.5 +/- 5.0 mm vs. 2.6 +/- 2.8 mm, P < 0.001). Multi-logistic regression analysis indicated that cortical thickness of >3 mm (OR: 12.32, 95% CI: 4.50-33.75, P < 0.001) and non-fatty hilum (OR: 5.38, 95% CI: 1.51-19.19, P = 0.009) were independent predictors for ALN metastasis. The sensitivity, specificity and AUC of MDCT for ALN metastasis prediction based on combined-variated analysis were 85.3%, 87.4%, and 0.893 (95% CI: 0.832-0.938, P < 0.001), respectively.Conclusions: Cortical thickness (>3 mm) and non-fatty hilum of MDCT were independent predictors for ALN metastasis. MDCT is a potent imaging tool for predicting ALN metastasis in breast cancer. Future prospective study on the value of contrast enhanced MDCT in preoperative ALN evaluation is warranted.

AB  - The Indonesian fire and smoke event of 2015 was an extreme episode that affected public health and caused severe economic and environmental damage. The MODIS Dark Target (DT) aerosol algorithm, developed for global applications, significantly underestimated regional aerosol optical depth (AOD) during this episode. The larger-than-global-averaged uncertainties in the DT product over this event were due to both an overly zealous set of masks that mistook heavy smoke plumes for clouds and/or inland water, and also an aerosol model developed for generic global aerosol conditions. Using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 3 sky inversions of local AERONET stations, we created a specific aerosol model for the extreme event. Thus, using this new less-absorbing aerosol model, cloud masking based on results of the MODIS cloud optical properties algorithm, and relaxed thresholds on both inland water tests and upper limits of the AOD retrieval, we created a research algorithm and applied it to 80 appropriate MODIS granules during the event. Collocating and comparing with AERONET AOD shows that the research algorithm doubles the number of MODIS retrievals greater than 1.0, while also significantly improving agreement with AERONET. The final results show that the operational DT algorithm had missed approximately 0.22 of the regional mean AOD, but as much as AOD D 3.0 for individual 0.5 degrees grid boxes. This amount of missing AOD can skew the perception of the severity of the event, affect estimates of regional aerosol forcing, and alter aerosol modeling and forecasting that assimilate MODIS aerosol data products. These results will influence the future development of the global DT aerosol algorithm.

TI  - Bacterial and viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce divergent early transcriptomic landscapes in a bovine macrophage cell line
T2  - BMC GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPathogens stimulate immune functions of macrophages. Macrophages are a key sentinel cell regulating the response to pathogenic ligands and orchestrating the direction of the immune response. Our study aimed at investigating the early transcriptomic changes of bovine macrophages (Bomacs) in response to stimulation with CpG DNA or polyI:C, representing bacterial and viral ligands respectively, and performed transcriptomics by RNA sequencing (RNASeq). KEGG, GO and IPA analytical tools were used to reconstruct pathways, networks and to map out molecular and cellular functions of differentially expressed genes (DE) in stimulated cells.ResultsA one-way ANOVA analysis of RNASeq data revealed significant differences between the CpG DNA and polyI:C-stimulated Bomac. Of the 13,740 genes mapped to the bovine genome, 2245 had p-value 0.05, deemed as DE. At 6h post stimulation of Bomac, poly(I:C) induced a very different transcriptomic profile from that induced by CpG DNA. Whereas, 347 genes were upregulated and 210 downregulated in response to CpG DNA, poly(I:C) upregulated 761 genes and downregulated 414 genes. The topmost DE genes in poly(I:C)-stimulated cells had thousand-fold changes with highly significant p-values, whereas in CpG DNA stimulated cells had 2-5-fold changes with less stringent p-values. The highest DE genes in both stimulations belonged to the TNF superfamily, TNFSF18 (CpG) and TNFSF10 (poly(I:C)) and in both cases the lowest downregulated gene was CYP1A1. CpG DNA highly induced canonical pathways that are unrelated to immune response in Bomac. CpG DNA influenced expression of genes involved in molecular and cellular functions in free radical scavenging. By contrast, poly(I:C) highly induced exclusively canonical pathways directly related to antiviral immune functions mediated by interferon signalling genes. The transcriptomic profile after poly(I:C)-stimulation was consistent with induction of TLR3 signalling.ConclusionCpG DNA and poly(I:C) induce different early transcriptional landscapes in Bomac, but each is suited to a specific function of macrophages during interaction with pathogens. Poly(I:C) influenced antiviral response genes, whereas CpG DNA influenced genes important for phagocytic processes. Poly(I:C) was more potent in setting the inflammatory landscape desirable for an efficient immune response against virus infection.

TI  - Near doubling of Brazil's intensive row crop area since 2000
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has become a global leader in the production of commodity row crops such as soybean, sugarcane, cotton, and corn. Here, we report an increase in Brazilian cropland extent from 26.0 Mha in 2000 to 46.1 Mha in 2014. The states of Maranhao, Tocantins, Piaui, Bahia (collectively MATOPIBA), Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Para all more than doubled in cropland extent. The states of Goias, Minas Gerais, and Sao Paulo each experienced >50% increases. The vast majority of expansion, 79%, occurred on repurposed pasture lands, and 20% was from the conversion of natural vegetation. Area of converted Cerrado savannas was nearly 2.5 times that of Amazon forests, and accounted for more than half of new cropland in MATOPIBA. Spatiotemporal dynamics of cropland expansion reflect market conditions, land use policies, and other factors. Continued extensification of cropland across Brazil is possible and may be likely under current conditions, with attendant benefits for and challenges to development.

M3  - Article
AB  - We report the synthesis and characterization of three fluoride-rich barium iron phosphates BaxFex(PO4)F-y (1 <= x <= 3, 2 <= y <= 12), which exhibited abundant structural chemistry, exhibiting diverse frameworks and connecting modes between [FeOnF6-n](m-) octahedra surrounding Fe2+ or Fe3+ ions. BaFe-(PO4)F-2 (I) consisted of two-dimensional [Fe(PO4)F-2](2-) sheets built from linear (infinity)[Fe2O6F4](10-) moieties formed by fluorine corner sharing FeO4F2 and FeO2F4 octahedra with linking PO4 tetrahedra. Mixed-valence Ba2Fe2(PO4)F-6 (II) possessed a three-dimensional framework containing Fe4O6F12 tetramers formed by the edge-sharing oxygen or fluorine atoms of cis-FeF4O2 octahedra. Ba3Fe3(PO4)F-12 (III) contained one-dimensional columns of (infinity)[Fe-3(PO4)F-12](6-) infinite sections built from cis-FeF4O2 and FeF5O octahedra and tetrahedral PO4 linkers. The magnetic characterization of BaxFex(PO4)F-y unveiled diverse magnetism: an S = 5/2 spin chain for (I), a weak ferrimagnet or canted antiferromagnet for (II) thanks to the presence of distinct Fe2+ and Fe3+ sites identified by Mossbauer spectroscopy, and coupled spin-trimers for (III).

TI  - Global vegetation variability and its response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, global warming, and climate variability - a study using the offline SSiB4/TRIFFID model and satellite data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate regime shift during the 1980s had a substantial impact on the terrestrial ecosystems and vegetation at different scales. However, the mechanisms driving vegetation changes, before and after the shift, remain unclear. In this study, we used a biophysical dynamic vegetation model to estimate large-scale trends in terms of carbon fixation, vegetation growth, and expansion during the period 1958-2007, and to attribute these changes to environmental drivers including elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (hereafter eCO(2)), global warming, and climate variability (hereafter CV). Simulated leaf area index (LAI) and gross primary production (GPP) were evaluated against observation-based data. Significant spatial correlations are found (correlations > 0.87), along with regionally varying temporal correlations of 0.34-0.80 for LAI and 0.45-0.83 for GPP. More than 40 % of the global land area shows significant positive (increase) or negative (decrease) trends in LAI and GPP during 1958-2007. Regions over the globe show different characteristics in terms of ecosystem trends before and after the 1980s. While 11.7% and 19.3 % of land have had consistently positive LAI and GPP trends, respectively, since 1958, 17.1 % and 20.1 % of land saw LAI and GPP trends, respectively, reverse during the 1980s. Vegetation fraction cover (FRAC) trends, representing vegetation expansion and/or shrinking, are found at the edges of semi-arid areas and polar areas. Environmental drivers affect the change in ecosystem trend over different regions. Overall, eCO(2) consistently contributes to positive LAI and GPP trends in the tropics. Global warming mostly affects LAI, with positive effects in high latitudes and negative effects in sub-tropical semi-arid areas. CV is found to dominate the variability of FRAC, LAI, and GPP in the semi-humid and semi-arid areas. The eCO(2) and global warming effects increased after the 1980s, while the CV effect reversed during the 1980s. In addition, plant competition is shown to have played an important role in determining which driver dominated the regional trends. This paper presents new insight into ecosystem variability and changes in the varying climate since the 1950s.

TI  - Combination of microbiome analysis and serodiagnostics to assess the risk of pathogen transmission by ticks to humans and animals in central Germany
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundArthropod-borne diseases remain a major health-threat for humans and animals worldwide. To estimate the distribution of pathogenic agents and especially Bartonella spp., we conducted tick microbiome analysis and determination of the infection status of wild animals, pets and pet owners in the state of Hesse, Germany.ResultsIn total, 189 engorged ticks collected from 163 animals were tested. Selected ticks were analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS) and confirmatory PCRs, blood specimens of 48 wild animals were analyzed by PCR to confirm pathogen presence and sera of 54 dogs, one cat and 11 dog owners were analyzed by serology. Bartonella spp. were detected in 9.5% of all ticks and in the blood of 17 roe deer. Further data reveal the presence of the human and animal pathogenic species of genera in the family Spirochaetaceae (including Borrelia miyamotoi and Borrelia garinii), Bartonella spp. (mainly Bartonella schoenbuchensis), Rickettsia helvetica, Francisella tularensis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in ticks. Co-infections with species of several genera were detected in nine ticks. One dog and five dog owners were seropositive for anti-Bartonella henselae-antibodies and one dog had antibodies against Rickettsia conorii.ConclusionsThis study provides a snapshot of pathogens circulating in ticks in central Germany. A broad range of tick-borne pathogens are present in ticks, and especially in wild animals, with possible implications for animal and human health. However, a low incidence of Bartonella spp., especially Bartonella henselae, was detected. The high number of various detected pathogens suggests that ticks might serve as an excellent sentinel to detect and monitor zoonotic human pathogens.

TI  - Machine learning with remote sensing data to locate uncontacted indigenous villages in Amazonia
T2  - PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The world's last uncontacted indigenous societies in Amazonia have only intermittent and often hostile interactions with the outside world. Knowledge of their locations is essential for urgent protection efforts, but their extreme isolation, small populations, and semi-nomadic lifestyles make this a challenging task.Methods. Remote sensing technology with Landsat satellite sensors is a non-invasive methodology to track isolated indigenous populations through time. However, the small-scale nature of the deforestation signature left by uncontacted populations clearing villages and gardens has similarities to those made by contacted indigenous villages. Both contacted and uncontacted indigenous populations often live in proximity to one another making it difficult to distinguish the two in satellite imagery. Here we use machine learning techniques applied to remote sensing data with a training dataset of 500 contacted and 25 uncontacted villages.Results. Uncontacted villages generally have smaller cleared areas, reside at higher elevations, and are farther from populated places and satellite-detected lights at night. A random forest algorithm with an optimally-tuned detection cutoff has a leave-one-out cross-validated sensitivity and specificity of over 98%. A grid search around known uncontacted villages led us to identify three previously-unknown villages using predictions from the random forest model. Our efforts can improve policies toward isolated populations by providing better near real-time knowledge of their locations and movements in relation to encroaching loggers, settlers, and other external threats to their survival.

TI  - Trends in MODIS and AERONET derived aerosol optical thickness over Northern Europe
T2  - TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term Aqua and Terra MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Collections 5.1 and 6.1 (c051 and c061, respectively) aerosol data have been combined with AERONET (AERosol RObotic NETwork) ground-based sun photometer observations to examine trends in aerosol optical thickness (AOT, at 550nm) over Northern Europe for the months April to September. For the 1927 and 1559 daily coincident measurements that were obtained for c051 and c061, respectively, MODIS AOT varied by 86 and 90%, respectively, within the predicted uncertainty of one standard deviation of the retrieval over land (AOT = +/- 0.05 +/- 0.15<bold>AOT</bold>). For the coastal AERONET site Gustav Dalen Tower (GDT), Sweden, larger deviations were found for MODIS c051 and c061 (79% and 75%, respectively, within predicted uncertainty). The Baltic Sea provides substantially better statistical representation of AOT than the surrounding land areas and therefore favours the investigations of trends in AOT over the region. Negative trends of 1.5% and 1.2% per year in AOT, based on daily averaging, were found for the southwestern Baltic Sea from MODIS c051 and c061, respectively. This is in line with a decrease of 1.2% per year in AOT at the AERONET station Hamburg. For the western Gotland Basin area, Sweden, negative trends of 1.5%, 1.1% and 1.6% per year in AOT have been found for MODIS c051, MODIS c061 and AERONET GDT, respectively. The strongest trend of -1.8% per year in AOT was found for AERONET Belsk, Poland, which can be compared to -1.5% per day obtained from MODIS c051 over central Poland. The trends in MODIS and AERONET AOT are nearly all statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. The strongest aerosol sources are suggested to be located southwest, south and southeast of the investigation area, although the highest prevalence of pollution events is associated with air mass transport from southwest.

TI  - Intraoperative Assessment of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer Patients Post-Neoadjuvant Therapy
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH & TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Shift toward minimizing axillary lymph node dissection in patients with breast cancer post neoadjuvant therapy has led to the assessment of sentinel lymph nodes by frozen section intraoperatively to determine the need for axillary lymph node dissection. However, few studies have examined the accuracy of sentinel lymph node frozen section after neoadjuvant therapy. Our objective is to compare the accuracy of sentinel lymph node frozen section in patients with breast cancer with and without neoadjuvant therapy and to identify features that may influence accuracy. Design: We identified 161 sentinel lymph node frozen section from 77 neoadjuvant therapy patients and 255 sentinel lymph node frozen section from 88 non-neoadjuvant therapy patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2016 in 2 institutions. The frozen section diagnoses were compared to the final diagnoses, and clinicopathologic data were analyzed. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of frozen section analysis were comparable between neoadjuvant therapy patients and non-neoadjuvant therapy patients (71.9% vs 50%, 100% vs 100%, and 88.3% vs 81.8%). Nine (11.7%) of 77 neoadjuvant therapy patients had discordant results, most often due to undersampling (tumor absent on frozen section slide). Four of these patients subsequently underwent axillary lymph node dissection. Discordant results (all false negatives) were significantly more likely in neoadjuvant therapy patients with Estrogen Receptor-positive/HER2-negative status, and in sentinel lymph node with pN1mic and pN0i+ deposits; age, preneoadjuvant therapy lymph node status, histotype, nuclear grade, tumor size, and response to neoadjuvant therapy showed no significant differences. For non-neoadjuvant therapy cases, large tumor size, lobular histotype, and sentinel lymph node with pN1mic and pN0i+ were associated with false-negative frozen section assessment. Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node frozen section diagnosis post-neoadjuvant therapy has comparable sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy to the sentinel lymph node frozen section diagnosis in the non-neoadjuvant therapy setting.

T2  - ZOOKEYS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report the Carabidae collected at the Shada Al-A'Ala Nature Reserve (SANR) in Baha Province in southwestern Saudi Arabia during 2013-2015. In total, 62 carabid species and subspecies representing 39 genera, 17 tribes, and 10 subfamilies were identified, including one new species, Paussus minutulus Nagel & Rasool, sp. n, four new country records, and 24 species that are new provincial records for Baha. The carabid fauna was dominated by the Lebiini with 19 species. A high number of species were rarely collected (34 species) in comparison to the more abundant and common species (9 species). The highest number of species (52 species) was collected during autumn. The carabids of SANR are represented by a large component of Afrotropical faunal elements (28.1%) and smaller numbers of Oriental species (3.5%) and endemic taxa (5.3%). In comparison to Garf Raydah Nature Reserve in Asir Province, also in southwestern Saudi Arabia, SANR had an equal number of carabids sharing 64.5% of the species but with lower number of endemic elements. Our study can serve as a component for implementing a conservation plan for SANR using carabid beetles as sentinel taxa. These research results may support future ecological studies on SNAR carabids.

TI  - Preventing falls among older fallers: study protocol for a two-phase pilot study of the multicomponent LIVE LiFE program
T2  - TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFalls reflect sentinel events in older adults, with significant negative consequences. Although fall risk factors have been identified as intrinsic (e.g., muscle weakness, balance problems) and extrinsic (e.g., home hazards), most prevention programs target only intrinsic factors. We present the rationale and design of a home-based multicomponent fall prevention programthe LIVE LiFE programfor community-living older adults. The program adapts and expands the successful Lifestyle Intervention Functional Exercise (LiFE) program by adding home safety, vision contrast screening, and medication review. The specific aims of the study are to (1) adapt the LiFE program to a US context and expand it into a multicomponent program (LIVE LiFE) addressing intrinsic and extrinsic fall risks, (2) examine feasibility and acceptability, and (3) estimate program impact on multiple outcome measures to prepare for an efficacy trial.MethodsThe study involves two phases: an open-label pilot, followed by a two-group, single-blinded randomized pilot trial. Eligible participants are community-living adults 70+ years reporting at least one injurious fall or two non-injurious falls in the previous year. Participants are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the program group (LIVE LiFE, n=25) or the control group (written fall risk assessment, n=12). The open-label pilot participants (n=3) receive the program without randomization and are assessed based on their experience, resulting in a stronger emphasis on the participant's personal goals being integrated into LIVE LiFE. Fall risk and balance outcomes are assessed by the Timed Up and Go and the 4-Stage Balance Test at 16weeks. Additional outcomes are incidence of falls and near falls, falls efficacy, fear of falling, number of home hazards, and medications assessed at 16weeks. Incidence of falls and near falls, program adherence, and satisfaction are assessed again at 32weeks.DiscussionBy expanding and adapting the evidence-based LiFE program, our study will help us understand the feasibility of conducting a multicomponent program and estimate its impact on multiple outcome measures. This will support moving forward with an efficacy trial of the LIVE LiFE program for older adults who are at risk of falling.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03351413.

TI  - Invasive group A streptococcal infection outbreaks of typeemm118 in a long-term care facility, and of type emm74 in the homeless population, Montreal, Quebec.
T2  - Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS) infection outbreaks occurred in Montreal in 2016 and 2017; one in a long-term care facility (typeemm118) and one in the community, primarily involving homeless people (typeemm74).OBJECTIVE: To describe two recent iGAS outbreaks in Montreal and highlight the challenges in dealing with these outbreaks and the need to tailor the public health response to control them.METHODOLOGY: All cases of iGAS were investigated and the isolates were sent to the laboratory foremmtyping. In both outbreaks, cases of superficial group Astreptococcus(GAS) infection were identified, through 1) systematic case detection accompanied by screening for asymptomatic carriers among residents and employees of the long-term care facility and 2) sentinel surveillance among homeless people. Visits were made to community organizations providing homeless services (including shelters) and social networks were analyzed to establish whether there were any links among cases of GAS infection (both invasive and noninvasive) and locations frequented. In both outbreaks, recommendations were made to service providers regarding enhancement of infection prevention and control measures.RESULTS: In the long-term care facility, five cases of typeemm118 iGAS were identified over a 22-month period, one of which resulted in death. All residents were screened and no carriers were identified. Among the employees, 81 (65%) were screened and fourcarriers were identified. Of those, one was a carrier of typeemm118 GAS. All carriers were treated, and subsequent follow-up sampling on three carriers (including the one withemm118) was negative.In the community, 23 cases of typeemm74 iGAS were detected over a 16-month period, four of which resulted in death. Half of the cases (n=12) were described as homeless, and six others were users of services for the homeless. Sentinel surveillance of superficial infections yielded 64 cultures with GAS, chiefly on the skin, including 51 (80%) of typeemm74. An analysis of the social networks revealed the large number and variety of resources for the homeless used by the cases. Visits to the community organizations providing homeless services revealed the heterogeneity and precariousness of some of these services, the difficulties encountered in applying adequate health and hygiene measures, and the high degree of mobility amongst those who use these services.CONCLUSION: The detection and control of iGAS outbreaks in both long-term care establishments and among community organizations providing homeless services are very complex. An outbreak of iGAS can develop in the background over a long time and be easily overlooked despite cases being admitted to the hospital.Emmtyping and systematic research of previous cases of iGAS are essential tools for the detection and characterization of outbreaks. Close cooperation among public health agencies, clinical teams, community organizations and laboratories is essential for proper monitoring and the reduction of GAS transmission in the community and health care settings.

TI  - An examination of the long-term relationship between hydrologic variables and summer algal biomass in a large Prairie reservoir
T2  - CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological drought as characterized by low river inflow rate (IR), and, in turn, low water level (WL) and greater water residence time (WRT), may support greater algal biomass and blooms in lakes. Lake Diefenbaker (LD), a large mesotrophic reservoir on the Canadian Prairies, receives approximate to 98% of its inflow from the South Saskatchewan River (SSR). The SSR annual flow volume largely varies with precipitation and temperature in the Rocky Mountains. The SSR basin has experienced multiple years of hydrological drought. To test the hypothesis that periods of lower inflows are related to increased algal biomass in LD, summer chlorophyll-a was related to hydrologic variables (IR, WL and WRT). A 31-year period of hydrologic data and estimated chlorophyll-a (i.e. derived from Landsat imagery) was examined. Summer chlorophyll-a ranged from 3.8 to 7.6g/L, and late spring and early summer IR, WL and WRT were 117-1061 m(3)/s, 550.7-556.2m and 0.3-2.1years, respectively. Chlorophyll-a increased as WL decreased in LD (R-adj(2) = 0.30, P=0.00081). This inverse relationship may be a function of light penetration and internal nutrient loading. Chlorophyll-a had a weak, inverse relationship with IR (R-adj(2) = 0.12, P=0.0315) that was likely driven by an extreme high-flow event. Chlorophyll-a was not significantly related to WRT (R-adj(2) = 0.06, P=0.1), which may be due to the limited variability in WRT and the size of LD. It was hypothesized that a water volume reduction exceeding 25%, caused by water abstraction or drought, or both, may support greater algal biomass in LD. Such reductions are unusual in the historical record, but will likely become more common with frequent drought together with water abstraction in the SSR basin as the Prairies continue to warm.

TI  - Preparing for the world of diverse worldviews: parental and school stakeholder views on integrative worldview education in a Finnish context
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to explore integrative worldview education as a platform for learning from worldviews in a diverse cultural context. This is done by exploring integrative worldview education in a Finnish secondary school context by examining the views of school stakeholders. The stakeholders examined in this article consist of 174 parents of the pupils and a total of six teachers and head teachers from two different lower secondary schools in Helsinki. We use the concept of learning from worldviews to examine the possibilities of the integrative classroom to facilitate learning from both personal and organised worldviews. The results indicate that the stakeholders view integrative worldview education as an important tool for widening the worldview of the pupil. Although the stakeholders view the sensitivity of the teacher as paramount in teaching an integrative classroom, integrative worldview education is also seen as important in offering tools for forging mutual understandings in an ever more complex world of worldviews.

TI  - Determination of 16 PAHs and 22 PCBs in honey samples originated from different region of Lebanon and used as environmental biomonitors sentinel
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to assess the air quality in some Lebanese regions, a biomonitoring study based on honey as biomonitor candidate was conducted. For this, 18 samples of honey collected from four regions in Lebanon, were analyzed for their contamination by 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 22 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Samples were first extracted using a multi-residue extraction method based on the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe extraction method (QuEChERS) followed by a concentration step using Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) procedures. The extraction was then followed by chromatographic analysis by gas chromatography-ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). After PAHs samples assessment, different ratios of founded PAHs were calculated in order to estimate the sources of the pollution by these compounds. The obtained results showed that the four analyzed regions were contaminated with PAHs originated from both pyro and petro genic sources while none of them was found to be contaminated by any of the 22 assessed PCBs. The results of this study show that honey can be used as potential biomonitor candidate allowing the assessment of the pollution statement of a given environment.

TI  - An assessment of the impact of urbanization and land use changes in the fast-growing cities of Saudi Arabia
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding rates, patterns and types of land use and land cover (LULC) changes are essential for various decision-making processes. This study quantified LULC changes and the effect of urban expansion in three Saudi Arabian cities: Riyadh, Jeddah and Makkah using Landsat images of 1985, 2000 and 2014. Seasonal change of vegetation cover was conducted using normalised difference vegetation index, and object-based image analysis was used to classify the LULC changes. The overall accuracies of the classified maps ranged from 84 to 95%, which indicated sufficiently robust results. Urban area was the most changed land cover, and most of the converted land to urban was from bare soil. The seasonal analysis showed that the change of vegetation cover was not constant due to climatic conditions in these areas. The agricultural lands were significantly decreased between 1985 and 2014, and most of these lands were changed to bare soil due to dwindling groundwater resources.

TI  - Portrayals of Endangered Species in Advertising: Exercising Intertextuality to Question the Anthropocentric Lens
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines recent advertisements used by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to raise awareness about the predicament of endangered, vulnerable, and threatened species. By engaging in a critical discourse analysis of a selection of advertisements, this study demonstrates how the WWF uses intertextuality as a discourse strategy to articulate its message and objectives. In this paper, I argue that by engaging in the juxtaposition of various paratexts ("layers of meaning"), the WWF produces a narrative which reveals an anthropocentric lens through which we view the world. The advertisements are found to resort to paratexts of anthropomorphism with the intent of extending the bounds of personhood to non-human animal species. In closing, I maintain that intertextuality is employed not only to question the dominant human-centric paradigm, but serve the heuristic function of encouraging a more empathetic identification with the animals in question and the creation of a more holistic worldview.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variation of Drought Based on Satellite Derived Vegetation Condition Index in Nepal from 1982-2015
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of drought is essential for many environmental and agricultural applications. To further understand drought, this study presented spatial and temporal variations of drought based on satellite derived Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) on annual (Jan-Dec), seasonal monsoon (Jun-Nov) and pre-monsoon (Mar-May) scales from 1982-2015 in Nepal. The Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) obtained from NOAA, AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) and climate data from meteorological stations were used. VCI was used to grade the drought, and the Mann-Kendall test and linear trend analysis were conducted to examine drought trends and the Pearson correlation between VCI and climatic factors (i.e., temperature and precipitation) was also acquired. The results identified that severe drought was identified in 1982, 1984, 1985 and 2000 on all time scales. However, VCI has increased at the rate of 1.14 yr(-1) (p = 0.04), 1.31 yr(-1) (p = 0.03) and 0.77 yr(-1) (p = 0.77) on the annual, seasonal monsoon and pre-monsoon scales, respectively. These increased VCIs indicated decreases in drought. However, spatially, increased trends of drought were also found in some regions in Nepal. For instance, northern areas mainly in the Trans-Himalayan regions identified severe drought. The foothills and the lowlands of Terai (southern Nepal) experienced normal VCI, i.e., no drought. Similarly, the Anomaly Vegetation Condition Index (AVCI) was mostly negative before 2000 which indicated deficient soil moisture. The exceedance probability analysis results on the annual time scale showed that there was a 20% chance of occurring severe drought (VCI 35%) and a 35% chance of occurring normal drought (35% VCI 50%) in Nepal. Drought was also linked with climates in which temperature on the annual and seasonal monsoon scales was significant and positively correlated with VCI. Drought occurrence and trends in Nepal need to be further studied for comprehensive information and understanding.

TI  - Using new remote sensing satellites for assessing water quality in a reservoir
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality monitoring could benefit from information derived from the newest generation of medium-resolution Earth observation satellites. The main objective of our study was to assess the suitability of both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A satellites for estimating and mapping of Secchi disk transparency (SDT), a common measurement of water clarity, in Cassaffousth Reservoir (Cordoba, Argentina). Ground observations and a dataset of four Landsat 8 and four Sentinel-2A images were used to create and validate models to estimate SDT in the reservoir. The selected algorithms were used to obtain graphic representations of water clarity. Slight differences were found between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 estimations. Thus, we demonstrated the suitability of both satellites for estimating and mapping water quality. This study highlights the importance of free and readily available satellite datasets in monitoring water quality, especially in countries where conventional monitoring programmes are either lacking or unsatisfactory.

TI  - Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva: a review of present management and future considerations
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTICANCER THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Although a relatively uncommon disease, the treatment of vulvar cancer has changed considerably over the years and has been under considerable focus due to its past overtreatment and apparent increase in incidence. The purpose of this review is to describe the recommended management of the most commonly encountered vulvar carcinomas based on the most recent available literature. Areas covered: The clinical environment of squamous cell vulvar cancers are illustrated in order to describe the potential pitfalls and limitations of treatment. Then, by examining published data on the treatment efficacy, find those that are best at limiting morbidity and maximizing patient outcomes. In addition, effective prevention of HPV-related disease will be included as its limitation of disease can be considered an aspect of treatment. The benefits and limitations of medical and surgical modalities as well as the evolving discussion surrounding lymph node sampling and the novel role of genomics will also be considered. Expert commentary: Great care should be taken by the gynecologic oncology community regarding prevention and continuing efforts of limiting surgical morbidity while providing quality care. Although sentinel lymph node dissection is a controversial topic, greater attention should be paid to clinical trials to delineate the data, but also to limit our own biases in counseling patients.

M3  - Article
AB  - The 2017/18 winter influenza season in Hong Kong started in early January 2018, predominated by influenza B/Yamagata. We collaborated with private medical practitioners of our sentinel surveillance system to collect respiratory specimens and clinical information from patients with influenza-like illness for estimation of the influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) using the test-negative case-control design. We found that the overall VE was 59.1% (95%CI 41.1 to 71.8%) against all influenza and 53.5% (95%CI 35.4 to 74.6%) against influenza B. Seasonal influenza vaccine provided moderate to good protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza infection at primary care level in Hong Kong in the 2017/18 winter influenza season.

TI  - Integrating Landscape Metrics and Hydrologic Modeling to Assess the Impact of Natural Disturbances on Ecohydrological Processes in the Chenyulan Watershed, Taiwan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chenyulan watershed, located in the central mountain area of Taiwan, has been suffering from earthquakes, typhoons, and heavy rainfalls in recent decades. These sequential natural disturbances have a cumulative impact on the watershed, leading to more fragile and fragmented land cover and loss of capacity of soil water conservation. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and a landscape metrics tool (FRAGSTATS) were used to assess the direct impact (e.g., by annual rainfall) and indirect impact (e.g., by landscape configuration and composition) of natural disturbances on the ecohydrological processes of the Chenyulan watershed. Six SPOT satellite images from 2008 to 2013 were analyzed by using the nearest feature line embedding (NFLE) approach and reclassified into six land cover types: forest, cultivated land, grassland, river, landslide, and built-up. Forest was found to have the largest patch size, indicating that it is more resilient to disturbances, while agricultural land tended to expand from the river side toward the hill. Two land cover change scenarios were compared in the SWAT model. The results showed that there was no significant difference in simulated streamflow during 2004-2015 and sediment loading during 2004-2009; however, the model performed better for sediment loading during 2010-2015 with dynamic land cover change (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.66, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) = 0.62, percent bias (PBIAS) = 10.5%, root mean square error observation standard deviation ratio (RSR) = 0.62) than with constant land cover (R-2 = 0.61, NSE = 0.54, PBIAS = -17.3%, RSR = 0.68), indicating that long-term land cover change should be considered in hydrologic modeling. Changes in landslides during 2008-2013 were found to significantly affect ecohydrological processes, especially after 2011. In general, annual precipitation plays a dominant role, and landscape composition had by far the strongest influence on water yield and sediment yield compared to landscape configuration. The results can be useful for understanding the effects of land cover change on ecohydrological processes in the Chenyulan watershed and the potential impact of ecohydrological changes on the environment and public health.

TI  - Estimating Spatial and Temporal Trends in Environmental Indices Based on Satellite Data: A Two-Step Approach
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a method for employing satellite data to evaluate spatial and temporal patterns in environmental indices of interest. In the first step, linear regression coefficients are extracted for each area in the image. These coefficients are then employed as a response variable in a boosted regression tree with geographic coordinates as explanatory variables. Here, a two-step approach is described in the context of a substantive case study comprising 30 years of satellite derived fractional green vegetation cover for a large region in Queensland, Australia. In addition to analysis of the entire image and timeframe, separate analyses are undertaken over decades and over sub-regions of the study region. The results demonstrate both the utility of the approach and insights into spatio-temporal trends in green vegetation for this site. These findings support the feasibility of using the proposed two-step approach and geographic coordinates in the analysis of satellite derived indices over space and time.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation and monitoring of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) or consumptive water use over large-area holds the key to irrigation management plans and regional drought preparedness. The objective of this study was to estimate ETc by applying the simplified-surface energy balance index (S-SEBI) model to Landsat-8 data for the 2014-2015 period in parts of North India. An average ETc was estimated 2.72 and 2.47 in mm day(-1) with 0.22, 0.18 standard deviation and 0.11, 0.07 standard error for Kharif and Rabi crops, respectively. On validation part, a close relationship was observed between S-SEBI derived and scintillometer observed evaporative fraction with 0.85 correlation coefficient and 0.86 agreement index. The statistical analysis also endorses the results accuracy and reliability with 0.026 and 0.602, relative root-mean square errors and model efficiency for wheat crop, respectively. The study showed that normalized difference vegetation index and LST are closely related and serve as a proxy for qualitative representation of ETc.

TI  - Land-use/cover changes in relation to stream dynamics in a marginal graben along the northern Ethiopian Rift Valley
T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates land-use/cover changes related to river dynamics in northern Ethiopia. Aerial photographs from 1965 to 1986, and SPOT images of 2007 and 2014 were used to extract land units. Land-use/cover changes took place in 48% of the entire landscape around the river across the last five decades. Changes related to swap accounted for 37%, whereas net changes accounted for 11%. The most systematic transitions in terms of gain were from shrubland to farmland, alluvial deposit to settlement, and alluvial deposit to active channel and settlement. Most of these transitions were related to the river dynamics and depict cyclic transitions: farmland -> active channel -> alluvial deposits -> grassland/shrubland -> farmland. Human interventions and natural vegetation succession were also very important. The study concludes that river systems have considerable impact on livelihood and need attention in land management undertakings in graben bottoms.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a novel physical approach is proposed to detect damages due to earthquakes using dual polarimetric (DP) coherent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. An optimization method, aimed at enhancing scattering basis differences between measurements collected before and after the event, is designed exploiting Lagrange optimization of the difference between two polarimetric covariance matrices. A meaningful showcase is presented to demonstrate the soundness of the proposed approach that consists of processing Sentinel-1 C-band scenes related to 2016 Central Italy Earthquake. The proposed approach, which is contrasted with the conventional coherence based single- and dual-polarization approaches, results in the best sensitivity to damages.

AB  - This article will begin with a discussion of the distinctive ways in which the notion of Christian perfection is understood in Southern African Methodism by reflecting on how Methodists in Southern Africa have understood, perhaps even misunderstood, the emphasis on "social holiness" as a Christian response to the oppression of colonialism and apartheid on the African continent. It is contended that this understanding could be classified as a form of African Christian humanism. In order to show this, the article will highlight aspects of Christian humanism and the African worldview that correlate with Southern African appropriations of Methodist and Wesleyan theology. Reference is made to Nelson Mandela's faith, which was formed within this theological framework. He developed his own faith in response to significant Black South African Methodists (such as the founders of the African National Congress, the founder of the Pan African Congress, and the founders of the Black Methodist Consultation) and Methodist communities (such as Churches, schools and chaplaincies). The paper argues that humanism, which has its roots in Christian theological and social ethics, became distinctively African through the work and witness of Southern African Methodists.

TI  - Religious Education, Big Ideas and the study of religion(s) and worldview(s)
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article outlines the 'Big Ideas' approach to curriculum reform, as applied in the 'Principles and Big Ideas of Science Education' project. A critical analysis follows of the outcomes of the University of Exeter's 'Identifying Principles and Big Ideas for Religious Education' project, which sought to apply the same approach to Religious Education (RE) in English schools. This project made great headway in generating 'Big Ideas' to inform and improve the selection and sequencing of RE curriculum content. However, its primary focus on subject content knowledge means that 'Big Ideas' about epistemology and methodology are lacking. The article recommends an additional focus on multi-disciplinary, multi-methodological, inquiry-based, reflexive learning, which would ask why, how, where and by whom our 'knowledge' of religion(s) and worldview(s) is generated. In this regard, the article posits four 'Big Ideas about the study of religion(s) and worldview(s)' to highlight the symbiotic relationship between knowledge and knower, and to reject the false dichotomy between the object of study and method of study. In so doing, it draws upon the theoretical framework underpinning the 'RE-searchers approach' to primary school RE, which correspondingly exemplifies how such ideas can be taught in practice.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation using land surface temperature and soil temperature at 5 cm depth
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil Temperature (ST) data, obtained from either field works or satellite imagery, has frequently been studied for Soil Moisture (SM) estimation. However, a combination of ST data at different depths and soil surface temperature, i.e., Surface Radiometric Temperature (SRT) or Land Surface Temperature (LST), has not yet been well investigated for accurate SM prediction. In this study, an empirical model was first developed to estimate SM at 5 cm Depth (SM5D) over areas with no or sparse vegetation cover using the field SRT and field ST data at 5 cm Depth (ST5D). A Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.037 m(3) m(-3) and 0.8 were obtained using this model, respectively. Then, the SRT was substituted by the LST obtained from Landsat thermal bands and ST5D was estimated using the ST data collected at the nearest weather station to the study area by developing a regression equation. The second model demonstrated an RMSE and r of 0.035 m(3) m(-3) and 0.71, respectively. Overall, it was concluded that the proposed models had high potential for SM estimation using the ST data at different depths collected in the field or acquired by optical satellites.

TI  - Estimating evapotranspiration in semi-arid rangelands: connecting reference to actual evapotranspiration and the role of soil evaporation
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In a context of water scarcity, efforts to increase landscape production should focus on improving water productivity. This requires an appreciation of the various components of evapotranspiration (ET), including soil evaporation (E-s) because the latter reflects 'unproductive' water loss. Both complex and simple algorithms have been developed to determine ET. In data scarce areas, developing and testing parsimonious algorithms is useful. This study sought to improve a simple single layer ET model by incorporating an E-s component. Empirical methods were also explored to predict ET from vegetation indices (VIs), leaf area index (LAI) and reference evapotranspiration (ET0). A large aperture scintillometer and an eddy covariance (EC) system were used to validate the proposed algorithm at three sites over Grasslands and Albany Thicket biomes in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. There was good agreement between the observed and predicted ET with RMSE of 0.30-0.58 mm d(-1) when average daily observed ET was 0.43-3.24 mm. The VIs had moderate correlations with the observed data due to the significant role played by E-s (65%-84%) across the sites and stomatal conductance at the Albany Thicket site. The simple algorithms developed would make determining ET easier in data scarce regions.

TI  - Combined multiscale segmentation convolutional neural network for rapid damage mapping from postearthquake very high-resolution images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classifying land use from postearthquake very high-resolution (VHR) images is challenging due to the complexity of objects in Earth surface after an earthquake. Convolutional neural network (CNN) exhibits satisfied performance in differentiating complex postearthquake objects, thanks to its automatic extraction of high-level features and accurate identification of target geo-objects. Nevertheless, in view of the scale variance of natural objects, the fact that CNN suffers from the fixed receptive field, the reduced feature resolution, and the insufficient training sample has severely contributed to its limitation in the rapid damage mapping. Multiscale segmentation technique is considered as a promising solution as it can generate the homogenous regions and provide the boundary information. Therefore, we propose a combined multiscale segmentation convolutional neural network (CMSCNN) method for postearthquake VHR image classification. First, multiscale training samples are selected based on segments derived from the multiscale segmentation. Then, CNN is directly trained to classify the original image to further produce the preliminary classification maps. To enhance the localization accuracy, the output of CNN is further refined using multiscale segmentations from fine to coarse iteratively to obtain the multiscale classification maps. As a result, the combination strategy is able to capture objects and image context simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed CMSCNN method can reflect the multiscale information of complex scenes and obtain satisfied classification results for mapping postearthquake damage using VHR remote sensing images.

CL  - San Sebastian, SPAIN
AB  - Infrastructure is a key area of public investment and development cooperation, and can be seen as a critical enabler of trade and integration. Stakeholders increasingly demand evidence on the effectiveness of investments in infrastructure such as railways, in part because these investments typically lock in development patterns for decades. In this article we take stock of the main findings, methodological approaches, gaps and caveats of the current literature with a focus on railways. Based on this analysis, we present a methodology for an impact evaluation framework which builds on existing knowledge and addresses some of these shortcomings. Beyond the dearth of empirical evidence on the socio-economic and environmental impacts of infrastructure, we discuss critiques of the currently prevalent methodological toolbox. Using a real-world railway project in India, the Konkan Railway, we exemplify how a rigorous quantitative impact assessment can integrate inter-disciplinary and mixed-methods features to address these issues. Specifically, we apply different quasi-experimental techniques on the level of intermediate and ultimate outcome and impact indicators, using census, survey and satellite data and information from document analyses, interviews and focus group discussions. We draw on insights from economics, sociology, engineering and geography in making sense of large infrastructure projects and their impacts.

TI  - Dalits and Religion: Towards a Synergetic Proposal
T2  - BLACK THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Indian subcontinent religious beliefs and worldviews are grounded and embodied in the community experience. For many people, religion without tangible social expression, is deemed as irrelevant and futile. Even though the dominant religious persuasions may demand exclusive adherence, Dalits and Dalit Christians in India show the human capacity to influence such views, change their course of action and live with more than one prevailing religious worldview. This article strives to move beyond theories of hybridity within the study of religion and offers a constructive proposal that is synergetic in approach, facilitating an academic trope to work with the increasing realization of multi-religious belonging among Indian communities.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of soil salinity using multi-source remote sensing data based on the support vector machine and artificial neural network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinization of soil is one of the most important environmental issues in arid and semi-arid areas. Accordingly, agricultural production and ecological development have been profoundly influenced in these regions. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to assess soil salinization and its driving factors. However, soil salinity is difficult to accurately characterize by using single-factor and linear models. Thus, it is necessary to develop a robust modeling technique by integrating multiple biophysical indicators to quantitatively monitor soil salinity. In this paper, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression algorithm and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm were employed to better estimate the soil salinity in the Yanqi Basin, Xinjiang, China. The soil backscattering coefficient (), Groundwater Depth (GD), Salinity Index (SI) and Surface Evapotranspiration (SET) were used as model parameters. was obtained from Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data; GD and SI were calculated from Landsat-8 imagery; and SET was obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) evapotranspiration product (MOD16). The performances of SVM and ANN in evaluating the nonlinear relationship between , GD, SI, SET, and soil Electrical Conductivity (EC) were compared. The results showed that, the SVM regression algorithm performs better than ANN algorithm in monitoring soil salinity. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2) in the estimation obtained using the SVM regression algorithm were about 2.01 and 0.82, respectively, versus the training data set; the RMSE and R-2 were 1.36 and 0.88, respectively, versus the testing data set. The accuracy was significantly higher than that using the ANN algorithm, which obtained an RMSE of 2.20 and R-2 of 0.79 versus the training data set, and 2.25 and 0.68 versus the testing data set. The results of this study indicated that about 56.82% of the soil in the study area was affected by different degrees of salinity. It is obvious that SVM regression algorithm has great potential for estimating soil salinity using multi-source remote sensing data.

M3  - Article
AB  - The primary objective of this paper is to analyze the past and present changes of Dodoma region and also predict the future changes using the Landsat satellite images of 1998, 2008 and 2018. In this study, land use and land cover change (LULC) is examined using remote sensing and Markov chains analysis. The study first uses remote sensing to detect LULC changes and then based on the result of classification images, predicts the 2030 LULC using Markov chains analysis. The results of the net change between 1998 and 2018 show that built-up land increased by 2221 ha, bare land by 15,737 ha and vegetation declined by 17,958 ha. Markov prediction to 2030 based on land use and land cover maps of 2008 and 2018 show that bare land has a high probability (0.61) of maintaining its current status in 2030. However, vegetation only has a probability of 0.41 for maintaining its current state, and it could convert to bare land at a probability of 0.43 and to built-up land at a probability of 0.015. The transition probabilities illustrate that most of the LULC are oriented towards the increase of the bare land and built-up land.

TI  - Management of the Axilla in T1-2 Breast Cancer Patients with Macrometastatic Sentinel Node Involvement Who Underwent Breast-Conserving Therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The aims of our study were to determine the incidence of axillary recurrence and arm morbidity in T1-2 invasive breast cancer patients with macrometastases on the sentinel lymph node (SLN) who underwent breast-conserving therapy (BCT), with or without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Methods: One hundred and nine T1-2 invasive breast cancer patients with macrometastases on the SLN who underwent BCT in our institution were included in the study. Patients with 1-2 positive SLN and without extra nodal extension (ENE) on the SLN did not undergo ALND (SLN-only group) and patients with ENE or patients who had >2 metastatic nodes underwent level I, II ALND (ALND group). The SLN-only group received radiotherapy to three axillary levels, the supraclavicular fossa, and +/- mammaria interna. ALND group received radiotherapy to axillary level III, the supraclavicular fossa, and +/- mammaria interna. The incidence of axillary recurrence and arm morbidity were investigated. Results: Of the 109 patients, 18 patients with >2 metastatic SLNs and 10 with ENE on the SLN underwent ALND and 81 patients underwent SLN only. Median follow-up time was 37 months (3-77). There was no axillary recurrence in SLN-only group. However, in the ALND group 1 patient had developed axillary metastasis. There were 2 objective lymphoedema and 3 arm-shoulder restriction cases in the SLN-only group, and 2 and 3 in the ALND group, respectively. Conclusions: Axillary dissection could safely be omitted in patients with 1-2 macrometastatic SLN and without ENE who undergo BCT and axillary radiotherapy.

TI  - Exposure of manufacturing firms to future sea level rise in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is facing notably high levels in current and future flooding. Simultaneously, the ongoing process of rapid industrialization is characterized by the strong emergence of manufacturing firms within the urban area. As manufacturing firms are at the frontline regarding damage caused by flooding, which is often neglected in risk analyses, we argue that the assessment of firms' exposure to flooding is essential for implementing an integrative flood risk governance. Hence, this study maps manufacturing firms in HCMC, using geocoding based on the Vietnam Enterprise Census (2005, 2015), and assesses whether they are exposed to future sea level rise. The maps developed visualize the expansion of manufacturing firms from 2005 to 2015 and the spatial distribution of firms exposed to future sea level rise in HCMC. Our results reveal that particularly domestic, private micro firms in labor-intensive industries, which represent the backbone of the local economy, are exposed, threatening their competitiveness and viability.

TI  - A Combined Quantitative Evaluation Model for the Capability of Hyperspectral Imagery for Mineral Mapping
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - To analyze the influence factors of hyperspectral remote sensing data processing, and quantitatively evaluate the application capability of hyperspectral data, a combined evaluation model based on the physical process of imaging and statistical analysis was proposed. The normalized average distance between different classes of ground cover is selected as the evaluation index. The proposed model considers the influence factors of the full radiation transmission process and processing algorithms. First- and second-order statistical characteristics (mean and covariance) were applied to calculate the changes for the imaging process based on the radiation energy transfer. The statistical analysis was combined with the remote sensing process and the application performance, which consists of the imaging system parameters and imaging conditions, by building the imaging system and processing models. The season (solar zenith angle), sensor parameters (ground sampling distance, modulation transfer function, spectral resolution, spectral response function, and signal to noise ratio), and number of features were considered in order to analyze the influence factors of the application capability level. Simulated and real data collected by Hymap in the Dongtianshan area (Xinjiang Province, China), were used to estimate the proposed model's performance in the application of mineral mapping. The predicted application capability of the proposed model is consistent with the theoretical analysis.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Changes in Evapotranspiration from an Overexploited Water Resources Basin in Arid Northern China and Their Implications for Ecosystem Management
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET), including evaporation from soil and water surfaces and transpiration from vegetation, influences water distribution in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, especially in arid areas where water is a key limiting factor. Therefore, understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of ET, including its two components of soil evaporation (Es) and vegetation transpiration (Ec), can be useful for water resource management and ecological restoration in arid regions. Based on ET data from 2002 to 2012, the spatiotemporal variations in ET were evaluated in the Shiyang River Basin in arid Northwest China. The results showed the following: (1) spatially, ET decreased from upstream of the Qilian Mountains to the middle and downstream, with a mean annual value of 316 mm; (2) temporally, ET showed a single peak curve throughout the year, with the highest value occurring in summer; (3) ET showed a downward trend (from 350 to 265 mm) before 2009 and thereafter increased (from 265 to 345 mm); and (4) water use efficiency, indicated by the ratio of Ec to ET, was low in the cropland, with a mean value of 50.9%. Further analysis indicates that decreases in ET are mainly caused by vegetation decreases; in contrast, ecological restriction measures and strict water resource management policies in the middle reaches of the basin led to ET increases. It is concluded that understanding ET and its two components can elucidate the connections between water and human society.

TI  - Improved aerosol correction for OMI tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> retrieval over East Asia: constraint from CALIOP aerosol vertical profile
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite retrieval of vertical column densities (VCDs) of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is critical for NOx pollution and impact evaluation. For regions with high aerosol loadings, the retrieval accuracy is greatly affected by whether aerosol optical effects are treated implicitly (as additional "effective" clouds) or explicitly, among other factors. Our previous POMINO algorithm explicitly accounts for aerosol effects to improve the retrieval, especially in polluted situations over China, by using aerosol information from GEOS-Chem simulations with further monthly constraints by MODIS/Aqua aerosol optical depth (AOD) data. Here we present a major algorithm update, POMINO v1.1, by constructing a monthly climatological dataset of aerosol extinction profiles, based on level 2 CALIOP/CALIPSO data over 2007-2015, to better constrain the modeled aerosol vertical profiles. We find that GEOS-Chem captures the month-to-month variation in CALIOP aerosol layer height (ALH) but with a systematic underestimate by about 300-600m (season and location dependent), due to a too strong negative vertical gradient of extinction above 1 km. Correcting the model aerosol extinction profiles results in small changes in retrieved cloud fraction, increases in cloud-top pressure (within 2 %-6% in most cases), and increases in tropospheric NO2 VCD by 4 %-16% over China on a monthly basis in 2012. The improved NO2 VCDs (in POMINO v1.1) are more consistent with independent ground-based MAX-DOAS observations (R-2 = 0.80, NMB = -3.4 %, for 162 pixels in 49 days) than POMINO (R-2 = 0.80, NMB = -9.6 %), DOMINO v2 (R-2 = 0.68, NMB = -2.1 %), and QA4ECV (R-2 = 0.75, NMB = -22.0 %) are. Especially on haze days, R-2 reaches 0.76 for POMINO v1.1, much higher than that for POMINO (0.68), DOMINO v2 (0.38), and QA4ECV (0.34). Furthermore, the increase in cloud pressure likely reveals a more realistic vertical relationship between cloud and aerosol layers, with aerosols situated above the clouds in certain months instead of always below the clouds. The POMINO v1.1 algorithm is a core step towards our next public release of the data product (POMINO v2), and it will also be applied to the recently launched S5P-TROPOMI sensor.

TI  - On-board radiometric calibration for thermal emission band of FY-3C/MERSI

AB  - On-board radiometric calibration is the most efficient method to improve the measurement accuracy of satellite-borne sensors. Chinese Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI), loaded on the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) satellite, uses one satellite-borne fixed-temperature blackbody (BB) for its thermal emission band's (TEB) radiometric calibration, but its optimal calibration algorithm is not determined. By using MERSI's on-board calibration data taken on November 2013, this article investigates two algorithms of linear and semi-nonlinear calibration for MERSI TEB's on-board radiometric calibration and finds that the linear calibration is more reasonable than semi-nonlinear calibration because linear coefficients' variation tendency can reflect MERSI's inherent systematic properties better. The relative difference between linear properties and inherent properties for pixel variability being 9.5%, mirror-side variability being 21.5% and scan variability being 17.8% are all smaller than those between semi-nonlinear case and inherent case. All of those suggest that the linear calibration is coincident with the inherent systematic properties. By using MERSI's calibration data at June 2014, the performance of those two algorithms is validated by comparing the difference between inferred BB radiance L-I and standard BB radiance L-S (0.01%), and between inferred BB brightness temperature T-I and standard BB temperature T-S (0.25 K).

TI  - Spatial-temporal patterns of features selected using random forests: a case study of corn and soybeans mapping in the US
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is not easy in remote sensing field to distinguish corn and soybean mapping for the similarity of the mixed summer crops. To understand the variations better and generate corn and soybean maps more accurately, more accurate mapping of these two crops is required. However, classifying different crops with remote sensing is not easy. Finding the discriminating features to use in a mapping classifier can lead to higher-precision mapping. In this paper, we used feature selection of random forests to analyse the most important phenological features for mapping corn and soybeans in the US Corn Belt (also called the Extended Corn Belt, ECB), and identified the spatial and temporal patterns of these features in the ECB. Results show that all the states in the ECB have very similar patterns: Temporal pattern showed that different years always reflected the same pattern. Date-related and phenology curve-related features were the most important. Also, the whole phenology curve was a prerequisite for more accurate mapping. These patterns make the variations more understandable and also support the further research to consider the most important variables for detailed classification.

TI  - Regional-scale rice-yield estimation using stacked auto-encoder with climatic and MODIS data: a case study of South Korea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In South Korea, rice is the most important grain crop that it is crucial to develop yield estimation model for supporting sustainable agriculture and national food security. The main objectives of this paper are (1) to propose a Deep Learning (DL) algorithm, the Stacked Sparse Auto-encoder (SSAE), for rice-yield estimation using climatic and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data; (2) to choose scenarios showing the best combined performance in terms of length of crop season (before and after harvest) and aggregation periods (7, 10, 15, and 30 days) of climatic data; and (3) to analyse the results in both the temporal and spatial perspectives. In this procedure, the SSAE model was built around the study objectives and compared with the artificial neural network (ANN) model for evaluation of its performance. According to the results, the combined 15-day-aggregated climatic data (between June and August) and MODIS data were selected as the optimal feature set for rice-yield estimation in the study area, Jeolla-do; the SSAE model outperformed ANN, showing root mean square error (RMSE) and RMSE% of 33.09 kg(10a)(-1) (5.21 kg(10a)(-1)lower than ANN) and 6.89% (1.14% lower than ANN). Throughout the experiments, the rice-yield-estimation potentiality of a DL algorithm, namely the SSAE, was substantiated.

TI  - Quantifying Grazing Intensity Using Remote Sensing in Alpine Meadows on Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data have been widely used in the study of large-scale vegetation activities, which have important significance in estimating grassland yields, determining grassland carrying capacity, and strengthening the scientific management of grasslands. Remote sensing data are also used for estimating grazing intensity. Unfortunately, the spatial distribution of grazing-induced degradation remains undocumented by field observation, and most previous studies on grazing intensity have been qualitative. In our study, we tried to quantify grazing intensity using remote sensing techniques. To achieve this goal, we conducted field experiments at Gansu Province, China, which included a meadow steppe and a semi-arid region. The correlation between a vegetation index and grazing intensity was simulated, and the results demonstrated that there was a significant negative correlation between NDVI and relative grazing intensity (p < 0.05). The relative grazing intensity increased with a decrease in NDVI, and when the relative grazing intensity reached a certain level, the response of NDVI to relative grazing intensity was no longer sensitive. This study shows that the NDVI model can illustrate the feasibility of using a vegetation index to monitor the grazing intensity of livestock in free-grazing mode. Notably, it is feasible to use the remote sensing vegetation index to obtain the thresholds of livestock grazing intensity.

TI  - Assessment of subsidence in Delhi NCR due to groundwater depletion using TerraSAR-X and persistent scatterers interferometry
T2  - IMAGING SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, high-resolution SAR data is available from different satellites. These datasets have been proved to be a strong source to monitor land subsidence. This paper aims to use high-resolution Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) to estimate the urban subsidence in Delhi NCR. TerraSAR-X images in 68 numbers spread over a period of 26 months during September 2011 - September 2013 have been used to assess the land surface subsidence. The study area is covered with large infrastructure projects such as railway lines, bridges, highways, metro bridges and tunnels. The resultant surface subsidence has been compared with the groundwater table data and it appears that most of the subsidence has been induced by the over-exploitation of groundwater in the area. In some areas, we can clearly see that the rapid construction activities contributing to the surface subsidence phenomenon. Development of a new construction project required groundwater to be used in the activity which impacts the groundwater table. This deterioration of the groundwater table has led to the land subsidence. The study suggests that there is an urgent need to address the issue of groundwater exploitation in the affected areas to check the current phenomenon of subsidence. This is a distinctive work carried out over the study area.

TI  - Atacama Field Campaign: laboratory and in-situ measurements for remote sensing applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents the preliminary results of the first field calibration campaign performed in the Atacama Desert, Chile, between the 18 and 22 August 2014, called the Atacama Field Campaign (ATAFIC 2014). In situ measurements were performed in order to spectrally characterize the surface reflectance spectra between 0.3 and 2.5 mu m, radiometric temperature (8.0-14.0 mu m) and atmospheric measurements. A soil sample was collected and analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and X-Ray Diffraction techniques to characterize the surface reflectance spectra and mineralogical composition, respectively. ASTER land surface emissivity in addition to GOES, MODIS and Landsat-8 land surface temperature (LST) were also used. Results showed that the spectral features of the Atacama soil and the characteristics of this geographical zone, which is featured as the most hyper-arid and cloudless place in the world, make this area a potential target for surface reflectance characterization. Day and night LST comparison between field and remote sensing data are lower than 2 K and the Root Mean Square Error for land surface emissivity is close to 2%. This work opens the possibilities to consider the Atacama Desert as a reference target for calibration and validation activities for earth observation missions' purposes.

TI  - Land Use Change Trends and Their Driving Forces in the Kilombero Valley Floodplain, Southeastern Tanzania
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change (LUC) driven by human activities and natural factors has resulted in the global loss of native biodiversity and the alteration of ecological processes and services across different ecosystems. It is thus necessary to analyze the trends and driving factors that influence land use changes. In this study, moderate resolution Landsat images were freely downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) archives, analyzed using the random forest (RF) algorithm and mapped in ArcGIS 10.2 software to examine the LUC trends from 1990 to 2016 in the Kilombero valley floodplain (KVFP), Tanzania. Participatory rural appraisals (PRA) and household questionnaire surveys were used to assess the potential drivers of LUC. The results show that, from 1990 to 2016, the agricultural land and grassland increased by 11.3% and 13.3%, respectively, while the floodplain wetland area decreased from 4.6% in 1990 to 0.9% in 2016. Based on a questionnaire survey, the intensification of human activities was identified as the proximate driver while population growth, a growing market demand and price incentives for agricultural and forest products coupled with improved infrastructure and biophysical factors such as soil properties, climate variability and terrain characteristics were identified as the underlying drivers of LUC. However, there is interplay among these factors acting simultaneously as well as differently that influence land use changes. Based on these findings, future sustainable land management strategies should include the introduction of the alternative environmentally friendly sources of livelihood, such as beekeeping, the promotion of community participation and education on the importance of sustainable wetland management.

TI  - Assessing soil organic carbon stocks under land-use change scenarios using random forest models
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying changes in soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) is essential for determining appropriate ways to deal with land degradation, for understanding soil and crop management and for gathering useful information for a range of environmental studies. The aim of this study was to predict SOCS and compare under current and potential future land uses. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and bulk density were measured at 137 locations across the Marivan, Kurdistan Province, Iran, and soil SOCS was computed. Auxiliary data including, terrain attributes and Landsat 8 ETM+ data were acquired. Random forest (RF) models were used to relate the SOCS to the auxiliary data. Results suggested that the mean SOCS in the topsoil and subsurface in croplands were lower than in forestland and wetland, although not significantly so. In the area, approximately 18.48% of forestland and 17.39% of wetland has been brought into cultivation. The authors estimate that this has led to a loss of SOCS from forestland topsoil of 22,860 Mg C, and from subsurface of 15,685 Mg C. The SOCS loss from wetland topsoil and subsurface were not as great, at 4193 and 2680 Mg C, respectively, but this was due to the area not being as large.

TI  - A climatological study of the spatio-temporal variability of land surface temperature and vegetation cover of Vadodara district of Gujarat using satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, a comprehensive assessment of the spatio-temporal variation of day-time and night-time land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of Vadodara district of Gujarat in India from 2001 to 2012 has been carried out using satellite data. A significant cooling trend was observed in the day-time LST, whereas the night-time LST showed a distinct warming trend. The entire geographical extent of Vadodara was classified into different night-time LST classes to quantify the extent of the hot pockets, and it showed a clear-cut warming pattern for all the months of the year with an increase in the geographical areas under higher temperature range. Further analysis of Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) also revealed a strong impact of the urbanization process, with annual DTR showing a decreasing trend at the rate of 0.29 degrees C year(-1). An analysis of the vegetation cover of the district showed that on an average, the NDVI of the district increased during the study period. However, a micro-level examination of NDVI values depicted that the type of vegetation cover had drastically changed. The maximum NDVI values for months from May to December for 2012 were much lower than those of 2001 and 2006, indicating a change in vegetation pattern of the district. An assessment of the area under different NDVI values exhibited that for all the months of the year (except September), the total area with NDVI values of higher range (i.e. +0.5 and above) had substantially decreased from 2001 to 2012. The analysis revealed that for some of the months like February, while in 2001, 45% of district exhibited NDVI values above +0.5, but by 2012, it had decreased to only 18%, showing a drastic change in vegetation type and deterioration of the extent of thick dense vegetation.

TI  - Satellite image fusion to detect changing surface permeability and emerging urban heat islands in a fast-growing city
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and extensive urbanization has adversely impacted humans and ecological entities in the recent decades through a decrease in surface permeability and the emergence of Urban Heat Islands (UHI). While detailed and continuous assessments of surface permeability and UHI are crucial for urban planning and management of landuse zones, they mostly involve time consuming and expensive field studies and single sensor derived large scale aerial and satellite imageries. We demonstrated the advantage of fusing imageries from multiple sensors for landuse and landcover (LULC) change assessments as well as for assessing surface permeability and temperature and UHI emergence in a fast growing city, i.e. Tirunelveli, Tamilnadu, India. IRS-LISSIII and Landsat-7 ETM+ imageries were fused for 2007 and 2017, and classified using a Rotation Forest (RF) algorithm. Surface permeability and temperature were then quantified using Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) index, respectively. Finally, we assessed the relationship between SAVI and LST for entire Tirunelveli as well as for each LULC zone, and also detected UHI emergence hot spots using a SAVI-LST combined metric. Our fused images exhibited higher classification accuracies, i.e. overall kappa coefficient values, than non-fused images. We observed an overall increase in the coverage of urban (dry, real estate plots and built-up) areas, while a decrease for vegetated (cropland and forest) areas in Tirunelveli between 2007 and 2017. The SAVI values indicated an extensive decrease in surface permeability for Tirunelveli overall and also for almost all LULC zones. The LST values showed an overall increase of surface temperature in Tirunelveli with the highest increase for urban built-up areas between 2007 and 2017. LST also exhibited a strong negative association with SAVI. Southeastern built-up areas in Tirunelveli were depicted as a potential UHI hotspot, with a caution for the Western riparian zone for UHI emergence in 2017. Our results provide important metrics for surface permeability, temperature and UHI monitoring, and inform urban and zonal planning authorities about the advantages of satellite image fusion.

TI  - Of(f) Course: Michel Foucault, the Mobile Philosopher and his Dreamworlds
T2  - CRITICAL HORIZONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Foucault extolled the Iranian revolution and, anticipating the havoc that his public intervention in favour of the revolution would create, he wrote: "I can already hear the French laughing, but I know that they are wrong". Examining Foucault's (so unlikely) valorisation of certainty and the partisan affectivity it bestows upon knowledge and truth, I read his unusual engagement with the Iranian revolution against the grain. A major tendency is to approach Foucault's Iranian writings as aberration; against this tendency, I read them as an effect of Foucault's specific epistemic and utopian optics. Through a critical reading of neglected aspects of Foucault's comments on Iran, I argue that much nuance is missing when damning critiques fail to see why and how Foucault's interest in an active rather than folklore non-European political identity unveils deeper tensions of his own worldview and outlook on international politics and interrogates mainstream appraisals of Foucault's political philosophy.

TI  - From an essential being to an actor's becoming: political ecology transformational learning experiences in adult education
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Adult education in political ecology entails critically and constructively observing the interactions among the actors involved in socioecological conflicts at global and local scales. This definition invites transcending environmental education and education for sustainability's frontiers, examining the ontology, or the 'place', from where actors co-construct these conflicts. If actors don't question the reified and divided assumptions of the 'self' and 'reality' at the base of these conflicts, the creative and transformative potential of becoming together cannot unfold. The transformational learning approach is a coherent way of addressing this challenge, as it promotes an ontological change in actors and their worldview. The training experience offered by the University of Santiago provides insights into how transformational education's perspective can contribute to education in political ecology, inciting an acknowledgment of the self and the world as a complex and dynamic entanglement of actors.

TI  - Full-polarimetric burn scar mapping - the differences of active fire and post-fire situations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a threat to human lives, infrastructure, and forestry. Satellite-based Earth observations enable a fast, efficient, and reliable estimation of burnt area. In most cases, optical satellite data are used for burn scar detection. However, smoke and cloud coverage strongly limits the suitability of optical imagery for rapid mapping of burn scars. Here, an automated procedure based on quad-polarized L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is presented to enable fast burn scar mapping independently of the weather and smoke conditions. Full-polarimetric SAR data enable the decomposition of the SAR backscatter into different scattering mechanisms, describing the scatterer more precisely. Important differences in the polarimetric backscattering behaviour during the active fire and post-fire situations are reported. While the SPAN difference is best suited for burn scar mapping during active fire situations, the Entropy-Anisotropy-Alpha and the generalized Freeman-Durden decompositions showed the best suitability for burnt area mapping several months after the end of the fire. The proposed methodology is an object-based image analysis approach based on change detection. The big fire event which affected Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, in May-June 2016 was investigated as a case study.

TI  - Improving the reliability of landslide susceptibility mapping through spatial uncertainty analysis: a case study of Al Hoceima, Northern Morocco
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims at providing an answer as to whether generalization obtained with data-driven modelling can be used to gauge the plausibility of the physically based (PB) model's prediction. Two statistical models namely; Weight of Evidence (WofE) and Logistic Regression (LR), and a PB model using the infinite slope assumptions were evaluated and compared with respect to their abilities to predict susceptible areas to shallow landslides at the 1:10.000 urban scale. Threshold-dependent performance metrics showed that the three methods produced statistically comparable results in terms of success and prediction rates. However, with the Area Under the receiver operator Curve (AUC), statistical models are more accurate (88.7 and 84.6% for LR and WofE, respectively) than the PB model (only 69.8%). Nevertheless, in such data-sparse situation, the usual approaches for validation, i.e. comparing observed with predicted data, are insufficient, formal uncertainty analysis (UA) is a means for evaluating the validity and reliability of the model. We then refitted the PB model using a stochastic modification of the infinite slope stability model input scheme using Monte Carlo (MC) method backed with sensitivity analysis (SA). For statistical models, we used an informal Student t-test for estimating the certainty of the predicted probability (PP) at each location. Both modelling outputs independently show a high validity; and whereas the level of confidence in LR and WofE models remained the same after performance re-evaluation, the accuracy of the PB model showed an improvement (AUC = 72%). This result is reasonable and provides a further validation of PB model. So, in urban slope analysis, where PB diagnostic is necessary, statistical and PB modelling may play equally supportive roles in landslide hazard assessment.

TI  - Relative Radiometric Normalisation-performance testing of selected techniques and impact analysis on vegetation and water bodies
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, six image-based Relative Radiometric Normalization (RRN) techniques were applied to normalize the bi-temporal Landsat 5 TM data-set. RRN techniques do not require any atmospheric and ground information at the time of image acquisition. The target image for the year 2009 was normalized in such a way that it resembled the atmospheric and sensor conditions similar to those under which the reference image of the same season for the year 1990 was acquired. Among the selected methods applied, it was found that the Iteratively Reweighted Multivariate Alteration Detection (IR-MAD) method performed better, based on the error statistic. The IR-MAD technique was found to be advantageous as it identified a large set of true time-invariant pixels automatically from the change background using iterative canonical component analysis. The technique also stretches the values of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Water Index and may help to distinguish different vegetation and water bodies better.

TI  - Interpolated fields of satellite-derived multi-algorithm chlorophyll-a estimates at global and European scales in the frame of the European Copernicus-Marine Environment Monitoring Service
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The new level-4 daily chlorophyll-a interpolated products described in this paper and freely available in the Copernicus-Marine Environment Service, aim at providing daily continuous fields (cloud-free) of satellite-derived chlorophyll-a surface concentration at two different resolutions: 4*4 km over the world and 1*1 km resolution over Europe. The multi-sensor daily analyses, by filling the cloudy pixels, provide high-frequency retrievals of chlorophyll-a which can contribute to a better monitoring of the phytoplankton biomass. From a methodological point of view our approach is a combination of a water-typed merge of chlorophyll-a estimates and an optimal interpolation based on the kriging method with regional anisotropic covariance models. These analysed products have been designed to meet the expectations of the end users, by considering both the typical lack of observations during cloudy conditions and the historical multiplicity of available algorithms involved by case 1 (oligotrophic) and case 2 (turbid) water classifications. These products gather MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer), SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor), VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) and OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) daily observations from 1997 to the present. A total product uncertainty, i.e. a combination of the interpolation and the product error, is provided for each pixel.

TI  - Do abandoned farmlands promote spread of invasive alien plants? Change detection analysis of black wattle in montane grasslands of the Eastern Cape
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive alien plants (IAPs) pose a threat to ecosystem integrity and generally provide more disservices than services. Acacia mearnsii (black wattle) was introduced to South Africa for its provisioning and economic potential. Since then, it has colonized large areas and it is a high priority taxon by the Working for Water (WfW) programme. This study establishes the nature of the spread of A. mearnsii in grasslands in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, with the aim of providing feedback to the WfW programme on IAP expansion and focal areas of concern. Land cover change detection analysis using historical aerial photographs showed that A. mearnsii has spread more extensively into disturbed (abandoned cultivation and overgrazed) grasslands compared to undisturbed natural grasslands from the initial plantings prior to 1958. Using the point-centred quarter method to determine density, and an allometric equation to determine above-ground biomass, a growth model for A. mearnsii was prepared. The incremental annual increase in the standing biomass of A. mearnsii using the model, validated against MODIS Net Primary Productivity data, was estimated to be similar to 10.5 ton DM ha(-1) yr(-1). The spread rate of wattle maybe up to 10% and several alternative control strategies need to be considered.

TI  - Definition differences and internal variability affect the simulated Arctic sea ice melt season
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations show that the Arctic sea ice melt season is getting longer. This lengthening has important implications for the Arctic Ocean's radiation budget, marine ecology and accessibility. Here we assess how passive microwave satellite observations of the melt season can be used for climate model evaluation. By using the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM LE), we evaluate the effect of multiple possible definitions of melt onset, freeze onset and melt season length on comparisons with passive microwave satellite data, while taking into account the impacts of internal variability. We find that within the CESM LE, melt onset shows a higher sensitivity to definition choices than freeze onset, while freeze onset is more greatly impacted by internal variability. The CESM LE accurately simulates that the trend in freeze onset largely drives the observed pan-Arctic trend in melt season length. Under RCP8.5 forcing, the CESM LE projects that freeze onset dates will continue to shift later, leading to a pan-Arctic average melt season length of 7-9 months by the end of the 21st century. However, none of the available model definitions produce trends in the pan-Arctic melt season length as large as seen in passive microwave observations. This suggests a model bias, which might be a factor in the generally underestimated response of sea ice loss to global warming in the CESM LE. Overall, our results show that the choice of model melt season definition is highly dependent on the question posed, and none of the definitions exactly match the physics underlying the passive microwave observations.

TI  - Soil salinity mapping using dual-polarized SAR Sentinel-1 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is a major environmental threat, which has a negative impact on soil productivity and agricultural fields. One of the most promising methods for monitoring affected areas, which has special importance in land management studies, is through remote sensing technologies. While the potential of optical imagery in detecting saline soils is widely investigated, limited studies have been dedicated to assessing the potential of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery in monitoring soil salinity. Accordingly, this paper deals with soil salinity estimation using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery in an area which is highly affected by salinity hazard. Due to lack of a suitable theoretical model for simulating radar backscatter of soil based on salt contents, we investigated a new method to relate radar intensity to measured in-situ salinity directly. In the first step, Sentinel-1 dual polarized VV (Vertical transmit Vertical receive) and VH (Vertical transmit Horizontal receive) data were acquired from the study site. A field study was also conducted, simultaneously, and the Electrical Conductivity (EC) of several soil samples was measured. We then extracted some features based on the intensity images of both VV and VH polarization. Based on the fact that the target texture affects the radar response, an analysis of the texture was also performed by calculating the first and second order statistics, extracted from the histogram and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), respectively. The Support Vector Regression (SVR) technique, with different kernel functions, was used to relate explanatory variables to ground measured salinity. We also applied Feature Selection (FS) algorithms of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Sequential Feature Selection (SFS) for optimizing the model and selecting the best explanatory features. The results showed that epsilon-SVR with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel had the most accuracy with the Coefficient of Determination (R-2) = 0.9783 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.3561 when the GA FS was applied. Also and had the best performance in salinity detection. It can be concluded that the intensity images of VV and VH polarization of SAR imagery have the potential to discriminate saline surface soils, regardless of the failure of common backscattering models.

TI  - Imaging of Metastatic Cancer Cells in Sentinel Lymph Nodes using Affibody Probes and Possibility of a Theranostic Approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate detection of lymph node metastases is essential for treatment success in early-stage malignant cancer. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the most effective procedure for detecting small or micrometastases that are undetectable by conventional imaging modalities. To demonstrate a new approach for developing a more efficient SLN biopsy procedure, we reported a two-stage imaging method combining lymphoscintigraphy and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging to depict metastatic cancer cells in SLNs in vivo. Furthermore, the theranostic potential of the combined procedure was examined by cell culture and xenograft mouse model. Anti-HER2 and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) affibody probes were used for NIR fluorescence imaging. Strong NIR fluorescence signal intensity of the anti-EGFR affibody probe was observed in SAS cells (EGFR positive). Radioactivity in the SLNs was clearly observed in the in vivo studies. High anti-EGFR affibody NIR fluorescence intensity was observed in the metastatic lymph nodes in mice. The addition of the IR700-conjugated anti-EGFR affibody to the culture medium decreased the proliferation of SAS cells. Decreased proliferation was shown in Ki-67 immunohistochemistry in xenograft tumors. Our data suggest that a two-stage combined imaging method using lymphoscintigraphy and affibody probes may offer the direct visualization of metastatic lymph nodes as an easily applied technique in SLN biopsy. Although further animal studies are required to assess the effect of treating lymphatic metastasis in this approach, our study results provide a foundation for the further development of this promising imaging and treatment strategy for earlier lymph node metastasis detection and treatment.

TI  - Social dominance orientation, fear of terrorism and support for counter-terrorism policies
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Following September 11 and the subsequent heightened fear of terrorism from more recent events, this study examines the role of Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) in explaining individuals' support for counter-terrorism policies that infringe individual liberties in pursuit of defending community security. Three hypotheses are proposed: (1) that SDO positively predicts support for 'defensive' counter-terrorism policies such as the maintenance of strong border protection; (2) that SDO positively predicts fear of terrorism and fear of Islamic extremism; (3) that the relationship between SDO and support for defensive policies is mediated by fear. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 1200 Australian adults, with support found for each hypothesis. Counter-terrorism policies commonly encounter trade-offs between community-wide security and individual-level liberties; pursuit of optimal security tends to require infringement of those liberties. This research demonstrates that high SDO citizens will support such policies, particularly as fear increases.

TI  - Detection of sentinel lymph node using contrast-enhanced agent, Sonazoid<SUP>™</SUP>, and evaluation of its metastasis with superb microvascular imaging in oral and oropharyngeal cancers: a preliminary clinical study
T2  - ACTA OTO-LARYNGOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for head and neck cancers, the radioisotope method has been the gold standard. However, this method has several problems, such as unavoidable radiation exposure and requirements of expensive equipment. Aims/Objectives: To overcome these problems, we evaluated the contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS)-guided SLN-detection method, and predicted the SLN metastatic status using novel ultrasound technology, superb microvascular imaging (SMI). Methods: Ten patients (6 with oral and 4 with oropharyngeal cancers) without neck lymph node metastasis were enrolled in this study. Ultrasound contrast agent, Sonazoid((TM)), was infiltrated into the mucosa at the primary site to observe the lymphatic ducts and SLNs in the neck field. The detected SLNs were examined for blood flow using SMI to categorize the SLNs metastases-positive or negative. Results: SLNs were successfully detected in 8 out of 10 cases. In 7 out of the 8 cases, in whom SLNs were successfully detected, the metastatic status of SLNs was correctly diagnosed with SMI. Conclusions and significance: Although more clinical data are needed based on a larger cohort, establishing the CEUS-guided SLN-detection and criteria for the accurate diagnosis of SLN-metastases using SMI would be valuable as an alternative to radioisotope method, in oral and oropharyngeal cancers.

TI  - Spatiotemporal crop NDVI responses to climatic factors in mainland China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has caused a great impact on vegetation growth, production and distribution through variations of precipitation, temperature and sunshine. In this study, a categorization of zones for vegetation responses to climatic variability was conducted. Seasonal and annual crop responses to climate change in each region were analysed with multiple linear regression. The results show that the annual impact of climatic factors on crop growth was most significant in lower North China (R-2 = 0.48) and most insignificant in Northeast China (R-2 = 0.22). Temperature is the limiting climatic factor for crop growth annually in North China and Northeast China (zones 1-3), (p <= 0.05), while sunshine duration plays an important role for crop growth in zones which are more southern (zones 3 similar to 5). Precipitation significantly affects the annual crop growth in Inner Mongolia-Hebei-Shandong zone (zone 2) and Southeast zone (zone 5). Therefore, more attention should be paid to these zones. The spring temperature is the limiting climatic factor for crop growth in all the zones (p <= 0.05). Spring warming is helpful for crop growth in mainland China. Different agricultural and administrative measures should be taken in each zone to adapt to future climate change.

Using data on four samples from the 1992 Gallup "Health of the Planet" Survey and the 2003 and 2010 Chinese General Social Surveys, we found that in all samples not only is the NEP the most powerful predictor of EC, but it also mediates the effects of socio-demographic variables on EC as hypothesized. The results confirm that the NEP is the source of coherence of EC, making it a meaningful construct.

TI  - Studies of precipitable water vapour characteristics on a global scale
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric water vapour plays an important role in hydrological, global climate change, atmospheric, and meteorological processes. In this study, precipitable water vapour (PWV) data set for 2004-2017 was first estimated with an average accuracy of about 1.28 mm globally using the products provided by the International Global Navigation Satellite System Service and Global Geodetic Observation System Atmosphere and then the spatio-temporal trends of PWV variation were characterized. Periodic signals of the annual, semi-annual, and seasonal variations of PWV time series were detected based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and analysed by dividing the whole world into five geographical zones. From a global perspective, the average PWV has an increasing trend, which may be caused by global warming effects and anthropogenic activities. Analysis of different PWV amplitudes also shows that the main component of the PWV is annual amplitude except in low latitude zones. In addition, the PWV differences between weekends and weekdays for four seasons are also analysed globally, and the result indicates that the weekend effects caused by anthropogenic activity depend on season and region

AB  - This contribution is part of a project for the identification, research and protection of archaeological evidence in the village of Sant'Arsenio (SA), through the use of new technologies applied to archaeological research. In particular, the activity combines typical Remote Sensing tools (satellite data and UAVs), with a preference for open source software and open access databases, and common archaeological research practices (study of ancient and modern bibliographic sources, field survey, topographic analysis, etc.). Sant'Arsenio is a small town in the western part of Vallo di Diano, a large plain surrounded by mountains, between 450 and 480 m above sea level, located on the border between Campania and Basilicata. Information about the archaeological potential of the Sant'Arsenio appear to be relatively scarce compared to those available for the surrounding municipalities (Polla, Atena Lucana, Teggiano, Sala Consilina). This lack is due to the absence of systematic studies and planned archaeological research activities in the municipality. This paper presents the data collected between the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 by IMAA-CNR (Istituto di Metodologie per l'Analisi Ambientale del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche). In particular, the satellite data (Sentinel-2), assisted by archaeological research, allowed to identify some anomalies of archaeological interest.

TI  - GIS-based Landslide Susceptibility Evaluation Using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) Approach: The Case of Tarmaber District, Ethiopia
T2  - MOMONA ETHIOPIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are one of the natural threats that often result in great loss of life and destruction of property in Ethiopia. One of the areas that is affected by landslides of different types and sizes is the Tarmaber district in the rift margin in the central part of Ethiopia. Keeping in view the cause and effect relationship and mitigation, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach is used in the present case to understand the possible causes for landslides. Based on AHP, landslide susceptibility map is produced for Tarmaber using field survey data, remote sensing data, and geographic information system tools. The factors considered in the present case that can influence landslides are lithology, proximity to fault, land use, proximity to drainage, slope gradient, aspect and elevation. The results are validated with the inventory of landslide occurrences. The landslide susceptibility index (LSI) is calculated using the weighted -linear combination (WLC) technique based on the assigned weight and rating given by the AHP method. The accuracy of the results verified using the existing landslide locations is about 88.6%. The landslide susceptibility zonation map has identified our classes/zones: very high (29%), high (44%), moderate (20.0%) and low (7%).

AB  - Fuel wood extraction and its implication for the environment and development have been on increase worldwide. It is a known fact that the utilization of fuel wood in Nigeria contributes greatly to desertification, deforestation and consequently has implications with regard to climate change. Very little is however known on the situation in Gombe State, more especially the extent of the impact. This study focuses on the assessment of socio-economic and environmental impacts of fuel wood exploitation in Gombe state. This was achieved through examining the patterns, levels and temporal variation of fuel wood supply between seasons; the empirical estimate of daily harvest and supply of fuel wood to various parts of the country from the sources in Gombe state, Nigeria. Two forest reserves were selected and five sites and communities in each of them were picked based on a checklist. Determinants of fuel wood such as quantity of fuel wood per kilogram per week were observed. Interview, focus group discussions (FGD) and questionnaire surveys were used to generate data from the respondents on the impacts of the exploitation on the socio-economy settings of the source areas. The environmental impact was assessed by conducting time-series analyses of satellite imageries such as LANDSATS over a period often years (2016-2017). The results show that the there are more negative impacts and the destruction was caused more by land clearing for agricultural production. Recommendations were made at the end of the study, based on the findings.

AB  - In the last 20 years, a number of Earth observation satellite missions has been launched, resulting in a considerable improvement in the spatiotemporal capabilities of applied remote sensing. In order to survey the main recent flooding events in Chott El Jerid, Tunisia, dated to April 2007, September 2009, June 2014 and February 2015, time-series of MODIS-Terra data have been used. The maximum surface area of the water bodies reached 660 km(2) in 2007 and 2014. The flooding event of September 2009 was the longest event (88 days) compared to only 35 days for the exceptional June event in 2014. The daily acquisition of images, the spectral range and the large swath of the sensor are well-adapted to estimate the extent of the ephemeral lake in an area that is difficult to investigate in the field. It remains difficult to decipher the part of water from direct precipitation, runoff from the reliefs and aquifer resurgence.

AB  - Low melanin level in white skin results in many genetic alterations that activate oncogenes to form metastatic melanomas because of interaction with ultraviolet rays. These melanomas are uncommon, but they arc dangerous and spread rapidly in the individual's body. Individuals with fair, freckled skin; a weak immune system; or have a personal or family history of melanoma are at high risk to have melanoma. There are different stages of melanomas. All have some treatments, but to achieve more efficient treatment, clinical trials are being done. Some of the treatments involve immunotherapy, radiotherapy, surgeries, and sentinel lymph node biopsy.

AB  - The deterioration of forests has contributed to greenhouse effect on massive scale, during last four decades and related regional climatic changes and rapid disappearance of natural landscapes left unattended will cause no sign of forests in the past. The integrated remote sensing technology applied to assess forest resources cover information regarding health and related problems and depended factors such as rural population, livestock and wildlife. The main focus of this study is to quantitatively assess deforestation to evaluate forest cover change from 1979 to 2010. The employment of space borne Landsat MSS and TM sensor (multi-spectrum sensor & thematic Mapper) technology is used to analyze forests patterns and Maximum Likelihood Algorithm is applied for quantitative assessment. This study was also conducted to carry out field survey in Thatta riverine forest from Kotri barrage to Arabian Sea and three hundred samples were collected from different locations using GPS device (global positioning system) the results of remote sensing satellite imagery helped to find out significant changes in Thatta forests cover from 1979 to 2010. The forests cover in 1979 was 35.11%, 1992 29.14%, 1998 8.10%, 2000 5.56%, 2006 2.57%, 2009 1.96%, 2009-12 3.02% and 2010 2.23% the overall change observed in forests area 89.07%. The field survey revealed that the main causes of deforestation asconstruction of dams/barrages on the upper streams to produce hydroelectric power and irrigation purpose which significantly reduction in the discharge of fresh water into the lower Indus basin. The reduction in flood caused severe erosion of the Indus Delta; the sea water has been encroached the Indus basin and livestock population increased grazing load and illegal tree cutting; these main causes directly impacted on natural sub- tropical forests and also effected rural population which depended on forests produced. All these uncontrolled situations have been creating environmental, climatically, social and economical problems direct impacted on Indus region and these changes threatening Indus Eco-region system.

TI  - Wind regime and sand transport in the Sistan and Registan regions (Iran/Afghanistan)
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Both, the formation of aeolian dunes and the rate of sand transport in arid environments are controlled by the wind regime. The Sistan region in eastern Iran and the Registan region in Southwestern Afghanistan are strongly influenced by the wind of 120 days (Sadobist Roozeh wind), which is blowing along the Iran-Afghanistan border from North to South, then shifts it's direction toward the Southeast into the Sistan region and, finally, continues eastward into southwestern Afghanistan, forming the Registan sand seas. It blows during the hot season due to the pressure gradient between the Turkmenistan high and the Pakistan Low. In order to determine the wind regime and the sand transport, wind roses based on long-term datasets from 16 meteorological stations, the Drift Potential (DP), the Resultant Drift Direction (RDD), the Resultant Drift Potential (RDP) and the RDP/DP ratio have been calculated using the Fryberger (1979) method. The distribution of the Registan sand dunes was surveyed by using Landsat ETM data, Google Earth scenes and field operations (the latter only in the Iranian part). The spatial differences of the drift potential were also mapped using GIS and geostatistical methods overlaying the sand dune map. The results show that the drift potential (DP) increases from north to south along the border between Iran and Afghanistan and reaches to highest values in the Sistan region, then decreases gradually in the Registan sand seas. The highest wind energy, based on DP matches, was determined exactly where the ephemeral lakes in the northern part of the Sistan plain are located, which function as a source area of intense dust and sand storms during the dry season. The temporal trend of the DP showed an increase between 1999 and 2007, followed by a decrease until 2015 in Sistan. The results show that the wind regime in the Sistan and Registan regions is unimodal during the wind of 120 days (the Sadobist Roozeh) period, which is also supported by the dominance of transverse, barchanoid and barchans dunes in both regions.

AB  - Current satellite data retrieval systems retrieves data using latitude, longitude, date, time and sensor parameters like wind, cloud etc. To achieve concept based satellite data retrieval like Storm, Hurricane, Overcast and Frost etc., requires ontological concept descriptions using satellite observation parameters and concept based classification of satellite data. The current research work has designed and implemented a two phase methodology to achieve this. The phase 1 defines ontology concepts through satellite observation parameters and phase 2 describes ontology concept based satellite data classification. The efficiency of the methodology is been tested by taking the Kalpana satellite data from MOSDAC and weather ontology. This achieves concept based retrieval of satellite data, application interoperability and strengthen the ontologies. The current methodology is implemented and results in concept based satellite data classification, storage and retrieval.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Unsuitable practices and improper land management lead to soil degradation and therefore deviates land from optimum productivity. Remote sensing indices and spatial variability of soil properties were implemented in Arc GIS model-Builder for quantitative assessment of land degradation in Siwa Oasis, western desert, Egypt. Semivariogram model through Kriging techniques was used to produce maps of soil properties in two dates 2002 and 2017. This was done in order to calculate soil degradation rates and its areas in the studied area. The results indicated that geostatistical approach and ArcGIS model-builder can directly reveal the spatial variability of soil properties and measure accurately the changes in soil properties. The results will help the farmers and decision makers for improving the soil-water management. The cross-validation results illustrated the smoothing effect of the spatial prediction. Physical and chemical properties of 90 soil profiles were analyzed and chemical parameters were analyzed of 30 groundwater sample, collected from irrigation-wells. Landsat images of five different periods were collected to monitor the changes of the surface features of soil salinity and water logging. Soil analyses show a wide variability. The very saline, non-sodic soils cover most of the suited soils. Agricultural areas, saline soils and water logged areas were increased. The increment of saline soil and water logged areas is associated with poor drainage and increment in crop irrigation. There is degradation in groundwater quality which indicated by its salinity. The studied soils are salt-affected and this prompts the need of a proper land reclamation program and prods the development of effective irrigation and drainage systems.

AB  - Urbanization has a dynamic structure especially in megacities and therefore rapid detection of the urban is vital for sustainable management of the city. In this work, we apply a multi-source feature data approach to investigate the urban area of Istanbul, Turkey which is a megacity with an approximate 15 million inhabitant, and under strong both anthropogenic and natural pressures. In order to analyse and compare the spatial pattern of the urban footprint, different techniques are applied. Speckle divergence, backscatter and repeat pass interferometric coherence values are considered for the analysis. To this aim, L-band HH and HV polarized ALOS-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were acquired from Japan Space Exploration Agency's (JAXA). Pixel based Random Forest Classification method was used for the urban mapping. During the classification, different scenarios have been applied using speckle divergence, backscatter and coherence information. Overall, user and producer accuracies were calculated from the error matrix. While comparing HH and HV polarimetry, in each scenario HH provided much higher accuracies than HV results. Speckle divergence and backscatter values yielded similar accuracies which is around 88% for urban class. However, coherence gave approximately 69% while it is classified individually. The contribution of coherence was extracted while coherence was stacked with speckle divergence, and the result was improved to 91% The urban areas was extracted with a maximum accuracy of maximum 93% while all information was combined. The preliminary results allow us to obtain a comprehensive image of urban structure, and indicate that the results may reference address for further analysis of multi-temporal SAR data over large and complicated mega cities.

AB  - Desertification is a natural event that endangers the the world's ecology in different ways, and the unfavorable consequences of this event can be observed in various sections of the Earth. Designing evaluation systems that can investigate the process of destruction and adopt suitable strategies for dealing with this phenomenon is essential and important. In the meantime, selecting indices that can show a clear picture of the status of desertification can play a key role in the decision-making process. In this research, effective indices in desertification, such as vegetation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, land surface temperature(LST), soil salinity, and rainfall were used on the basis of MODIS satellite data, MERRA, and TRMM for two periods in 2000 and 2013. Then, an AHP method was used to weigh the time variations of each index for 2000 and 2013. Finally, the most effective index for assessing the vulnerability of the study area to desertification in a 13-year period was determined Results showed that the evapotranspiration index with a weight of 0.412 had the highest importance, and the LST index with a weight of 0.037 had the least importance among other indices. Therefore, the time variations of these indices showed a significant role in the vulnerability assessment of the Mashhad regions to desertification.

AB  - Finding locations suitable for disposal of solid waste is one of the fundamental challenges facing municipal cities and environmental stability. The present study aims to identify the most suitable solid waste disposal site using Geographic Information System (GIS), remote sensing, and the multi criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique. In addition, the study compares the proposed method for suitability with the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach A new validation approach was applied to evaluate the accuracy of the AHP and Fuzzy logic methods based on the selected solid waste locations. Remote sensing data (ASTER GDEM) and field/reference maps were used to derive 12 conditioning factors required to produce a suitable location for solid waste disposal. The result shows that the accuracy of AHP, based on the consistency index (CI), is acceptable (greater than 0.1). However, Fuzzy logic was shown to be more accurate than AHP. The total surface areas of suitable locations based on AHP and Fuzzy models are 4.4 km(2) and 13.35 km(2), respectively. This study showed that AHP, Fuzzy logic and GIS can be integrated for waste management decision issues related to site selection to reduce negative effects on the environment and inhabitants.

M3  - Data study
AB  - In this study, the early stage of European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus, L.) infestation (so-called green attack) is investigated using Landsat-8 optical and thermal data. We conducted an extensive field survey in June and the beginning of July 2016, to collect field data measurements from a number of infested and healthy trees in the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP), Germany. In total, 157 trees were selected, and leaf traits (i.e. stomatal conductance, chlorophyll fluorescence, and water content) were measured. Three Landsat-8 images from May, July, and August 2016 were studied, representing early stage, advanced stage, and post-infestation, respectively. Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) sensitive to the measured traits were calculated from the optical domain (VIS, NIR and SWIR), and canopy surface temperature (CST) was calculated from the thermal infrared band using the Mono-window algorithm. The leaf traits were used to examine the impact of bark beetle infestation on the infested trees and to explore the link between these traits and remote sensing data (CST and SVIs). The differences between healthy and infested samples regarding measured leaf traits were assessed using the Students t-test. The relative importance of the CST and SVIs for estimating measured leaf traits was evaluated based on the variable importance of the projection (VIP) obtained from the partial least square regression (PLSR) analysis. A temporal comparison was then made for SVIs with a VIP > 1, including CST, using boxplot. Finally, the clustering method using a principal components analysis (PCA) was used to visually examine how well the two groups of sample plots (healthy and infested) are separated in 2-D space based on principal component scores. The results revealed that all measured leaf traits were significantly different (p <0.05) between healthy versus infested samples, and CST was found to has a stronger correlation with all measured leaf traits compared to SVIs. Moreover, the study showed that CST was superior to the SVIs in detecting subtle canopy changes due to bark beetle infestation for the three months considered in this study. Results showed that CST is an essential variable for estimating measured leaf traits VIP > 1, improving the results of clustering when used with other SVIs. The new insight offered by this study is that the stress induced by the early stage of bark beetle infestation is more pronounced by Landsat-8 thermal bands than the SVIs calculated from its optical bands. The potential of CST in detecting the green attack stage would have positive implications for the forest practice. Copyright: info:eu-repo/semantics/restrictedAccess DANS License

TI  - Quantifying the spatiotemporal patterns of forest degradation in a fragmented, rapidly urbanizing landscape: A case study of Gazipur, Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapidly growing population of Bangladesh is significantly influencing forest degradation. Recent economic development and industrialization in Gazipur, a district adjacent to the capital, Dhaka, has further aggravated this situation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to understand the causes of forest degradation in Bangladesh using Gazipur as a case study. The forest land conversion was evaluated in this district using supervised classification with the Random Forest algorithm based on Landsat images from 2002, 2007, and 2015. This data was used to conduct a land conversion analysis to study the relative changes in the defined classes. In the study, built-up areas, trees outside forest, and cropland areas increased by 654.38%, 87.44%, and 40.71%, respectively, while forest, waterbody, and fallow land areas decreased by 62.67%, 54.10%, and 46.95%, respectively. The land cover change analysis revealed that forest areas, particularly those dominated by the threatened sal tree (Shorea robusta), were converted into other land-use classes. Bangladesh-specific development indicators from the World Bank were also incorporated into the study to better understand the underlying situation. The results support the formation of policies and planning to reverse forest degradation as per the Paris Climate Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals. Such environmental degradation should be considered by the government and development agencies as a critical issue in Bangladesh, where more sustainable forest resource management is needed to achieve forest degradation neutrality.

AB  - A study was conducted to investigate the effect of the brick industry on the environmental system of these project soils of the brick factories in Alnahrawan district. Remote sensing techniques was used to study the relationship between the spectral reflectivity and the vegetative index on the one hand and some surface soil characters of the project and to determine the variation in vegetation cover for the same area and for two different periods.Ten sites were selected to study spectral reflectivity under similar geomorphological conditions near the brickworks project in the Anahrawan district with an area of 10,000 hectares. Soil samples were taken from the surface and at a depth of 0-30 cm. Some chemical and physical characters of research soil were analyzed in the soil department laboratories, college of Agriculture, Baghdad University.Several satellite images taken from the satellite Land sat (ETM) 2013 and another from same satellite in 1990 T.M to determining the change between the two periods. After obtaining remote sensing data (reflectivity and vegetation index).the correlation analysis was carried out between these data. It was observed that the soil salinity values were decreased due to the drainage that the area was confined between the Tigris River and the Diyala tributary which leads to good natural drainage.The attached tables indicate that thedigital numbers of the soil sampling sites in 2013 are highly significant correlated, While some of the characters did not show the use of this region industrially. After calculating the difference between the two images to determine the change. A 100% change was observed and the vegetation cover was sharply reduced between the two images. as well as the extension of the land of empty land, although these lands are still suitable for agriculture.

AB  - We use L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar data to reveal crustal deformation associated with the eruption of Sierra Negra volcano, Galapagos Island, on June 26, 2018. Intensity analysis revealed the area of lava flowing out from the northside of the mountain. Interferograms resulted in large surface displacement in the crater as well as the northwestern slope of the summit Using the offset fields from ascending and descending orbit data, we calculated 3D deformation, showing about 8 m subsidence in the crater. The amount of the deformation was greater than that in the previous eruptions, which implies the volume of magma accumulation and flowing out can be larger than that in the past events.

AB  - Speckle reduction is a necessary step for many applications. Very effective methods have been developed in the recent years for single-image speckle reduction and multi-temporal speckle filtering. However, to reduce the presence of sidelobes around bright targets, SAR images are spectrally weighted and this processing impacts the speckle statistics by introducing spatial correlations. These correlations severely impact speckle reduction methods that require uncorrelated speckle as input. Thus, spatial down-sampling is typically applied to reduce the speckle spatial correlations prior to speckle filtering. To better preserve the spatial resolution, we describe how to correctly resample SAR images and extract bright targets in order to process full-resolution images with speckle-reduction methods.

AB  - Floodplain hydro-geomorphology is the major factor for vegetation growth and biomass. Characterizing interaction between the vegetation and hydro-geomorphology is essential to better understanding river ecosystems in arid regions. In this study, considering the various hydro-geomorphological dynamics of floodplains, the study area was divided into four functional zones and spatialized lateral variations of the floodplain fluvial disturbance intensity, sediment erosion and deposition process, moisture dynamics and vegetation growth condition through Landsat and daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series between 2010-2015. And analyzed the various interactions between floodplain vegetation and hydro-geomorphology in different floodplain lateral zones. Results shows that the highest vegetation NDVI values (>0.4) are distributed in the regularly static floodplain area where characterized regular flood inundation and has moderate moisture ability. Vegetation NDVI values in the frequency inundation, wet and highly dynamic floodplain area are mainly less than 0.2. Results indicate that different hydro-geomorphological processes dominated in floodplains, therefore plants and hydro-geomorphology interact each other in different ways from river to floodplain margins. Using remote sensing time series can be better characterizing the different interactions between floodplain vegetation and hydro-geomorphology. This study can help to better management of river ecosystems in the arid region floodplains.

AB  - Soil moisture is a key component of water balance models. Physically, it is a nonlinear function of parameters that are not easily measured spatially, such as soil texture and soil type. Thus, several studies have been conducted on the estimation of soil moisture using remotely sensed data and data mining techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). However, all models developed based on these techniques are limited to site-specific applications where they are trained and their parameters are tuned. Moreover, since the system of non-linear equations produced by and conducted in the machine learning process are not accessible to researchers, each application of these machine learning approaches must repeat these training steps for any new study area. The fact that the results of this machine learning, black box approach cannot be easily transferred to different locations for extraction of soil moisture estimates is frustrating, and it can lead to inaccurate comparisons between methods or model performance. To overcome the Black-box issue, this study employed a powerful technique called genetic programming (GP), which is a combination of an evolutionary algorithm and artificial intelligence, to simulate soil moisture at different levels using high-resolution, multispectral imagery acquired with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The output of this approach is either a linear or nonlinear empirical equation that can be used by others. The performance of GP was compared with ANN and SVM modeling results. Several sets of high-resolution aerial imagery captured by the Utah State University AggieAir UAV system over two experimental pasture sites located in northern and southern Utah were used for this soil moisture estimation approach. The inputs used to train these models include the reflectance for the visible, near-infrared (NIR), and thermal bands. The results show (1) the performance of GP versus ANN and SVM and (2) the master equation provided by GP, which can be used in other locations and applications.

AB  - We consider results of geo-information tools development for Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Arctic and Subarctic while climate change. The main attention we gave to obtaining information on the state of soil and vegetation cover in coastal areas of the Arctic and Subarctic, as integrated indicator of climate change. In study, we used: Foresight technologies, remote sensing methods, theory of decision making under uncertainties, risk management approach, methods of data bases constructing. Recently, geo-information management for Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Arctic and Subarctic while climate change demonstrates new digitalization peculiarities in data obtaining and presenting. We considered the model of geo-information support for observation of the state for soil and vegetation cover in hard-to-reach areas of the Arctic according to remote sensing data, obtained with the help of modern satellite systems Sentinel-1, Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and MODIS. While research, we gave preference to the remote sensing using in digital management platforms, which integrate heterogeneous hardware and software resources with the use of web-technologies in distributed networks and wide application of cloud services. We used platform https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Valery_Abramov2/ for preliminary data exchange and discussion.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, most of the outcrops around the historic gold mines in Egypt had been damaged by the local miners, a situation that complicated remote sensing-based exploration research activities. Madari gold mine area was no more fortunate than other mines in the region. This study identifies a new integrated remote sensing workflow that emphasizes the spectral variations related to differences in chemical and mineralogical compositions of the investigated rock units and deemphasizes the spectral variations introduced by the local miners. All combinations of ratio images are first generated from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data, then a suite of ratio images that best differentiates between the investigated units is selected, and finally the selected ratio images were stacked to substitute the original image bands in the further processing techniques. The PCA was then applied to the selected ratio images within the stack. Subsequently, a statistical analysis of the eigenvector matrix for each of the PC bands was conducted to select the optimum PC bands and a Principal Component False Color Composite image (PC-FCC) was created from the three selected PC bands. The PC-FCC image (PC3, PC11, PC4 in RGB) was chosen as a result of subtracting the average PC eigenvector negative weights from the average positive eigenvectors weights. Not only was the PC-FCC image used to distinguish the main rock units in the damaged area, but also, to identify the areas with intense alteration zones.

M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity, whether natural or human induced, is a major geo-hazard in arid and semi-arid landscapes. In agricultural lands, it negatively affects plant growth, crop yields, whereas in semi-arid and arid non-agricultural areas it affects urban structures due to subsidence, corrosion and ground water quality, leading to further soil erosion and land degradation. Accurately mapping soil salinity through remote sensing techniques has been an active area of research in the past few decades particularly for agricultural lands. Most of this research has focused on the utilization and development of salinity indices for properly mapping and identifying saline agricultural soils. This research develops a soil salinity index and model using Landsat 8 OLI image data from the near infra-red and shortwave infra-red spectral information with emphasis on soil salinity mapping and assessment in non-agricultural desert arid and semi-arid surfaces. The developed index when integrated into a semi-empirical model outperformed in its soil salinity mapping overall accuracy (60%) in comparison to other salinity indices (similar to 50%). The newly developed index further outperformed other indices in its accuracy in mapping and identifying high saline soils (67%) and excessively high saline soils (90%).

AB  - The soil surface humidity parameter over vegetated fields is of great importance for controlling water consumption; prevention of salinity caused by over-irrigation; efficient use of irrigation system and improving the yield and quality of the cultivated crop. However, determination of the soil surface humidity is very difficult on vegetated fields. In order to overcome this problem, polarimetric decomposition models and machine learning based regression model were implemented. The main purpose of this study is to predict soil surface humidity on moderately vegetated fields. Thus, the study is conducted in agricultural fields of Dicle University and it consists of several stages. In the first stage, a Radarsat-2 data was obtained in 3 March 2016 and the local humidity samples were measured simultaneously with the Radarsat-2 acquisition. In the second stage, 10 polarimetric features were obtained from each cell (2x2 pixels) of ground sample by utilizing standard intensity-phase technique as well as Freeman-Durden and H/A/alpha polarimetric decomposition models. This step is repeated for all ground samples and as a result, a dataset with 156x10 lengths is formed. In the next stage, Extreme Learning Machine based Regression (ELM-R) model was used for predicting the soil surface humidity with the aid of polarimetric SAR features. For the validation of the proposed system, leave-one-out cross-validation method was applied and finally, 2.19% Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were computed.

AB  - Surface water change is a very important indicator for environmental, climatic, and anthropogenic activities. Remotes sensors, such as Landsat, have been providing data since the last four decades, which are useful for extracting land cover types such as forest and water. Researchers have proposed many surface water extraction techniques, among which index-based methods are popular owing to their simplicity and cost effectiveness. By using the standard and Otsu threshold methods, water features can be mapped, thus changes can be detected. On the basis of the results of this study, the following water indices were applied, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), water ratio index (WRI), and simple water index (SWI) for surface water extraction, and their changes using Landsat images. Three unique test sites from Nepal, which represent overall types of water features found in the country, were selected for this study. A model was developed in ArcGIS to differentiate the water features based on index methods and changes were calculated in terms of positive and negative. The results show that most of the case water index methods based on standard and Otsu thresholds cannot accurately separate water from its nearby backgrounds, such as melting ice, shadows of hills with or without vegetation, grasslands, and wet barren sand. From the current cases, it is not recommended to use the water indices in Nepal without any appropriate expert opinion or sitewise calibrated thresholding for automated water detection. However, they can be used for the overall change detection. Most of the change maps of the selected lakes showed good accuracies in some unique cases, such as the dark shadow and forest near a water body. SWI is good for stagnant lakes but not for water bodies with shifting features, such as the Koshi River. The model can be very useful in quickly understanding the changes in water bodies and taking the necessary measures to planners, but not much in accurate mapping. Furthermore, studies of different seasons, sensor data, and sites are necessary in the use of standard water indices for accurate change detection.

TI  - Decision-tree-based Mapping of Erosion-prone Areas in Hilly Regions of Kangwon Province, North Korea
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - After the division of the Korean peninsula, North Korea overexploited their natural resources especially the forest. It lost about 23% of the total forest from 1990 to 2011, which continues today. However, the country is inaccessible to monitor such changes. Hence, in this study, we aim to use Landsat 8 imagery with the aid of Google Earth to map erosion-prone areas in a subset area of Kangwon Province, North Korea. Pruned Decision Tree (DT) modeling was used in selecting the optimum ratio/index and threshold based on ground truth points extracted for Landsat scenes from May, October, and both months combined. Pruned DT resulted in applying the normalized green, near-infrared (NIR), green ratio vegetation index (GRVI), red-green ratio index (RGRI), infrared percentage vegetation index (IPVI), and slope with the optimum threshold for the segmentation of the study area with reasonable accuracy. The result shows that combining the ground truths from different seasons resulted in rules giving higher overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient than the individual rule results. However, interchanging ground truths of different months is not effective. On average, out of the total land, high and medium erosion-prone areas are 15 and 20%, respectively. The remaining 65% is covered by forest. The result can be useful for estimating loss and restoring resources such as forest and land in the future.

AB  - EU forestry does not currently have automatic planters, hence the project proposes to develop an innovative technology in which the key role will be played by an autonomous planter designed for establishing forest cultures and afforestation of former farmland and reclaimed areas with the use of seedlings with a covered root system (grown in container nurseries). The device will have a self-levelling traction system, a control system with a satellite navigation module to support autonomous navigation and planting site selection, a mechanism of planting spot preparation, a planting unit, an intelligent robotic arm to feed seedlings from containers to the planting unit according to a given algorithm, a container storage unit with an automated feeder, a drive unit with an electro-hydraulic control system, a control module, and a wireless remote control system. The autonomous planter will significantly reduce the cost and machine inputs during establishing forest cultures and afforestation of former farmland and reclaimed areas with the use of seedlings with a covered root system, and thus perfectly fits into the assumptions of agriculture 4.0.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The possibilities of using multispectral data of remote sensing of the Earth and field research to highlight plant communities using the example of the Pizhemsky State Nature Reserve (SNR) of the Kirov region are shown. The Pizhemsky SNR is defined as a complex (landscape) reserve. It is especially valuable for maintaining the integrity, protection and restoration of aquatic biogeocenoses, preserving in the natural state of the unique natural objects of the region.Selection of plant communities in the Pizhemsky reserve with the use of remote sensing data was carried out in several stages: pre-field cameral, field expeditionary and office generalizing. The pre-field cameral stage included the selection of satellite images from the Landsat 7 and Sentinel 2 satellites and their interpretation to isolate areas of vegetation that are homogeneous in interpretation. At this stage, several areas that were homogeneous in terms of certain features (color, microtexture of the pattern, phototones, etc.) were identified, caused by various natural objects and plant communities of the region. In the field expeditionary stage, work was carried out to identify vegetation types on the ground. The characteristic of plant communities was carried out according to generally accepted geobotanical techniques.The peculiarities of the coenotic composition of forests in the reserve were studied. The composition of the plant communities of the Pizhemsky SNR reflects the characteristic zonal features of the vegetation of the studied region and is associated with certain landscape elements. Based on the analysis of the available cartographic material and satellite images, it has been established floodplain meadows occupy more than 60% of the study area, forests - about 20%. In order to identify plant communities, the most characteristic and most accessible direct interpretation features (phototone, shape, structure) were selected. In addition, we used the synthesis of standard combinations of "artificial colors" channels from the Landsat 7 and Sentinel 2 satellites, which made it possible to identify grassy communities, deciduous and coniferous forests. The completed classification with training provided important information on the distribution of the majority of plant communities typical for the region. The NDVI vegetation index made it possible to isolate pine, deciduous forests and meadow phytocenoses, as well as to recognize water bodies and open soils. The obtained results will allow to substantiate new approaches to environmental management.

TI  - African Culture and the Gains of Cultural Inclusivity in the Age of Globalization
T2  - OMNES: The Journal of Multicultural Society
M3  - research-article
AB  - The paper advances the reason for an inclusive review of what constitutes African culture in view of the impact of globalization on the continent of Africa. Culture is a significant aspect of the African social system. It is the platform for asserting Africanity. The paper is motivated by George Herbert Mead’s theory of symbolic interactionism whose core concern is mutual inclusivity. African culture has undergone different stages of modification. What constituted African culture in the 19th century, for example, is not what constitutes it in the present day. The paper, therefore, argues the need for African culture to embrace and co-exist with the Western contact which globalization has occasioned. Such inclusivity is capable of making the continent of Africa affirm its Africanness and as such, its relevance on the global stage. A historical periodization of the culture’s evolution is undertaken, resulting in the emergence of such categories as primitive African culture, traditional African culture and contemporary African culture. Also, the paper laments the inherent contradiction in the present-day African cultural practices whereby Africans live by Western values in their realities but condemn the West according to the principle of nationalism. Following this, it is proposed that African culture should liberalize and permit the indispensable visiting Western worldview to co-exist with it. African spiritualism, arts and ethics are identified as the most enduring of all the elements of African culture, needed for Africa’s technology, iconic identity, and rectitude, respectively.

TI  - Bayesian geo-additive spatial modelling of HIV prevalence using data from population-based surveys
T2  - HIV & AIDS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Estimates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence in Nigeria have been based on the data from HIV surveillance and sentinel studies among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics at some selected sentinel sites. However, such data overestimate HIV prevalence. This paper explores possible geographical variations in HIV prevalence among the general population of males and females based on two waves of the National HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and Reproductive Health Surveys.Material and methods: Data were extracted from the cross-sectional 2007 and 2012 National HIV/AIDS and Reproductive Health Serological Surveys of men (15-64 years) and women (15-49 years) covering all states of Nigeria. Bayesian geo-additive modelling technique was employed for analysis. Appropriate prior distributions were assigned to the different types of variables in the models and inference was based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. Models of different specifications were considered.Results: The findings reveal significant spatial variations at a highly disaggregated level of states in Nigeria. The nonlinear effects of respondents' age show a similar pattern of HIV prevalence for male, female and the combined respondents, implying that HIV prevalence is peak among middle-age individuals, from where it declines with age. Also, the results reveal a downward change in HIV prevalence in Nigeria between 2007 and 2012.Conclusions: When these findings are taken into consideration in designing intervention strategies, it is believed that each state can be targeted with the right intervention(s). This can also lead to efficient utilization of the scarce resources witnessed globally and more importantly with the economic recession in Nigeria.

TI  - A Comparison of Retrieval Approaches for Estimating the Seasonal Dynamics of Rice Leaf Area Index from simulated Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XXI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXI held at SPIE Remote Sensing
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a key variable for the monitoring the ability of crops to intercept solar energy for biomass production. In addition, LAI has the high seasonal variability and differ among phenophases. Therefore, accurately monitoring LAI at the vegetative, reproductive and ripening stage is central for improving yield. The aim of the study is to identify the performance of different retrieval methods on the estimation of LAI at different phenophases of rice from sentinel 2 simulated bands. To achieve this, the research seeks to answer the following research objectives (i) compare the performance of piecewise model based on the specific phenophases with single models generated from the entire active season, (ii) to determine whether phenophase models are advantageous for LAI estimation in rice. The retrieval models were developed and tested on proximal hyperspectral bands, with focus on the sentinel 2 spectral bands. The machine learning regression models (MLRAs) presented the highest retrieval accuracy during the entire growing season (R2=0.65-0.74). The hybrid model's retrieval performance was similar to vegetation indices but with much higher errors during the entire growing season. The phenophases estimation of LAI saw a decline in the overall retrieval performance of MLRA, hybrid and VI models. The models performed much better during the vegetative stage compared to the reproductive and ripening stages. The study shows MLRA as the best model for estimating LAI during the entire growing and vegetative stages of rice growth. The hybrid models were only suited for the entire growing season (R2>0.5) but generally low when estimating for different phenohases. Finally, VI models were identified to be the best for estimating LAI during the ripening stages of irrigated rice.

TI  - Predicting malaria cases using remotely sensed environmental variables in Nkomazi, South Africa
T2  - GEOSPATIAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been a conspicuous increase in malaria cases since 2016/2017 over the three malaria-endemic provinces of South Africa. This increase has been linked to climatic and environmental factors. In the absence of adequate traditional environmental/climatic data covering ideal spatial and temporal extent for a reliable warning system, remotely sensed data are useful for the investigation of the relationship with, and the prediction of, malaria cases. Monthly enviromnental variables such as the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), the normalised difference water index (NDWI), the land surface temperature for night (LSTN) and day (LSTD), and rainfall were derived and evaluated using seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models with different lag periods. Predictions were made for the last 56 months of the time series and were compared to the observed malaria cases from January 2013 to August 2017. All these factors were found to be statistically significant in predicting malaria transmission at a 2-months lag period except for LSTD which impact the number of malaria cases negatively. Rainfall showed the highest association at the two-month lag time (r=0.74; P<0.001), followed by EVI (r=0.69; P<0.001), NDVI (r=0.65; P<0.001), NDWI (-0.63; P<0.001) and LSTN (r=0.60; P<0.001). SARIMA without environmental variables had an adjusted R-2 of 0.41, while SARIMA with total monthly rainfall, EVI, NDVI, NDWI and LSTN were able to explain about 65% of the variation in malaria cases. The prediction indicated a general increase in malaria cases, predicting about 711 against 648 observed malaria cases. The development of a predictive early warning system is imperative for effective malaria control, prevention of outbreaks and its subsequent elimination in the region.

T2  - JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Haze over Sumatera and Kalimantan has been a prolonged trans-boundary issue in South East Asia mainly due to setting fire to drained peatland. At present, fire sources (i.e. hotspots) are located based on satellite data. Sensors such as MODIS and AVHRR detect extremes in average temperatures of an area. The hotspots have low spatial resolution and large spatial footprints, thus making it harder to detect fires. This research proposed a ground-based spatial validation of satellite data based on crowdsourcing in order to obtain more accurate estimates of the location and severity of the fire. We developed an Android application for reporting and validating fires in peatlands. Crowd data collected were integrated with satellite hotspot data by the dashboard system as a monitoring platform for government agencies. The 110,888 hectares of Padang Island, in Riau Province, were chosen as the study area given its vulnerability to peatland fire and imminent danger of subsidence as the collateral effect of draining peatlands. Residents of Padang Island tested the use-case scenario of the app to assess its applicability. The study showed the potential use of mobile apps for local communities to help the government validate hotspots for haze mitigation.

TI  - Photoperiod controls vegetation phenology across Africa.
T2  - Communications biology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Vegetation phenology is driven by environmental factors such as photoperiod, precipitation, temperature, insolation, and nutrient availability. However, across Africa, there's ambiguity about these drivers, which can lead to uncertainty in the predictions of global warming impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and their representation in dynamic vegetation models. Using satellite data, we undertook a systematic analysis of the relationship between phenological parameters and these drivers. The analysis across different regions consistently revealed photoperiod as the dominant factor controlling the onset and end of vegetation growing season. Moreover, the results suggest that not one, but a combination of drivers control phenological events. Consequently, to enhance our predictions of climate change impacts, the role of photoperiod should be incorporated into vegetation-climate and ecosystem modelling. Furthermore, it is necessary to define clearly the responses of vegetation to interactions between a consistent photoperiod cue and inter-annual variation in other drivers, especially under a changing climate.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - This paper presents a novel application of remote sensing data and machine learning technologies for damage classification in a real-world cross-domain application. The proposed methodology trains models to learn the building damage characteristics recorded in the 2011 Tohoku Tsunami from multi-sensor and multi-temporal remote sensing images. Then, the trained models are tested in the recent 2018 Sulawesi Tsunami. Additionally, a simulation of high-resolution SAR image was carried to deal with missing data modality. Our initial results show that the ResNet-derived features from optical images acquired after the disaster together with moderate- and high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) post-event intensity data showed significant accuracy in classifying two levels of tsunami-induced damage, with an average f-score of approximately 0.72. Taking into account that no training data from the 2018 Sulawesi Tsunami was used, our methodology shows excellent potential for future implementation of a rapid response system based on a database of building damage constructed from previous majors disasters.

AB  - The Indian Ocean Tsunami on 26th December 2004, had caused devastation on land and coastal ecosystems. One of the worst affected ecosystems is the mangrove forest. Many areas of mangrove forest have been destroyed, and it may pose a long-term impact for the region, both in terms of forest and biodiversity conservation and in terms of the ability of the ecosystem to support the livelihoods of the coastal communities. The tragedy of tsunami has requested the rationale for conserving and sustainably managing natural ecosystems among the researchers and scientific community. The research was carried out to make a post-tsunami damage assessment and recovery of mangrove forest in Banda Aceh city area. Several high-resolution satellite imageries data have been effectively used to detect, assess and monitor the changes of mangrove forests in the pre and post-tsunami period using multi-temporal optical satellite data. An on-screen visual interpretation was made to identify the heterogeneous patches for the preliminary classification of fieldwork. A supervised classification was performed to obtain the pre and post Tsunami assessment maps. Accuracy assessment of the classified maps was performed on pixel-level using ground truth. The result highlighted the changes in the spatial extent of the mangrove forests in the study area as a result of Tsunami disaster. The latest condition of the mangrove forest recovery is about 90.3% of the total damage area.

T2  - Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Influenza virological surveillance is essential for monitoring the evolution of influenza viruses (IVs) as well as for annual updating of the vaccine composition. The aim of this study is to analyse IVs circulation in Emilia-Romagna during the eight epidemic seasons after the 2009 pandemic and to evaluate their match with seasonal vaccine strains.METHODS: A total of 7882 respiratory specimens from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI), were collected by regional sentinel practitioners and hospital physicians. Viral investigations were conducted by rRT-PCR assay. Genetic characterization was performed for a spatial-temporal representative number of influenza laboratory-confirmed specimens.RESULTS: Influenza-positive samples per season ranged between 28.9% (2013-2014) and 66.8% (2012-2013). Co-circulation of IVs type A and type B was observed in all seasons, although with a different intensity. In all seasons, the highest number of positive samples was recorded in younger patients aged 5-14 years with relative frequencies ranging from 40% in the 2013-2014 season and 78% in the 2012-2013 season. Since the 2009 pandemic, A/H1N1pdm09 IVs circulating were closely related to the vaccine strain A/California/7/2009. Antigenic mismatch between vaccine strain and A/H3N2 IVs was observed in the 2011-2012 and 2014-2015 seasons. During 2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons a complete or nearly complete mismatch between the predominant influenza B lineage of IVs type B circulating and vaccine B lineage occurred.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis confirms the importance of the virological surveillance and highlights the need of a continuous monitoring of IVs circulation, to improve the most appropriate vaccination strategies.

AB  - While Xi Jinping governing the country the religious policy is performing under the slogan "sinification of religions". This idea isn't new for the PRC. It's become a step forward in developing the "three-self" movement of 1950s, when religious communities were required to break ties with foreign religious centers, to achieve financial autonomy and independence in matters of management and preaching. Authorities of PRC set a global mission to "sinicize" religions represented in China. The Communist Party of China nowadays doesn't tend to eradicate religions from the social life like in 1960s, but they try to reduce the degree of religion's ideological influence. So they fight the religions in pure state, creating its' hybrid form. The religiosity of society is to be brought down to minimum, religious canons and rites are to be gradually reformed.The sinification of religions is adjustment of theology, architecture traditions of religions, forms of organization of church life to bring it all to safe and clear framework according to authorities' view. Slogans calling on religions' adaptation to socialism are oriented on their change to the government indicated forms, to make religions achieve "Chinese characteristics". Work on adapted and edited translation of holy books supervised by Party organs, interpretation of religious teachings in the light of requirements of government can create principally new religious movements, by form similar to world religions, but by its' nature able to change into heresy, but comfortable and ideologically safe for government.To summarize, the project of the sinification of religions is the attempt to guarantee the co-operation of religious organizations with CPC, their support and unconditional approval of CPC policy, ideology and worldview values.

CP  - 5th International Experts Seminar on Stainless Steel in Structures
CL  - London, ENGLAND
AB  - While the nominal material properties given in material specifications are suitable for design purposes, for the generation of realistic numerical parametric results that are 'equivalent' to physical experiments, material properties that are representative of actual structural members are required. Standardised values for these properties are proposed herein. Following analysis of a comprehensive database of material test data from different stainless steel products, values for the yield stress f(y), the ultimate tensile stress f(u), the strain at ultimate tensile stress epsilon(u) and the Ramberg-Osgood parameters n and m are proposed. This enables the generation of standardised stress-strain curves for typical austenitic, duplex and ferritic stainless steel sections. Following this, an extensive numerical modelling study, incorporating the proposed standardised material parameters, was carried out to investigate the effect of production route (cold-formed and hot-finished) and material grade (austenitic, duplex and ferritic) on the flexural buckling behaviour and design of stainless steel square, rectangular and circular hollow section compression members. The FE generated flexural buckling data, combined with column test data from the literature, were used to derive a series of buckling curves for the design of stainless steel compression members. The suitability of the proposals was confirmed by means of reliability analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Effects of Polynomial Interpolation and Resampling Methods in Geometric Correction on the Land-cover Classification Accuracy of Landsat-8 OLI Imagery: A Case Study of Kulon Progo Area, Yogyakarta
T2  - SIXTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Geometric correction is an important step in image pre-processing, because it determines the the positional accuracy of the data. However, the geometric correction also includes pixel values interpolation in their new position, so that it may change original values. This study objectives were (a) to provide information on the effect of geometric correction models on the accuracy of land-cover classification, especially using per-pixel classification with maximum likelihood algorithm; and (b) to assess the effect of image resampling methods on the accuracy of the multispectral classification results. This study made use of Landsat 8 OLI Level 1G imagery covering Kulon Progo Area, Yogyakarta, so that several ground control points (GCPs) were needed to suppress geometric errors. Non-systematic geometric correction was undertaken using first, second and third order polynomial transformations. After that, several resampling processes were applied to the geometrically corrected image, i.e. Nearest Neighbour, Bilinear and Cubic Convolution interpolations. It was found that the affine transformation using six GCPs distributed over the edges of the image, delivered an RMSE value of 0.355539. In addition, the second order polynomial with 10 GCPs scattered around the edges of the image gave an RMSE value of 0.178053. While the third order polynomial transformation with 17 GCPs that were evenly distributed in the image produced an RMSE value of 0.100343. The resampling process produced new images with new pixel values, which were then tested with respect to their classification accuracies based on maximum likelihood algorithm. Samples for accuracy assessment were taken using stratified random sampling strategy. Samples were taken in terms of polygons whose size was determined by considering the pixels' displacement as the results of geometric corrections. This study also found that resampling with nearest neighbour interpolation using third order polynomial equation produced the best overall accuracy of 75.46%, with a Kappa of 0.7032.

AB  - Satellite imagery has been used in most of the applications to estimate, monitor and predict various situations and hurdles in the current scenario. According to the application, the satellite data is chosen on the basis of its spatial, spectral and temporal characteristics. From agriculture to the road highways construction and their health monitoring, it is playing a major role by providing its features details from a high level to medium and low level. In the context of agriculture, there are many ways to find crop health like visual interpretation, health parameter, existing vegetation indices, etc. For the purpose of monitoring and predicting, we require band values from the satellite data which may lack in providing accurate values because of the several parameters that affect it by which there is a possibility of error because they have to be calibrated. Therefore in this paper, a machine learning based calibration approach is proposed by considering multispectral drone data as in-situ data. The methodology is developed and tested for Sentinel-2 data. It is observed that the proposed calibration technique has good potential to calibrate satellite data.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Disasters are increasing in their frequency and intensity with some more devastating than ever before. The magnitude may appear more impactful due to the immediacy of media coverage and the Internet. In the years since the 9/11 tragedy, children have been exposed to the devastation of hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters and human-made disasters of genocide, war, terrorism, and epidemics. In 2017 alone, the world witnessed multiple disaster events including the devastation of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in Texas, Florida, across the Caribbean and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in Mexico, a mass shooting in Las Vegas, and massive landslides and flooding in Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, and Sierra Leone with significant loss of life.Disasters are defined as "a calamitous event that generally involves an injury of loss of life and destruction of property ... [affecting] both small and large populations" (Hagan, the Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health, & the Task Force on Terrorism, 2005, p. 787). Research on children following these events has resulted in findings that increase awareness of healthcare professionals for resultant symptomology and effects, plus provide an impetus and direction for interventions. The sentinel events of September 11, 2001, as noted by Lengua, Long, Smith, and Meltzoff (2005), had "a dramatic effect on most U.S. citizens and on individuals worldwide" and many studies have considered the immediate and lasting effects of this disaster on both adults and children in subsequent research.Since 2001, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have affected millions of families and children as parents have been deployed, many repeatedly, for varying amounts of time separating them from their children at various points in their development to unclear long-term effects. In addition, many children have lost a parent or greeted one parent returning home with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), amputations, or recovering from other physical or psychological injuries. Research addressing children's adjustments to parental deployments and separations as well as addressing military member and spousal readjustment document the impact as these conflicts conclude (Agazio, Goodman, & Padden, 2014; Padden & Agazio, 2013). Osofsky and Chartrand (2013) note that while the stress of military deployment cannot "be equated with the experience of disaster, certain similarities exist-for example, heightened family distress, disruption of family support systems and schedules, and an impact on parenting" (pp. 68-69).Children are traumatized beyond witnessing disasters in person. Lengua et al. (2005) demonstrated that effects may occur and persist even when children are geographically removed from the disaster itself. These researchers were already conducting a study on child, family, and contextual influences on children's development prior to the 9/11 attacks. Following up with the same instrumentation 6 months afterward, children in Seattle, exposed at a distance to the 9/11 events, demonstrated persistent PTSD symptoms and worries while controlling for any preattack symptomology. In 2013, many children watched the Boston Marathon bombing unfold in real time on news channels, where three people were killed including a school-aged child, and 264 others were injured, 16 of whom later required amputations (Comer et al., 2014). Children were exposed to the intensive media coverage of the manhunt that followed and then could relive the event in a popular 2017 movie Patriot's Day, Similarly, multiple movies and documentaries made about other disasters such as 9/11, for example, Fahrenheit 9/11, World Trade Center, and United 93, or the Phuket tsunami, The Impossible, make these distant events appear real and immediate. Saylor, Cowart, Lipovsky, Jackson, and Finch (2003) surveyed 179 Grade K-5 students and their parents at four Southwestern schools 1 month after 9/11 using the Pediatric Emotional Distress scale, the Parent Response of Post-Traumatic Symptoms, and the children's report of PTS to assess effects of media exposure via the Internet, TV, and print media. Interestingly, as expected, higher levels of PTSD symptoms were detected with increased exposure to negative images. What was not expected was that a comparable level of symptoms occurred in conjunction with exposure to positive images as well. The authors concluded that "greater amounts of exposure, both positive and negative, correspond with more PTSD symptoms" (p. 1636). While not necessarily a direct link of causation, other factors could have been influential, such as distressed parents may have watched more about the event, thus the child could have picked up the parental response in conjunction with the media images. They noted that more research is needed in this area, especially in guiding parents and teachers regarding children's media exposure. These results mirrored that of Mijanovich and Weitzman (2010) who also analyzed data collected post 9/11 that included 10- to 18-year-old youths, distant to the actual events, who displayed symptoms of emotional distress following the disaster. Man-made disasters such as these not only traumatize those in the immediate area, but there may also be a distance effect for children through media exposure (Sharlin, Moin, & Yahav, 2006).

AB  - This paper deals with the characterization of permanent scatterers in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of urban environment. To this aim, the main purpose of this paper is to investigate how spaceborne SAR tomography (TomoSAR) can be employed to identify and distinguish the target scattering mechanisms. Along this, the conventional H-alpha classifier can be adapted to the reconstructed polarimetric coherence matrix, i.e. T, in a multi-dimensional space. However, dealing with multi-temporal multi-baseline satellite images, the accurate tomographic reconstruction requires permanent scatterers between all the acquisitions. To cope with this issue, a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT)-based tomographic approach for polarimetric SAR tomography is developed. The proposed framework of scatterer detection and characterization is evaluated using TerraSAR-X polarimetric multi-baseline data sets over an urban area in France.

AB  - This paper discusses the potential of using advanced satellite remote sensing techniques such as radar interferometry for millimeter-accuracy structural health monitoring over abandoned mines. Images covering the broader Springfield, IL, USA area were used to determine the potential of radar interferometry products from several satellite missions (e.g., Sentinel-1) by employing diverse processing techniques. The methodology and results for permanent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) solutions is presented in detail. The vertical movements calculated using PS-InSAR are validated using high precision in-situ surveying measurements. The practical limitations and considerations for utilizing PS-InSAR as an accurate and cost-effective operational procedure for the subsidence insurance industry are presented.

CL  - Univ Wuhan, Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - In planning profession, every step of the planning process is guided by data-either in the form of primary data or secondary data, collected by various institutions and agencies, but rarely shared in public forum. Each project allocates a significant portion of the project timeline and cost for data collection, but these costs and challenges can be drastically reduced if the data is open. This chapter highlights a case example on the role of open data in climate resilient development for Delhi. The example indicates the use of open data, available on the geoportal of international agencies, national agencies and local government, in conducting spatial-temporal analysis of spatial development and climate change environmental degradation, for three decades within a time span of 5months. The study is grounded in remote sensing based on Landsat imageries made available from the online portal of United States Geological Survey (USGS) and a digital elevation model available from the USGS as well as national geoportal called Bhuvan. The models built from these aerial imageries are empirically analyzed in a correlation model supported by data inputs through national, state and local government data available on various government portals of Delhi, including Geospatial Delhi Limited. The crux of the research highlighted in the chapter, is to emphasize on the importance of open data for urban planners and administrators of India in ever changing dynamics of city and its region-and the need for climate resilient urban strategies for a sustainable urban future.

TI  - Quality assessment of digital surface models extracted from WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 stereo pairs over different land covers
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital surface models (DSMs) extracted from very high resolution (VHR) satellite stereo images are becoming more and more important in a wide range of geoscience applications. The number of software packages available for generating DSMs has been increasing rapidly. The main goal of this work is to explore the capabilities of VHR satellite stereo pairs for DSMs generation over different land-cover objects such as agricultural plastic greenhouses, bare soil and urban areas by using two software packages: (i) OrthoEngine (PCI), based on a hierarchical subpixel mean normalized cross correlation matching method, and (ii) RPC Stereo Processor (RSP), with a modified hierarchical semi-global matching method. Two VHR satellite stereo pairs from WorldView-2 (WV2) and WorldView-3 (WV3) were used to extract the DSMs. A quality assessment on these DSMs on both vertical accuracy and completeness was carried out by considering the following factors: (i) type of sensor (i.e., WV2 or WV3), (ii) software package (i.e., PCI or RSP) and (iii) type of land-cover objects (plastic greenhouses, bare soil and urban areas). A highly accurate light detection and ranging (LiDAR) derived DSM was used as the ground truth for validation. By comparing both software packages, we concluded that regarding DSM completeness, RSP produced significantly (p<0.05) better scores than PCI for all the sensors and type of land-cover objects. The percentage improvement in completeness by using RSP instead of PCI was approximately 2%, 18% and 26% for bare soil, greenhouses and urban areas respectively. Concerning the vertical accuracy in root mean square error (RMSE), the only factor clearly significant (p<0.05) was the land cover. Overall, WV3 DSM showed slightly better (not significant) vertical accuracy values than WV2. Finally, both software packages achieved similar vertical accuracy for the different land-cover objects and tested sensors.

AB  - On December 22(nd), 2018, the area around Sunda Strait was hit by a tsunami which had been associated by most scientists to the eruption of Mount Anak Krakatau. An image from Sentinel-1 satellite captured on December 23(rd), 2018 western Indonesia time clearly showed that Mount Anak Krakatau had changed in shape. This article describes the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data that have been observed by Sentinel-1 satellite at 12-day temporal resolution to identify morphological changes of this volcano. In addition, interferometry method was used to identify ground deformation before and after the December 22(nd) eruption. The study collected and processed SAR data in ground range multi look detected (GRD) and slant range single look complex (SLC) products from June 2018 to May 2019. The result showed that Mount Anak Krakatau's active period started in early December 2018 and could be classified into destructive and constructive phases. Based on Sentinel-1 image, the destructive phase was identified from December 23(rd), 2018 to December 31(st), 2018 while the constructive phase was identified from January 33(rd), 2019 onward. Line of sight displacement derived from the interferogram indicated ground deformation before the active period and during constructive phase.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of El Nino 2013 and 2015 in the formation of thermal fronts in the southern sea of East Java and Bali and its correlation with Indonesian Throughflow (ITF). The data that is used in this research were the SST from Aqua MODIS, Nino index of 3.4 derived from CPC NOAA, and Geostrophic current from AVISO. The used method was descriptive method with spatial and temporal analysis approach. Front can be detected in the data of SST raster image using a Cayulla Cornilon SPL 1992 algorithm with strong category of SST difference of >= 0.5 degrees C and with weak one of SST difference of 0.3 - 0.49 degrees C. The results show that thermalfront formed in the southern water of Java and Bali was the temporary front with weak and strong scale. The presence of El Nino affected the formation of thermal fronts, where it was formed during El Nino more than in normal states and El Nino affected transport ITF as well. It is because upwelling in the El Nino is stronger than at the normal condition.

AB  - Advancements in satellite imagery and image processing techniques has enabled computerized solutions for various geographical and ecological monitoring and analysis problems. This has assisted geographical experts in topographic mapping, disaster monitoring and analysis of urban sprawl. Automated terrain segmentation and classification is a significant preliminary step in any Geographic Information System (GIS) based application. Nevertheless it is the most challenging task as well. In this paper, we present a complete schematic for assessing the effectiveness of various features and classifiers that are popularly employed in the literature for landform classification. A subset of images from DeepSat SAT-6 dataset is reconstructed using the RGB spectral band information and evaluations are performed using all six terrain classes. A number of color and texture features are then extracted from samples of each class and fed to a number of classifiers. In addition to conventional features, the effectiveness of convolutional features for terrain classification is also assessed in this study. A light convolutional neural network is proposed and trained on the employed dataset. The study also highlights the effect of color, texture and convolutional features on classification of each type of terrain under consideration. Experimental results show that convolutional features outperform both texture and color features by achieveing an overall accuracy of 93%.

AB  - Hydrocarbon exploration is a very important activity in petroleum geology as it starts from land survey passes through seismic survey and ends at drilling a test well. Remote Sensing (RS) data and Geographical Information System (GIS) under the supervision of Geo scientists guiding petroleum explorers to a new horizon where technology and economics meet the new limits. Landsat8 (OLI) satellite offers the most appropriate RS system for the delineation of surface features of Petroleum research. Indus basin is well known to the world for its Petroleum production, especially from the Potwar sub basin. Indeed, Potwar is a geologically complex petroleum basin where petroleum exploration is tacky activity then a normal activity. Surface deformations, undulations and faults are very common in this basin due to surface uplift and continental- continental collision. Therefore, lineament study of geological structures in the basin provides us a way to find a more accurate and reliable approach to find hydrocarbon sites developed under the influence of subsurface geological pressure and plate tectonics. A complete set of bands provided by Landsat8 (OLI) is the most effective basic data by which lineament study is carried out with focus on visible bands and Panchromatic band due to spatial accuracy. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) provides us to find the most reliable PC having maximum spatial geological information. Lineaments are obtained using the most reliable component of the PCA. Lineament statistical analysis is performed to understand surface pressure points and orientation of geological structures present in the basin. Lineament map, lineament density map and lineament orientation map are produced to visually understand the layout of the area. Land surface temperature (LST) profile, Vegetation trends through NDVI, drainage network development and surface soil profile provide indicators in the demarcation of hot spot areas for the Petroleum exploration. Digital elevation Model (DEM), Thermal band, Infra-red band, and visible bands of landsat8 (OLI) provide the necessary results for the search of Petroleum lead. Lineament statistical analysis vis a vis drainage analysis, vegetation analysis viz a viz LST analysis effectively directed to democrat probable areas of Petroleum gathering in Potwar basin.

TI  - Forecasting river sediment deposition through satellite image driven unsupervised machine learning techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrologic and riverine systems of the Earth's surface, subject to ever increasing instability, requires forecasting techniques now more than ever. Existing mathematical and machine learning models for forecasting river sediment deposition are driven by non-remotely sensed data and/or require ground truth data. The study aims to demonstrate that remote sensing and unsupervised machine learning techniques coupled with appropriate validation metric can be employed to quickly forecast regions that are subject to future river sediment deposition. The results indicate that the NIR and other bands outside the visible range are determinant features for forecasting depositional areas, a multi-algorithm approach is both successful and necessary in indicating such regions and appropriate learning algorithm selection is more dependent on image cluster interpretability rather than cluster validation indices. However, the Silhouette Width validation index consistently picks the algorithm providing the result with most interpretability. Regions to be subjected to river sediment deposition were confirmed when validated against satellite images of the same region captured in the future. Such techniques can be employed in policymaking, disaster management, labeling for supervised learning etc.

TI  - Early experiences with robot-assisted prosthetic breast reconstruction
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PLASTIC SURGERY-APS
M3  - Article
AB  - Robotic surgery facilitates surgical procedures by employing flexible arms with multiple degrees of freedom and providing high-quality 3-dimensional imaging. Robot-assisted nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction is currently performed to avoid breast scars. Four patients with invasive ductal carcinoma underwent robot-assisted nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate robot-assisted expander insertion. Through a 6-cm incision along the anterior axillary line, sentinel lymph node biopsy and nipple-sparing mastectomy were performed by oncologic surgeons. The pectoralis major muscle was elevated, an acellular dermal matrix (ADM) sling was created with robotic assistance, and an expander was inserted into the subpectoral, sub-ADM pocket. No patients had major complications such as hematoma, seroma, infection, capsular contracture, or nipple-areolar necrosis. The mean operation time for expander insertion was 1 hour and 20 minutes, and it became shorter with more experience. The first patient completed 2-stage prosthetic reconstruction and was highly satisfied with the unnoticeable scar and symmetric reconstruction. We describe several cases of immediate robot-assisted prosthetic breast reconstruction. This procedure is a feasible surgical option for patients who want to conceal surgical scars.

AB  - According to reformed worldview, arts is good and positive because it is a part of Creation. Arts needs redemption and restoration because it represents ugliness of the fallen world. Aesthetic redemption of this fallen world necessarily comes true only by means of artistic accomplishment in Christ's incarnation. In this regard, the purpose of this paper is to examine aesthetic features of the Park Su-geun paintings, by studying his art works conducted in the reality of suffering and try to configure redemptive art towards the art of Shalom with focusing on reformed worldview. The reason why this article specially aims to study the aesthetic phenomenon on the key concept of creation, fall and redemption is because the Park Su-geun's artistic truth is closely interrelated to human suffering and social devastation after the Korean War and one can see the most beautiful glory of God in this world through our Lord Jesus Christ.

TI  - A Refined Bilateral Filtering Algorithm Based on Adaptively-Trimmed-Statistics for Speckle Reduction in SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a refined bilateral filtering algorithm based on adaptively trimmed-statistics (ATS-RBF) for speckle reduction in SAR imagery. The new de-speckling method is based on the bilateral filtering method, where the similarities of gray levels and the spatial location of the neighboring pixels are exploited. However, the traditional bilateral filter is not effective to reduce the strong speckle, which is often presented as impulse noise. The ATS-RBF designs an adaptive sample trimming method to properly select the samples in the local reference window and the trimming depth used for sample trimming is automatically derived according to the homogeneity of the local reference window. Furthermore, an alterable window size-based scheme is proposed to enhance the speckle noise smoothing strength in homogeneous backgrounds. Finally, bilateral filtering is applied using the adaptively trimmed samples. The ATS-RBF has an excellent speckle noise smoothing performance while preserving the edges and the texture information of the SAR images. The experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using TerraSAR-X images.

TI  - Long-term exposure to ambient fine particles associated with asthma: A cross-sectional study among older adults in six low- and middle-income countries
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Ambient PM2.5 is considered harmful to the respiratory system. However, little has been shown about the long-term association between ambient PM2.5 and asthma.Methods: A survey from 2007 to 2010 was conducted among adults over 50 years of age in six low- and middle-income countries (including China, India, Ghana, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa), which belonged to one part of a prospective cohort study - the Study on global AGEing and adult health. The yearly mean PM2.5 concentrations of the residential communities of participants were estimated from remote sensing data. A mixed effects model was applied to investigate the association between ambient PM2.5 and asthma.Results: A total of 4553 asthma patients were identified among the 29,249 participants in this study, producing a prevalence of 15.57%. For each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5, the adjusted prevalence ratio of asthma was 1.05 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.01, 1.08) after controlling for the effects of sex, age, BMI, education attainment, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposure. Further analyses showed that males and smokers might be particularly vulnerable populations. Additionally, it was estimated that about 5.12% of the asthma cases in the study population (95% Confidence Interval: 1.44%, 9.23%) could be attributed to long-term PM2.5 exposure.Conclusion: Long-term exposure to PM2.5 might be an important risk factor of asthma. Effective air pollution reduction measures should be taken to reduce PM2.5 concentrations in order to reduce the associated asthma cases and disease burden.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXV
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - A processing chain jointly employing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data is presented. It aims at monitoring changes in the status of the vegetation cover by integrating the three red-edge (RE) bands of Sentinel-2, at 20 m pixel spacing, with textural features calculated from the Interferometric Wide (IW) Ground Range Detected (GRD) product of Sentinel-1, available at 10 m pixel spacing. Hyper-sharpening on Sentinel-2 multispectral bands and modulation-based integration of Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions are applied on a multitemporal dataset acquired before and after a recent fire event. New color-composite results of the proposed fusion procedure may be useful for visual inspection and analysis by experts in vegetation status monitoring.

TI  - MODELLING SOIL EROSION IN THE ALPS WITH DYNAMIC RUSLE-LIKE MODEL AND SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS
T2  - EARTH OBSERVATION ADVANCEMENTS IN A CHANGING WORLD
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Soil water erosion is a creeping natural phenomenon, mostly related to weather and climate, and one of the main hydrogeological risk in Europe. It causes nutrients loss and exposes the environment to landslides, with negative impacts on agriculture, ecosystem services and infrastructures. Conversely, several human activities induce environmental modifications which intensify pressure on soils, thus increasing their predisposition to erosion.This study describes the integration of satellite observations with a modified version of the well-known Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model for estimating soil erosion in an Italian Alpine river basin. Compared to traditional RUSLE formulation, in this study we assigned the cover management factor using a combination of DUSAF land cover classification and NDVI values computed from Landsat time series. Rainfall erosivity was estimated separating liquid precipitation (erosive) and solid precipitation (non-erosive) from hourly data. Soil erodibility for the study area was tuned combining soil maps with total organic carbon (TOC), acidity (pH) and texture (granulometry) from soil samples collected on site. Finally, the slope length and steepness factor was derived using a 30-meter spatial resolution digital elevation model.Integrating the RUSLE-like model with spectral indices derived from satellite data allows highlighting spatial patterns useful for understanding soil erosion dynamic and forcing. Thus, satellite-derived spectral information, that include both seasonal and long-term land cover changes, opens new ways for modelling the dynamics of soil erosion.

AB  - By exploring the history of the founding of Ihievbe town, one begins to observe a heightened cultural memory of the relevance of hospitality and friendship as tools for building healthy communities. Openness to strangers and celebrations of the cult of friendship are noticeable markers of the town's sociocultural worldview. Even the strategic embrace of Christianity as means to counter the disruptive demands of Islam during the early part of the twentieth-century points to the town's pragmatic approach to religion.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - There is an essential continuity in the understanding of how a people view themselves, but it is not shaped by static factors that defy time. Instead, social interactions hinged on constantly evolving values, which are also shaped by the worldview of each epoch, help to define how a people collectively embrace a hermeneutic of identity. Ihievbe people face this same reality. Historical interactions with foreigners on the economic, social, political, and religious areas of life have led Ihievbe people to construct a broader approach to identity. With the introduction of Islam and Christianity to the town, the previous mono-religious identity embraced within the framework of Ihievbe Traditional Religion has given way to multiple religious identities. It should be noted that although Ihievbe, historically, had multiple shrines for worship within the context of Ihievbe Traditional Religion, Ihievbe people refer collectively to them as forming the religion of their land. Though the shrines have different rituals and rites, they are within the community's collective religious worldview. Each of the deities venerated by the different villages and quarters is part of the total spiritual domain. Finally, this chapter sheds light on the history of interreligious encounters in the town.

AB  - This chapter addresses the cultural significance of relationality and alterity among the Ihievbe people as grounds for validating the use of hospitality and friendship as dialogical tools. This chapter presents the importance of social harmony in Ihievbe worldview. Since social harmony among the Ihievbe people is made possible by the role such virtues as hospitality and friendship play in the community, I argue that a workable dialogical model can truly be constructed by using these two virtues. Finally, this chapter extrapolates from the results of the surveys and interviews a sense of Christian salvation history that affirms and attests to religious diversities as understood by the Catholic community in the town.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the application of remote sensing, based on the Vegetation-Impervious surface-Soil (V-I-S) model and spatial metrics, in an urban analysis for promoting sustainability and understanding urban growth theory. In order to improve the accuracy of land-cover classification, spectral angle mapping (SAM), spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and band ratioing were applied on satellite images for land-cover classification and comparison of the discrimination efficiency of these techniques. For the SMA, subsets of the Landsat (2, 3, 4, 5, and 7) and ASTER (1, 2, and 3N) images were selected. After endmember extration and purification, the Bayesian probability of each component was computed and used for the spectral unmixing. The classified images of different years were compared to analyze the changes in land use and spatial pattern using V-I-S, a form of percentage of landscape (PLAND) and annualized urban sprawl index (AUSI). The result indicates that the performance of band ratioing (69% accuracy) is not as good as that of SAM (75%) and SMA (86%) in discriminating between vegetation and agricultural land. The land-use analysis results denote that urban growth management strategies in Riyadh have not been completely successful and the growth pattern substantiates the urban theory of diffusion and coalescence.

AB  - This research aims to analyze the heavy rain which accompanied by severe winds, caused floods and landslides in several of sub-districts in Cilacap, Central Java on 16-17 September 2016 that coincides with the phase 4 of Madden Jullian Oscillation (MJO) event. In the same time, also found a Mesoscale Convective Complex (MCC) in the around Central Java. MCCs were identified by infrared satellite imagery from Himawari 8 using an algorithm that combines criteria of cloud coverage, eccentricity, and cloud lifetime. The data used is a combination of observation data, satellite data and reanalysis data. This study results that there is an increase in vertical velocity accompanied by strong negative vorticity since the development of MCC until it reached its mature phase, then the vertical velocity decreases as the cloud systems disseminated. These results indicate there is the evolution of MCC convective cells from growth until dissipation. Throughout its lifetime the MCC system moves south-east into the Indian Ocean and is decapitated there. Based on GSMaP rainfall data it was observed that in Central Java area especially Cilacap area has extreme rainfall which caused by MCC activity. The influence of MCC on significant rainfall is also supported by the existence of MJO phase 4. The significant increase in rainfall when phase 4 active MJO is followed by the MCC. The value of rainfall intensity when MJO followed by the presence of MCC is greater than in the absence of MCC.

AB  - Aeromagnetic data was processed in order to delineate structural trends which may be indicative of potential gold mineral traps in the Watari hill gold prospect located between longitude 5 degrees 8 '' and 5 degrees 16 '', and latitude 11 degrees 24 '' and 11 degrees 30 '' in Garin Hawal district, northwest Nigeria. Landsat-8 OLI data was processed to produce colour composite, band ratio and minimum noise fraction images that mapped the hydrothermal alteration zone in the study area. The multispectral images which were displayed in Red-Green-Blue colours were subsequently pan-sharpened to display a greater image resolution of the area. The application of enhancement algorithms such as an analytic signal to the aeromagnetic data over the alteration zone helped in mapping the mafic metavolcanics, felsic metasediments and intruding granitoid complexes. Further reductions using the second vertical derivative and tilt angle derivative filters aided in delineating fracture/faults and the contact zones of the formations, especially the metasediments-metavolcanic boundary that delineates the shear zone. This study showed that the low-angle geologic structure between the metasediments and metavolcanics where hydrothermal alteration is present is likely to accommodate veins of gold mineralization in the study area.

AB  - In this study we show the correlation between the surface temperature of the water and its phytoplankton turbidity in Lake AL MASSIRA, from satellite data Landsat 7. To achieve that, we established thermal maps, from the thermal infrared band of Landsat data, illustrating the spatial distribution of the surface temperature of the lake. At the same time, we have created spatial distribution of phytoplankton turbidity maps of the lake; from the ratio between spectral bands (blue and red bands). The correlation study between the surface temperature and the phytoplankton turbidity factor shows a positive correlation coefficient of about of 0.802 (R-2). The linear functions deduced from this correlation allow us to estimate and quantify the spatial distribution of living matter in water based on thermal infrared remote sensing data.

AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change analysis is a critical instrument for studying urban growth across the world. Our objectives were to produce historical LULC maps during the 1988-2016 period for spatial and temporal analysis, forecast future LULC until 2040 by using the Markov model, and identify the impact of LULC on urbanization. Two scenes of Landsat-5 TM for 1988 and 2001 and one scene of Landsat-8 OLI for 2016 were processed and used. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) model with precise class value ranges was applied to produce land cover maps with six classes of water, built-up, barren land, shrub and grassland, sparse vegetation, and dense vegetation. LULC maps for the years of 1988 and 2001 were used to develop an LULC transformation matrix. It was used to drive an LULC transformation probability matrix using a Markov model for future forecasting of LULC in 2014, 2027, and 2040. The accuracy of 2016 LULC classes was estimated by comparing it against Markov modeled classes. It was found that the areas for: (i) water decreased from 1.43% to 0.51%; (ii) built-up increased from 9.58% to 20.80%; (iii) barren land decreased from 29.50% to 13.40%; (iv) shrub and grass land decreased from 30.57% to 21.10%; (v) sparse vegetation increased from 18% to 20.10%; and (vi) dense vegetation increased from 10.57% to 24.10%. The variations in LULC classes could be noticed by 2040 as compared to 1988. This LULC variation revealed that the water could decrease to 5.32 km(2) from 25.37 km(2); the built-up could increase to 625.16 km(2) from 168.29 km(2); the barren land could decrease to 137.53 km(2) from 514.13 km(2); the shrub and grassland could decrease to 297.68 km(2) from 539.46 km(2); the sparse vegetation could decrease to 297.68 km(2) from 539.46 km(2); and the dense vegetation could increase to 409.65 km(2) from 191.51 km(2). The LULC classification accuracy was 90.27% and 95.11% for 1988 and 2001, respectively. The co-efficient of determination (R-2) was found to be 0.90 for 2016 LULC classes obtained from Landsat-8 and derived from a Markov model. For District Lahore, the LULC changes could be related to increasing population and intense migration trends, which had progressive impact on infrastructure development, industrial and economic growth, and detrimental effects on water resources.

AB  - Global warming, which triggers climatic changes, has direct effects on the phenology of plants. For a sustainable agricultural production, continuous monitoring of crops and trees is critical to have updated information and producing effective agricultural plans. Remote sensing is an efficient option for this purpose and is a very popular technique. Olive is an essential agricultural product for the economy of Mediterranean countries such as Turkey. Determination of olive trees, which are expanded all around Aegean and Mediterranean regions of the country, is critical to assess the production capacity and the quality of products. In this study, combinations of time series of Sentinel-1 satellite images, Sentinel-2 satellite images and NDVI products obtained from Sentinel-2 satellite images are used to investigate the classification accuracy of olive trees. According to analysis results, a significant correlation with R-2 = 0.67 found between NDVI and SAR data (sigma nought VH/VV in decibel scale). This result pointed out probable accuracy improvement in classification of fused data from different sensors. In the next step, supervised random forest classification was applied on the fused data combinations and results showed that Sentinel-1 - I Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 - NDVI and Sentinel-2 - NDVI combinations achieved the highest overall accuracy with 73 %, while standalone Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image time series classification accuracies are 48 % and 68 % respectively.

M3  - Article
AB  - One approach to determining the height structure of the mid-latitude medium-scale travelling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) above the F layer peak is to involve simultaneous satellite measurements in the ground-based ionosonde measurements near Kazan. The electron concentration data obtained from the Swarm satellite constellation were the most suitable for our purposes. For accurate spatial attachment to satellite data, a strict selection of daytime satellite degrees ythroughs data was used: their trajectory should not be located in latitude further than 100 km from the Kazan's longitude, and the spatial extent of irregularities in electron plasma density measurements should be at least more 100 km without smaller (high-frequency) irregularities. Of all the satellites in the passes over >> 2 years (2016{2018), we managed to select only seven such cases. For the cases found, mutual correlation functions of sequences of values of two series of the critical frequency and electron concentration were constructed. The correlation function has a bright negative peak, with a spread within 100 km, which, taking into account the typical horizontal wavelength of the MSTIDs (>> 200 km), means the antiphase behavior of electronic concentrations within the MSTID below and above the peak of the F layer of the daytime mid-latitude ionosphere.

AB  - The purpose of the article lies in the study of political attitudes and activities of a well-known lawyer N. Novombergsky. Field of research is the reconstruction and analysis of the circumstances of the scientist's life, the results of his impact on the political processes in Siberia in the first third of the XX century and the influence on the surrounding social reality. Thus defined, the field studies led to the use of the techniques of psychohistory, which allowed to find out the influence of his childhood and youth on the formation of the foundations of his world; the historical-legal method that enabled us to establish the type of legal consciousness of the scientist to analyse his legal writings; the methods of social history, which allowed to assess the effectiveness and impact of the scientist on the socio-political processes and influence of these processes on the evolution of his views. Methodological basis of research was the dialectic method, the principles of objectivity and historicism. Historical sources for the research were the scientific and journalistic works of the scientist, autobiographical materials, documents of state bodies and the judicial investigation of the case of A. Kolchak's Ministers. A number of documents were introduced into scientific circulation for the first time. In the result of the research the author came to the following conclusions. Difficult childhood and adolescence defined the programmatic basis of the Novombergsky's worldview and the ability to adapt to changing social reality. Education, experience, public service, research and teaching in Tomsk University allowed him to become one of the outstanding attorneys of the Russian Empire. He was a positivist, an advocate of constitutional development, the theory of the welfare state, Siberian regionalism, autonomy of the peoples of Siberia. His political activity led to conflicts with officials of the Russian Empire, a military dictatorship of Kolchak, the Soviet authorities. The nature of these conflicts was in lawyer's opposition to the non-legal methods of implementation of the state policy. However Novombergsky was able to realize the most important ideas of the constitutional agenda: the idea of the autonomous Siberia influenced the political processes of the civil war period and was partially implemented through the creation of the Siberian region during the Soviet period; the idea of protection of the Siberian peoples has been realized with the creation of national-territorial and national-cultural autonomies in 1918-1920s. Novombergsky played a prominent role in the development of planning the national economy of Siberia in the 1920s. The contribution of the scientist to the development of national education in Siberia and the Russian North was valuable.

AB  - Drought is one of the frequently observed natural hazard resulting from precipitation deficit and increased evapotranspiration caused by high temperatures. Remote sensing indices are used to analyze spatio-temporal distribution of drought conditions and identify drought severity. In this study, we analyzed the spatio-temporal distribution of drought conditions in Turkey from February 2000 to January 2019 by using different drought indices produced from MODIS satellite data in Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Vegetation Health Index (VHF), Normalized Multiband Drought Index(NMDI) and Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI) maps in country level for different years and months of the related years were utilized to assess the drought conditions. Time series were also created for some specific locations to deeply analyze the drought conditions in 20-year period. Our results show that MODIS derived drought indices provide useful geospatial information to assess drought conditions in country level. Moreover, GEE platform is very handy and rapid tool to reach related satellite images and conduct remote sensing analysis of huge and long term date efficiently. Geospatial big data could be successfully accessed and processed in this platform not only for drought monitoring hut also for other environmental monitoring applications.

AB  - Marine scientists had applied many remote sensing methods to shallow-water marine habitat mapping. However, integrating traditional ecological knowledge and remote sensing application to produce marine habitat map was still very limited. The aims of this study are to try to implement the integration of traditional ecological knowledge and multispectral image classification for shallow-water marine habitat mapping in the marine protected area (MPA) of Kaledupa Island, Wakatobi National Park (WNP). Imagery data used was Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (2016). Fishers from Kaledupa Island visually interpreted Landsat 8 OLI multispectral image to identify sangnga (live coral), sangnga mate (dead coral), rondo (lamun), and one (sand). Their interpretations were used as input to image supervised classification with Mahalanobis and Maximum Likelihood. Then, habitat mapping with four classes could be produced. Results indicate that marine habitat mapping can be generated well by combining traditional ecological knowledge and multi-spectral image classification, Mahalanobis with the overall accuracy 71.67% and kappa statistic 0.62%; Maximum Likelihood Analysis with the overall accuracy 73.33% and kappa statistic 0.65%. This hybrid method is useful to marine scientists and coastal resource managers in producing swallow-water marine habitat map and management planning of MPA.

AB  - The aim of the present study is focusing on a validation and comparison among eight different physical models for soil salinity mapping in arid landscape. The considered models were developed for different geographic regions around the world, i.e. Latino-America (Mexico), Middle-East (Iraq), north and east Africa (Morocco and Ethiopia) and Asia (China). These models integrated different spectral bands and unlike mathematical functions in their conceptualization (stepwise, linear, second order, logarithmic, and exponential). Three main steps were considered. The Landsat-OLI image data was radiometrically standardized and the models were implemented to derive soil salinity maps. The field survey was organized during 4 days, two days before the OLI data acquisition, and a total of 100 soil samples were collected representing different salinity levels, and each sampling location was geographically localized using accurate GPS. The laboratory analysis was accomplished to derive electrical conductivity (EC-Lab) for validation purposes. Statistical analysis (p < 0.05) was applied between predicted salinity maps (EC-Predicted) and the measured ground truth (EC-Lab). The results obtained showed that predictive models based on VNIR bands and vegetation indices are inadequate for soil salinity prediction due to a serious signals confusion between the salt-crust and the soil optical properties in these spectral bands. The statistical tests revealed insignificant fits (R-2 <= 0.41) with a very high prediction errors (RMSE >= 0.65). While, the model based on second order polynomial function and integrating the SWIR bands provides results of best fitness in comparison to the ground truth, yielding an R-2 of 0.97 and low overall RMSE of 13%.

In this study, we suggested a model to estimate high resolution air temperature for different region based on climate datasets estimation by Iraqi Agrometeorological network daily air temperature and the land surface temperature derived from thermal bands of landsat8 images. The new air temperature estimation was tested over part of Babylon governorate as a case study. Observations from four weather stations at Babylon governorate for four months from June to September for the year 2017 were used for modelling and accuracy assessment air temperature estimation.

AB  - This paper deals with assessing and detecting the changes of soil salinity and vegetation cover for a part of An-Najaf Governorate and verification regarding the impression of soil salinity on the change of vegetative regions, over the period from 2001 to 2015. The results demonstrated a clear reduction in vegetative cover with salinity rates increased. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and Soil Salinity Index (SI) were applied for each date using the multispectral images derived from Landsat ETM+ and OLI data. Then image differencing technique was utilized to detect the change/no-change for vegetation and salinity for the two study periods. The results revealed that soil salinity increased from 6.36 in 2001-2009 period to 10.59% in 2009-2015, whereas the vegetation cover deteriorated to 9.95 % for the same period. Finally, the strong inverse correlation which found in this paper between NDVI and SI emphasizes that vegetation cover on long term is heavily and directly affected by changes of soil salinity.

TI  - Multi-scale Correlation-based feature selection and Random forest classification for LULC mapping from the integration of SAR and optical Sentinel images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS IV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments IV held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference

AB  - Reliable and accurate land use/land cover (LULC) map is a crucial data source for the understanding of coupled human-environment systems, monitoring changes, timely low-cost planning, and management of natural resources. Improvements in sensor technologies and machine learning capabilities have shifted the attention of remote sensing community to data complementarity through fusion of multi-sensor data for accurate feature extraction and mapping. Amalgamation of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has shown promising advantages in enhancing the accuracy of extracting LULC as such method allows exploitation of information in sensors. This study investigated the potential of using freely available multisource Sentinel images to extract LULC maps in semi-arid environments through multi-scale geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA). A multi-scale classification framework that integrates GEOBIA, correlation-based feature selection (CFS), and random forest (RF)-supervised classification was adopted to extract LULC from assimilation of Sentinel multi-sensor products. First, Sentinel-1 and -2 images were pre-processed. Second, optimum multi-scale segmentation levels were selected using F-score segmentation quality measures. Third, 70 features of various spectral indices and derivatives and geometrical features from optical data and multiple ratios and textural features from dual-polarization SAR images were computed, and a CFS based on wrapper approach was used to select the most significant features at multi-scale levels. Finally, a single and multi-scale RF classifier was used to extract LULC classes using the most relevant features extracted from Sentinel SAR and optical images. Results of multi-scale image segmentation optimization showed that scale parameter (SP) values of 40, 60, and 150 were optimal for extraction of LULC classes. Results of feature selection showed that 22, 24, and 27 features were selected at scale SP values of 40, 60, and 150, respectively. Half of the features were common among the three scales. Single RF classification yielded overall accuracy (OA) values of 92.10%, 93%, and 91% and kappa coefficients of 0.901, 0.912, and 0.89 at scale values of 150, 60, and 40, respectively. Multiscale RF classification from scale values of 150 and 60 produced better LULC classification with OA 96.06% and kappa coefficient of 0.95 compared with other scale SP values. The integrated approach demonstrated an effective and promising method for high-quality LULC extraction from coupling optical and SAR images. Overall, multi-sensor Sentinel images along with the adopted approach feature a remarkable potential for improving LULC extraction and can effectively be used to update geographic information system layers for various applications.

AB  - This study explored the use of satellite data to monitor Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) and Water Vapor (H2O vapor) in Iraq. The retrieved monthly data obtained from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), included on the EOS Aqua satellite, from January 2003 to December 2016 are employed. In order to better assess these two parameters distribution, the spatiotemporal and long term trends analysis are provided for five stations dispersed across Iraq; Mosul, Sulaimaniyah, Rutba, Baghdad and Basra. The OLR and H2O vapor monthly distribution shows important spatiotemporal variations values over study area, with a maximum in summer and minimum in winter. The higher OLR values of monthly average for study period occurred (370, 364) w/m(2) in July and August at Rutba, and the lowest values of monthly average occurred were (232 w/m(2)) in January over Mosul and Sulaimaniyah. The higher H2O vapor values (6.34 g/kg) observed in July and August over Baghdad and the lowest values of monthly average was (3.30 g/kg) in January and December over Mosul and Rutba. The satellite observation efficiently shows the spatial and temporal variations of OLR and H2O vapor. This study sheds new light on the processes and analysis of both parameters emission over Iraq.

AB  - The aim of this study is to construct a rice yield estimation model for Bangladesh. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images have been used. The MODIS NDVI images and ground truth data are acquired for the years 2011 to 2016. Since Bangladesh is divided into 8 divisions, several regression models are applied to predict rice yield for each division rather than a single model for the entire country, in order to get improved result in rice yield prediction. Firstly the rice field area is predicted by using NDVI threshold values. An improvised algorithm has been implemented to determine the NDVI threshold values. Four regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree) are performed to estimate total Boro production of each district of Bangladesh. Among the regression models, maximum R-2 (co-effiecient of determination) values of 0.492, 0.790, 0.899, 0.891, 0.848, 0.942, 0.777 and 0.848 are acquired for Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur and Sylhet divisions respectively. Ridge regression worked better for Barisal and Chittagong divisions. For Mymensingh and Rangpur divisions Lasso regression performed the best. Decision Tree regression worked best for the four other divisions.

TI  - Rainwater Harvesting and Artificial Groundwater Recharge in Arid Areas: Case Study in Wadi Al-Alb, Saudi Arabia
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accelerated economic development in arid areas results in harmful stress on limited surface and groundwater resources. Flash flood and rainfall harvesting is a promising renewable resource. Using a theoretical water budget approach, this paper investigates groundwater recharge after a flash flood in three small dam reservoirs and one moderate-capacity dam reservoir in the Al-Alb basin, central Saudi Arabia. This approach is validated against water level measurements at five recharge wells. Watershed modeling of this basin was conducted using an analysis of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) digital elevation models, in which the morphometric variables were calculated. Landsat-8 and Spot-5 images from April 2015 were classified to identify different land-use and land-cover categories. The soil conservation service curve number (SCS CN) method was used to estimate the effective rainfall, where the estimated CN values of different land uses and the spatially distributed time-area zones of the catchment were identified. The rainfall-runoff relationship was assessed using the Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model, and the results were validated using the actual reservoir storages of these dams. The lag time, time of concentration, time to peak, and maximum of discharge storage reservoir sizes and volumes were estimated for the main and subbasins of the Al-Alb basin. This research shows that considerable amounts of water can be harvested using these small dams (0.21x106m3 to 6.95x106m3). The hydrographs show that the construction of smaller dams upstream of the main dam at the Al-Alb location decreases the main peak magnitude by 14%, and the main runoff volume by 3%. Because of the high evaporation rate and low natural groundwater recharge as a result of siltation process in the dam lakes, recharge wells were drilled in the dam reservoir, increasing groundwater recharge by 44% and decreasing evaporation loss by 86%. With time, well recharge efficiency decreases, owing to clogging by the siltation process. Consequently, it is recommended to periodically clean and maintain the recharge wells.

AB  - Eutrophication is a process in which elevated organic matter and nutrients raises the primary production of a water body. As a result, the productivity of phytoplankton and biomass are very high at all trophic levels. During bloom event, the spatial and temporal distribution of this phenomena is difficult to be observed using conventional water sampling methods. This work advance the state of the art by using Sentinel-2 (S2) images to estimate chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration with an empirical model. Specifically, the model uses band 8 (NIR) and band 4 (red) to predict chl-a concentration during an algal bloom event in San Roque lake, Cordoba, Argentina. Nevertheless, novel spectral ratio for algae composition patterns has also been created using bands 8a and 9. The results show that S2 has the potential to monitor bloom events in eutrophic lakes.

TI  - Positive deviance, big data, and development: A systematic literature review
T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Positive deviance is a growing approach in international development that identifies those within a population who are outperforming their peers in some way, eg, children in low-income families who are well nourished when those around them are not. Analysing and then disseminating the behaviours and other factors underpinning positive deviance are demonstrably effective in delivering development results. However, positive deviance faces a number of challenges that are restricting its diffusion. In this paper, using a systematic literature review, we analyse the current state of positive deviance and the potential for big data to address the challenges facing positive deviance. From this, we evaluate the promise of "big data-based positive deviance": This would analyse typical sources of big data in developing countries-mobile phone records, social media, remote sensing data, etc-to identify both positive deviants and the factors underpinning their superior performance. While big data cannot solve all the challenges facing positive deviance as a development tool, they could reduce time, cost, and effort; identify positive deviants in new or better ways; and enable positive deviance to break out of its current preoccupation with public health into domains such as agriculture, education, and urban planning. In turn, positive deviance could provide a new and systematic basis for extracting real-world development impacts from big data.

TI  - Traditional knowledge and uses of gymnosperms in the northeast of Oaxaca, Mexico
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims: Approximately 156 gymnosperm species divided into six families occur naturally in Mexico. Oaxaca has a high richness of gymnosperms, with 45 species, and its inhabitants have an ancient knowledge about the traditional use of this group. The present study contributes to the documentation of traditional knowledge of the gymnosperms in Oaxaca, to evaluate the importance of plant families as useful resources, to understand the relationships between ethnic groups and richness of useful species, as well as to compare our records of gymnosperms with those at state and national levels.Methods: This study was carried out in 84 municipalities within three Priority Terrestrial Regions in the northeast of Oaxaca. The ethnobotanical data were collected through participant observation, ethnobotanical fieldtrips, content-free interviews of the local guides, and botanical specimens were collected. All data were analyzed qualitatively to integrate ethnofloristic and traditional knowledge, as well as ecological aspects of species studied.Key results: We recorded 30 species belonging to the families Cupressaceae, Pinaceae, Podocarpaceae and Zamiaceae. The largest number of useful species (16) registered belongs to Pinaceae. Among the Zapotecs, uses were found for 16 different species, the Mixes use ten and the Mazatec nine. All taxa registered with any use have a common name, 71% in the local language and 97% in Spanish. The most common uses were timber, construction, ornamental and fuel. The montane cloud forest is the vegetation type with the largest number of useful gymnosperms, with 15 species. Forty-five percent of the registered taxa are endemic to Mexico, six species of Pinaceae and eight of Zamiaceae are considered endemic to Oaxaca.Conclusions: This research contributes to increase records of useful gymnosperms in the state of Oaxaca. It is necessary to reconsider and understand the local value of species within the ethnic worldview in order to preserve traditional uses and promote sustainable management programs.

T2  - Case reports in anesthesiology
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Patients present with cerebellar ataxia, dystonia, rigidity, and neuropathy that worsen with time. On a molecular level, it occurs due to a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. Due to the risk of pulmonary aspiration, hypoventilation, autonomic and thermoregulatory dysfunction, vocal cord paralysis, progressive paraplegia, parkinsonian symptoms, and chronic pain, it has significant anesthesia implications. Rarely, case reports occur in the literature describing regional anesthetic management of patients with SCA3, but none that describe general anesthesia specifically with MJD. We therefore describe a case of a patient with SCA3 who successfully underwent general anesthesia and considerations for perioperative management of this patient population.

AB  - In this paper near co-incidental Sentinel-1 C-band SAR imagery and Sentinel-3 SRAL Ku-band altimeter data are compared for their capabilities of sea ice type discrimination. Knowledge of sea ice type is important for climate research and safety in Arctic offshore operations.First-year ice is characterised by a low SAR backscatter intensity in both HH and HV polarisation compared to multi-year ice, while the altimeter waveform parameters show high pulse peakiness and peak power compared to multi-year ice.Thus SAR imagery and altimetry can principally discriminate different ice types. The complexity of the backscattered radar signal however impedes a clear separation of the two types for all cases. Cross comparison of the two sensors offers an opportunity of high resolution validation data, which is often lacking for sea ice studies.

AB  - Atmospheric aerosols play an important role in both climate forces and air quality. Different algorithms have been developed using satellite images to describe their spatial dispersal and evolution over time. In this study, a high-resolution, multispectral, polarized aerosol retrieval algorithm (PARA) was developed. Landsat TM Land Surface Reflectance products, and aerosols' data from the Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds database were used to retrieve the aerosols' optical properties over two locations within the Arabian plate. The Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground-based sun photometer measurements were used to validate the PARA. Validations showed that PARA retrievals are well correlated with AERONET measurements (R-2 = 0.965 and 0.967), by mean absolute error of 0.04 and 0.07, and root mean square error of 0.085 and 0.080. The PARA can describe aerosol components over different locations and provides detailed spatial distributions of aerosol optical properties.

AB  - Urbanization is a spatiotemporal process that has significant role in economic, social, and environmental structures. Spatiotemporal analysis for urban growth is vital for city management planning. With highly recognized financial and social developing trends, Dubai City, UAE appears as one of most challenging cities in terms of research and preparation toward a smart city aspect. Integrated technologies of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) facilitate urban growth detection and its relation to population distribution. In this study Multi-temporal, medium-resolution Landsat images were used to detect and analyze the urbanization trend in Dubai over the last three decades(1986-2019). Moreover, the influence of urbanization on the aspects of smart city tendency was investigated. The study methodology consisted of three parts. First, classification algorithms along with change detection, segmentation, and extraction of urban areas were used to obtain land Use/land Cover (LULC) maps. Second, Shannon's entropy was used to investigate Dubai's growth toward compact or sprawl city based on two city centers and a major highway. Finally, CA-Markov, associated with the digital elevation model and road map of Dubai, was used to simulate the urban change for 2030, 2050, and 2100. With more than 90% overall accuracy, the statistical analysis for LULC percentages and Shannons entropy values indicated that Dubai experienced a considerable increase in urban fabric while maintaining a compact growth. CA-Markov model estimated 3% urban growth by 2030, which would result in potential loss of green areas and open spaces. This study could be used in improving planning and management methods to achieve sustainable urban growth.

T2  - REVISTA GENERO & DIREITO
M3  - Article
AB  - Each culture is based on a specific system of subject meanings, social stereotypes and cognition patterns. The "worldview" invariant is determined by socially developed supports (by meanings, in the first place). In its turn, there may be a worldview which is common for the whole society (for a socio-cultural community or ethnos) or an individual one typical of a specific group (a sociocultural group) within a given ethnos. In the process of ontogenesis, a child learns words in its native language, while lying behind these words is an integral image of consciousness comprising two layers. The first layer is the existential one. It includes the biodynamic tissue of live movement and action, as well as a sensory image. The second layer is the reflexive one, which includes meaning and sense. Behind a language sign, there is an organic cell, which is part of a worldview typical of a specific culture. The systemic character of meanings reflects the system of concepts existing in a given culture, in a Universe structure (worldview) formed within this culture. It is the association component represented by figurative and metaphoric connotations that determines the semantic content of a cultural concept.

AB  - Periglacial lakes of high mountains often become the center of the large mudflows formation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the mudflow danger of periglacial lakes in the Elbrus region. The analysis was performed on the basis of field researches, interpretation and processing of PLEIADES satellite images and SPOT-6. The interpretive signs of mudflow danger were revealed in the high mountains and a scale of mudflow risk was created on the basis of the identified interpretive signs. Special attention was paid to Upper Bashkarinsky Lake, the breakthrough of which caused a large mudflow in September 2017. According to the analysis of satellite images, we can conclude that the mudflow was not instantaneous, but occurred within a few hours, and this confirms the safety of Lower Bashkarinsky Lake. Intensive rainfall contributed to the blurring of the surface moraine on the glacier and then the ice itself. According to the satellite image the area of Upper Lake before the mudflow was 87 718 m(2), and after the mudflow-27 608 m(2). Thus, the lake area decreased by 60 110 m(2). Most of the periglacial lakes in the upper reaches of the Baksan river valley are located at altitudes from 2400 to 3400 m, the maximum water volumes are concentrated in Lakes Syltrankel, Bashkar, DonguzOrun, which are also potential mudslides and require long-term scientific monitoring.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, plasticulture, which is broadly defined as the use of plastics in agriculture, including greenhouse, tunnels and plastic mulch has become a fast-growing production system. While in the 1970s, the system was used on 2.8 M ha worldwide, the area had grown to 38 M ha in 1996/97 and is still increasing at a rapid rate: In Asia and Africa, the use of plastic greenhouses is growing by 15-30% per year. Therefore, plasticulture is expected to rise in many agrarian countries such as Mexico. Nonetheless, there are negative effects of plasticulture, that need to be correctly addressed in order to have responsible rural landscape management. Ergo our study attempts, through cloud geoprocessing of Sentinel-2 imagery, to rapidly provide a reliable and updated high-resolution map of protected agriculture that employs plastics (mostly tunnels and greenhouses). This map can be used as a basis for a protected agriculture monitoring system in Mexico, and eventually help to effectively plan the upcoming rural development, e.g. by providing input for territorial planning, showing the municipal rural practice trends, and monitoring the markets and its economic impacts.

TI  - Multi-criteria GIS analysis of the topography of the Moon and better solutions for potential landing
T2  - OPEN ASTRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - During the past twenty years, the need to reach the Moon by the private space missions has been growing. Some of the private missions are supported by Google Lunar X-prize and Space-X. In the period between 2020 and 2050 private companies will be planning landing to the Moon with their own capacity. These missions can send new geodesy and cartography data. Lunar topography modelling with new satellite and remote sensing data gives plenty of possibilities for its exploration. GIS (Geographical Information System) may be successfully to the Moon topography analysis. According to the results after GIS numerical analysis 30% of the territory of the Moon showed excellent characteristics for landing. The most useful parts of the Moon for potential landing belong to the altitude between 2,000 and 3,000 m and on the plateaus with the north-east direction of azimuth. These plateaus have an excellent inclination of 3 degrees and azimuth of 120 degrees. The main aim and goal of this investigation would be in better understanding of Moon topography and relief. With help of GIS numerical methods, the astronomical geodesy may be applied in better way. A potential mission to the Moon can use this topography investigation, presented maps and results.

AB  - The technique of simulation of the zones of thermal and chemical impacts on the environment is tested for the case of an active unit for the associated natural gas flaring at the oil and gas field in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug. Using satellite imagery of medium spatial resolution (30 m) from the Landsat 8 satellite obtained in the winter of 2015, 2017 and 2018, and using geoinformation technologies, the zones of thermal and chemical attacks are constructed. This allows determining the level of pollution and ecological risk of the impact of associated petroleum gas flaring on the environment of oil and gas areas.

AB  - The study was motivated by the need to determine the spatial variation of ET and to test the applicability of RS based methods in arid to semi-arid climates with limited ground-based measurements. In this paper we present results of an effort of determining spatial actual evapotranspiration in the Limpopo basin, the Notwane subcatchment in the south-eastern part of Botswana, using remote sensing data from MODIS and Landsat Data sets. The Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI) was applied to determine actual evapotranspiration using the seven bands of Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance and temperature channels. Three different dates were used to estimate ET from both Landsat and MODIS scenes. The estimated ET values from the two sensors show approximately equally comparable results. An assessment was also conducted to determine the factors influencing evapotranspiration. No strong correlation was identified for ET against the five factors investigated: Net radiation, NDVI, Surface Temperature, emissivity and surface albedo.

AB  - Soil erosion is considered as a major environmental problem since it seriously threatens natural resources, agriculture and the environment. This study aims to assess the impacts of a changing climate, land use and vegetation cover on the quantity of erosion processes in four catchments in the island of Crete / Greece. Modelling techniques were used to project the influence of changes of the above mentioned factors on the major determinants erosion processes at various time and space scales in the present and in the future (2050). Regional climate models from CORDEX experiment provided the essential information on shifting precipitation, and feeded into erosion model in order to assess the changes in seasonality, amount, and incidence of extreme events in the catchment areas. In addition, sophisticated classification algorithms were applied to Landsat images to collect new data sets of Land Use / Land Cover (LULC), topography and vegetation. Ca-Markov approach was employed to project the LULC changes in the broader future. The current and projected soil erosion risk was estimated with the use of RUSLE model.

AB  - Purpose: We sought to evaluate value impact of transition from an adult. trauma center treating children (ATC) to a verified pediatric trauma center (PTC) in children with blunt splenic injury (BSI).Methods: Children with BSI from FY 2005 to FY 2017 were extracted from the hospital trauma registry. February 2009 distinguished "ATC" treated children from "PTC" treated children. Cohorts were subcategorized into "isolaled injury" and "multisystem injury". Quality and financial characteristics were statistically compared. Analysis of covariance was used to evaluate changes in quality and financial trends over the transition period. A multiple linear regression was pertbrmed to identify variables independently predictive of hospital and professional charges.Results: 126 children with BSI were identified (ATC, n = 56; PTC, n = 70). Splenic procedure rates and hospital charges decreased. Quality and cost metrics for isolated BSI remained unchanged while multisystem BSI children experienced improvements. PTC designation, ISS, splenic procedure, isolated BSI, average hospital LOS, and mortality were all independently predictive of hospital and professional charges.Conclusions: PTC verification improves the value of BSI management, but the associated decrease in operative rate is only partially responsible. Multisystem injury children experience the greatest value benefit from PTC verification.Type of study: Treatment and cost-effectiveness study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Distribution of Land Surface Temperature In Yogyakarta Urban Area
T2  - SIXTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Yogyakarta urban area has grown throughout the year as the course of migration and its attraction to tourists and students resulting in the high demand of living space which leads to the increment of the built-up area such as hotels and other supporting-tourism-activity accommodation, so-called urban sprawl. The increase of paved-surface causes the increase of land surface temperature (LST), which may impact to micro-climate in the urban area with adverse consequences, for instance, erratic rainfall and rainstorm in the urban area. Consequently, it triggers new future problems. Therefore, it is necessary to study LST to perceive the state of temperature change in the study area as a preliminary assessment in studying urban climate.This paper attempts to present the distribution of Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Yogyakarta urban area, extracted from remotely-sensed Landsat 8 image acquired from a two-year image. Before the extraction, several variables are incorporated such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to calculate emissivity, as well as atmospheric correction parameter transmissivity, upwelling and downwelling radiance. The reflectance values are also corrected to obtain NDVI. Land surface temperature extracted according to the procedures: conversion of the digital number of Landsat image to radiance, correction of radiance value, conversion of the corrected radiance value to brightness temperature, then brightness temperature to land surface temperature. The extracted temperature map then presented into 5 degrees C interval.Consecutively, the two-year of temperature maps are then analyzed to obtain the difference of its spatial distribution. The expected result is the expanding high-temperature distribution in the urban area. The result shows there is an increase in the average land surface temperature by 1,5 degrees C from two different images, 2014 and 2018. The majority value of temperature is between 30 - 40 degrees C, dominated with the built-up area. Two image shows that the respective area spread from 54% to 70%.

T2  - AGROCLIMATOLOGY: LINKING AGRICULTURE TO CLIMATE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Information regarding evapotranspiration, the combined pathways of evaporative water loss from both the soil and vegetation, is critical to a broad range of applications from managing irrigation to maximizing both crop yield and quality and ensuring the sustainability of water resources. Evapotranspiration is controlled by multiple interconnected processes. These include the amount of available water in the soil, the atmosphere's ability to take up water vapor, and both the type and distribution of vegetation. A number of techniques have been developed to measure evapotranspiration. Each of the measurement techniques is built around its own unique set of theoretical and practical considerations and each has differing strengths and weaknesses. The overarching objective of this chapter is to provide an overview of the different methods for monitoring evapotranspiration using within-field and remote sensing-based approaches. Using lysimetry and the eddy covariance method as representative techniques, two broad approaches for monitoring evapotranspiration in situ, are discussed. Lysimetry is an example of the mass balance approach that leverages the principle of the conservation of mass to estimate evapotranspiration by measuring changes in the amount of water stored in the soil. Eddy covariance, which uses the relationship between turbulent air flow and humidity to determine evapotranspiration, is discussed as an example of the micrometeorological approach. Approaches that do not use field measurements are also available. For example, the ALEXI/DisALEXI modeling system is discussed as one remote sensing-based approach that can be used to obtain spatially-distributed estimates of evapotranspiration using remotely-sensed data from airborne or satellite platforms.

AB  - This research aims to determine the flooded agricultural lands after the flood that occurred in April 2015 on the Menderes Plain. The unexpected heavy and continuous precipitation in spring season induced a flash flood on the Menderes River, which directly damaged the agricultural lands. The flooded areas arc determined by geographic object based GEOBIA classification of normalized difference water index (NDWI) data calculated from after- disaster SPOT 6 satellite image and land cover type of the flooded areas are verified from pre-disaster SPOT 6 satellite image. Moreover, topographic characteristics of the flooded areas arc produced from open access AIMS W3D DSM data in order to investigate the relationship between the flood and topography. Results of this research exhibited that, optical satellite images are feasible data sources in determining flooded areas due to unique reflectance responses of them especially in the green and near infrared portions of the spectrum. Both flood extent and agricultural parcels affected by the flood are accurately mapped by using SPOT 6 image and GEOBIA approach.

AB  - Determination of cotton and maize cultivated areas with multi-temporal satellite images using vegetation indices is the main objective of this research. Study area was located on Sanliurfa province, Turkey, which hosts huge amount of agricultural production of cotton and maize in spring-summer season with its suitable and effective irrigation system. The Landsat 8 OLI multi-temporal images acquired with 16-day interval were used to identify cultivated areas in the study area. Image acquisition dates from 30 April 2015 to 21 September 2015 completely covers the phenological development period of cultivated crop types. Terrain corrected images were radiometrically calibrated to produce Top of Atmosphere (ToA) reflectance images, in order to reduce the atmospheric and illumination effects, thus providing efficient multi-temporal analysis. ToA reflectance images were then used in vegetation index (VI) production. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Transformed Difference Vegetation Index (TDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) were used in this research as vegetation suppression and data dimension reduction methods. Then VI image stacks were classified with pixel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and results were compared with statistical production database to evaluate the effectiveness of broadband VIs in cultivated area and crop pattern detection. Results of the analysis provided that, GNDVI based dataset provided highest accuracies according to areal comparison and point based accuracy assessment. NDVI and TDVI based datasets were ranked as the second with similar accuracy results, while EVI based dataset was in the last place when compared to remaining VI datasets. Additionally, area determination efficiency and classification accuracy for the cotton was higher than the maize nearly in all regions.

AB  - The estimation of aboveground forest biomass at species level is crucial due to the high variability in tropical forest tree species. Therefore, this study aims to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) at different tree species by using remotely sensed data. The study was carried out at Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM), Kepong Selangor. High resolution WorldView-2 satellite image was used to classify tree species based on nearest-neighbor method, where the AGB was estimated by using classical allometric equation. A number of sample trees were measured on the ground and five species were chosen namely Neobalanocarpus heimeii, Dryobalanops aromatica, Dryobalanops oblongifolia, Shorea bracteolata, and Dipterocarpus baudii, respectively. Classification of these species was based on spectral signatures measured on the leaves samples by using spectroradiometer. Correlation analysis was applied to estimate the AGB at individual stand from spectral bands and vegetation indices derived from the images. The result indicated that the polynomial function produced the best correlation between NIR2 and AGB with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.685 and RMSE at +/- 2.539. As a conclusion, this study successful to show that Worldview-2 satellite image able to be used to estimate aboveground biomass at different species at high density tropical rainforest.

AB  - The present study investigates the spatiotemporal characteristics of aerosol optical depth (AOD), cloud properties, and TOA (Top Of Atmosphere) Net Cloud Radiative Effect (Net CRE) using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra and CERES (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) products over Bangladesh for the period 2001-2016. This study also explores the backward trajectory using a HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to discover the origins of air masses. Results show annual values of AOD (0.55), Cloud Fraction (CF, 0.66), CER (Cloud Effective Radius, 14.89), COT (Cloud Optical Thickness, 15.25), CTP (Cloud Top Pressure, 639.17), CTT (Cloud Top Temperature, 262.52), WV (Water Vapor, 4.48), and Net CRE (-13.06) over Bangladesh. A seasonally peak is recorded for AOD (0.64) in MAM while for CF (0.96), CER (17.24), COT (21.12), WV (6.86), and Net CRE (-34.44) the peak is in JJA, and for CTP (884.06) and CTT (28417) it is in DJF. By monthly the peak is recorded in June for AOD (0.73) and COT (24.86); for CER (17.87), WV (7.26), and Net CRE (-45.38) it is in July; for CF (0.97) it is in July/August; CTP (900.89) and for CTT (285.75) it is in February. Regression analysis shows annual increasing trends for AOD, CF, WV, COT, CTP, and CTT with negative trends for CER and Net CRE. AOD shows increasing trends in all seasons, whereas CF, CER and COT show increasing trends in DJF and MAM only. CTP and CTT show increasing trends in JJA and SON. WV shows an increasing trend in MAM, JJA, and DJF, whereas Net CRE shows an increasing trend in MAM and SON. Relationship study provides a better conclusion of AOD and cloud interaction based on the analysis of positive and negative correlation values over the study region. The backward trajectory indicated that the air masses originated from the Bay of Bengal, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Iran. This study may be considered as a base document for further study on aerosols over Bangladesh using climate model simulation for the projection period.

Landslide inventory and subsequently landslide susceptibility mapping is one of the main prerequisite for taking mitigation measure against landslide effects. This study has focused on developing most updated and realistic landslide inventory and Susceptibility mapping. The high resolution data of Worldveiw-2 having spatial resolution of 0.4 m is used for landslide inventory. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was used for landslide inventory developing. Total 51460 number of landslides were classified using semi-automatic technique with covering area of 265 Km(2), smallest landslide mapped is covering area of 2.01 m(2) and the maximum covered area of single landslide is 3.01 Km(2). Nine influential causative factors are used for landslide susceptibility mapping. Those causative factors include slope, aspect, profile curvature, elevation, distance from fault lines, distance from streams and geology. Logistic regression model was used for the Landslides susceptibility modelling. From model the highest coefficient was assigned to geology which shows that the geology has higher influence in the area. For landslide susceptibility mapping the 70 % of the data was used and 30% is used for the validation of the model. The prediction accuracy of the model in this study is 92 % using validation data. This landslide susceptibility map can be used for land use planning and also for the mitigation measure during any disaster.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the academic polemics, stakeholder perceptions and publishing prospects for Islamic economics and finance (IEF) research.Design/methodology/approach - This study adopts both quantitative and qualitative methods with a view to understanding the aforementioned aspects of published IEF research. The main part of the study constitutes searching through selected databases to identify leading journals and publishing outlets for IEF research. To supplement and support the main part, the study also conducted a survey of IEF experts and interviewed major stakeholders with a view to understanding the current trends and future perspectives of IEF research. The study also attempts to bring to the fore less explored aspects of IEF research, which has the potential of shaping the future trends in both the academia and the industry.Findings - Apart from challenges such as inadequate funding opportunities, differences in worldview, among others, the field is still in need of improvement in the quality of research despite the increasing interest in IEF research and the level of research output over the past three decades. The study also finds that IEF has yet to establish core IEF journals reporting the research findings, which creates a perception among IEF researchers that non-IEF journals have a greater academic standing than IEF journals.Research limitations/implications - It must be highlighted that the study has been limited to specific well-known research databases; therefore, future studies may explore other leading databases such as Web of Science and examine the quality of IEF research published in journals indexed in such databases.Practical implications - It is expected that mainstream journals in economics and finance will publish more of IEF research, which has been facilitated recently by the increasing trends of special issues of such journals dedicated to IEF research.Originality/value - The study brings to the fore a less explored aspect of Islamic economics and finance, which has the potential of shaping future trends in both the academia and the industry.

AB  - Pakistan is amongst the countries that face water issues and the resources are vulnerable to global warming and changing climate. In addition, it hosts a large, rapidly growing population which depends on agriculture and the world's largest irrigation scheme. In fact, it is challenging to get into deeper understanding of snow and glacier fed Upper Indus catchment that contributes to the water system of the country. Integrating Remote Sensing abilities and Geographic Information System techniques with hydrological modelling approach is very useful to simulate the impact of climate on water resources, understand problems and enhances the methods of investigation for better decision support system. It has been proven to be an effective tool for managing large and complex database, thus providing a digital depiction of catchment characteristics. It is a supportive tool in attaining higher accuracy from hydrological models, thus gives reliable outcomes for the betterment. Therefore, it is essential that the hydrological response of a catchment must be appraised. In the present study, to simulate the daily discharge of the North facing Astore Basin in the Northern -Pakistan, SRM+G (Snowmelt Runoff Model +Glacier) hydrological model was used. For this, SRTM Digital Elevation Model, MODIS snow cover daily product. RFE (Rainfall Estimation) 2.0 for precipitation and LANDSAT 8 for glacier cover were considered. Data extraction and pre-processing was done using R-script to put into the model. The variation in temperature, precipitation (snowmelt and rainfall) and glacier melt influences the overall runoff generation. The results obtained suggest that the SRM+G can be efficiently used as the statistical and hydrograph results are within the acceptable range for both the calibration and validation period (20062010). Ensemble approach can be applied for higher precision that can be helpful in proper and efficient decision support system.

AB  - The Latin Colony (303 BC) of Alba Fucens (L'Aquila, Italy) is the largest archaeological area of the whole Apennines. Due to its extension, location and environmental context, the conservation of the site is particularly complex.For these reasons, in the paper a multiscale and multidisciplinary geoarchaeological study (remote sensing and UAV photogrammetry) of the site, to extract and measure morphostructural information to be associated to the environmental context, risk assessment and conservation, is reported.The study area is located on a higher geostructure with a subangular shape, which suggests a tectonic origin, with respect to the surrounding plain and bounded to the East by a large fan that takes place towards the Piana del Fucino.First, the geo-structural analysis, using the Landsat-8 and GeoEye multispectral sensors, was performed. The GeoEye satellite image allowed carrying out the morphological analysis of the archaeological area, its physical characteristics, the drainage pattern and the land use. Subsequently, after image processing of satellite data, a UAV survey was carried out in some relevant zones. Considering the UAV photogrammetry accuracy information, it was possible to extract data as map producing with several advantages (economic and time saving, minimum field work). With a multiscale and metric approach, the geomatics techniques allowed to deeply investigate some areas, creating detailed 3D models for evaluate risks and the decay. Finally, a general discussion about risk mitigation and conservation is reported.

AB  - Rapid growth in urbanized areas is a worldwide phenomenon. The rate of urban growth is very fast in developing countries like Iraq. This study illustrated urbanized area development in Sulaimaniyah Governorate from 2001 to 2017 using different Landsat imagery, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI). The Environment for visualizing images ENVI 5.3 and GIS software was utilized for image pre-processing, calibration and classification. The Maximum likelihood method was used in the accurately extracted solution information from geospatial Landsat satellite imagery of different periods. The Landsat images from the study area were categorized into six different classes. These are: forest, vegetation, rock, soil, built up and water body. Land cover variation and land use change detection in the area were calculated for over a 17 year period. The Change detection Analysis shows an explosive demographic shift in the urban area with a record of +8.99% which is equivalent to 51.80 km(2) over a 17 years period and the vegetation area increased with 214 km(2). On the other hand, soil area was reduced by 257.87 km(2). This work will help urban planners in the future development of the city.

AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) comprised of mixed seagrass and algae species in shallow water has gathered more attention in recent studies at local, regional, and global scales. The objective of this research is to validate and to investigate the potential of several spectral indices for percentage of submerged aquatic vegetation cover (PSAVC) density mapping in the southwest of Arabian-Gulf. The analysis was based on Landsat-OLI data and field sampling (seabed-truth). Statistical test has been undertaken using regression analysis with a confidence interval of prediction p < 0.05. Image data were radiometrically calibrated, atmospherically corrected, as well as geometrically rectified. For validation purposes, field sampling campaign was organised simultaneously with OLI image acquisition for 55 selected sampling locations associated with shallow water areas (-0.5 to -7 m depth) with variable biomass cover. The, predicted percentage cover was derived from OLI image data and statistically validated against seabed-truth (observations) extracted from underwater vertical digital photos for each sampling location using Isodata classier. The results obtained showed that only four indices are characterized by significant fits. The best fit (R-2 of 0.93) was obtained using Difference-Index exploiting the blue and green bands, followed by Simple-Ratio the VIN (R-2 of 0.81), then the MNDWI (R-2 of 0.76), and finally the VARI (R-2 of 0.66).

AB  - Rapid urbanization has been considered as a major issue across the globe due to its irreversible effects. One of the major effect is increase in Land Surface Temperature (LST) that acts as a contributor to global warming. LST is affected by the local Land Use (LU) of a region and surrounding environment. Several methods have been developed to extract LST from remote sensing data. This research focuses on using Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) to extract the LST from Landsat images. Results indicate that there has been an increase in land surface temperature with changing land use pattern from 2000 to 2017. These results with understanding of other climatic parameters can help in forecasting the changes.

AB  - With the phenomenon of urban heat island and thermal discomfort felt in urban areas, exacerbated by climate change, it is necessary to best estimate the air temperature in every part of a territory, especially in the context of the on-going rationalization of the Meteo-France network. This study proposes to estimate the temperature of the air from 35 explanatory variables, notably from remote sensing using multiple linear regressions. The collinearity of the explanatory variables is analyzed by the Pearson correlation matrix and the Variance Inflation Factor. In fine, for each day of study in each study area, the part of the variance explained is very high (greater than 73%). On the other hand, this estimate of the air temperature can never be a substitute for measurements on the ground.

M3  - Article

AB  - Sedimentary features that characterize the coastline of Abu Dhabi include beach ridges, sabkha flats, algal mats, and mangroves associated with carbonate-evaporites that are tied field descriptions, photography, and satellite imagery. Knowledge of the facies content and geometries of these bodies is intended for as analogs of similar features recognized in subsurface regional sequence stratigraphy. This paper is directed at the local and international geological and hydrocarbon exploration community, especially those starting their career. Through much of the Quaternary, the local climate and depositional settings favored the accumulation of bedded carbonates associated with minor clastics and evaporates. Accommodation for these sediments was controlled by cycles of transgression and regression through minor epeirogenic movements and the glacial eustatic sea-level fluctuations common to the Pleistocene and Holocene. Holocene sedimentary facies of the coastal area include offshore pelecypod shell gravels, onshore coral reefs, coralgal sands, oolite shoals, inshore grapestones and pelleted lime muds, and cyanobacterial mats and mangrove swamps flanked by sabkha salt flats filled by a mix of calcareous silts and muddy calcareous sands with some aeolian quartz, displacive sulfate nodules, and crystals capped by halite crusts. Storm and spring tides and infrequent wadi runoff cause periodic flooding of these salt flats. The Holocene coastal facies complex onlaps Pleistocene aeolian cross-bedded carbonate sands rich in miliolids and shell fragments. Landward these in turn onlap exposures of Miocene mixed siliciclastics, carbonates. From southeast to west, the inland area of desert is dominated by a mix of extensive gravel plains onlapped by the product of prevailing winds, a variety of aeolian sand dunes of different sizes and forms, enclosing inland sabkhas, and scattered mesas of Neogene. Sabkhat Matti, a large inland lowland sabkha, extends inland from the coast some 120 km, reaching a height of over 40 m above sea level at its southern tip.

AB  - As a part of the diagnosis pathway for breast cancer, a needle biopsy of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) is taken for analysis. Photoacoustic imaging is a better approach for guiding a needle than ultrasound imaging. However, the photoacoustic image will be affected by clutter, phase aberration and artefact from the needle. In this study, a dynamic filter delay multiply and sum (D-FDMAS) beamformer was produced to reduce these effects and improve the SNR and contrast difference (CD) of imaging targets. The D-FDMAS beamformer with a sub-group of 16 elements (16 D-FDMAS) showed improvement in SNR of needle and inclusion (SLN) by 8.38 dB and 5.42 dB compared with the delay and sum (DAS) beamfomer. It also showed reduction in CD between the inclusion and needle by almost 12 dB compared with the filter delay multiply and sum (FDMAS) beamformer.

M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVERecent meta-analysis have not revealed any positive effects of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) on locoregional recurrence (LRR) or overall survival in axilla-negative patients. However, risk of LRR increases to 15% in the presence of two or more adverse factors for the same patient group. In this study, PMRT indications and volume selections of radiation oncologists in Turkey for axilla-negative breast cancer was investigated.METHODSQuestionnaires were distributed to members of the breast cancer study group. Data of patients with axillary negative or isolated/micrometastasis and PMRT over 10 years (2006-2016) were collected from 10 participating centers. Clinical and tumor histopathological features and treatment details of 185 patients were analyzed.RESULTSThe median age of patients was 48 years. Ratio of early-stage patients was 60% (T1-15%,T2-45%). There were 147 (79%) negative cases, 32 (17%) with micrometastasis, and 6 (3%) with isolated tumor cells. Half of the patients had only their chest walls (CW) irradiated. Peripheral lymphatics were also included in the rest. In Nmic cases, ratio of irradiation of supraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes with CW were statistically significant compared to CW irradiation (72% and 28%, respectively; p=0.015).CONCLUSIONConsidering the low number of patients treated over 10 years in 10 different centers in Turkey, it can be said that PMRT is often done in node-negative breast cancer. It is difficult to reach a definite conclusion for patients with Nmic, due to lack of data from patients with PMRT. However, the general tendency is to irradiate peripheral lymphatics in Nmic cases if PMRT is to be performed.

TI  - Drought monitoring in the Brazilian Semiarid region
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural and recurrent phenomenon. It is considered 'a natural disaster' whenever it occurs in an intensive manner in highly populated regions, resulting in significant damage (material and human) and loss (socioeconomic). This paper presents the efforts developed to monitor the impact of drought in the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil. In this scope, information from different sources is compiled to support the evaluation and identification of impacted municipalities, with the main objective of supporting emergency actions to mitigate their impact. In the semiarid region of Brazil there are frequent occurrences of dry periods during the rainy season, which, depending on the intensity and duration, can cause significant damage to family-farmed crops, with a farming system characterized by low productivity indices. However, rain-fed agriculture has great economic expression and high social importance due to the region is densely occupied, and contributes to the establishment of communities in the countryside. Specifically, in the present study, the methodology adopted to monitor the impact of agricultural droughts, including an analysis of the hydrological year 2015-2016, is presented, considering different water stress indicators for the identification of the affected municipalities and assessment of the methods and tools developed.

TI  - Improving NDVI by removing cirrus clouds with optical remote sensing data from Landsat-8 - A case study in Quito, Ecuador
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Andean region has a high cloud density throughout the year. The use of optical remote sensing data in the computation of environmental indices of this region has been hampered by the presence of clouds. To maximize accuracy in the computation of several environmental indices including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), we compared the performance of two algorithms in removing clouds in Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data of a high-elevation area. The study area was Quito, Ecuador, which is a city located close to the equator and in a high-elevation area crossed by the Andes Mountains. The first algorithm was the automatic cloud removal method (ACRM), which employs a linear regression between the different spectral bands and the cirrus band. The second algorithm was independent component analysis (ICA), which considers the noise (clouds) as part of independent components applied over the study area. These methods were evaluated based on several images from different years with different cloud conditions. The results indicate that neither algorithm is effective over this region for the removal of clouds or for NDVI computation. However, after improving ACRM, the NDVI computed using ACRM showed a better correlation than ICA with the MODIS NDVI product.

AB  - Several studies have demonstrated that air quality and weather changes have influence in the prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases. Considering this context, the spatial risk modeling along the cities can help public health programs in finding solutions to reduce the frequency of respiratory diseases. With the aim to have a regional coverage and not only data in specific (point) locations, an effective alternative is the use of remote sensing data combined with field air quality data and meteorological data. During the last years, the use of remote sensing data allowed the construction of models to determine air quality data with satisfactory results. Some models using remote sensing based air quality data presented good levels of correlation (R-2 > 0.5), proving that it is possible to establish a relationship between remote sensing data and air quality data.In order to establish a spatial health respiratory risk model for Quito, Ecuador, an empirical model was computed considering data between 2013 and 2017, using the median data values in each parish of the city. The variables are: i) 46 Landsat-8 satellite images with less than 10% of cloud cover and some indexes (normalized difference vegetation index NDVI, Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index SAVI, etc.); ii) air quality data (nitrogen dioxide - NO2, Ozone - O-3, particulate matter less than 2.5 mu m - PM2.5 and sulfur dioxide - SO2) obtained from local air quality network stations and; iii) the hospital discharge rates from chronic respiratory diseases (CRD). In order to establish a probability model to get a CRD, a logistic regression was used. The empirical model is expressed as the probability of occurrence during the studied time. All the procedures were implemented in R Studio. The methodology proposed in this work can be used by health and governmental entities to access the risk of getting a respiratory disease, considering an application of remote sensing in the environmental and health management programs.

AB  - Raydah protected area in an important declared protected area in Aseer area, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that is rich in biodiversity, and provides habitat for nine of the ten indigenous bird species in the kingdom. Invasive plant Opuntia spp. in Raydah could threaten the natural balance among the indigenous species and thereafter affect the biological components of the ecosystem. This study evaluates the prevalence of invasive species and vegetation cover trends in Raydah protected area to identify possible interventions to conserve and protect the protected area. The results provide important and necessary information for the conservation and management of the Raydah Area and the Aseer Area's southwestern highlands. The study has demonstrated the potential of sentinel sensor for detection and mapping of invasive species such as Opuntia spp. with desirable accuracy. This encouraging result demonstrated the feasibility of developing a semi -automated process for mapping and analysing the distribution of Opuntia spp. and found better results compared to multispectral data with very high resolution. Assessment of the current situation of the Opuntia spp. in the protected area will provide scientific data base for future management plans to combat and control invasive plants and protect the protected area from their adverse effects.

AB  - Agro-climatology is highly worthy in the identification of agro-climates with the climate change conditions to introduce new agricultural crops. Agro-Climatic Zones permits recognizing areas with different potential products according to their climate change environmental conditions. This study aims to produce Agro-Climatic Zones map using satellite-based climate data in Iraq. Climate data based on satellite data were downloaded and processed with a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees, then interpolated using the spline method. The annual precipitation was downloaded from TRMM_3B43 v7 satellite data from 1998 to 2018 and the average annual air temperature for the period 2000 to 2018 was downloaded from the GLDAS Model (NOAH025_M v2.1). The GIS-based approach was implemented to create the necessary datasets and to develop an Agro-Climatic Zones map in the Iraq Republic. The results have mapped Iraq republic Agro-Climatic Zones into five zones, which are arid, cool winter, very warm summer (ACZ 1 represent about 48.8 % of the total area); arid, mild winter, very warm summer (ACZ 2 about 36.8 % of the total area); semi-arid, cool winter, very warm summer (ACZ 3 about 8.8 % of the total area); semi-humid to Mediterranean, cool winter, very warm summer (ACZ 4 about 4.2 % of the total area); and very humid to humid, cold to cool winter, warm summer (ACZ 5 about 1.4 % of the total area).

TI  - Multispectral analysis to estimate the turbidity as an indicator of the quality of water in reservoirs in Chihuahua State, Mexico
T2  - REVISTA GEOGRAFICA DE AMERICA CENTRAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Basin of Conchos River, located in the State of Chihuahua (Mexico), has suffered a marked deterioration due to the development of human activities. The urban population growth, industrialization, and agriculture have significantly degraded water resources of this basin. To examine the quality of its waters, the reservoirs of Las Virgenes dam, the Colina lake, and La Boquilla dam have been analyzed, determining the parameters of dissolved oxygen, pH, nitrates, total dissolved solids, turbidity and temperature from water samples. Using these data and the spectral information of Landsat 5 satellite images, 30 linear regression models were evaluated; from these models, turbidity obtained the best match. The regions of spectrum 0.52-0.6 mu m and 0.63-0.69 mu m, provided by the predictor variable, appeared as the ranges of higher correlation with the values of turbidity. The model used to represent the turbidity spatially distributed shows that La Boquilla dam gets the highest values related to the suspension of sediments provided by ephemeral channels throughout the reservoir.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXIV, held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Cloud detection is a critical issue for satellite optical remote sensing, since potential errors in cloud masking can be translated directly into significant uncertainty in the retrieved downstream geophysical products. The problem is particularly challenging when only of a limited number of spectral bands is available, and thermal infrared bands are lacking. This is the case of Proba-V instrument, for which the European Space Agency (ESA) carried out a dedicated Round Robin exercise, aimed at intercomparing several cloud detection algorithms to better understand their advantages and drawbacks for various clouds and surface conditions, and to learn lessons on cloud detection in the VNIR and SWIR domain for land and coastal water remote sensing. The present contribution is aimed at a thorough quality assessment of the results of the cloud detection approach we proposed, based on Cumulative Discriminant Analysis. Such a statistical method relies on the empirical cumulative distribution function of the measured reflectance in clear and cloudy conditions to produce a decision rule. It can be adapted to the user's requirements in terms of preferred levels for both type I and type II errors. In order to obtain a fully automatic procedure, we choose as a training dataset a subset of the full Proba-V scenes for which a cloud mask is estimated by a consolidated algorithm (silver standard), that is from either SEVIRI, MODIS or both sensors. Within this training set, different subsets have been setup according to the different types of surface underlying scenes (water, vegetation, bare land, urban, and snow/ice). We present the analysis of the cloud classification errors for a range of such test scenes to yield important inferences on the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methodology when applied to different types of surfaces.

TI  - Gender differences in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an analysis of hospitalization indicators
T2  - ITALIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared to the last two decades, an increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) prevalence, morbidity, mortality and disability has clearly emerged among women both in Europe and in all other countries. Despite this evidence, in the international guidelines for COPD there are no sex-specific recommendations. The aim of this study is to evaluate gender differences in patients hospitalized for COPD in Puglia (Italy), with regard to number of admissions, mean age, average length of stay in hospital (ALOS), hospital mortality, re-hospitalization and presence of comorbidities. To identify COPD hospitalized patients, we relied on the Puglia Hospital Discharge Register Database. We included all patients discharged with principal diagnosis of COPD with or without exacerbation (respectively ICD-9-CM codes 491.21 and 491.20) between 2005 and 2016. There has been an increase in the proportion of women's hospitalizations for COPD, from 2005 [31.9%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 31.1-32.7] to 2016 (37.9%, 95% CI 36.0-40.0). Women need longer hospitalization and in 2016 the proportion of women's re-hospitalization was greater compared to men. Despite these data, women are less treated with respiratory therapy (ICD-9-CM 93.9x) than men in all the examined years and wards. The prevalence of most common comorbidities is higher among women. The number of COPD hospitalized patients had been reduced in Puglia between 2005 and 2016, with an important increase of female COPD patients, female average age, ALOS and re-hospitalization. Women are treated less and have more comorbidities with a negative impact on clinical progression of COPD, survival and quality of life.

The best method which can solve this problem is the sentinel method; It allows estimating the pollution term at which we look for information independently of the missing term that we do not want to identify. So, we prove the existence of such instantaneous sentinel by solving a problem of controllability with constraint on the control.

CL  - Melaka, MALAYSIA
AB  - The main objective of this study is to track the coastal change over Kuala Terengganu coastal water from 1989 to 2018. In this study, dataset acquired from Landsat 5 and 8 have been used. The image was processed using Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to differentiate land and water body. The result shows that, before the reclamation of the coastal for the extension of the airport runaway, accretion is a dominant process over this area. After the reclamation, the erosion occurs at the north and accretion at the south. During the period of 2006-2014, 0.0229 km(2) of coastal was lost due to the erosion. However, the reclamation and accretion processes contribute about 0.972 km(2) of new land over this area. Overall, for the period of 1989-2018, the reclamation and accretion contribute 1.337 km(2) of new land/coastal to this study area.

CL  - Hammamet, TUNISIA
AB  - Groundwater is depleting at a more rapid rate than its replenishment in Indus Basin due to increased demand attributed to urbanization, inefficient water management practices especially in the agricultural sector and increase in impervious area in the name of development that can expose the country to severe challenge in the future. Through an unregulated groundwater exploitation now farmers often meet inadequacy in surface water supplies. The concurrent use of surface water and groundwater water now takes place on more than 70% of irrigated lands. Therefore, water resources should be monitored on frequent intervals to sensitize policy makers to formulate an optimal framework for water management practices. This study assessed the competence of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Satellite (GRACE)-based estimation of changes in Ground Water Storage (GWS) as a substitute approach for groundwater quantitative approximation for management of groundwater resources in the Indus basin. The GRACE satellite Total Water Storage (TWS) data from 2011 to 2015 was used to calculate GWS. A common reduction trend was seen in the Upper Indus Plain (UIP) where the average net loss of groundwater was observed to be 1701.39 km(3) of water amid 2011-2015. A net loss of around 0.34 km(3)/year groundwater storage was deduced for the UIP where flooding in 2014 assumed a fundamental part in natural replenishment of groundwater aquifer of the UIP. In view of TWS varieties three out of four doabs Bari, Rachna, Thal demonstrated a decrease in groundwater capacity though Chaj doab brought about increment of 0.09 km(3). Based on this study, GRACE-Tellus satellite data is competent enough to hint for groundwater storage variations, however there is a vibrant need to calibrate GRACE-Tellus data with hydrological stations data periodically in order to take a maximum advantage for utility of GRACE to monitor groundwater variations on regional scale. Future studies should focus on this aspect.

T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture a major source of food and fibre affects the natural land cover and in turn is affected by climatic factors like temperature and precipitation patterns beside other factors. The soil temperature and moisture, wind, relative humidity and crop water requirements also affect the crop growth. Local farming practices also alter the natural landscape structure and biodiversity in croplands This study was conducted with the objective to find out seasonality trend and to determine the land cover classification in Potohar region using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Moreover, random points throughout the study area were selected in order to detect the vegetation index pattern in different land cover types. For land cover classification and acquiring seasonality trend, crop growth patterns were determined by phenological phases of a particular crop. Land cover was classified with standard Level 1 Terrain-corrected (LIT) orthorectified images from Landsat 8 from years 2012 to 2016. Seven land cover classes within the study area were identified namely; agriculture, grasses, forest, shrubs/tall herbs, bare soil, built-up and water bodies. Moreover, the seasonality trend over the study was found related to different land cover classifications using 959 sample plots with 97.81% accuracy. The phase trend analysis determined the change in vegetation cover during the years under study, which was correlated to precipitation patterns in Potohar. The NDVI pattern was highly fluctuating in agricultural land cover due to seasonal crop growth but it remained stable throughout the year in forest covers. Urban land cover was found to have high impact on nearby vegetation as it was related to change in land cover type, which affected the climate of the area. Climate being a vital deriving force, affected precipitation patterns of the rain-fed (barani) land which in turn shifted the seasonal growth of various agricultural crops.

AB  - Objective: To describe the investigative path of analysis and the operationality of concepts based on Martin Heidegger's theoretical and philosophical framework. Method: Theoretical reflection on the phenomenon of pregnancy in a woman with heart disease. Results: Stages of the investigative movement were evidenced based on the pre-reflection related to the object of study and to the search for the phenomenal meaning, using the existential and analytical Hermeneutics as the approach and resulting in the reach of the phenomenal totality. Conclusion: The worldview of the researcher, who considered the subjectivities of the person in a health or disease situation, favored the announcement of the referential by the object of study. Knowledge production in the light of Martin Heidegger's phenomenology unveiled phenomena lived and experienced in the Health and Nursing field, provided of epistemological rigor that demanded appropriation of concepts inherent to the existential analytics.

TI  - Development of Land-cover Spatial Database using Satellite Imagery: Lesson Learned from Southern Part of Sumatera
T2  - SIXTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Development of spatial databases for systematic thematic mapping is a complex activity, as compared to mapping a small area with arbitrary boundaries. This research was conducted in the provinces of Riau Islands, Bangka Belitung Islands, Jambi, and Bengkulu, southern Sumatera. The stages of spatial databases development involved remote sensing, GIS, and cartographic activities. A synoptic overview of the landscape was carried out prior to the spatial database development. The landscape complexity was assessed using landscape-ecological approach, which was implemented in the delineation and classification. The remote sensing process started from spatial data collection of various images with various spatial resolutions, image pre-processing, followed by image analysis and interpretation. Pan-sharpened Landsat-8 images (15 meters) were used as main data, supported by SPOT 6/7 imagery (6 meters), Sentinel-2A imagery (10 meters) and DEMNAS digital elevation model (8 meters) for particular areas. This stage gave consequences to the multi-scale analysis in the process of land-cover delineation. The GIS process comprised the stages of compiling the interpretation results to form a seamless mosaic, topology construction, coding into Indonesian Geographic Element Catalog (KUGI) standard, metadata development, followed by topology checking. Those processes aimed to achieve a single map of Sumatera at 1: 50,000 scale. The cartographic layout design was the final stage of the spatial database development, where the land-cover classes symbol was also carried out in accordance with the established standards. Some problems and solutions in the whole processes were also discussed in this paper.

AB  - Three glaciers and other small glacial formations, which are not mentioned in the USSR Catalog of glaciers as well as in any published article, were found in the area of the Verkhneangarsky (upper Angara) Range on satellite images. Earlier, researchers from the Institute of Geography of Siberian Branch of RAS described a group of glaciers on the Baikal Mountains and the Barguzin Range, which together with the above group of the Verkhneangarsky Range are related to the Baikal basin by the climate conditions. Ogdynda-Maskit Glacier has been described on the spot in 2017, while other glaciers and snow patches are to be investigated in situ in 2018. Together with the above Baikal and Barguzin glaciers, new data allow identification of the Baikal Glacial system. The article presents analysis of climate changes in the region. Trends in mean annual temperature range from 1 to 4 degrees C/50 years, while the same of summer temperatures change from 1 to 3 degrees C/50 years, but without any evident spatial distribution between them. Another situation takes place in the spatial distribution of precipitation: trends in total precipitation decrease towards the Baikal Lake, while precipitation of the cold period, on the contrary, slightly increases towards the Lake, but with rather small trend - 10-40 mm per 50 years. The last fact confirms the influence of the Baikal basin on the alimentation of glaciers and snow patches on the Verkhneangarsky Range. Currently, glaciers of the Verkhneangarsky Range undergo a slow regression.

TI  - Studies of the glaciers located on the Verkhneangarsky mountain range
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers of the Verkhneangarsky mountain range are discovered in 2017-2018 and require detailed investigation and cataloging. This group of glaciers includes glaciers of the corrie and morphological types, and, according to the sizes, they should be qualified as small forms of glaciation. Four glacial formations were found during field studies of 2017-2018 together with several snow patches and stone glaciers; these four glaciers were measured and described. The temperature of ice in the glaciers of this region was measured during the investigations. Data on the ice temperature close to the temperature of the surface permafrost layer explain one of the conditions for existence of glaciers in the temperate zone at altitudes of 1800-2000 m. The dynamics of some glacial formations is analyzed in comparison with their present-day sizes, obtained as a result of interpretation of images from Bing maps and Sentinel-2 services, as well as with images of the CORONA mission (1967). The relative stability of the local glacial formations under climate change is related to the underlying permafrost as well as to the forms of occurrence in the relief, and a degree of closure by the stone cover.

TI  - Assessment of dual polarization in Sentinel-1 data for estimating forest aboveground biomass: case study of Barru Regency, South Sulawesi

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Remote sensing has been widely used in the estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) which is essential for climate change mitigation,by using either optical or radar data and its combination. This estimation of AGB from remote sensing data is now supported by the availability of the freely available dual-polarization Sentinel 1 SAR data. However, the assessment of the accuracy for measuring AGB from the VV and VH polarization in Sentinel-1 data in Indonesia is still limited. This study aims to assess the performance of VV and VH polarization and the combination with texture data from Sentinel-1 for estimating AGB in tropical forest of Barru Regency, South Sulawesi. The AGB was calculated by using backscatter value from C-band SAR dual-polarization and Grey Level of Measure (GLCM) texture data from Sentinel-1 as the independent variables, and ground inventory plots as the dependent variable. The allometric equation was used to calculate the biomass value of the field survey data then multilinear regression models were generated by using biomass value, backscatter data from VV and VH polarization, and texture data. The performance of the resulted multilinear regression models was compared by looking at the coefficient of determination (R-2) and RMSE value generated by crossvalidation. The results demonstrated that combination of VH and GLCM texture suggest as the best to estimate the AGB based on higher value of R-2 = 0.34 and RMSE 21.98355 Ton/Ha. In conclusion, VH polarization usage in vegetation AGB modelling has been able to predict 12 % higher than by using VV polarisation. The inclusion of texture also had been able to increase the model performance by 12% to 19% which demonstrated the importance of having texture variables in the analysis of AGB.

TI  - Performance of Various Speckle Filter Methods in Modelling Forest Aboveground Biomass using Sentinel-1 Data: Case Study of Barru Regency, South Sulawesi
T2  - SIXTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Noise in SAR imagery was produced due to different backscatter responses from the objects in the earth's surface. This resulted in a grainy image, usually known as "salt and pepper" noise, which reduces the capability to identify an object from radar imagery. Therefore, speckle filtering was conducted to decrease this noise from SAR imagery. This study aims to assess the performance of different types of speckle filters, especially when used to construct forest aboveground biomass (AGB) model from Sentinel-1 data in Barru Regency, South Sulawesi. There were 4 filters used in this study i.e. Frost, Gamma-MAP, Median, and Refined Lee. AGBmodelwas constructed by using dual-polarization C-band SAR of Sentinel- 1 data and ground inventory plots. 23 plots were collected in the field and the allometric equation was used to calculate the biomass value of the field survey data then cross-validation models were generated by using biomass value and backscatter data from VV and VH polarization. Quality control was performed by comparing the coefficient of determination (R-2) of those filters. The result shows that Frost filter, especially on VH polarization was chosen as the best- fit model to estimate the AGB based on the higher value of R-2 (0.3464158) and RMSE (33.5231). The result demonstrated the Frost filter as the best filter for retaining and/or enhancing the backscatter signal in Sentinel-1 data to be used in vegetation biophysical modelling.

AB  - The relevance. The expansion of the mineral resource base of existing mining enterprises requires modern approaches to the study of adjacent areas. One of such modern methods in the study of areas is the use of modern spectral space imagery in order to isolate potentially ore-bearing areas based on structural and material interpretation.The main aim of the work was to develop the criteria for epithermal gold-silver mineralization within the Okhotsk-Chukotka volcanic belt based on materials from remote surveys.The objects of the research were the well-known ore taxa of the southeastern flank of the Ulinskaya mineragenic zone of the Okhotsk-Chukotka volcanic belt.Methods: processing, spectral analysis and interpretation of modern remote sensing Landsat, Aster and high resolution images Ikons, World View, QuickBird.Results. The authors have developed regional, local and detailed criteria for epithermal Au-Ag mineralization using the example of one of the sections of the Ulinsk mineragenic zone. Structural criteria for the regional level are systems of telescoped ring structures with a diameter of 20-90 km at the junction points of multidirectional faults. Structural and material criteria of the local level are the areas of conjugation of systems of nested coordinated ring structures with sizes from 1 to 10 km with zones of development of Fe-oxide indices. The structural-material criteria of the detailed level include small ring structures made by the bodies of silica of various mineral composition, associated with zones of development of Fe-oxide indices, within the sections of the propilitic type of alteration. On the basis of the identified features of the structure of the Svetloe ore field, a forecast was made of the prospects for the southern and southeastern flank to identify Au-Ag epithermal mineralization. A hierarchical remote sensing forecast and prospecting model of epithermal Au-Ag deposits is proposed.

TI  - Continued expansion of tick-borne pathogens: Tick-borne encephalitis virus complex and <i>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</i> in Denmark
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a tick-transmitted flavivirus within the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) complex. The TBE complex is represented by both TBEV and louping ill virus (LIV) in Denmark. Anaplasma phagocytophilum is also transmitted by ticks and is believed to play an essential role in facilitating and aggravating LIV infection in sheep.This study aimed to describe the distribution of TBE complex viruses in Denmark, to establish the possible emergence of new foci and their association with the distribution of A. phagocytophilum. We performed a nationwide seroprevalence study of TBE complex viruses using roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) as sentinels and determined the prevalence of A. phagocytophilum in roe deer. Danish hunters obtained blood samples from roe deer during the hunting season of 2013-14. The samples were examined for TBEV-specific antibodies by virus neutralization tests (NT). A. phagocytophilum infection was assessed by specific real-time-PCR.The overall seroprevalence of the TBE complex viruses in roe deer was 6.9% (51/736). The positive samples were primarily obtained from a known TBE endemic foci and risk areas identified in previous sentinel studies. However, new TBE complex risk areas were also identified. The overall prevalence of A. phagocytophilum was 94.0% (173 PCR-positive of 184 roe deer), which is twice the rate observed ten years ago.These results point to an expansion of these tick-borne diseases geographically and within reservoir populations and, therefore, rationalize the use of sentinel models to monitor changes in transmission of tick-borne diseases and development of new risk areas. We found no association between TBE complex-positive roe deer and the prevalence of A. phagocytophilum, as almost all roe deer were infected. Based on our findings we encourage health care providers to be attentive to tick-borne illnesses such as TBE when treating patients with compatible symptoms.

AB  - Analysis Ready Data (ARD) is a recent concept in Earth observing remote sensing which encompasses many different initiatives by individual imagery providers and collaborative international organizations working towards easing/minimizing data preprocessing required by users. This allows users to spend more time on analysis and less time on downloading, formatting, and ingesting. The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), the primary provider of Landsat image data, has been making internal strides to provide ARD: moving towards Level-2 surface reflectance and surface temperature as standard products. External cooperation, working toward a common ARD definition, has also been a focus of the USGS by working directly with other governmental or commercial providers, both national and international, or through organizations such as the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and the Joint Agency Commercial Imagery Evaluation (JACIE) workshop. The USGS is determined to provide users with the most accurate and easy to use data.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the socio-cultural aspects of the formation of a new technocratic elite in Russia, corresponding to the perspective of the so-called "society 5.0". There were some concerns about the impact on the process in the interest of the whole community. As a hypothetical proto-elite environment, on the basis of which the "elite 5.0" can crystallize in the future, the student contingent of leading Russian universities with increased requirements for the level of training is considered. The article presents the results of empirical research of this category of youth, on the basis of which its worldview, models of personal self-realization and hierarchy of values are reconstructed. Based on the reconstruction of the inner world of the "avant-garde" part of the Russian students, carried out on the basis of psychosemantic probing, forecasts are made about the possible evolution of the views and social attitudes of the updated Russian elite. The special role of the American and Chinese models in the formation of young educated Russians' ideas about how modern society should develop is noted. At the same time, based on the data of the study, the author substantiates the thesis that the Russian intellectual youth does not show a tendency to a sharp break with the traditions and, probably, with the strategy of traditionalist modernization is currently being implemented in Russia.

AB  - From the point of view of physics and physiology, the perception of color should be the same by all people, but the process and associations connected with it have historical and cultural determinants in different nations. The conceptual apparatus of color linguistics is studied in different scientific studies and from different points of view. The material of this study comprises riddles extracted from Khanty folklore by the method of continuous sampling, as well as scientific literature on the description of color words. A common way of creating riddle metaphors is color matching. Therefore, exploring color words in the Khanty riddles allows us to reveal the cognitive, pragmatic and cultural factors of language functioning. The present research highlights the role of color terms in the formation of linguistic worldview, as well as conceptualizes and defines the place of the color vocabulary in the cognitive process. Key words: Khanty riddles, basic color terms, color words.

TI  - TRICKSTER IN MODERNIST SWEDISH LITERATURE (BASED ON PAR LAGERKVIST'S NOVEL <i>THE DWARF</i>)
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the role of the trickster in the modernist Swedish mythological novel. The analysis is mainly based on Par Lagerkvist's The Dwarf; I discuss other novels and short stories, such as Lagerkvist's Barabbas, The Sybil, Pilgrim at Sea, and "The Eternal Smile" as well as Eyvind Johnson's Return to Ithaca to illustrate the repeatability of certain trickster's features in the literature of Swedish modernism. Modernist trickster has not been hitherto thoroughly studied, that is why the methodology of the article is complex. It combines Carl Jung's theory of archetypes with Paul Radin's and D.A. Gavrilov's methodology employed to analyze the trickster's folklore origins. M.M. Bakhtin's terms are also employed but with reservations, because Swedish modernist novels, while sharing some features of the menippea, do not develop a carnivalesque worldview. The article demonstrates that Lagerkvist's Dwarf, Barabbas, Ahasuerus and Giovanni, as well as Johnson's Odysseus are indeed tricksters; however, they are very different from their predecessors in folklore, ancient, and medieval literature. The concluding part points out three main features of these new modernist tricksters: they are no longer funny or entertaining, they are self-reflective, and they are philosophers: not only do they help the authors to voice their ideas but they themselves go on a quest, seeking the answers to eternal questions.

TI  - The Trilogy of Novels by the Argentinian-Austrian Writer German Kratowchwil: the Big World in the Small World of Patagonia
T2  - REVISTA DE FILOLOGIA ALEMANA
M3  - Article
AB  - German Kratochwil, born 1938 in Austria, emigrated early on to Argentina but didn't come to literature until later in life after a long career as a social scientist. Meanwhile, he has published three novels in German: Scherbengericht (2012), Rio Pun" (2013) und Territorium (2016). Since the setting of all three works is Patagonia, it makes sense to speak of a Patagonian trilogy of novels by the author. On the basis of a considerable arsenal of characters, the motifs lie in confrontations with the past and present, attempts to escape from society, and the effects of world conflicts on an only seemingly isolated Patagonia. These motifs are explored in an exact textual analysis. Ultimately, the events of big world show themselves in the small world of Patagonia, resulting in a worldview that points to a hardly secure future.

AB  - The problem of detecting objects on a sequence of images with a complex structure is considered. Optimal and quasi-optimal algorithms for processing multidimensional images have been synthesized and investigated. Improved detection efficiency has been obtained by adequately describing real data using doubly stochastic random fields. The possibility of describing Earth remote sensing data using doubly stochastic models is investigated. The possibility of obtaining significant gains when filtering satellite material and detecting extended objects on it due to the adaptive structure of such models and processing time sequence of multizone images as a single multidimensional dataset is shown. The gains for filtering algorithms in the error variance are about 80% comparing single frame processing, and the gains for detecting algorithms in the signal/noise ratio are about 70% comparing single frame processing.

AB  - The Moon has played a vital role in the radiometric stability monitoring of NASAs Earth Observing System sensors, such as MODIS on the Terra and Aqua spacecrafts. The lunar calibration methodologies developed for the two MODIS instruments were later extended to apply to the VIIRS instrument on the Suomi-NPP spacecraft. The follow-on VIIRS instrument on the NOAA-20 (N20) spacecraft (previously JPSS-1) has been successfully operating since its launch in November 2017. Fifteen VIIRS spectral bands are in the reflective solar spectral region, covering wavelengths from 0.4 to 2.3 mu m. Similar to the previous MODIS and VIIRS instruments, the N20 VIIRS views the Moon via a spacecraft roll maneuver on a near-monthly basis at a confined phase angle range (-51.5 degrees to -50.5 degrees) to facilitate radiometric stability monitoring with reduced uncertainties. In this paper, we briefly present the lunar calibration methodology and also report the derived instrument gain parameters from the regularly scheduled lunar calibrations. The USGS Robotic Lunar Observatory (ROLO) model is used to provide the predicted lunar irradiance for each lunar measurement to account for the variation in the observation geometry. The spatial characterization algorithms using the Moon, previously developed for MODIS and SNPP VIIRS, have also been extended to N20 VIIRS to track its on-orbit band-to-band registration (BBR).

AB  - Discerning regional political volatility is valuable for successful policy development by government and commercial entities, and necessitates having an understanding of the underlying economic, social, and political environment. Some methods of obtaining the environment information, such as global public opinion surveys, are expensive and slow to complete. We explore the feasibility of gleaning comparable information through automated image processing with a premium on freely available commercial satellite imagery. Previous work demonstrated success in predicting survey responses related to wealth, poverty, and crime in rural Afghanistan and Botswana, by utilizing spatially coinciding high resolution satellite images to develop models. We extend these findings by using similar image features to predict survey responses regarding political and economic sentiment. We also explore the feasibility of predicting survey responses with models built from Sentinel 2 satellite imagery, which is coarser-resolution, but freely available. Our findings reiterate the potential for cheaply and quickly discerning the socio-politico-economic context of a region solely through satellite image features. We show a number of models and their cross-validated performance in predicting survey responses, and conclude with comments and recommendations for future work.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dengue fever hotspots associated with climatic factors in Taiwan including outbreak predictions based on machine-learning
T2  - GEOSPATIAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Early warning systems (EWS) have been proposed as a measure for controlling and preventing dengue fever outbreaks in countries where this infection is endemic. A vaccine is not available and has yet to reach the market due to the economic burden of development, introduction and safety concerns. Understanding how dengue spreads and identifying the risk factors will facilitate the development of a dengue EWS, for which a climate-based model is still needed. An analysis was conducted to examine emerging spatiotemporal hotspots of dengue fever at the township level in Taiwan, associated with climatic factors obtained from remotely sensed data in order to identify the risk factors. Machine-learning was applied to support the search for factors with a spatiotemporal correlation with dengue fever outbreaks. Three dengue fever hotspot categories were found in southwest Taiwan and shown to he spatiotemporally associated with five kinds of sea surface temperatures. Machine-learning, based on the deep AlexNet model trained by transfer learning, yielded an accuracy of 100% on an 8-fold cross-validation test dataset of longitude-time sea surface temperature images.

AB  - This paper presents a case study of automatic classification of the remotely sensed Sentinel-2 imagery, from the EU Copernicus program. The work involved a study site, located in the area next to the city of Pavia, Italy, including fields cultivated by three farms. The aim of this work was to evaluate the so-called supervised classification applied to satellite images and performed with Esri's ArcGIS Pro software and Machine Learning techniques. The classification performed produces a land use map that is able to discriminate between different land cover types. By applying the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, it was found that, in our case, the pixel-based method offers a better overall performance than the object-based, unless a specific class is exclusively taken into consideration. This activity represents the first step of a project that fits into the context of Precision Agriculture, a recent and rapidly developing research area, whose aim is to optimize traditional cultivation methods.

AB  - Orbit estimation is of increasing interest due to need to avoid close encounters between operational satellites and space debris. This paper uses input estimation to estimate the drag on a satellite, where the drag is modeled as an unknown input forcing. Retrospective cost input estimation is applied to simulated satellite data under three scenarios, namely, 1) indirect estimation of the drag acceleration in the inertial frame (that is, estimation of the total inertial acceleration), 2) direct estimation of the drag acceleration in the inertial frame (that is, estimation of only the inertial drag acceleration), and 3) estimation of the magnitude of the drag acceleration.

AB  - Multitemporal phase estimation aims at the exploitation temporal data redundancy within the SAR time-series to reduce the impact of inherent stochastic and systematic interferometric phase inconsistencies [1] for distributed scatterers (DS). The consistent phase-series estimated as such is further utilized to retrieve the underlying geophysical and atmospheric signals. Therefore, the precision and interpretability of the retrieved physical signals from the DS is governed by the performance of the phase estimators. Different approaches to phase estimation calls for the investigation of their performance. Here we explain the discrepancy among the different approaches in terms of their underlying covariance model and introduce our recently proposed estimator named EMI [2]. Bridging between different approaches via revised mathematical formulation of phase estimation, EMI enhances the estimation precision and computational efficiency of the temporal phase estimation. The performance of different phase estimators is brought into attention via simulation analysis. Using Sentinel-1 time series over the North and East Anatolian Faults, wide area performance analysis is further carried out and will be presented.

TI  - Retrieval of Chlorophyll <i>a</i> from Sentinel-2 MSI Data for the European Union Water Framework Directive Reporting Purposes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Parliament and The Council of the European Union have established the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) for all European Union member states to achieve, at least, good ecological status of all water bodies larger than 50 hectares in Europe. The MultiSpectral Instrument onboard European Space Agency satellite Sentinel-2 has suitable 10, 20, 60 m spatial resolution to monitor most of the Estonian lakes as required by the Water Framework Directive. The study aims to analyze the suitability of Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument data to monitor water quality in inland waters. This consists of testing various atmospheric correction processors to remove the influence of atmosphere and comparing and developing chlorophyll a algorithms to estimate the ecological status of water in Estonian lakes. This study shows that the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument is suitable for estimating chlorophyll a in water bodies and tracking the spatial and temporal dynamics in the lakes. However, atmospheric corrections are sensitive to surrounding land and often fail in narrow and small lakes. Due to that, deriving satellite-based chlorophyll a is not possible in every case, but initial results show the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument could still provide complementary information to in situ data to support Water Framework Directive monitoring requirements.

TI  - Integration of UAV, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 Data for Mangrove Plantation Aboveground Biomass Monitoring in Senegal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the increasing importance of mangroves in climate change mitigation projects, more accurate and cost-effective aboveground biomass (AGB) monitoring methods are required. However, field measurements of AGB may be a challenge because of their remote location and the difficulty to walk in these areas. This study is based on the Livelihoods Fund Oceanium project that monitors 10,000 ha of mangrove plantations. In a first step, the possibility of replacing traditional field measurements of sample plots in a young mangrove plantation by a semiautomatic processing of UAV-based photogrammetric point clouds was assessed. In a second step, Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical imagery were used as auxiliary information to estimate AGB and its variance for the entire study area under a model-assisted framework. AGB was measured using UAV imagery in a total of 95 sample plots. UAV plot data was used in combination with non-parametric support vector regression (SVR) models for the estimation of the study area AGB using model-assisted estimators. Purely UAV-based AGB estimates and their associated standard error (SE) were compared with model-assisted estimates using (1) Sentinel-1, (2) Sentinel-2, and (3) a combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as auxiliary information. The validation of the UAV-based individual tree height and crown diameter measurements showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.21 m and 0.32 m, respectively. Relative efficiency of the three model-assisted scenarios ranged between 1.61 and 2.15. Although all SVR models improved the efficiency of the monitoring over UAV-based estimates, the best results were achieved when a combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data was used. Results indicated that the methodology used in this research can provide accurate and cost-effective estimates of AGB in young mangrove plantations.

TI  - Linguistic Policy in Yakutia in Context of Soviet Nation-Building of 1920-1930: New Yakut Alphabet
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors present the concept of alphabetical construction in Yakutia during the Soviet modernization. It is emphasized that the Yakut region as a special historical and cultural space was characterized by the intensity of civilizational dialogue and exchange of ideas, political strategies and practices. The authors note that the socialist reconstruction actualized the "linguistic" turn in the intellectual environment of the Yakut ASSR in the 1920s-1930s. Two principal positions are characterized in the ongoing heated debate about the graphics of the Yakut alphabet (Cyrillic, on which N. N. Poppe, E. K. Pekarskiy, A. E. Kulakovskiy and V. N. Leontyev insisted, and Latinized, advocated by A. N. Samoylovich, B. M. Grande, S. A. Novgorodov, P. A. Oyunsky). Special attention is paid to the linguistic project developed by the linguist G. V. Baishev (Altan Saryn), which echoes the ideas of linguistic pan-Turkism. For the first time P. A. Oyunsky's scientific activity in the years of postgraduate study in Moscow (1932-1935), where he was in the "ideological" circle of outstanding linguists, is analysed. It is shown that the worldview and practice of the national intelligentsia were concentrated on experiments on alphabetical construction. The novelty of the research is seen in the methodological innovation: the combination of approaches of transnational and intellectual history allowed to reveal the importance of the presented language projects in the framework of political discourse.

TI  - SPENGLERIAN IDEAS IN AMERICAN CULTURAL CONSCIOUSNESS
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the article is to study the three most striking cases of the Oswald Spengler's influence on the USA authors (F. Scott Fitzgerald, J. Kerouac, A. Bloom). The subject of research is Spenglerian cultural concepts which appeared most relevant for the Americans and the ideological premises of the transfer of cultural concepts. The methodology applied in the article is one of the modern modifications of the comparative method - the study of cultural transfer (cultural movements of ideas and concepts and their consequent incorporation into the new culture). The beginning of Spengler's influence on Fitzgerald dates back to The Great Gatsby. The attention is drawn to the fact that the title characters of the last two unfinished novels of the writer can be viewed as Faustian men at the beginning and end of the historical cycle respectively. Jack Kerouac belonged to the generation of"beatniks". The very word "beat" goes back to the English translation of "cosmic rhythm," the concept critically important for the worldview of Spengler. Kerouac developed the themes foregrounded by the German philosopher: the stupefying and destructive influence of the city on modern man, the phenomenon of alienation, the opposition of the intellect to real existence, the incomprehensibility of the concept of time, the meaning of memory, the insatiable desire of the Faustian man to move forward and to better oneself. Kerouac's reinterpretation of the concept of"fellaheen" is analyzed; an assumption is made about the influence of Spengler's ideas on the poetics of "spontaneous prose". The general tendency of the American sociologist and philosopher Alan Bloom, whose famous book The Closing of the American Mind (1987) became the first sign of "cultural wars" in the USA, also fits into the Spengler paradigm. Bloom's role in the intellectual life of the United States at the late 2oth century is found very similar to what Spengler was for Germany of his time. Each of the three figures in question became exponents of generational cultural transformations ("the lost generation", "beat-generation", and the generation of "cultural wars"), which confirms the recurrent consonance of Spengler's ideas to periods of paradigmatic cultural shifts. Conclusions made can be implemented for study and research of the 2oth century USA culture and its relationship with European intellectual tradition.

AB  - For Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data, Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a radiative skin temperature that is measured in the direction of the atmosphere to the ground. This data has been used several times in climatological and environmental studies. The tropical rainforest is one of valuable area on this earth that is need to be protected. It exhibits high levels of biodiversity and habitat of animal and plant species on the planet. In Thailand, a tropical rainforest can be found in Hala-Bala where is situated at the boundary of Thai-Malaysia. In mathematical analysis, cubic spline is an approximation function. It gives smooth and flexible way of fitting non linear models, while Generalized Estimate Equation (GEE) is statistical method of parameter estimation for the correlated data from longitudinal studies at different points in time. The purpose of this study was to analyze the data of LST by using cubic spline and GEE to perceive trend and variation at Hala-Bala in Narathiwat, Southern Thailand during 2002-2017. LST data were recorded by MODIS, an important data resource provided efficiency information relating to the Earth, between 2002 and 2017. The result of cubic spline showed that it was fitted quite well on pattern of LST data. The LST has increased statistically significant around the center pixel. GEE showed that LST trends had changed with statistically significant over 15 years.

The output of these sensors will be a digital image which represents the scene being perceived. In order to extract the useful information from these images, various image processing techniques need to be employed. In this paper, a detailed outline of the steps and various techniques used for detecting the changes in multi temporal remote sensing images is discussed and a case study is done by taking multi-temporal Landsat-8 images covering Hyderabad city. Image differencing method is applied in order to find the changes in the Hyderabad city limits over 2013December and 2017 December time periods.

TI  - Diarrhea Patterns and Climate: A Spatiotemporal Bayesian Hierarchical Analysis of Diarrheal Disease in Afghanistan
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Subject to a high burden of diarrheal diseases, Afghanistan is also susceptible to climate change. This study investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of diarrheal disease in the country and how associated it is with climate variables. Using monthly aggregated new cases of acute diarrhea reported between 2010 and 2016 and monthly averaged climate data at the district level, we fitted a hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal statisticalmodel. We foundaridity and mean daily temperature were positively associatedwith diarrhea incidence; every 1 degrees C increase inmean daily temperature and 0.01-unit change in the aridity index were associated with a 0.70% (CI: 0.67%, 0.73%) increase and a 4.79% (CI: 4.30%, 5.26%) increase in the risk of diarrhea, respectively. Average annual temperature, on the other hand, was negatively associated, with a 3.7% (CI: 3.74%, 3.68) decrease in risk for every degree Celsius increase in annual average temperature. Temporally, most districts exhibited similar seasonal trends, with incidence peaking in summer, except for the eastern regionwhere differences in climate patterns and population density may be associated with high rates of diarrhea throughout the year. The results from this study highlight the significant role of climate in shaping diarrheal patterns in Afghanistan, allowing policy makers to account for potential impacts of climate change in their public health assessments.

TI  - Methods to Retrieve the Cloud-Top Height in the Frame of the JEM-EUSO Mission
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Japanese Experiment Module-Extreme Universe Space Observatory (JEM-EUSO) telescope will measure ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray properties by detecting the UV fluorescence light generated in the interaction between cosmic rays and the atmosphere. Therefore, information on the state of clouds in the atmosphere is crucial for a proper interpretation of the data. For a real-time observation of the clouds in the telescope field of view, the JEM-EUSO will use an atmospheric monitoring system composed of a light detection and ranging and an infrared (IR) camera. In this paper, the focus is on the IR camera data. To retrieve the cloud-top height (CTH) from IR images, three different methods are considered here. The first one is based on bispectral stereo vision algorithms and requires two different views of the same scene in different spectral bands. For the second one, brightness temperatures provided by the IR camera are converted to effective cloud-top temperatures, from which the CTH is estimated using the vertical temperature profiles. A third method that uses the primary numerical weather prediction model output parameters, such as the cloud fraction, has also been considered to retrieve the CTH. This paper presents a first analysis, in which the heights retrieved by these three methodologies are compared with the heights given by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor installed on the polar satellite Terra. Since all these methods are suitable for the JEM-EUSO mission, they could be used in the future in a complementary way to improve the accuracy of the CTH retrieval.

TI  - Revealing the User Behavior Pattern Using HNCORS RTK Location Big Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hunan continuously operating reference station network is one of the most important infrastructures of the regional geospatial datum in Hunan province, China. It provides the official 24-h RTK service to the public. How to reveal the user behavior pattern by spatio-temporal analysis on location-based big data is significant for the service promotion. With procedures, such as cleaning, sampling, and so on, the usage count, fixing rate, and network delay data from August 2017 to July 2018 are first analyzed on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The results show that user behavior is strongly correlated to the surveying field work habits. Overall, the usage count is much more in the central and eastern, developed, and plain or hill area, while it is less in the western, underdeveloped, mountain and lake area. The suburbs are the most popular area. The usage count is also correlated to the local economic profile. Meanwhile, the Huaihua and Shaoyang cities need to be paid more attention to promotions. The hot spots revolution in 24 h can be divided into six stages as sleeping, recovery, first and second busy stages, adjustment, and dormancy when the hot spot successively increased and decreased around the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan urban agglomeration and other 11 urban centers in the Hunan province.

TI  - The Study of Discrimination of Remotely Sensed Data for Designing the Separation Technique between Cassava and Sugarcane Farmland

AB  - Cassava and sugarcane are the most important agricultural crops in Thailand. The cultivations of those are similarly in crop season, natural resources, and climate. For decades, the farmers usually switch their plant depending on unit price and government subsidy. The use of remote sensing data for monitoring change in farmland has encountered a problem on the similarity of vegetation index and the seasonal variation. In this work, we investigate the significant differences between cassava and sugarcane plantation by using satellite data from two sensors systems (Optical and SAR sensor) from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. The result of the sampling fields of cassava shows the fluctuation of the growth and the mean of SAVI is slightly lower than sugarcane at the same age. SAVI values over the cassava farmland seem to approach the homogeneity of sugarcane when the age of more than 11 months. Thus, the difference between cassava and sugarcane farmland using this method should be investigated on the growth stage of the age between 4-9 months. For SAR polarization, the VV, VH of SAR backscatters have little difference in cassava and sugarcane. When compare the backscatters value of VV and VH from cassava and sugarcane, the sigma0 values in dB show that VV backscatters have a higher signal return. The variation of VH polarization of cassava and sugarcane seem difficult to identify due to the diversity of signal targets. Therefore, by using SAR data, the detection of the difference between cassava and sugarcane should be considered after working on time series techniques for crop seasoning to remove unwanted objects until only cassava and sugarcane remain. From the results, we also found that the parcel-based method is a better processing approach to separate cassava from sugarcane compared to pixel-based, and it requires descriptive statistics to distinguish between cassava and sugarcane at each age. This method requires the information of two agricultural plantations boundaries. The possible handling process when harvesting and preparation of the plantation are by observing time-related over an area to determine the boundary of the farmland. Therefore, the discrimination of remotely sensed data for designing the decomposition technique between cassava and sugarcane farmland is necessary because of the specificity of cultivation in Thailand.

AB  - The China-France Oceangraphy SATellite (CFOSAT) is an innovative satellite mission with wind and waves measurements on oceans. This paper aims to evaluate the first results of the assimilation of the wave data provided by CFOSAT in the wave model MFWAM. Model runs are implemented during the Calibration/Validation phase of the mission. The results are compared to the wave data from altimeters and buoys. The first results are promising and indicate a significant improvement of wave heights in the different ocean basins (high latitudes, intermediate latitudes and the tropics). Azimuthal cut-off sensitivity tests for the SWIM wave spectra are also examined in this study. We also discussed the impact of combined wave spectra and the ones from the incidence angles of SWIM (6, 8 and 10 degrees). In other respects this study also investigate the complementary use of SWIM and SAR from CFOSAT and SAR from Sentinel-1 for combined assimilation in the wave model MFWAM

AB  - The relevance of the study has arisen because the environmental crisis that arose in the second half of the twentieth century is acquiring more and more global nature and the risk of irreversibility of its consequences increases. Overcoming this crisis, preventing or overcoming its negative consequences is possible only through the efforts of the entire human civilization, the development of which should receive a humanistic and environmentally friendly orientation. The formation of a new worldview and ecological culture of both each individual and the human community as a whole, which can be carried out most effectively in the process of environmental education, becomes relevant. The study purpose: this article aims at analyzing various approaches to the formation of ecological culture, factors and conditions of its formation effectiveness. The study results: It establishes that ecological culture is a humanistic culture of human interaction with the biosphere and the socio-sphere, aimed at preserving and restoring the environment and creating the noosphere. The features of modern environmental education are in its development based on the noosphere concept and the concept of sustainable development. The main factors of increasing the effectiveness of ecological culture formation at the cognitive, reflexive-value and activity-based levels of environmental education are identified. The main conditions for the effectiveness of environmental culture formation are the increasing of environmental education importance and the dynamic interaction of its subjects. Practical significance: The materials of the article are of theoretical and practical value for the development of educational and methodical complexes on ecology and ecological pedagogy, teacher training and retraining programs, as well as programs aimed at the formation of new environmentally friendly ideological and value attitudes and behavioral skills of students.

TI  - Advances in Snow Hydrology Using a Combined Approach of GNSS In Situ Stations, Hydrological Modelling and Earth Observation-A Case Study in Canada
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of in situ snow water equivalent (SWE), snowmelt and run-off measurements is still very limited especially in remote areas as the density of operational stations and field observations is often scarce and usually costly, labour-intense and/or risky. With remote sensing products, spatially distributed information on snow is potentially available, but often lacks the required spatial or temporal requirements for hydrological applications. For the assurance of a high spatial and temporal resolution, however, it is often necessary to combine several methods like Earth Observation (EO), modelling and in situ approaches. Such a combination was targeted within the business applications demonstration project SnowSense (2015-2018), co-funded by the European Space Agency (ESA), where we designed, developed and demonstrated an operational snow hydrological service. During the run-time of the project, the entire service was demonstrated for the island of Newfoundland, Canada. The SnowSense service, developed during the demonstration project, is based on three pillars, including (i) newly developed in situ snow monitoring stations based on signals of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS); (ii) EO snow cover products on the snow cover extent and on information whether the snow is dry or wet; and (iii) an integrated physically based hydrological model. The key element of the service is the novel GNSS based in situ sensor, using two static low-cost antennas with one being mounted on the ground and the other one above the snow cover. This sensor setup enables retrieving the snow parameters SWE and liquid water content (LWC) in the snowpack in parallel, using GNSS carrier phase measurements and signal strength information. With the combined approach of the SnowSense service, it is possible to provide spatially distributed SWE to assess run-off and to provide relevant information for hydropower plant management in a high spatial and temporal resolution. This is particularly needed for so far non, or only sparsely equipped catchments in remote areas. We present the results and validation of (i) the GNSS in situ sensor setup for SWE and LWC measurements at the well-equipped study site Foret Montmorency near Quebec, Canada and (ii) the entire combined in situ, EO and modelling SnowSense service resulting in assimilated SWE maps and run-off information for two different large catchments in Newfoundland, Canada.

Audible representation of multi-dimensional meteorological data layered wind direction and speed data derived from Earth observation satellite data is developed. Experimental results show rapidly changing meteorological data can be listened with the different musical scale (melody), harmony, rhythm and music instrument types. More importantly, weather analysts may much easily be aware of the inversely proportional relation between altitude and air temperature by hearing the multi-dimensional meteorological data.

AB  - Tin Tarabine is located in Central Hoggar, at the junction of three terranes of different geological and tectonic histories. The late Pan-African E-W compression produced in the Tuareg shield N-S trending folds linked to mega-systems of shear belts and strike-slip faults which dissect the Tuareg shield into N-S trending branches and blocks of many hundred kilometers lateral displacements. Remote sensing has been used to define the Pan-African deformation. Various treatments such as Contrast-enhanced Red-Green-Blue (RGB) composites, Principal Component Analysis, Band Ratios and Directional Filters have been applied on Landsat 8 OLI Satellite images of Tin Tarabine region. The aim of this study is to highlight the impact of major shear-zones on the region of study. The structural mapping has allowed us to identify and characterize their structural expression. Most of the structures found include faults, folds and lineaments with the highest lineaments densities obtained being mainly oriented NNE-SSW, NE-SW, NW-SE and N-S. We consider that during the final compressive phase the unquantified E-W shortening may have been absorbed by lateral movements along shear zones with a main sinistral component.

AB  - This study examines contribution of brick kiln (BK) industry to PM2.5 emission over northern part of India. We analyze NASA's MODIS and JAXA's GCOM-C/SGLI land-atmospheric products with 3887 BK locations over the region in the period of the highest PM2.5 concentration during December 2016 to February 2017. Our preliminary results show that more than 60% of BK occupied silt-rich areas, with more than 80% of them were located over croplands on the outskirts of urban areas, indicating proxies for PM2.5 emission over Northern India. Initial WRF-Chem model simulations showed prominent diurnal variation of the pollutant with averaged peak concentration exceeding 1 mu g/m(3) over the capital city of New Delhi. Future works will introduce the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform for identifying BK locations and incorporate them into the model to improve the simulation results.

AB  - This article explores the perceptions about health-illness and death of an Embera Chami mother, a Colombian indigenous woman who experienced the illness of one of her children. The research was carried out through a qualitative interpretative type case study with an ethnographic approach. The data analysis was classified by categories and subcategories structuring the information in this way. Mother Embera Chami's perception of the concept of health, illness and death, are constructs formed through her experiences with a child with cancer, cultural beliefs, Western medicine and the process of Acculturation of her community. The present work as health professionals allowed an enriching cultural approach identifying the cultural diversity of patients in the Colombian context to which they are confronted, customs and worldview, the need to apply cross-cultural care and palliative care as an essential part of the attention of patients with chronic diseases. Understanding the situation of the other helps to broaden the perspectives of management regarding care by reaching cultural agreements that benefit the health of the indigenous population.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) content was determined in eggshells of Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis L. 1766). Samples were collected during breeding season (february, march, april) on southern coast of Cariaco Gulf, state of Sucre, Venezuela. Samples were then analyzed for total Hg concentrations using thermal decomposition, amalgamation/atomic absorption spectrophotometry (TDA/AAS). Levels mercury no showed significant differences between months (february: 0,02693[plus or minus]0,003179 mg.kg-1 april: 0,02598[plus or minus]0,003777 mg.kg-1 march, 0,02314[plus or minus]0,002174 mg.kg-1); and these values do not exceed standard levels established in aquatic biota. Nonetheless this marine seabird can serve as a bio-sentinel of environmental contamination for Hg and other heavy metals due to its abundance and the fact that it is located at the top of food chain in this important fishing, ecological and touristic marine area.

TI  - The atheism in the worldview of Karl Marx and antitheologism in anarchocollektivism of M. A. Bakunin

M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a comparative analysis of the atheistic views of Marx and Bakunin. The German philosopher and the Russian anarchist in his youth belonged to this philosophical movement as ladegerate (left Hegelianism). Hegel's dialectics revolutionarily stimulated the thinkers of German, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Italian and other nations. The inevitable was the split among Hegel's followers on the issue of further trends in historical development. It was the German left Hegelians who started discussing the religious problem. The call of left Hegelians to the philosophy of practical actions have inspired many thinkers, including Feuerbach, Marx, Bakunin, to reconsider the Hegelian philosophy. The atheism of Marx developed on the basis of the study of the materialist doctrines of Epicurus and of Democritus, and anti-theologism Bakunin relied on his understanding of the Church as a tool of autocratic rule. For Marx, atheism had a worldview value, for Bakunin it was a practical task. If in his materialistic philosophy, which was developed in the post-Hegelian period, Marx proceeded in theoretical positions from the category of "alienation", in the early period of his philosophical creativity, the main category was the will. In the further Marx concludes that the elimination of religious alienation involves the abolition of economic alienation. Bakunin's ideal of anarchy as an absence of power suggests other social ties, rather than power, force, control, hierarchy, etc. It is the strongest spiritual and moral basis of common life. This is the existence of a free person in a free society, the reverse side of which is the responsibility of the individual.

AB  - Monitoring variations in the spectral reflectance of thermal bands of Landsat data provide land surface temperature information of earth's surface features. This research tried to examine the variations of Land surface temperature (LST) from 1987 to 2017 at the Gomishan district and its soundings in Iran. Images preprocessing was conducted including the geo-shifting and atmospheric correction. NDVI and LST maps and their change map using a change detection technique were generated. Basic inferential statistics and spatial analysis were performed. The results show that LST mean reached approximately 42.5 degrees C with 9 degrees C increase, while it was 33.8 degrees C in 1987. However, comparing the statistical analysis of NDVI data did not show any differences between the two study dates. Land cover classes include water, urban, and rural covered areas had the lowest LST shifts between the two study periods. The LST of rangelands, wetlands, and bare lands with more than 10 degrees C increase have experienced considerable LST shifts between during the study periods. Interestingly, some parts of wetland areas had the highest increase approximately 13 degrees C from 1987 to 2017. This study emphasized that LST change detection approach and spatial analysis can be used successfully in LST monitoring investigations. The results can be used to identify regions that experienced LST shifts (change or no change) and also to identify the most critical and impacted areas. The obtained results can be used effectively in sustainable natural disastermanagement plans.

AB  - Literature widely recognize the strong influence of urban green areas in the microclimatic regulation and its potential to mitigate warming in cities. To promote viable actions to climate change adaptation for cities through vegetation and therefore help to palliate the urban heat island effect (UHI) and to reduce health risk during extreme heat episodes requires accurate criteria for each context in its different scales. This study presents a multi-scale approach to quantify the influence of urban green spaces at two different scales: global (Barcelona Metro Area) and detailed (studying the environments of seven specific parks) in the urban continuum of the cities of Gava, Viladecans and Castelldefels. For this purpose, Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 data imagery are analyzed. The study confirms the significance of the NDVI to moderate the LST, as well as the intensity and extent of the cooling effect of the parks. In conclusion, the models and methods applied in this study suggest effective planning measures to moderate UHI.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments IV held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - The study of urban heat islands (UHI) is of great importance in the context of climate change (CC). The use of satellite images has helped considerably to understand UHI, especially in analyses of land surface temperature (LST). However, available sensors have a major limitation: their low spatial resolution (100 meters, Landsat; 1000 meters, MODIS) does not allow detailed analysis of UHI. Moreover, most remote sensors are limited to daytime data collection, while UHI mainly appear during the night. The images provided by satellites that study nocturnal thermal radiation, such as MODIS, have very low spatial resolution. There is abundant literature about the fusion of images from several satellites and sensors, especially information from MODIS and Landsat. However, most of these studies have concentrated on studying the combination of congruent images in the temporal plane, to extrapolate the results obtained to other temporal instances for which there is no detailed information. In general, few studies have focused on increasing the resolution of thermal images beyond the 100 meters/pixel of Landsat.The objective of this paper is to combine information from various sensors (Modis, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2) by constructing a set of OLS models of daytime and nighttime LST. These models provide a detailed view of daytime UHI (10 meters) and a robust evaluation of the range of cooling produced during the night. A modelling exercise at 1 meter/pixel of resolution has also been developed, using information from more detailed sensors installed on aircraft in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area.

T2  - CYBERGEO-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the risk space of wildfires in the forest of the province of El Tarf (North-East of Algeria). Wildfires have been a nation-wide concern for more than a decade, and the various actions taken to prevent and suppress them did not result in a significant drop both in their number or the decrease of the burnt area. As measures of punctual treatment of the visible symptoms of wildfires had reached their limits, this research aims at designing new forms of operational maps to be used for the management of forest lands in order to reduce the number and the impact of wildfires. Earth observation satellite data associated with different types of forest fire information, once integrated into a geographic information system, are reliable to identify risky areas and to map the extent of wildfires. The geographical database compiled in this work is an extremely useful tool for understanding and monitoring wildfires and will provide managers and decision takers with valid arguments to justify their decisions.

AB  - In the present article different methods and techniques were applied for the generation and characterization of thematic information in a sector of the province of Chaco (Argentina). Using the calculation of the Tasseled Cap Transformation, the variables of brightness, greenness and humidity were calculated. In addition, a supervised classification was applied through support vector machines (SVM) and then the classification accuracy was estimated.According to the criteria of brightness, greenness and humidity, land cover classes were characterized using methods of superposition and statistical summary with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The application of this methodology presented a potential to identify and explain the behavior of the mapped land cover classes.

AB  - In this work, we have extended a procedure for the spatial decorrelation of fully developed speckle, originally developed for single-polarization SAR data, to fully-polarimetric SAR data. Assuming that the SAR processor is the same for all the polarimetric channels, the noise-whitening procedure can be performed applying the decorrelation stage to each channel, separately. Equivalently, the noise-whitening stage is applied to each element of the scattering matrix, before any multilooking operation, either coherent or not, is performed. In order to evaluate the impact of speckle decorrelation on the performance of classical polarimetric despeckling fiters, we make use of simulated PolSAR data. We optionally introduce a spatial correlation of the noise in the simulated data by means of a 2D separable Hamming window; then we remove such a correlation by using the whitening procedure and compare the despeckling performance for the three following cases: uncorrelated, correlated, and whitened correlated SLC images. Simulation results show a steady improvement of performance scores, e.g., ENL, which are better after decorrelation than those measured with correlated noise and closely attain those of the uncorrelated case. Also, qualitative results on a true RADARSAT-2 image confirm the trend of the simulated data.

AB  - Several tasks of remote sensing entail the measurement of the similarity/dissimilarity of a test multiband image to a reference multiband image. To this purpose, several indices has been developed over the last two decades. The most widely used indices are normalized to avoid dependence on the data format. In this work, we will focus on such indices and provide a novel insight on their behaviors. Spectral indices are those performing crossed measurements between couple of different bands of the test and reference image. Wherever crossed measurements do not occur, the index is purely spatial, or better radiometric. Both theoretical insights and simulations performed on a GeoEye dataset, with the products of twelve pansharpening methods, show that their performance ranking does not depend on the data format for purely radiometric indices, while it significantly depends on the data format, either spectral radiance or digital numbers (DN), for a purely spectral index, like the spectral angle mapper (SAM). The dependence on the data format is weak for indices that balance the spectral and radiometric similarity, like the family of indices, Q2(n), based on hypercomplex algebra.

AB  - Coral reefs are referred to as "tropical rainforests of the sea" to provide for richness of biological diversity. However, coral reefs are seriously degrading for global warming effects. Mapping coral reefs is important to spatially interpret the current coral distribution. Now, coral reefs mapping is generally created by visual interpretation with aerial photos in Japan. For effectively mapping coral reefs cover, the study is to understand availability if satellite-based remote sensing technique is able to be substituted in the near future. The paper introduces how to map coral reefs distribution by aerial photo-based visual interpretation and satellite-based analytical process. The result by satellite data is evaluated with the ground truth data and the visible interpretation method. In the error matrix utilizing 73 ground survey points, the overall accuracy was achieved 78%, which indicated similar trend with the ground truth. In error matrix with rasterized visible interpretation map, the overall accuracy was 55%. The reason is why "less than 5% Coral cover on Sand and Rock bottom" and "5-50% Coral cover" were caused misclassification in the offshore. However, the inshore area in the analytical result is able to detail coral structure, and the satellite image was able to penetrate deeper by the water column correction. Therefore, satellite-based remote sensing is appreciable to apply for the coral reefs mapping. In the future, we need to consider the classification class types and pro-processing to achieve higher accuracy.

AB  - A semi-analytical technique for both the design and control of repeat ground-track (RGT) orbits in a high fidelity dynamical model, including non-conservative forces and accurate Earth orientation parameters, is introduced. The method is based on the use of high-order expansion of Poincare maps to propagate forward in time regions of the phase space for one, or more, repeat cycles. This map provides the means to efficiently study the effect that an impulse, applied at the Poincare section crossing, produces on the ground-track pattern, thus enabling highly accurate design and control. The approach is applied to the design and control of missions like TerraSAR-X, Landsat-8, SPOT-7, IRS-P6, and UoSAT-12.

AB  - Several water index-based methods have been proposed in the literature, which, combine satellite multispectral bands in an algebraic expression. The objective of these water index-based methods is to increase the intensity contrast between water-pixels (surface water-body) and non-water pixels (built-up, soil, vegetation, etc.). The present investigation evaluates the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and the Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) using the Satellite data from Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A at different time scenes. Based on visual inspection of the Lake Metztitlan water body mapping results, a high performance of AWEI approached via the OLI and the MSI sensors is observed. In the selected study area of [9210x9380]m, a statistical water pixel percentage of 30.703616% is observed in a flooding season and 9.884537% for a dry season of the year.

AB  - Global land cover maps are important sources of information for a wide range of studies including land change analysis and climate change research. While the global land cover maps attempt to present a consistent and homogenous data in terms of the production process, the existing datasets offer coarse resolution data, e.g. 1000 m for IGBP DISCover and 300 m for GlobeCover 2009 that is oftentimes challenging. Recently, GlobeLand30 data based on Landsat archive for two timestamps of 2000 and 2010 has been released. It presents a finer spatial resolution of 30 m, which provides numerous opportunities for a wide range of studies. The main objective of this study is to use this dataset for characterizing global land cover patterns, monitoring, and identifying extreme land change cases with their types and magnitude. The findings reveal massive land change patterns including deforestation, desertification, shrinkage of water bodies, and urbanization across the globe. The results and discussions of this research can help policy-makers, environmental planners, ecosystem services providers and climate change researchers to gain finer insights about the forms of global land change. Future research calls for further investigation of the underlying causes of the massive changes and their consequences on our ecosystems and human populations.

AB  - In this paper, we present newly established webcam monitoring system in Finland for monitoring and phenology and snow cover. Main motivation of this work is to facilitate Earth Observation (EO) systems by providing time-series of field observation for calibration and validation, as well as to improve the assessment of ecosystem services. Images have been used in phenological analyses of birches along a latitudinal gradient across Finland, snow cover and compared to greenhouse gas fluxes on Scots pine and wetland ecosystems. Finnish Meteorological Institute image PROcessing Toolbox (FMIPROT) is developed to analyse the images for the extraction of environmental data. The Images from the camera network, producing a continuous image series in Finland, are used in the analysis of Fractional Snow Cover (FSC). Another camera network, producing continuous image series in the SPICE site, Sodankyla, Finland, is used for the analysis of Snow Depth (SD). SPICE (Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment) is a WMO/CIMO multi-sites intercomparison of instruments and systems of observation for the measurement of solid precipitation. Analyses are done using the FMIPROT. We discuss on estimation of FSC and SD using digital imagery and utilizing the digital imagery to complement FSC and SD retrieval algorithms from remote sensing data and/or to validate Earth-observed FSC and SD introducing MONIMET camera network and FMIPROT. We also tested this method in mountain region, the Careser Dam (at an altitude of 2600 m a.s.l.), in Trentino's Region (Italy) in the south-eastern part of the Ortles-Cevedale massif the largest glacierised mountain group of the Italian Alps.

AB  - The First World War was a global turning point in world history. Understanding the experience of the war, proposed by Ernst Ringer, was a heroic chronicle of the fighting, describing the exploits and everyday life of hostilities and is a clear indication of the experiences of war. Ernst Ringer acted as a seismograph of the war, capable of identifying the special features of the new war and their influence on the transformation of the soldier's worldview in the context of hostilities.The purpose of the article is to examine the influence of military experiences on the worldview of the military generation on the example of thinking about the war of Ernst Ringer. Sources of research were the works of Ernst Ringer on the First World War, his military diaries. The specifics of understanding the First World War in Germany was associated with the process of identifying participants in the war after its completion. The clash of the military and the revolutionary generation led to the condemnation of war as a phenomenon and leveling the significance of the activities of its participants. Ernst Ringer in his writings on the war, including the famous book "In Steel Thunderstorms", interprets war as not only destructive force, but also a creative phenomenon that shaped new values and forged character. Junger notes the key feature of the war - the role of technology in battles, which erases the value of the individual aspirations of soldiers. However, despite the technical face of the war, he claims that the resilience of the troops depended on the courage of the soldiers sitting in the trenches. Military experience has formed among the soldiers the values of front-line brotherhood based on loyalty, self-sacrifice, perseverance. A distinctive feature of the generation of the First World War, he considers determination and readiness for action, which the burghers lack. In his picture of war, there are no anti-war and pacifist elements, which he interpreted as manifestations of weakness. E. Ringer does not consider the military generation to be a "lost generation", seeing in it a willingness and determination to change the world on the basis of the values of duty and service. E. Ringer discourse on the military generation, inscribed in the intellectual direction of the conservative revolution in Germany, served not only to criticize the revolutionary Weimar Republic, but also acted as a guide to the formation of the future German state.An important role of observation E. Ringer played in the understanding of the image of a man in a war, the analysis of the everyday life of hostilities. Understanding of the military experiences, outlined by E. Ringer, made a significant contribution to the understanding of the military generation of the First World War.

AB  - Although field monitoring can provide an accurate measurement of pollution, these measurements are of a limited spatial coverage. On the contrary, satellite-based observations can provide Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products with higher spatial resolution and continuous spatial coverage; however these products cannot directly measure the pollution concentration. In this study, the potential of a Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors was investigated to evaluate the air quality parameters, after which water consumption in the studied area was considered. For this purpose, linear regression analysis was used in order to develop a relationship among MODIS-AOD, metrological data (relative humidity, temperature, precipitation, and wind speed) and air pollution data (CO, O-3, NO2, SO2, PM2.5) gathered 22 monitoring stations from 2012 to 2016. Among the 5 years of pollution data collection, the period of 2012 to 2014 was used for the model calibration and the period of 2015 to 2016 was used for the validation of the model. The results indicated that the regression models were of the best performance during spring (R-2 = 0.901 for CO), moderate performance during winter (R-2 = 0.674 for CO) and autumn (R-2 = 0.694 for CO), and weak performance during summer (R-2 = 0.181 for SO2). The results of the validation process also showed that the maximum determination factor (R-2 = 0.83) was obtained during spring season and for PM2.5 and the least (R-2 = 0.18) was obtained during summer and for SO2. Meanwhile, the assessment of water consumption demonstrated that there is significant relationship between water consumption and the concentration of pollution parameters.

AB  - Reinforced slope dynamics can be studied using the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering analysis. This study provides the results of the InSAR analysis obtained from the reinforced slope monitoring by ALOS-2/PALSAR2. The vertical displacement values from the GEONET and the Line-of-Sight InSAR analysis have been compared. Correct InSAR image pair selection is of primary importance if the Line-of-Sight image error to be reduced. Recurrent field surveys are necessary to find the link between the InSAR analysis results and the reinforced slope dynamics.

AB  - There are more than 5 hundred thousand places with landslide risk in Japan. Especially in recent years, we have been experiencing more and more damages by large-scale landslide by heavy and short-term rain in spot areas, which is caused due probably to the global warming influence. The detection of landslide occurrence beforehand is one of the social problems, but it is thought very hard to solve due to the required accuracy, say millimeter-level, and its cost. The Real Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is applicable to this measurement from the viewpoint of accuracy. It needs, however, the expensive reference station placed near from RTK positioning sensors, say within several hundred meters, to maintain the millimeter positioning accuracy which easily degrades proportionally to the distance among them. This system therefore thought rather unpromising to this application. Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) [1] has a positioning augmentation service named Centimeter Level Augmentation Service (CLAS) [2] which is expected to become a candidate for this application. The service is free of charge, no reference station is needed, and many sensors can be placed in a larger area with a stand-alone configuration with no location-dependent degradation of accuracy. In order to utilize CLAS, however, we must firstly overcome the accuracy problem. Under these circumstances, we studied how to utilize CLAS and its dedicated receiver technology, Real-Time Kinematic Precise Point Positioning (PPP-RTK) [3], to the land slide proactive measurement. QZSS also provides the technical demonstration service of Multi-GNSS Advanced Demonstration tool for Orbit and Clock Analysis (MADOCA) [4]. This paper describes; a) our paid attention to the measured data with centimeter-level accuracy taken by PPP-RTK from the viewpoint of "frequency components aggregate", b) the development of purely mathematical method which expands the original data into orthogonal polynomial and applies the high pass filter technique to retrieve the occurrence timing of millimeter-level displacement which is embedded in the original data, and c) how to obtain the displacement value with a sufficiently accuracy, after having the occurrence timing.

AB  - In this work, a novel approach to water segmentation of Synthetic Aperture Radar images is presented. The proposed methodology, suitable for any VV-VH dual-pol data source, it is based only on the statistical and morphological content of the two polarimetric channels. No external information or supervision is required to successfully complete the segmentation task, allowing a complete automation of the process. The methodology has been applied to Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide-Swath data and validated using very high-resolution optical images acquired by an Unmanned Aerial System over two Italian rivers, during different seasons. The performances of the algorithm have been estimated carrying out a pixel-based validation, deriving from the binary confusion matrix two classical figures of merit such as Global accuracy and F1-score. In the validation procedure, it has been assessed an overall Global Accuracy of 0.92 and an overall F1-score of 0.81, suggesting that the presented methodology applied to S-1 data is well-suited for the monitoring of rivers characterized by a wet channel width greater than 60 m.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed enormous growth in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) and sensor technology which made it possible to collect high spatial and temporal resolutions data over the crops throughout the growing season. The objective of this research is to develop a novel machine learning framework for marketable tomato yield estimation using multi-source and spatio-temporal remote sensing data collected from UAS. The proposed machine learning model is based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and it takes UAS based multi-temporal features such as canopy cover, canopy height, canopy volume, Excessive Greenness Index along with weather information such as humidity, precipitation, temperature, solar radiations and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) as input and predicts the corresponding marketable yield. The predicted yield is validated using the actual harvested yield. Breeders may be able to use the predicted yield as a parameter for genotype selection so that they can not only increase their experiment size for faster genotype selection but also to make efficient and informed decision on best performing genotypes. Moreover, yield prediction maps can be used to develop within-field management zones to optimize field management practices.

TI  - Landscape Transformations in Rapidly Developing Peri-urban Areas of Accra, Ghana: Results of 30 years
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Beyond the loss of peri-urban agricultural and forested land as a result of built-up expansion, not much information exists on the changes in the structure of the pen-urban landscape in Ghana. The aim of this paper is to examine the extent to which urban expansion is driving changes in landscape structure of the pen-urban fringes of Accra. We submit that rapid peri-urbanisation will fragment the existing agricultural and forested landscape with consequent ecological, socio-economic and urban governance implications. Using Landsat satellite images for the years 1985, 1991, 2002 and 2015 the study area was classified into four land cover classes. The study adopted the use of Urban Intensity Index (UII) and the Annual Rate of Urbanization (R) as measures of urbanization. Edge density (ED), largest patch index (LPI) and Aggregation index (AI) were used as proxies to measure landscape structural transformations. The study reveals substantial reductions and fragmentation in agricultural lands, riverine and open forests, while there has been over 200 percent increase in built-up areas. Beyond these revelations in spatiotemporal changes in landscape structure, the paper points to the ecological implications of the changes, and three key socio-economic and urban governance implications.

TI  - Assessing Land Cover Changes and CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions in Tropical Forests, 1998-2016: A Case Study of the Sungai Wain Protection Forest
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests have long been known for being home to a huge biodiversity of plants, animals and microbes. Nevertheless, one of the most dangerous threats to the existence of tropical forests is fire. Fire in tropical forests does not only devastate the forest structure and biodiversity, but it also releases huge amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere. This study aims to observe land cover changes in the Sungai Wain Protection Forest (SWPF) via Landsat multitemporal data from 1998 to 2016 and to calculate their resulting emissions. The findings showed that the total area affected by forest fire during this period was 6,400 ha, which amounts to 5,000 and 1,400 ha of lost forest in 1998 and 2015, respectively. The potential of CO2 emissions due to aboveground biomass (AGB) loss was 4.66 Tg during that period. This study also showed that SWPF was able to recover naturally after the 1998 fire. Fires in 2015 mostly occured in regenerating forests, implying that it is more flammable than primary forests. As an implication, the fire phenomenon is still threatening the SWPF because it has potential value to cut down succession from regenerating to primary forests.

TI  - Investigating Subsidence in the Bursa Plain, Turkey, Using Ascending and Descending Sentinel-1 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We characterize and monitor subsidence of the Bursa Plain (southern Marmara region of Turkey), which has been interpreted as resulting from tectonic motions in the region. We quantify the subsidence using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series analysis. The Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers InSAR package (StaMPS) is employed to process series of Sentinel 1 A-B radar images acquired between 2014 and 2017 along both ascending and descending orbits. The vertical velocity field obtained after decomposition of line-of-sight velocity fields on the two tracks reveals that the Bursa plain is subsiding at rates up to 25 mm/yr. The most prominent subsidence signal in the basin forms an east-west elongated ellipse of deformation in the east, and is bounded by a Quaternary alluvial plain undergoing average vertical subsidence at similar to similar to 10 mm/yr. Another localized subsidence signal is located 5 km north of the city, following the Bursa alluvial fan, and is subsiding at velocities up to 25 mm/yr. The comparison between temporal variations of the subsiding surface displacements and variations of the water pressure head in the aquifer allows estimation of the compressibility of the aquifer, It falls in the range of0.tic5x10-6-2x10-6 Pa-1, which corresponds to typical values for clay and sand sediments. We find a clear correlation between subsidence patterns and the lithology, suggesting a strong lithological control over subsidence. In addition, the maximum rate of ground subsidence occurs where agricultural activity relies on groundwater exploitation. The InSAR time series within the observation period is well correlated with changes in the depth of the ground water. These observations indicate that the recent acceleration of subsidence is mainly due to anthropogenic activities rather than tectonic motion.

AB  - Remote sensing active systems which is represented by C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enhance features in mapping inundation of coastal areas of Jakarta that are free of clouds/shadows. This study was conducted to assess the dynamical inundation of coastal areas in Jakarta based on multi-temporal data of C-band SAR Sentinel 1A. Data was analyzed using In-SAR and Radar Polarization analysis. Data processing was performed using SNAP 6.0 and QGIS Las Palmas 2.18.15 software. The results of this study indicate that the backscatter coefficient of the surface water is about - 19dB. The polarization analysis shows the appearance of water bodies and surface water mixed with other objects that was blue and cyan colors. VH polarization analysis showed more detection than VV polarization analysis. Dual polarization analysis reveals inundation changes in certain areas such as coastal dikes, reservoirs, mangrove ecosystems and built-up land in temporally and spatially. This study demonstrates an ability of rapid assessment in monitoring coastal inundation of tropical urban areas using InSAR and Radar Polarization analysis.

AB  - Since launched in 2015, LAPAN-A3/IPB satellite has been collecting many images of the surface of the earth. These images were taken by multispectral imager carried by the satellite. However, these data are not completely utilized yet. Therefore, this paper presents the potential applications of LAPAN-A3/IPB satellite multispectral imager. Literature study has been being done to find the research using the data form other satellites where their payload is similar to LAPAN-A3/IPB satellite. Because of the multispectral imager of LAPAN-A3/IPB has four bands (red, green, blue, and nir-infrared), most of the applications found are the application based on vegetation indices. It is found that LAPAN-A3/IPB satellite data is possible to support green open space mapping in the city, assessing soil saline degradation, measuring colored dissolved organic matter absorption, predicting land use land cover change and its effect on soil erosion, asses protective role of coastal woody vegetation against tsunami, asses resource development footprints using remote sensing, detect lahar path, and monitor urban growth.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of the MSI Sentinel-2 and SRTM data to estimate the volume of wood in a Semidecidual Seasonal Forest. Regression equations were fitted based on the remote sensing data, taking into consideration the individual bands and vegetation index of the MSI, elevation values and their derivatives obtained from the SRTM mission and the combination of the data drawn from the MSI and SRTM. RMSE and graphic analysis of residues were used to assess the accuracy of the fitted equations. The best model revealed values of 0.6508 and RMSE of 20.41% in the fit, and of 0.5680 and RMSE of 26.61% in the validation, using the combined MSI and SRTM data as predictors. The volume estimation using spectral data showed satisfactory results, highlighting the importance of topography in the prediction of the volume of wood for the area under investigation.

AB  - The landslides are one of the well-known natural hazards occurring on the North East Black Sea coast of Bulgaria. The previous researches that take into account the geological and meteorological peculiarities of this region confirmed that the geomorphological conditions in this region are extremely favorable for landslide formation. Two are the main drivers that are being responsible for activation of the landslide processes in the area investigated. The first one is the sea erosion and the other is the increasing groundwater level. The influence of those is highly aggravated by the construction activities that took place in the last decades and the lack of sewerage networks. Those findings are based on information provided by the national authority responsible for monitoring and filing the landslides in Bulgaria. This was the motivation for developing and implementing reliable and accurate method for operational monitoring of the landslide processes in the said area. For development of such method data from SAR instruments were used. In this specific study data from Sentinel-1 SAR mission were processed by the freely provided by ESA SNAP software. Final results are interferometric images (IFIs) providing information about the ground movements.In this paper we present results reflecting the subsidence in the area of a landslide located some 20km north of the Albena resort. In the last decade two events have caused damages to the infrastructure in the area - one occurred in January 2015 which was attributed to the heavy rains the previous summer and the other took place in mid of August 2018. Both have been studied by processing SAR data for the periods mentioned. The results obtained are considered reliable since they have been reaffirmed by geodetic surveys and other terrain measurements. The outcomes of this research will contribute to better understanding the ongoing slow movements of the Earth's crust, and for forecasting and early warning of geological hazards.

AB  - Mapping of burned areas caused by forest fires was always a main concern to researchers in the field of remote sensing. Thus, various spectral indices and classification techniques have been proposed in the literature. In such a problem, only one specific class is of real interest and could be referred to as a one-class classification problem. One-class classification methods are highly desirable for quick mapping of classes of interest. A common used solution to deal with One-Class classification problem is based on oneclass support vector machine (OC-SVM). This method has proved useful in classification of remote sensing images. However, overfitting problem and difficulty in tuning parameters have become the major obstacles for this method. The new Presence and Background Learning (PBL) framework does not require complicated model selection and can generate very high accuracy results. On the other hand the Google Earth Engine (GEE) portal provides access to satellite and other ancillary data, cloud computing, and algorithms for processing large amounts of data with relative ease. Therefore, this study mainly aims to investigate the possibility of using the PBL framework within the GEE platform to extract burned areas from freely available Landsat archive in the year 2015. The quality of the results obtained using PBL framework was assessed using ground truth digitized by qualified technicians and compared to other classification techniques: Thresholding burned area spectral Index (BAI) and OC-SVM classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that PBL framework for mapping the burned areas shows the higher classification accuracy than the other classifiers, and it highlights the suitability for the cases with few positive labelled samples available, which facilitates the tedious work of manual digitizing.

TI  - Coastal accumulation of microplastic particles emitted from the Po River, Northern Italy: Comparing remote sensing and hydrodynamic modelling with <i>in situ</i> sample collections
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Microplastic research has mainly concentrated on open seas, while riverine plumes remain largely unexplored despite their hypothesized importance as a microplastic source to coastal waters. This work aimed to model coastal accumulation of microplastic particles (1-5 mm) emitted by the Po River over 1.5 years. We posit that river-induced microplastic accumulation on adjacent coasts can be predicted using (1) hydrodynamic-based and (2) remote sensing-based modelling. Model accumulation maps were validated against sampling at nine beaches, with sediment microplastic concentrations up to 78 particles/kg (dry weight). Hydrodynamic modelling revealed that discharged particle amount is only semi-coupled to beaching rates, which are strongly mouth dependent and occur within the first ten days. Remote sensing modelling was found to better capture river mouth relative strength, and accumulation patterns were found consistent with hydrodynamic modelling. This methodology lays groundwork for developing an operational monitoring system to assess microplastic pollution emitted by a major river.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Conference on Big Data Analysis and Deep Learning (ICBDL)
CL  - Miyazaki, JAPAN
AB  - Extracting environmental information accurately from remotely sensed images plays a vital role in policy planning, hydrological planning and environmental planning. Environmental change is facing a critical problem due to several factors such as increasing population, demolished natural resources, environmental pollution, land use planning, and others. Moreover, land use and land cover change are considered one of the central components in current strategies for managing natural resources and monitoring environmental changes. The main objective of this study is to assess the environmental changes in Magway Division using Landsat satellite images in the period from 2000 to 2017. In this study, the land cover change detection has been performed based on the analysis of the digital data of Landsat 5 (TM) for the year 2000, 2005, and 2010 and then Landsat 8 (OLI) for 2017. The collected images are classified into water, forest, buildup, vegetation and others for the representative Division in Myanmar. After that, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are applied for land cover index classification. The user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, overall accuracy and kappa coefficient are calculated to assess the method's performance.

AB  - The future space joint-mission TRISHNA (Thermal infraRed Imaging Satellite for High-resolution Natural resource Assessment, CNES and ISRO) will allow to retrieve LST at 60 m spatial resolution every 3 days, improving the urban environment monitoring capacities. Two methods can be used to derive LST from remote sensing TIR data, Split-Window (SW) or TES (Temperature Emissivity Separation). Even if proven efficient, the complexity and heterogeneity of urban areas limit the performance of those methods. This paper focuses on the TES algorithm. For TES, errors can be generated by the impact of the surface roughness on the data. In order to investigate the efficiency of the future TRISHNA mission, research was conducted to evaluate the TES algorithm. To do so, the impacts of using a representative material database when using TES were explored and validated based on airborne or satellite data, and the impact of the surface geometry on the TES estimations was evaluated using 3D thermo-radiative model simulations. This study shows that TES can be used for TRISHNA images with a mean difference of 1.6 K between validation measurements and the retrieved LST for both daytime and nighttime images and that neglecting the impact of the surface geometry while performing TES could lead to errors up to 4 degrees C in LST estimations.

AB  - As a commercial activity, agriculture is aimed primarily at production and relies on the availability of natural resources. The development of commercial activities has brought new environmental pressures on the natural capital stock. Technological progress and the desire to maximize returns and minimize costs have produced a marked intensification in agriculture over the last 40 years. Intensification can lead to degradation of soil, water and air. Water scarcity and related with it droughts have now emerged as a major challenge - and climate change is expected to make matters worse. In the last decades, Bulgarian agricultural sector is also negatively impacted by climate changes and water scarcity. Vegetation growing is limited by water scarcity and it is necessary to figure out the vegetation dynamic changes and responses to climate change to estimate the quality of ecosystems and maintain optimal ecosystem functioning. Water status can be effectively monitored by utilizing spectral indices and spectral transformation methods. Vegetation, water stress, and soil moisture indices are important to assess the crop state and its response of changing environmental conditions and to determine irrigation scheduling. The spectral transformation methods are very effective for interpretation and analysis of phenomena and processes related to the dynamics of change of the main components of the Earth surface. In the study Tasselled Cap model and obtained from its application Normalized Difference Greenness Index (NDGI) and Normalized Difference Wetness Index (NDWnI) will be applied. Microwave and optical satellite data, acquired by the sensors Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 of the European Space Agency Program for Earth Observation "Copernicus", as well as climate data will be used.

AB  - Desertification is a global ecological problem connected with a set of undesirable and devastating processes and the consequences resulting from them. Desertification is related to degradation processes and loss of ecosystem services, caused by human activities and climate changes in the arid and semi-arid territories. Degradation processes lead to modifications in horizontal and vertical landscape structure and accordingly to changes of the ecosystem services, delivered by landscapes. The study area is located in south-eastern part of Bulgaria, where, in the last years, intensification of degradation processes in landscapes, induced by drought is occurred. There is a real threat from intensification of desertification processes in these landscapes in the next decades. The case study aims to determine a predicted status of the ecosystem services, delivered by landscapes. As a starting point, two landscape maps valid to different time moments (2000, 2018) and an assessment of delivered by the landscapes ecosystem services are used. The landscape maps are created by application of supervised classification on Landsat TM and Sentinel 2 images. For differentiation of the changes and determination of a predicted status, Discriminant Function Change Detection is used. The results show the increase and respectively decrease of the area of different land cover classes within the territory and testify for the temp of the change in the horizontal landscape structure. The determination of a predicted status enables differentiation of potential risk territories, which to be prioritized in the ecological management.

TI  - Determining Salinity and Ion Soil Using Satellite Image Processing

M3  - Article
AB  - Arid and semi-arid zones frequently present salinity problems in soils. The agriculture of the municipality of Ahome, Sinaloa has an agricultural region where its soils are characterized by problems of salinity and sodicity - conditions that reduce production. Salinity can be detected by implementing remote sensing techniques; there are ways to enhance the detection of satellite salinity through the use of diverse quantitative models, using the spectral signature of each of the components of the study area through algorithms named indices. For this study we used the normalized differential salinity index (NDSI) from a Landsat OLI image for the southern area of the city, which is related to the electrical conductivity (EC) of the soils (R = 0.90). At the same time, it is related to some anions and cations. As a result, it is possible to determine since the NDSI, the anion Cl-and Cations Na+, Ca++, and Mg++. We found a relationship between EC -Cl- (R = 0.94), EC - Na+ (R = 0.84), EC - Ca++ (R = 0.85), and EC-Mg++ (R = 0.86). The electrical conductivity in the field and laboratory, anions, cations, and NDSI index were filtered with the Kalman filter obtaining better fitter, eliminating dispersivity in the variable relations.

AB  - Remote sensing present some new challenges for deep learning, because (also to compensate the scarce detail level) multimodal, multisource and multitemporal data should be jointly exploited. For example, time series of optical multispectral/hyperspectral or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data probe different properties of the observed scene, based on their different wavelength, acquisition geometry, etc., and with possible data gaps.To address this task, we propose a new deep learning architecture that exploits a sequence of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). In the proposed architecture, all the data (with their spectral, spatial and temporal information) are used jointly and optimally in the sense that no imputation is enforced, but the internal weights providing the best classification results are estimated from the data themselves (hence the proposed name ODIN - Optimal Data Imputation Network).We have tested the proposed architecture, using Sentinel SAR and multispectral image series, on land cover and crop classification, an important remote sensing application. The obtained results are very promising, with an error rate below 1%, and show good spatial consistency without loss of spatial resolution.

TI  - Climate Change and Indigenous Akan Religio-Cultural Practices <i>Lessons for Policy</i>-<i>Makers and Implementers in Environmental Conservation in Ghana</i>
T2  - WORLDVIEWS-GLOBAL RELIGIONS CULTURE AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most national and international discussions have not seriously recognized the role religio-cultural practices of indigenous Africans can play in mitigating the effects of climate change. This paper, examines the contribution the indigenous people can make towards the mitigation of the effects of climate change, using the Akan of Ghana as a case study. Mostly, indigenous people who are the major stakeholders in land use in Ghana are marginalized when policies aimed at reducing environmental degradation are made. This has resulted in low gains in the fight against environmental degradation despite several interventions in Ghana. A recent report puts Ghana into a net-emitter of GHG bracket. This means the country has to embark on a Low Carbon Development Strategy to address the situation. This paper, therefore argues that unless indigenous people-major stakeholders of land use-are duly involved; it will be difficult to address the effects of climate change in Ghana.

T2  - INTERFACES BRASIL-CANADA
M3  - Article
AB  - Questioning a certain way of cutting out reality always produces a problematic knot: here, this means problematizing the operation that separates the different and brings together the identical, confining them into exclusive spaces (schools, nursing homes) without communication with each other: a problematization that leads to ways of thinking the contemporary in its most complex face, calling us to provoke multiplicity, heterogeneity, difference ... and to ask - with regard to aging, in the midst of a socius that worships youth and its values - how to meet a worldview that includes the elderly, how to meet an aesthetic of maturity? Considering authors such as H. Bergson, M. Bakhtin, S. Beauvoir and S. Pinker, among others, reflection is centered on the conditions of production of creative-inventive processes, which inhabit intensive time, as a mode of existence. The conclusion leads to the position that invention-creation always installs itself at this critical point of inadequacy, dissonance, tension, disturbing intensity of consciousness in its duration, where the lines of the real and the virtual intersect, producing an inter-time, with the power to open a breach in this previously planned future time, asking for passage to the future potentially open, to the infinite of the future (in its multiplicity of meaning), in an ode to encounters with the unusual and the difference, the joys of the fullness of being-in-process in dialogic relations, the enriching possibilities engendered by empathic intuition and aesthetic contemplation.

TI  - Extracting an Urban Growth Model's Land Cover Layer from Spatio-Temporal Cadastral Database and Simulation Application
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover data, resolution, and time are among the important factors of SLUETH and similar urban growth simulation models (UGSM). Multitemporal satellite images are often used in many UGSM projects and settlement area, forest, agricultural area, highway, and temporal land cover classes can be extracted from satellite data using image processing techniques. However, land cover classes can also be economically obtained with higher resolutions from cadastral maps. Parcels and attributes in the geographical and temporal database may support a more realistic on-land cover change. The aim of our study is to determine the land cover change from 1961 to 2014 with temporal cadastral data and simulate urban expansion starting from 2030 to 2070 using SLUETH, a cellular automata (CA) based UGSM, for densely the populated Sancaktepe District in the metropolitan area of Istanbul. The population of Sancaktepe increased over 55% between 1961 and 2014, while approximately half of the forest and agriculture areas were transformed to a settlement area. According to the simulation results, if necessary precautions are not taken, almost all of the remaining forest and agricultural areas will be converted into residential areas by 2070.

TI  - Soil Moisture Monitoring Using Remote Sensing Data and a Stepwise-Cluster Prediction Model: The Case of Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a residual soil moisture prediction model was developed using the stepwise cluster analysis (SCA) and model prediction approach in the Upper Blue Nile basin. The SCA has the advantage of capturing the nonlinear relationships between remote sensing variables and volumetric soil moisture. The principle of SCA is to generate a set of prediction cluster trees based on a series of cutting and merging process according to a given statistical criterion. The proposed model incorporates the combinations of dual-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR data, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and digital elevation model as input parameters. In this regard, two separate stepwise cluster models were developed using volumetric soil moisture obtained from automatic weather stations (AWS) and Noah model simulation as response variables. The performance of the SCA models have been verified for different significance levels (i.e., alpha = 0.01, alpha = 0.05, and alpha = 0.1). Thus, the AWS based SCA model with alpha = 0.05 was found to be an optimal model for predicting volumetric residual soil moisture, with correlation coefficient (r) values of 0.95 and 0.87 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.032 and 0.097 m(3)/m(3) during the training and testing periods, respectively. While in the case of the Noah SCA model an optimal prediction performance was observed when alpha value was set to 0.01, with r being 0.93 and 0.87 and RMSE of 0.043 and 0.058 m(3)/m(3) using the training and testing datasets, respectively. In addition, our result indicated that the combined use of Sentinel-SAR data and ancillary remote sensing products such as NDVI could allow for better soil moisture prediction. Compared to the support vector regression (SVR) method, SCA shows better fitting and prediction accuracy of soil moisture. Generally, this study asserts that the SCA can be used as an alternative method for remote sensing based soil moisture predictions.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Defense Applications
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method to detect ships in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The architecture of proposed CNN has customized parts to detect small targets. In order to train, validate and test the CNN, TerraSAR-X Spot mode images are used. In the phase of data preparation, a GIS (Geographic Information System) specialist labels ships manually in all images. Later, image patches that contain ships are cropped and ground truths are also obtained from pre-labeled data. In the stage of train, data augmentation is used and the data divided into three parts: (i) train, (ii) validation, (iii) test. The training takes almost a day of duration with a NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti graphic card. Results on test data shows that our method has promising detection performance for the ship targets on both open water and near harbors.

AB  - Earth's behavior comprehension can be achieved by the analysis of Remote Sensing data, but considering the unprecedented volumes of information currently provided by different satellites sensors, the problem can be regarded as a big data problem. Machine learning techniques have the potential to improve the analysis of this type of data; however, most current machine learning algorithms are unable to properly process such huge volumes of data. In the attempt to overcome the computational limitations related to Remote Sensing Big Data analysis, we implemented the K-Means algorithms, a clustering technique, as distributed solution, exploiting the capabilities of cloud computing infrastructure for processing very large datasets. The solution was developed over the InterCloud Data Mining Package, which is a suite of distributed classification methods, previously employed in hyperspectral image analysis. In this work we extended the functionalities of that package, by making it able to process multispectral images using the aforementioned clustering algorithm. To validate our proposal, we analyzed the Ausangate glacier, located on the Andes Mountains, in Peru, by mapping the changes in such environment through a multi-temporal Remote Sensing analysis. Our results and conclusions are focused on the thematic accuracy and the computational performance of the proposed solution. Thematic accuracy was assessed by comparing the automatically detected glacier areas with manually selected ground truth data. Moreover, we compared the computational load involved in executing the respective processes sequentially and in a distributed fashion, using a physical local machine and cloud computing infrastructure.

TI  - DESHADOWING OF HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION IMAGERY APPLIED TO URBAN AREA DETECTION
T2  - BOLETIM DE CIENCIAS GEODESICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Different built-up structures usually lead to large regions covered by shadows, causing partial or total loss of information present in urban environments. In order to mitigate the presence of shadows while improving the urban target discrimination in multispectral images, this paper proposes an automated methodology for both detection and recovery of shadows. First, the image bands are preprocessed in order to highlight their most relevant parts. Secondly, a shadow detection procedure is performed by using morphological filtering so that a shadow mask is obtained. Finally, the reconstruction of shadow-occluded areas is accomplished by an image inpainting strategy. The experimental evaluation of our methodology was carried out in four study areas acquired from a WorldView-2 (WV-2) satellite scene over the urban area of Sao Paulo city. The experiments have demonstrated a high performance of the proposed shadow detection scheme, with an average overall accuracy up to 92%. Considering the results obtained by our shadow removal strategy, the pre-selected shadows were substantially recovered, as verified by visual inspections. Comparisons involving both VrNIR-BI and VgNIR-BI spectral indices computed from original and shadow-free images also attest the substantial gain in recovering anthropic targets such as streets, roofs and buildings initially damaged by shadows.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th International Conference on Concentrating Solar Power and Chemical Energy Systems (SolarPACES)
CL  - Casablanca, MOROCCO
AB  - The current national energy policy aims to develop and promote renewable and clean energy. To this end, one of the Morocco's most available energies that could contribute appreciably to improving national energy mix is solar energy. Thus; any solar project must rely (at least in large part) on modeled (satellite-based) irradiance data. However, a key question remains: the reliability of these data sets and generated maps. It is in this outlook that our study comes to highlight the problems with the assessment of the solar resource and to stress the concept of the calibration of satellite data to ground measurements (site-specific adaptation). In order to achieve this desired goal, we have introduced the different procedures of local calibration used in the solar energy industry and operated the calibration of the Moroccan Solar Atlas (MSA). In this context, an innovative protocol of generalization of the calibration to cover the entire territory of Morocco has been implemented and has demonstrated the quality of the proposed method and its contribution compared to conventional methods.

TI  - A Comparative Study on Constitutional Medicine in Zen Scriptures(禪經) and Susruta Saṃhita

T2  - 불교학보
M3  - research-article
AB  - This study examines the way of thinking about the body by contrasting the views of Ayurveda and Buddhism through the content analysis of constitution medicine.In Ayurveda, a traditional medicine of ancient India, it was developed as a constitution medicine by identifying the human body based on the concept of 3guṇa and 3doṣa. Among the Ayurveda schools, the Susruta school developed five types of human constitution by adding two classes of parthiva (地界) & nabhasa (天界) systems beyond the general practice of presenting constitution according to the 3doṣa systems. In this way, we aim for the five- differentiation system, one of the typical examples of Indian numerology, and present the five constitutions (panca-mahabhautika).In addition, the Susruta school presents the four constitutions of kapha-pitta-vata-rakta after the addition of the blood (rakta) constitution, a concept introduced to correspond to the material cosmology. This led Susruta Saṃhita to lay the groundwork for acquiring the universality of other four-factor theories such as four-body theory, four-constitution theory. This point is that the four constitutions ultimately gained universality in the process of the competition between the three constitutions and the four constitutions. In this sense, the empirical viewpoint of the Susruta school shows the practical attitude and affinity of Buddhist medicine.Buddhism's Zen Scriptures (禪經), Zuochansanmeijing (『坐禪三昧經』) Xiuxingdaodijing (Skt., Yogacarabhumi, 『修行道地經』) show empirical attitudes by presenting the mode of bhavana (修習) and religiousity. Particularly, the position of practical approach in constitution medicine is clear by suggesting the means of practice according to the temperament. Buddhist constitution medicine, which is based on the concept of three poisons (3毒), is characterized by psychological aspects, unlike Ayurveda's material worldview. Tso ch'an san mei ching analyzes the psychology and body shape based on the concept of three poisons(3毒). In addition, in the case of Xiuxingdaodijing’ 19 types are presented in detail as well as the psychological characteristics and physical inclinations, and the contents of the performance are guided.

AB  - The analysis of remote sensing images represents a highly important issue to be performed in many relevant fields such as climate change studies or land cover mapping. Traditional proposals usually identify the land cover classes from general related groups such as different tree species or different crop varieties. Additionally, these proposals commonly use information from a precise time span or season, not accounting for the variability of the data over the entire year, specially in regions with several seasons.In this work, we propose a multi-temporal classification system to identify and represent diverse land cover classes over any period of the entire year by using Sentinel-2 satellite image data. To this end, 526 representative samples were labelled from 5 complex and variable different land cover types over the Special Area of Conservation (SAC) Betanzos Mandeo in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The method achieves a satisfactory mean accuracy value of 84.0% for the testing set using the best configuration with a radial Support Vector Machine classifier. This system will be used in the study of the population connectivity of two threatened herptiles, but it can be easily extended to other species of interest in the future. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - The Contribution of Complementary and Alternative Medicine to Reduce Antibiotic Use: A Narrative Review of Health Concepts, Prevention, and Treatment Strategies
T2  - EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Aim. The aim of this narrative review was to explore the potential contributions of CAM to reduce antibiotic use. Methods. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews with a specific, limited set of search terms and collected input from a group of expert CAM researchers to answer the question: What is known about the contribution of CAM health and health promotion concepts, infection prevention, and infection treatment strategies to reduce antibiotic use? Results. The worldview-related CAM health concepts enable health promotion oriented infection prevention and treatment aimed at strengthening or supporting the self-regulating ability of the human organism to cope with diseases. There is some evidence that the CAM concepts of health (promotion) are in agreement with current conceptualization of health and that doctors who practice both CAM and conventional medicine prescribe less antibiotics, although selection bias of the presented studies cannot be ruled out. There is some evidence that prevention and some treatment strategies are effective and safe. Many CAM treatment strategies are promising but overall lack high quality evidence. Conclusions. CAM prevention and treatment strategies may contribute to reducing antibiotic use, but more rigorous research is necessary to provide high quality evidence of (cost-)effectiveness.

TI  - 'That's the problem with that lake; it changes sides': mapping extraction and ecological exhaustion in the Atacama
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple dynamics produce the ecological present. For the past 30 years or more, in the southern Atacama salt pan (Salar) in northern Chile, extractive industries have been accumulating minerals and water in exhaustive quantities, taking ever more than may be regenerated. However, the exhaustion of the Salar de Atacama involves a more complex set of symptoms than demonstrable environmental depletion. Fragmented scientific knowledge of the salt pan due to the privatization of water and under-regulation of mining provides a partial explanation for this complexity. In this article, we discuss these political conditions of environmental knowledge and, using a range of methodologies, we show that the scale of resource extraction threatens social and environmental harm and exhaustion may manifest in unexpected ways. We used remote sensing data to elaborate maps that reflect environmental change (1985-2017), relative to the intensification of extractive activity for copper and lithium salts in the area. Using these data, we undertook ethnographic and participatory mapping work to discuss with people from the Peine Indigenous community how they have experienced ecological change related to mineral and water extraction in the southern Salar. A review of the historical and archaeological material helps us to show the depth of Indigenous people's relationships to and knowledge of the salt pan and surrounds, and how social memory may be ecological. Combining the different results of our research, we argue that ecological exhaustion emerges from social, environmental and political conditions driven by both tangible and uncertain impacts of industrial extraction. Revealing these conditions of exhaustion raises key questions about the complexity of the effects of extraction.

TI  - Indocyanine green utility in sentinel node detection for cervical cancer patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF MIND AND MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - With wide implementation of screening tests for the Human Papilloma Virus, the number of diagnosed cases of premalignant or early stages of cervical cancer has increased considerably. As a consequence. surgeons' attention has focused on determining how best to limit the surgical procedure so the benefits of the procedure will not be surpassed by postoperative morbidity. In this respect, extended lymph node dissection, routinely associated so far with cervical cancer patients. has in the last decades been replaced with sentinel node detection and biopsy. Initially performed through radiocolloid injection. this method has undergone permanent changes in order to maximize its efficacy and safety. Although the laparoscopic approach had been widely used in the past, a new method has been proposed, i.e.. the use of indocyanine green injection. which has yielded promising results for sentinel node detection in the early stages of cervical carcinoma. This paper reviews the literature of the most relevant studies conducted on this topic.

AB  - Mount Kelud eruption on February 2014 has a tremendous impact on the surrounding physical environment which ejected more than 200x106m3 of material. Thus, triggered secondary hazard such as landslides in the surrounding area. The purpose of this study is to map landslides susceptibility using Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE) approach in Kelud mountainous area in particular within KRB 1 and 2. The identification of landslide occurrence was conducted based on remote sensing data and field observation along with four considerations criteria; topography, hydrology, soil, and environmental characteristics. Each factor then reduced into several sub-criteria such as slope, aspect, topographic position index, topographic wetness index, stream power index, rainfall, soil texture, soil structure, COLE index and land use. The SMCE method was also engaged with expert judgment provided by academic university' view and the BPBD agencies. The result showed that the river channel and surrounding areas categorized as landslide high prone area. Furthermore, eruption material found as the sources of landslides occurrences.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the performance sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and effect of ultrastaging in clinically early stage endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer prospectively enrolled after informed consent was obtained. The cervix was injected superficially with 1 mL of ISB and 1 mL of ICG (diluted 1:25) at 3 and 9 o'clock each. SLN biopsy was followed by complete pelvic lymphadenectomy (aortic lymphadenectomy at the discretion of the surgeon). Lymph nodes (LNs) were analyzed by standard sectioning with H&E; ultrastaging of SLN was done retrospectively and blinded to treating physicians.RESULTS: 204 patients received dye injections. In 184 (90.2%) patients at least one SLN was identified. Of all patients, 138 (68%) had bilateral mapping. In the patients with successful mapping of a hemipelvis, ICG detected SLNs in 83% and ISB in 64% of cases (p < 0.0001). Median BMI (kg/m2) for patients with successful mapping was 35.7 compared to 40.1 for those who did not map (p = 0.01). Twenty-three (11.3%) patients had positive LNs. Applying the SLN algorithm, positive nodes were detected in 21/23 (91.3%). The negative predictive value (NPV) was 98.9% (95% CI: 96.01% to 99.71%). Eleven patients had positive SLN with isolated tumor cells (ITCs) or micrometastases detected on ultrastaging. Including these patients, 34 (17%) had positive LNs, increasing the NPV to 99% and sensitivity to 94%. There were no recurrences in patients with ITCs only.CONCLUSIONS: SLN assessment in endometrial cancer is feasible and safe with high NPV (99%). ICG was more effective in detecting SLN compared to ISB. Although ultrastaging detected additional positive LNs, treatment based on standard sectioning appears reasonable but further research is needed.

TI  - Extramedullary Haematopoiesis in Axillary Lymph Nodes of Breast Carcinoma Patients Receiving Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Potential Diagnostic Pitfall
T2  - PATHOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH) in the axillary lymph node of breast cancer patients is extremely rare but when encountered can represent a diagnostic challenge. We aim to highlight this incidental finding as a diagnostic pitfall which can be mistaken for metastatic carcinoma (particularly of the metaplastic type). We report the case of a 68-year-old Caucasian female with a family history of cancer. Core biopsy revealed that she had grade II oestrogen receptor-negative, Her2-positive invasive ductal carcinoma. She was offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Herceptin and subsequently underwent breast-conserving surgery. Microscopic examination of the post-treatment breast surgical specimen showed a partial pathological response with large areas of tumour regression. The sentinel lymph node showed frequent large single and multinucleate giant cells with hyperchromatic nuclei located predominantly within the subcapsular and medullary sinuses. The morphological differentials of metastatic carcinoma, sinus histiocytosis and extramedullary haematopoiesis were considered. A panel of immunohistochemistry showed these large cells to be negative for epithelial markers and CD68. They were strongly positive for CD42b (megakaryocyte marker). Smaller myeloperoxidase and factor VIII-positive cells were identified. The findings confirmed EMH. Sentinel nodes are often well scrutinised by pathologists for evidence of metastatic carcinoma as an important prognostic parameter both in the standard and neoadjuvant setting. Nodal megakaryocytes have been described in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy particularly in association with Herceptin treatment. Pathologists' awareness of this finding in the neoadjuvant setting is crucial to avoid a mistaken diagnosis of malignancy. A relevant immunohistochemical panel together with careful attention to morphology should help establish the correct diagnosis. (c) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - This article aims to present the problem about the topographic effects produced by the shadow in the mountain area. The existence of this phenomenon creates confusion between the components of a scene, cause difficulty in establishment with precision the types of land use because the surfaces covered with the same type of vegetation being totally different shown. In this case, even if they represent the same category of use of the land, the pixels found under the shadow have different digital values compared to the sunny ones. Topographic correction, which eliminates the terrain effect caused by the topographic relief, is one of the fundamental steps in data pre-processing. The diminution of the topographic effects can be achieved through various methods which have as result getting clear images by highlighting the information in the shadow. The reflected radiance in topographically complex areas is severely affected by variations in topography; thus, topographic correction is considered a necessary pre-processing step when retrieving biophysical variables from these images. It was assessed the performance of three topographic corrections: Cosine, C-Correction and Minnaert. The performance of topographic corrections on the images was assessed by visual comparison and spectral response analysis. In the majority of cases, C method performed best in terms of eliminating topographic effects comparing with the Cosine and Minnaert methods, which showed the poorest performance.

AB  - This study evaluates the accuracy of four satellite-composite (OSTIA, AVHRR, G1SST, FNMONC-S) and three model-reanalysis (HYCOM, JCOPE2, FNMOC-M) daily sea surface temperature (SST) data around the Korean Peninsula (KP) using ocean buoy data from 20112016. The results reveal that OSTIA has the lowest root mean square error (RMSE; 0.68oC) and FNMOC-S/M has the highest correction coefficients (r = 0.993) compared with observations, while G1SST, JCOPE2, and AVHRR have relatively larger RMSEs and smaller correlations. The large RMSEs were found in the western coastal regions of the KP where water depth is shallow and tides are strong, such as Chilbaldo and Deokjeokdo, while low RMSEs were found in the East Sea and open oceans where water depth is relatively deep such as Donghae, Ulleungdo, and Marado. We found that the main sources of the large RMSEs, sometimes reaching up to 5oC, in SST data around the KP, can be attributed to rapid SST changes during events of strong tidal mixing, upwelling, and typhoon-induced mixing. The errors in the background SST fields which are used in data assimilations and satellite composites and the missing in-situ observations are also potential sources of large SST errors. These results suggest that both satellite and reanalysis SST data, which are believed to be true observation-based data, sometimes, can have significant inherent errors in specific regions around the KP and thus the use of such SST products should proceed with caution particularly when the aforementioned events occur.

AB  - Monitoring the surface soil moisture (SSM) in agricultural areas at plot scale helps in many applications such as irrigation planning and crop management. Over the last decade, SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data have shown great potential in estimating SSM over agriculture areas. Today, Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites present a good opportunity for operational SSM estimates in agricultural areas because they provide free and open access data at high spatial resolution (10 m x 10 m) and high revisit time (6 days over Europe). The aim of this paper is to present an operational approach for mapping soil moisture at high spatial resolution (plot scale) in agriculture areas by coupling S1 and S2 images. The proposed approach is based on the inversion of the Water Cloud Model (WCM) using the neural network technique.

AB  - Timely mortality surveillance in France is based on the monitoring of electronic death certificates to provide information to health authorities. This study aims to analyze the performance of a rule-based and a supervised machine learning method to classes medical causes of death into 60 mortality syndromic groups (MSGs). Performance was first measured on a test set. Then we compared the trends of the monthly numbers of deaths classified into MSGs from 2012 to 2016 using both methods. Among the 60 MSGs, 31 achieved recall and precision over 0.95 for either one or the other method on the test set. On the whole dataset, the correlation coefficient of the monthly numbers of deaths obtained by the two methods were close to 1 for 21 of the 31 MSGs. This approach is useful for analyzing a large number of categories or when annotated resources are limited.

AB  - A huge archive of very high-resolution SAR and optical satellite imagery acquired by different remote sensing satellites provides the opportunity to explore the possibility of 3D-reconstruction by multi-sensor stereogrammetry. This paper investigates the potential of SAR-optical stereogrammetry over urban areas using very-high-resolution imagery acquired by TerraSAR-X and Worldview-2. Furthermore, the potentials and challenges of deriving simple prismatic building models by combining the stereogrammetry results and OpenStreetMap building footprints are discussed. The results of this data fusion research demonstrate the possibility of using SAR-optical stereogrammetry for urban 3D reconstruction at level-of-detail 1.

AB  - In this study, the world first major 305 lakes have been investigated. An analysis of surface temperature variation over the global lakes have been conducted using observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) provides surface temperature data twice a day since 2002. The data products were first processed to obtain the average daily temperature over the lakes and their surrounding land areas from July 2002 to May 2018. A statistical approach was applied to calculate the temperature trends of the lake water, the surrounding land. Moreover, the relationship between the LST trends and potential driving factors such as the land cover changes in the lakes' basins, lakes areas, depth, and latitude were investigated. The primary results show that lakes water temperature are warming faster than the surrounding land temperature. Furthermore, 67.54% of lakes are shrinking while 24.92% are growing.

AB  - The city of Casablanca, as the main metropolis of Morocco, is considered as the most populated city in the country accompanied by an important urban development. The combination of urban growth and the spread of industrial and commercial activities in this region makes Casablanca vulnerable city to climate warming and climate change. These two phenomena accentuate another problem that already exists in the urban areas which is the urban heat island that is considered as the difference in temperature between the urban and the rural zone. However, the in-situ measurements of the National Meteorology Direction (DNM) don't supply data about the land surface temperature which is useful for surface urban heat island. Furthermore, the air temperature provided by the DNM doesn't describe precise information about its spatial distribution due to the heterogeneity of the urban fabric. Therefore, retrieving detailed information about the spatial distribution of the surface/atmospheric urban heat island at a large-scale level becomes a real challenge. This research project faces this challenge by exploring smart spatial data to evaluate the urban thermal environment in the Casablanca region. To achieve that, time series of remote sensing data were used and were completely analyzed and processed. The results obtained remain so promising and highlight the contribution and the feasibility of smart spatial data to evaluate the spatio-temporal evolution of the urban thermal environment at large scale level.

CL  - Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS
AB  - Dimensionality Expansion (DE) is a mathematical technique to increase multispectral data dimensionality in a nonlinear fashion so that standard hyperspectral linear methods can perform better at both pure-and mixed-pixel detection and classification. In this study, hyperspectral classification algorithms were applied on a WorldView-2 4-band image product. A visual modelling tool was used to build multiple classification workflows using subpixel target detection techniques that do not require knowledge of all endmembers in a scene, and to incorporate the DE into the classification process. The experiments have shown improved results for using the Adaptive Cosine/Coherence Estimator (ACE), Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM), and Matched Filter (MF) on the original WorldView-2 spectral bands plus the additional DE bands.

M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing applications in agricultural practices are comprehensively reliable and cover a multidisciplinary fundamental interest on a local as well as on a regional level. Significantly, vegetation indices are foremost essential remote sensing applications in agricultural activities related to vegetation and/or water, particularly in an arid environment. Adequate water resources management plans are based on better fulfilment of water demand and supply equation. In arid environments, this equation is barely achieved due to water resources limitations. Remote sensing techniques improve the water resources management schemes using five different water radiometric indices of Sentinel-2. Each of them plays a specific role in the quantification of soil/plant water content based on the interpretation of map surface water features and monitors the dynamic of surface water. The study area is located within the main agricultural region of Wadi As-Sirhan, Saudi Arabia. The area is characterized by flourishing agricultural activities. Remote Sensing data acquired by Sentinel-2 proved to be statistically sufficient to estimate soil water content in two different climatic conditions. Statistically, winter estimated indices are a better fit than summer indices. MNDWI and NDWI-2 were best to fit winter soil water content estimations. Meanwhile, RMSE shows no differences between NDWI and NDTI in both climatic conditions.

AB  - Approximately one-fourth of the population in Turkey works in the agricultural sector. One common problem in agricultural waste removal is the adverse effects of crop residue burning (CRB) on public health and environment, after the harvest. In this research, a pilot study area of 225 km(2) (15 km x 15 km) in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey was selected where CRB is a common practice. Sentinel-2 satellite images of the pilot area were obtained and processed in order to monitor the spatial distribution and the total area of the agricultural parcels where crop residues were burned in the field. The analysis was extended to find out the crop-specific emissions from residue burning by identifying the crop type for each agricultural parcel. Total emissions of CO2, CO, CH4, NMHC, N2O, NH3, SO2 and NOX from the study area as a result of CRB were calculated based on the previously reported emission factors and their implication for air quality and the atmosphere was assessed.

TI  - Dynamic Monitoring of Forest Land in Fuling District Based on Multi-Source Time Series Remote Sensing Images
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series remote sensing images can be used to monitor the dynamic changes of forest lands. Due to consistent cloud cover and fog, a single sensor typically provides limited data for dynamic monitoring. This problem is solved by combining observations from multiple sensors to form a time series (a satellite image time series). In this paper, the pixel-based multi-source remote sensing image fusion (MulTiFuse) method is applied to combine the Landsat time series and Huanjing-1 A/B (HJ-1 A/B) data in the Fuling district of Chongqing, China. The fusion results are further corrected and improved with spatial features. Dynamic monitoring and analysis of the study area are subsequently performed on the improved time series data using the combination of Mann-Kendall trend detection method and Theil Sen Slope analysis. The monitoring results show that a majority of the forest land (60.08%) has experienced strong growth during the 1999-2013 period. Accuracy assessment indicates that the dynamic monitoring using the fused image time series produces results with relatively high accuracies.

AB  - The hydraulic support is introduced into the single point incremental forming technology to obtain a new single point incremental forming technique with an isostatic pressure flexible support. Thereby, the forming process instability and the defects of the part due to the suspension of the sheet are eliminated. The isostatic pressing system are designed and developed to experimentally study the force in the forming process. The experimental results show that the horizontal forces Fx and Fy in forming process of the new technology have a certain increase compared with the force of the traditional single point incremental forming, but the increase is not large. However, the axial force Fz changes relatively large. As the isostatic pressure increases, the axial force increases.

TI  - Validation results of maximum <i>S</i>4 index in F-layer derived from GNOS on FY3C satellite
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The first Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Occultation Sounder (GNOS) compatible with both BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) and Global Positioning System was successfully launched into orbit on September 23, 2013, which was mounted on the FengYun-3C (FY3C) satellite. FY3C/GNOS has produced a lot of ionospheric radio occultation (RO) scintillation data until now. This work was conducted to verify the accuracy of the scintillation data observed by FY3C/GNOS for monitoring of the GNSS signal attenuation and early warning of the possible GNSS signal interruption, thus laying the foundation for research on ionospheric space weather. In this work, the ionospheric F-layer maximum scintillation indexes S4 (S4maxF) probed by FY3C/GNOS and Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) are matched into data pairs by data matching criterions during January 10, 2014 and January 9, 2015, which allow the comparison and error analysis of S4maxF indexes between FY3C/GNOS and COSMIC. We find that FY3C/GNOS overestimates the S4maxF data compared to that of COSMIC, and the biases and standard deviations (Stds) of the differences between the two S4maxF indexes (FY3C/GNOS-COSMIC) in data pairs are 0.004 and 0.063 in the whole day, 0.007 and 0.080at nighttime, 0.001 and 0.046at daytime, respectively. The statistical error results verify the precision consistency of the ionospheric RO scintillation data between FY3C/GNOS and COSMIC. The errors at nighttime are larger than those in the whole day and daytime, which is probably due to time-varying ionospheric irregularities after midnight and disparity of the data matching criterions. Since the deployment of FY3 series satellites, GNOS can contribute more scintillation data to the international ionospheric research and forecasting of ionospheric space weather.

AB  - The microwave imager is based on remote sensing data acquisition system to conduct remote sensing observation of the earth. The sampling mode and sampling time affect the Microwave Imager. After analyzing the traditional remote sensing data acquisition system, when collecting multi-channel data, the sampling interval time and sampling start time can't be controlled, and multi-channel data acquisition can't be carried out in parallel. The new remote sensing data acquisition system uses fully parallel mode and FPGA to control sampling time and sampling interval. Simulation results and test results show that the remote sensing data acquisition system is multi-channel and controllable.

AB  - Bashkirs developed various forms and ways of movement throughout the history progress. The vast territory of resettlement of Bashkirs and a various natural landscape promoted emergence of the certain rules connected with the road. This article considers the specificities of preparing for the journey and seeing off accepted by Bashkirs. Studying the culture of road remains relevant since the subject is understudied but important for reconstruction of a holistic picture of ethno-etiquette. The purpose of the study is to determine the road symbols and semiotic aspects of verbal and nonverbal components of farewell to the family, to reconstruct the road culture of Bashkirs in general. In order to achieve this purpose we used an integrated approach which is the analysis of historical, philosophical and ethnographic works. The study accomplished the following tasks: we analyzed the etiquette situations connected with preparing for the journey and seeing off and determined the meaning of the certain etiquette attributes.We used a wide range of unpublished and published sources to fulfill the research. The major source is the field data collected by the author in 2000-2017. As for the published sources, we extracted valuable information from the Bashkir folklore. The study has shown the associative understanding of thread as means of communication between worlds. It has deep historical roots and helps to find parallels with worldview of many cultures.According to research, the road is still accepted as predetermined and predestined. The purpose of the journey, frequency, distance and duration of the forthcoming trip, the status of the traveler determine preparing for the journey and seeing off etiquette. Before a trip it is necessary to receive the blessing of representatives of the upper, middle and nether worlds. The worldview of Bashkirs found reflection in rules of seeing off. Verbal, nonverbal components and attributes of communication as well as the participants of the etiquette situation ensured successful and safety trip. Great importance was attached to preparation for the journey. Ablution and dressing in new clean clothes were obligatory. The behavior of younger members of the family was controlled by adults so they did not harm the traveler with wrong words or actions. Prohibitions and instructions, wishful thinking and magic actions were designed to protect and maintain the traveler in accordance with the accepted rules. They prevented deviations from the given behavioral patterns and helped to feel confident in difficult situations. Fear of the unfamiliar on the road was the reason for implementation of the accepted rules.

AB  - Through various initiatives, CNES, the French space agency, has been involved in major disaster and environment monitoring from Space for many years and in particular in the International Charter which delivers satellite data to nations affected by major disasters and in the THEIA organization which promotes the use of satellite data to monitor human and climate impacts on environment.Thus, CNES developed in 2014 a reference framework to generate value-added products from satellite data. Since 2017, considering the increase of data and processing requests, CNES has decided to move to a new framework based on big data and cloud technologies and extended to data analytics.This paper will first introduce THEIA and Charter initiatives. It will present the current framework in operation and its limitations. It will then focus on the innovative approach to handle big data and analytics needs and finally presents the first results and perspectives.

M3  - Data study
AB  - Discharge data collected from tidal channels in the Polder 32 region of southwest Bangladesh, in the tidally-maintained region of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta. The datasets span (or have been extrapolated to span) one semidiurnal period at each of six locations. The raw data were collected in August and September 2015 using a boat-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) sampling at 1 Hz with autonomous GPS positioning. The measured velocities were then converted to discharge by calculating the flux through the area under the boat's transect. Systematic variations in measurements between oppositely-oriented transects were corrected by averaging pairs of consecutive transects to produce the final dataset recorded in this spreadsheet.Tidal elevation data were collected at seven stations in the Polder 32 region of southwest Bangladesh over one spring-neap cycle in August-September 2015 using an array of pressure sensors (HOBO loggers and Schlumberger CTDs). Pressure was converted to depth by subtracting atmospheric pressure and then applying a conversion factor of 9.9 kPa/m. Elevations are strictly local to the sensor and were not surveyed to a common vertical datum. A smoothing spline interpolant was applied during post-processing to fill gaps in the datasets around low water when several of the instruments were subaerially exposed.The KML files show the planform area of the channels at various tidal stages (lowest low water, the bankfull elevation, and highest high water) before polder construction, in the 1970s, and in 2015. These were manually digitized using Google Earth imagery (modern configuration) or the earliest available Landsat imagery (1970s data). Each polygon has fields indicating our estimate of tidal range, planform area, and the volume of water stored at that location between low and high water. In conjunction with the discharge data, these spatial data are useful for determining the size of the tidal basin which a given channel fills and drains. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB  - Monitoring and mapping agricultural areas is a major concern in the framework of global change and the use of remote sensing data to classes agricultural areas is quite common. The objective of this work is to classes the Capitanata plain, a typical Mediterranean agricultural area in Apulia (Italy), from a crop seasonality viewpoint and to explore the phenological heterogeneity of the study area. To this aim, we exploited the temporal and spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 remote sensing data. Results demonstrated that the pheno-classes identified clearly distinguish permanent from seasonal cultivations and irrigated from non-irrigated crops. Furthermore, the pheno-classes correlated with permanent and non-irrigated crops were the less fragmented, while the pheno-classes related to the irrigated crops were the most fragmented, but also the most connected. Characterizing the landscape from a phenological perspective allows describing the territory in terms of performance and seasonality, which are the main agricultural components affected by climate change.

TI  - Influence of meteorological conditions on the formation of ice regime of the Lake Onega
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation of the ice regime on large lakes is mostly determined by the complex meteorological processes occurring over the water area. Previous studies of the air temperature influence on the ice regime formation on the Lake Onega were based on observational data on the state of the ice cover in the Petrozavodsk Bay, as well as the materials of the rare missions of aerial reconnaissance performed in the second half of the XX century. So, it was necessary to revise the previously established dependencies using the present-day satellite data for 2000-2018, and to determine the nature of influence of other meteorological factors, among which a thickness of the snow cover on the Lake area. The authors obtained regularities of changes in the characteristic dates (complete freeze-up - +/- 5 days/degrees C and final clearing of ice - +/- 3 days/degrees C) of the ice regime on the Lake Onega, depending on changes in the average air temperature that preceded these dates (autumn and spring) for the period of two months. The regression equations to calculate these dates on the basis of the previous three - and four-month periods from the data of 2000-2018 are also given. Relative to the above mentioned results for the previous period, a certain shift by a month ahead of two- and three- period exerting influence on the date of the complete freeze-up is noted. Dependencies to calculate the cumulative daily temperatures for the period of the ice regime formation (the beginning of the formation of ice phenomena, complete freeze-up phase, the beginning of the breakup phase, clearing of the ice) were also deduced. Together with the data on the expected air temperature over the Lake these dates provide a potential possibility to estimate (predict) the characteristic dates of the ice regime. The significant influence of the average snow cover thickness on the process of destruction of the ice cover was shown, and the nature of the statistical relationship (along with the air temperature) was also determined.

AB  - This research is motivated by the global warming problem, which is likely influenced by human activity. Fast-growing oil palm plantations in the tropical belt of Africa, Southeast Asia and parts of Brazil lead to significant loss of rainforest and contribute to the global warming by the corresponding decrease of carbon dioxide absorption. We propose a novel approach to monitoring of the development of such plantations based on an application of state-of-the-art Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs) to solve Semantic Segmentation Problem for Landsat imagery.

M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) and their changes are critically required for any sustainable development policies. In this research, the changes in LULC in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate, northern Nile Delta, Egypt, were investigated. The LULC distribution over four different dates; 1972, 1984, 2003, and 2016 were carried out based on supervised procedure using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). Ten LULC classes were distinguished based on this procedure; agricultural land, fallow, urban or built-up land, lake, Nile, fish farm, natural vegetation, wet sabkha, dry sabkha, and sand sheet. Three post classification tools (majority analysis, clump classes, and sieve classes) were used to enhance the classified image and obtained more accurate thematic maps. For accuracy assessment, the confusion matrix was achieved. Post-classification change detection technique was employed as it is commonly implemented for detecting both nature and rate of changes at the assigned location. The results indicated that the dry sabkha significantly decreased from 16.5% to 2% between 1972 and 2016, respectively. Between 1972 and 2003 the agricultural land increased by around 10% due to the reclamation efforts, simultaneously, the urban area increased from 5% to 9%. In 1972, the fish farms did not exist, between 1983 and 2016 the fish farm increased from 4% to 11%, respectively. The Burullus Lake has significantly altered during the assigned dates since its area decreased from around 480 km(2) in 1972 to 222 km(2) by 2016. The overall accuracy of resulted thematic maps were over 90%. Due to the loss in agriculture land for built-up land, there could be economic risks that affect the rice cultivation and production in this area. The results indicated that as the total loss increase as the time increase, the economic analysis reveals that the total loss in 2016 was 78,750 feddan (feddan=4200m(2)) which is equal to 164,823,750 L.E. if it used in rice production. The findings of this research can help the decision makers for better management plans.

CL  - Peter Great St Petersburg Polytechn Univ, St Petersburg, RUSSIA
AB  - The article is devoted to the actual problem of the future specialist personality formation. Nowadays, the informational and political environment should be construed as an objective condition of professional activity. Information presentation depends on political goals, which implicitly guide current events interpretation and ideological concepts assessment. In this regard, a socially organized system of emotional and cognitive orientations of the mass subject in the public sphere is considered as a tool of political technology. The authors' start point is determined by an objective-systemic approach to the structural-functional analysis of the specialist's worldview formation involving the use of semantic modeling method. The effective mechanisms of the mass consciousness orientation are noted to be associated with the matrix of worldview and motivational structure hidden in the network of cognitive and communicative practices. The instrumental function of the criterion of truth in the mental representation of social events can be presented sweepingly in true, false and mythologized forms of worldview. In modern digital culture, the role of mythology is becoming relevant for the worldview semantic matrix design. Myths correcting the correlation between the true, false and mythologized form of political consciousness, quickly spread in digital virtual environments. The shift in criteria of truth induced by means of myth-making is an effective tool of political technology aimed at introduction of certain illusory ideas or symbols that carry certain values and norms, into the mass consciousness.

AB  - Efficient methodologies to map greenhouses are very important for the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices, natural resource management, and sustainable urban and rural development. Remote sensing imagery provides a great potential with different spatial and spectral resolutions for greenhouse monitoring and mapping. The conventional techniques for greenhouse mapping are time consuming, and expensive. Because of this reason, many different image processing methods such as classification methods including pixel-based or object based classification and remote sensing indices have been applied for greenhouse mapping. In this study, greenhouses in Anamur, Mersin, Turkey were determined by using object based classification and selected remote sensing indices. Freely available new generation 2018 dated Sentinel-2 MSI data which has 10-meters spatial resolution was used to detect the greenhouse in the selected region. Multi-resolution segmentation (MRS) method was conducted to Sentinel-2 NISI data for object-based image analysis (OBIA). In the first stage, the image segmentation process was performed. Spectral features (mean values of the layers) and remote sensing indices such as Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Normalized difference water index (NDWI) and Retrogressive plastic greenhouse index (RPGI) were extracted from the segmented image. Then, four different datasets were created and the OBIA classification process was performed by applying the nearest neighbor classifier to the created data sets. Reference dataset for training and validation has been created by field survey, apart from this some of the sample are taken with the help of high resolution Google earth images. On the final stage, the accuracy assessment analysis was performed to test the agreement between classification results and ground truth data using error matrix. Dataset-4 (mean values of the layers, NDVI, NDWI and RPGI) has the highest producer and overall accuracies with 82% and 74%, respectively.

AB  - Open mining operations have brought number of environmental challenges, which may result in soil erosion, dust, noise, water pollution, and severe impacts on biodiversity. Determination of the mining activities and its surrounding environment is a major issue in sustainable resource management. Many remote sensing indices have been developed and widely applied as an effective tool to determine different land surface types. The main objective of this study was to determine quarry mines and its surroundings land use and land cover (LULC) categories in the selected study area of Istanbul using different remote sensing indices including Tasseled Cap Transformation (Brightness, Greenness and Wetness) and Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBa1s). In this study, an open mining area in the northern Black Sea coastal part of Istanbul was selected as study area. Freely available Landsat 8 OLI & TIRs image was used to determine quarries and land cover/ land use categories in the concerned area. By using original bands of Landsat 8 OLI, TCT components and NDBaI, three different data sets were created. Each image was then separately subjected to support vector machine classification and processed to identify and quantify LULC categories. The accuracy of classification results were evaluated in a comparitive manner using error matrix. Data set C had the highest overall accuracy and Kappa statistics that were calculated as 83.00 and 0.80, respectively.

AB  - Soil consumption often shows a temporal trend that seems to be disconnected from the real territory needs. In this study the phenomenon is analyzed in some areas of the Basilicata Region (South of Italy) that, on average, are characterized by a low increase in economic activities and a negative demographic trend. The implemented procedure aims to detect the land consumption within some of the most representative municipalities of the Basilicata region, in this case Potenza, Pignola, Melfi and Matera, in order to meet the ISPRA (The Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research, ISPRA - Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale) guidelines, which provide for zeroing of land consumption by 2050. Also the Basilicata Region is affected by this phenomenon and it is fundamental to analyze the trend of variations and relate it to the economic activities and the demographic trend on the municipal territory, as each of these parameters can help to evaluate the state of art and improve the tools available to the planner with a view to current and future territory management. The analysis is performed by using Landsat images, that allow to access a historical database of over 30 years, thanks to which it was possible to obtain maps of land consumption for the years 1994, 2004 and 2014, using a supervised classification algorithm (SVM). The next step is to implement data obtained with other statistical information, available through ISTAT (National Italian Statistical Institute) censuses and other accredited sources.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilization is a key factor in turfgrass management. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is positively correlated with turfgrass health and quality and it is affected by species and fertilization rates. With the aim to test the sensitivity of remote NDVI reading methods in detecting N variation in coolseason and warmseason turfgrass species, data obtained by Satellite and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) with a multispectral camera on board and by a ground-based instrument were related and evaluated. The relationship between NDVI value from ground-based instrument and UAV resulted very high for bermudagrass (r=0.96), knotgrass (r 0.91) and tall fescue (r 0.99). Satellite data do not allow an accurate assessment of N plant status of tall fescue (r=0.50). UAV can be used to fill the gap between ground-based measurement and remotely sensed imagery from Satellite platform.

AB  - Satellite images of the Earth acquired in the thermal infrared range contain valuable information about the properties of objects on the Earth's surface, the significance of which increases in the context of climate change. To make this information accessible to many people including laymen, it is necessary not only to extract it from images, but also to present it in an obvious visual form. The goal of this research is to identify the thermal radiation generated by rail transport, assess the stability of this radiation through the seasons, and develop a method for visualizing thermal anomalies generated by rail transport in the places where it accumulates. The technique is based on TIRS Landsat 8 images use, acquired in different seasons. The images for 18 selected transport nodes were used firstly to calculate surface temperature for each period. The resulted images of a thermal field were combined with the corresponding high-resolution images to determine objects that contribute to the high-temperature anomalies at the nodes. The stability of thermal anomalies for each node was estimated by summarizing the raster thermal maps of different seasons. The comparative analysis of preprocessed thermal images of transport nodes, located in different climatic and economic conditions, shows that the thermal effect is much more evident if a node is located outside a city, whereas the latitudinal position of a node has a significantly smaller effect. Finally, the selected transport nodes were classified according to the degree of intensity and permanency during a year.

TI  - St. Gallen/Vienna 2019: A Brief Summary of the Consensus Discussion on the Optimal Primary Breast Cancer Treatment
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - This year, the St. Gallen Consensus Conference on early breast cancer treatment standards took place for the third time in Vienna, Austria, which is where the next conference will also take place (next date: March 17-20, 2021!). Once again, more than 3,000 participants from over 100 countries came together, and, overall, the 2019 St. Gallen/Vienna conference was a great success. After 3 days of reviews conducted by a global faculty concerning the most important evidence published in the last 2 years, the Consensus votes' challenge was to define the impact on routine everyday practice. This year, the conference's main theme was the optimization of early breast cancer therapies by assessment of the magnitude of benefit, aiming at further refinement when compared to de-escalation and escalation, which were mainly the topic of the 2017 conference. Patient empowerment and the importance of shared decision-making were particularly emphasized. The traditional panel votes were moderated by Eric Winer from Harvard, and for the most part, they managed to clarify most of the critical questions. This brief report by Editors of Breast Care summarizes the results of the 2019 international panel votes with respect to locoregional and systemic treatment as a quick news update for our readers, but it expressly does not intend to replace the official St. Gallen Consensus publication that will follow shortly in Annals of Oncology.

AB  - The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) spacecraft launched in January 2015, with a mission to produce global soil moisture maps every 1.5 days using a combination of active (radar) and passive (radiometer) L-band measurements. In July 2015, after 2.5 months in operation, the radar failed and was not able to transmit. While the radiometer was still producing excellent science measurements, the need to recover key active-passive soil moisture requirements was paramount. To that end, the science team found that the European Space Agency (ESA) had recently launched a C-band SAR spacecraft called Sentinel-1A (launched April 2014) in a similar orbit, which was seen as a potential replacement to the "active" part of the SMAP measurements. An analysis was performed to see what the resulting spatial and temporal coverage could be. The promising results of that coupled with the ramp up in global coverage from Sentinel-1A and 1B (launched April 2016) allowed SMAP to create a new joint science data product that strives to meet the original mission objectives. The joint product is now part of the routine release of SMAP data to the science community as of June 2018.

TI  - The 2016 UK Space Agency Mars Utah Rover Field Investigation (MURFI)
T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016 Mars Utah Rover Field Investigation (MURFI) was a Mars rover field trial run by the UK Space Agency in association with the Canadian Space Agency's 2015/2016 Mars Sample Return Analogue Deployment mission. MURFI had over 50 participants from 15 different institutions around the UK and abroad. The objectives of MURFI were to develop experience and leadership within the UK in running future rover field trials; to prepare the UK planetary community for involvement in the European Space Agency/Roscosmos ExoMars 2020 rover mission; and to assess how ExoMars operations may differ from previous rover missions. Hence, the wider MURFI trial included a ten-day (or ten-'sol') ExoMars rover-like simulation. This comprised an operations team and control centre in the UK, and a rover platform in Utah, equipped with instruments to emulate the ExoMars rovers remote sensing and analytical suite. The operations team operated in 'blind mode', where the only available data came from the rover instruments, and daily tactical planning was performed under strict time constraints to simulate real communications windows. The designated science goal of the MURFI ExoMars rover-like simulation was to locate in-situ bedrock, at a site suitable for sub-surface coresampling, in order to detect signs of ancient life. Prior to "landing", the only information available to the operations team was Mars-equivalent satellite remote sensing data, which were used for both geologic and hazard (e.g., slopes, loose soil) characterisation of the area. During each sol of the mission, the operations team sent driving instructions and imaging/analysis targeting commands, which were then enacted by the field team and rover-controllers in Utah. During the ten-sol mission, the rover drove over 100 m and obtained hundreds of images and supporting observations, allowing the operations team to build up geologic hypotheses for the local area and select possible drilling locations. On sol 9, the team obtained a subsurface core sample that was then analyzed by the Raman spectrometer. Following the conclusion of the ExoMars-like component of MURFI, the operations and field team came together to evaluate the successes and failures of the mission, and discuss lessons learnt for ExoMars rover and future field trials. Key outcomes relevant to ExoMars rover included a key recognition of the importance of field trials for (i) understanding how to operate the ExoMars rover instruments as a suite, (ii) building an operations planning team that can work well together under strict time-limited pressure, (iii) developing new processes and workflows relevant to the ExoMars rover, (iv) understanding the limits and benefits of satellite mapping and (v) practicing efficient geological interpretation of outcrops and landscapes from rover-based data, by comparing the outcomes of the simulated mission with post-trial, in-situ field observations. In addition, MURFI was perceived by all who participated as a vital learning experience, especially for early and mid-career members of the team, and also demonstrated the UK capability of implementing a large rover field trial. The lessons learnt from MURFI are therefore relevant both to ExoMars rover, and to future rover field trials.

AB  - The interpretation of the Yijing (i.e., Zhouyi, or Book of Changes) by Jesuit missionaries manifests how the text was transformed and integrated with other sources during an East-West cultural exchange and globalization. The Jesuit interpretation exhibits the influence of two distinct characteristics : figurism(索隱主義) and Western mathematics. While both attempted to understand the Yijing on the basis of a Western worldview, they brought about very different outcomes.Despite its foundation on a Christian worldview, figurism was approved only by some Jesuits and remained a comparably isolated theology, whereas the Jiheyuanben(幾何原本: Elements of Geometry), namely, the Chinese translation of Euclid’s Elements, had a long-lasting influence on the Chinese scholars. When it comes to the concept of taiji(太極: Supreme Ultimate) and yin-yang(陰陽), Matteo Ricci cast doubt on them because they were presented in numbers and geometric figures in Zhou Dunyi(周敦頤)’s Taijitushuo(太極圖 說: Explanations on the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate). In the philosophy of Aristotle, numbers and geometrical figures are not substances but attributes. Ricci followed Aristotle’s idea in that he regarded taiji and yin-yang as mere conceptual existences.Joachim Bouvet was one of the King’s Mathematicians (Mathematici-ens du Roy) dispatched to China by Louis XIV. In his view, taiyi(太一: Supreme One) is another name for taiji and the yi(一: One) represents the substance of the ultimate existence. He also believed that numbers, diagrams, and images are crucial instruments for representing the essence of the ultimate existence. In the “Qimengfulun”(啓蒙附論: Appendix on the Introduction to the Study of Changes) of the Zhouyizhezhong(周易折中: Balanced Annotations of Zhouyi), there are included many geometrical figures that turned out to be Bouvet’s work. It was Emperor Kangxi who urged Li Guangdi (李光地) to insert Bouvet’s chart in the Zhouyizhezhong. This shows the Emperor Kangxi’s strong interest in the western mathematics.Interest in Western mathematics notably increased during the Qing dynasty, and Jiao Xun(焦循)’s case clearly illustrates the tendency of interpreting the Yijing through mathematics. Jiao Xun, influenced by Euclid and Mei Wending(梅文鼎), enthusiastically applied mathematics to the interpretation of the Yijing. However, Jeong Yak-yong(丁若鏞), a contemporary of Jiao Xun, was against this method. For Jeong, the Yijing has nothing to do with mathematics or geometry and it would be absurd to overlay it with some significance that was not intended by the original author.

TI  - CHARACTERIZATION OF SENTINEL-MSI AND LANDSAT-OLI FILTERS RESPONSIVITIES DIFFERENCES FOR SOIL SALINITY DYNAMIC MONITORING IN AN ARID LANDSCAPE
T2  - 2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS 2019)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - The Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel satellites and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) installed on Landsat-8 satellite are designed to be similar. However, relative spectral response profiles characterizing the filters responsivities of the both instruments are not identical between the homologous bands, so some differences are probably expected in the recorded land-surface reflectance values. This paper analyse and compare the difference between the reflectances of the homologous spectral bands in the VNIR and SWIR of MSI and OLI sensors for soil salinity dynamic monitoring in arid landscapes. In addition, comparisons were carried out in term of conversion of these surface reflectances to the Soil Salinity and Sodicity Index (SSSI) and in term of the Semi-Empirical Predictive Model (SEPM) for salt-affected soil mapping. Analyses were performed on two images acquired with 1 day difference over the same area for a wide range of soil salinity degrees. The images were radiometrically calibrated, atmospherically corrected, and BRDF normalized. To generate data for comparison analysis, similarly to OLI, MSI images were resampled systematically in 30-m pixel size considering UTM projection and WGS84 datum. The comparisons were undertaken using regression analysis and root mean square difference (RMSD). The results obtained demonstrate that the two used images exhibited very significant fits (R-2 of 0.93 for the costal and R-2 >= 0.96 for the other bands of land-surface reflectances, and R-2 of 0.95 for SSSI and SEPM). Moreover, excellent consistency was observed between the products of the two sensors, yielding a RMSD values less than 0.029 (reflectance units) for the bands and less than 0.004 for SSSI. For the SEPM, the calculated RMSD was varied between 0.12 and 2.65 dS.m(-1), respectively, of non-saline and extreme salinity classes. While, the relative errors were varied between 0.046 and 0.005 for the considered soil salinity classes. Therefore, MSI and OLI sensors can be used jointly to characterize and to monitor accurately the soil salinity and it's dynamic in time and space in arid landscape; indicating that rigorous preprocessing issues must be addressed before.

TI  - SCENARIO OF FLASH FLOOD CAUSED BY HYPOTHETICAL FAILURE OF MOSUL DAM IN IRAQ USING HEC-GeoRAS MODEL AND GIS

AB  - Constructed on the Tigris River, Mosul dam is the most important hydraulic structure in Iraq, as well is the most dangerous dam in the world. Its geological foundation is unstable due to alternate and variable soluble strata formed from materials such as gypsum, anhydrite, marl and limestone. Consequently, it could collapse at any time and the lives of at least 1.5 million people could be at risk. The present paper investigate the flash-flood scenario due to a hypothetical disaster failure of Mosul dam using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) in concert with HEC-GeoRAS and ArcGIS. The Landsat-OLI image and SRTM-V4.1 DEM data were exploited to digitize the river line, banks, path, and elevation. The cross sections over the river was created based on HEC-GeoRAS model to simulate the spreading of the dam-break flood after the flood-wave exits the narrow valley towards the city of Mosul and its neighbourhood. The 3D and spatial analysts in ArcGIS were applied to create water surface and the depth raster layer for the flash flood scenario. The results revealed that the flow depths can reach a 110 m by reference to bed of the river (or 32 m compared to the topographic surface), covering the Mosul city and extent situated at 75 km downstream of the Dam and sweeping an area about 30 km wide within few hours. The visual impact of this theoretical flood propagation was represented in 3D for land planning and a strategic plan preparation to protect and reduce the potential impact on human life, infrastructure, and environment in Mosul dam watersheds and adjacent regions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal distributions of cloud parameters and their response to meteorological factors over the Tibetan Plateau during 2003-2015 based on MODIS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has important influences on regional and global climate change. Here, we perform an in-depth study of the relationship between cloud parameters and meteorological factors over the TP. The spatiotemporal variations in cloud cover and cloud optical thickness over the TP during the daytime from 2003 to 2015 are analysed using the Aqua-MODIS level 2 atmospheric product data MYD06. Results show that the annual average cloud cover over the TP decreases from the southeast to the northwest. The cloud cover of the western TP is highest in spring and lowest in autumn, while the cloud cover of the eastern TP is higher in spring and summer. The cloud covers in most areas of the TP exceed 30% in spring and summer, and the cloud optical thickness in the southeastern TP exceeds 10 in summer, with substantial cloud cover and cloud optical thickness changes. Compared to other seasons, the cooling effect of the near surface cloud net radiative forcing is greater during daytime in summer, which is likely associated with thick cloud optical thickness or large cloud cover. The results of the analysis of relationships among cloud cover, water vapour and air temperature show that positive correlations exist between cloud cover and water vapour, and that significantly negative correlations exist between cloud cover and air temperature over the TP. Combined with the analysis of variation features in the cloud parameters and meteorological factors, we find that water vapour variations during the daytime over the TP lead to cloud cover changes, which affect the air temperature variations over the TP by the cooling effects of clouds, especially in summer.

TI  - WHAT CAN TERRESTRIAL SAND-TEXTURED SOILS REVEAL ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF CORE MATERIALS FORMING MARTIAN REGOLITH?
T2  - 2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS 2019)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - Reliable interpretations of remote sensing data obtained from Mars, notably in the visible and near-infrared spectral domains, need to correctly account for variations on the reflectance of the sand-textured regolith covering its surface. These variations, in turn, are directly associated not only with the presence of iron oxides, which are also found in dune fields and coastal landscapes on Earth, but also with the composition of the core (parent) material forming different types of Martian regolith. While the core materials of terrestrial sand-textured soils can be clearly identified, the same cannot be said about the core materials of Martian regolith. The difficulties to solve this open question are mainly prompted by the relatively restricted range of experiments that can be performed using equipment deployed on Mars. In fact, missions have been proposed to overcome these restrictions by collecting and bringing samples of Martian soils to Earth. In the meantime, the pairing of remote sensing technology with in silico experiments continues to play a key role in investigations of Martian geomorphology, mineralogy and weathering history. Following this trend, we have compared the effects of different types of core materials on the reflectance of Martian regolith in order to add to the current knowledge about its composition. The core material candidates were selected based on remote and in situ observations of terrestrial and Martian sand-textured soils. Our in silico experiments were performed using a first-principles simulation framework in conjunction with measured reflectance data obtained from different regions on Mars. Besides contributing to the elucidation of the problem at hand, our findings enable an original and predictive assessment of the impact of different core materials on the spectral signatures of terrestrial and non-terrestrial sand-textured soils.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to identify new media text functions under a situation of communication condition global changes, when one and the same message of the city's Internet newspaper's website turns out to be both a formal capture of the event, transmitting news, and a polyfunctional text that responds to various requests from the audience. First of all, the request for a safe image of the place in which they live, which forms the ideas of contemporary reality, affecting the value system and worldview. Secondly, that responds to the request of an organized territorial identity of a reader. That responds to the request of an organized territorial identity of a reader. The functional of the media text in the digital environment is analyzed on the example of the content of the Big Village (Samara) and the Paper (Saint-Petersburg). The main method of analysis is structural-functional. The authors explore the structure of the urban Internet newspaper and its functional paradigm to identify the relationship of the compositional model of the publication and its texts with the behavior of the reader. Multimedia technologies allow to build the model as a complex multi-level structure: atomized, due to its presence on various Internet sites, on social networks, and at the same time networkizated. The authors conclude that modern media text, with a clear matrix structure, performs not so much an informational, but as a function of cartographic behavior of a reader (c) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

T2  - EARTH OBSERVATION ADVANCEMENTS IN A CHANGING WORLD
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The main aim of the research has been to create a classification system to evaluate the ecological characteristics of urban green spaces. From the current literature, we know that urban green allows us both to solve some problems such as air pollution, noise pollution and urban heat island, and to improve the aesthetic perception of urban quality. For this reason, in this paper the attention has been focused on the classification of urban green, and has been proposed an automatized methodology based on landscape metrics and remote sensing data, which have been distinguished homogeneous areas with the same structural and morphological characteristics of the vegetation. The innovative aspects of the method has been mainly three: the use of the coverage and height of the urban green from multispectral images and LiDAR data, the spatialization of this data on a central element of urban planning, namely city block, and, lastly, the use of a spatially bound geographic clustering procedure to identify both homogeneous and neighboring areas. The results have been shown the city of Livorno divided into different clusters, which have been highlighted the characteristics of the urban green. Each group has been characterized by city blocks that differ according to the shape and distribution of vegetation. The method permitted to differentiate the historical center from the suburbs and in according to this results we are able to determine guidelines useful for urban and landscape planning to regenerate and plan new urban spaces.

AB  - Forests have an important role in the balance of watershed systems, mainly as water management regulators by providing sustainable water resources for humans and the environment. The changing of forest conditions could give a huge impact to the balance of the watershed. The effect of this imbalance has caused flooding problems in the rainy season and drought in the dry season as it's happened in the Maros watershed. These problems occur because of the lack of optimal carrying capacity of forest ecosystems due to changes in forest conditions. Healthy forest conditions have a very different response compared to unhealthy forests, particularly in regulating watershed management. Based on these problems, this research was conducted to identify the condition of forests in the Maros watershed by detecting the level of forest health in forest types in Maros watershed through forest health analysis using Landsat 8 recording image of 2013 and to identify the impact of forest conditions on water availability (blue water and green water) by using SWAT model on the scenario of changing forest conditions and to make optimum forest condition direction which supported to become a sufficient Maros watershed management and to identify the condition of the forest related to air (blue water and green water) by using the SWAT model as much as possible and sustainable through reforestation or afforestation activities. The forest types in Maro's watershed consists of primary and secondary dryland forests, plantations forest and mangrove forests, with an area of 162.07 km2 The results of forest health analysis obtained a good level of forest health (very healthy and healthy) covering an area of 128.54 km2 and a poor (unhealthy and dead) forest health covering an area of 33.53 km2 The presence of unhealthy forests condition in Maros Watershed influenced the optimal proportion of the forest area in providing water yields. A good forest area in the Maros watershed produces 3,289,440 m3 of blue water. This value is very far from the water needs of the people around Maros watershed (3,308,977 m3/year). Therefore, it is necessary to optimize forest land through reforestation (improvement of forest conditions) and afforestation (forest addition). From the SWAT modeling results, it was found that the addition of forest area would increase the value of blue water, but to the optimum extent of forest addition with an area of 33.44% of Maro's watershed. The addition of forest area that exceeds this capacity will reduce the value of the blue water of the Maros watershed due to the increasing of green water through the evapotranspiration process.

TI  - Validation of VIIRS and MODIS reflectance data in coastal and oceanic waters: An assessment of methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite ocean color datasets have vast potentials for assessing and monitoring of marine environments. However, with the MODIS sensor aging and the VIIRS sensor reaching maturity, it is important to continuously evaluate the quality of reflectance data from both instruments. Here, we critically assess the statistical performance of both MODIS and VIIRS, including analysis of two separate (and commonly used) VIIRS processing routines. In addition, we note variability in the literature as to the methods used to identify and remove low quality data during similar validation exercises. Although most studies use some implementation of satellite quality flags (L2 flags) and many exclude data based on spatial heterogeneity or large temporal gap from satellite overpasses, critical assessment of these methods indicates variable performance. Indeed, we found little improvement in validation statistics after implementation of these data culling techniques, with substantial variability in effectiveness between wavebands and sensors. Overall, these findings highlight the need to critically assess the impact (on both data quantity and quality) of exclusion criteria, towards more effective techniques to ensure quality and consistency of satellite ocean color datasets.

TI  - Remote sensing data quality model: from data sources to lifecycle phases
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of data quality assessment has significantly increased with the boom of information technology and the growing demand for remote sensing (RS) data. The Remote Sensing Data Quality Working Group of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing aimed to conduct an investigation on the principles of data quality. Literature review revealed that most publications introduce data quality models for application specific processing chains and quality schemes are built case by case with particular domain indicators only. Yet no general concept independent from applications has been developed so far. This paper focuses on the formulation of a RS quality concept adopted from information technology domain describing a triangular RS data quality scheme that relates data sources, quality dimensions and lifecycle phases. Following the introduction it provides examples of international standards and fundamentals of theoretic quality modelling. After a short overview on platforms/sensors, definitions of different quality dimensions are presented with their metrics organised in clusters (like resolution or accuracy). The main achievement of the paper relates lifecycle phases to different quality dimensions of high relevance. The objective is not only to address experts of RS but to raise awareness of uncertainty for the general RS user community.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The Landsat-9 satellite will carry the Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2) as one of its payloads. This instrument is a clone of the Landsat-8 OLI and its mission is to continue the operational land imaging of the Landsat program. The OLI-2 will continue to populate an archive of Landsat earth images that dates back to 1972.The OLI-2 instrument is not significantly different from OLI though the instrument-level pre-launch spectral characterization process was much improved. While OLI was characterized by a double monochromator system, the OLI2 spectral characterization made use of the Goddard Laser for Absolute Measurement of Radiance (GLAMR), a system of tunable lasers that cover 350-2500nm which are fiber-coupled to a 30-in integrating sphere and is monitored by NIST-traceable radiometers.GLAMR allowed the spectral characterization of every detector of the OLI-2 focal plane in nominal imaging conditions. The in-band relative spectral responses were sampled at 1 or 2nm wavelength increments and the out-of-band responses at 10 or 20nm wavelength increments (increment is dependent on spectral band/region). The final relative spectral responses (RSRs) represent the best characterization any Landsat instrument spectral response.This paper will cover the results of the instrument-level spectral characterization, including in-band response, out-of-band response, spectral cross-talk and spectral uniformity.

TI  - Mapping and classifying green infrastructure typologies for climate-related studies based on remote sensing data
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the current evidence on the thermal benefits of vegetation and water bodies, further research is needed to investigate how cooling capacities are influenced by particular types, amounts, and spatial arrangements of green infrastructure (GI). However, there are no commonly agreed typologies that can be confidently used to compare and report the existing climatological effects of GI. Two previous studies were conducted to respond to this gap, and a conceptual GI typology matrix was developed according to functional, structural and configurational attributes. The present research presents a streamlined version and tests its applicability for the automated mapping, classification and thermal evaluation of GI using remote sensing data. A combination of parameters is introduced, including surface cover fractions and FRAGSTATS metrics estimated from very high-resolution hyperspectral imagery, LiDAR and cadastral data. The proposed framework can be applied at different spatial scales to analyse large urban areas rapidly and with high spatial accuracy. This paper also proposes a replicable workflow that can be implemented by researchers and practitioners to map existing vegetation conditions, prioritise greening interventions and assess thermal conditions with greater confidence. In this study, this workflow was successfully applied at local scale to classify green open spaces, tree canopies and water bodies in the city of Sydney. Evidence presented here demonstrates the applicability of the proposed system to evaluate and compare the infra- and inter-typology variability of land surface temperatures (LSTs), which can be potentially applied for performance assessment across other ecosystem service categories. Despite satisfactory results, the proposed typology is contingent on further developments and tests on a larger spatial extent and with a greater number of observations. Further statistical analysis is also required to determine the cooling capacity of typologies and quantify the influence of measured parameters on LSTs.

TI  - FAMILY AND HOME AS ELEMENTS OF WORLDVIEW IN ADULTS FROM FULL AND ONE-PARENT FAMILIES
T2  - STUDIA WARMINSKIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The family and the spare of the family home play a key role in every individual's life, both in the personal and social dimension. This leads to the question of whether the type of the family of origin may model the view of the family environment, which is generated in the consciousness of adults. The answer to this question may lie in the results of empirical studies conducted by means of an association experiment, which is one of the instruments for diagnosing the image of the world in the consciousness, expressed through the language of the people participating in the experiment. The analysis of the lexical material generated in association with the key words family and home highlighted certain characteristics of their image among respondents originating from various types of families. These characteristics are particularly noticeable in two aspects. The first is a similar range of the semantic associations generating the prototype image of home and family; the second is the different frequencies of use within the particular verbal reactions of the study participants. To conclude, it, is evident that family and home are elements of the worldview in adults whose profile is heavily determined by culture. However, the experience of the family of origin seems to model the manner in which the respondents perceive the importance of particular aspects of this image.

AB  - Landslide is a frequent and recurrent phenomenon in the northern mountainous terrain of Pakistan and Kashmir region. Where fatalities and severe economic losses occur along with the long time blockage of transport lines. The primary purpose of this research was to establish primary data and information about landslide occurrence in this area. For this purpose, interpretation of SPOT-5 satellite images and field investigations were carried out to develop a landslide inventory of the region. A total 534 landslides were identified and subsequently verified through field visits in a 540 km(2) area. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of 12.5 m resolution was used to derive topographic factors such as slope, aspect, curvature elevation and drainage in ArcGIS 10.1. Land cover map was generated using Landsat 8 imageries and processed in ENVI 5.3 software. After that, overlaying the landslide inventory map on these causative factor maps, landslide distributions were assessed in each class of causative factors. Landslide concentration was significantly found to be very high in slope gradient of more than 60 degrees (3.84), followed by water bodies class of land cover (3.35), and the road network (3.07). The landslide susceptibility map was developed using weight of evidence method to rank the region in low, moderate, high and very high susceptibility zones. This map could be helpful for planners to develop a safe hazard plan of the region.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere, is well-known adverse indicator on human health, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5) reflected with respiratory and cardiovascular disease. High PM concentrations in the atmosphere impairs visibility and renders of bad quality air. The Punjab Environmental Protection Deptt. (EPD) has installed more than 8 ground stations for monitoring of PM 2.5 concentration in Lahore city. However, these stations cover only a limited area which leaves most of the land as unaccounted. To overcome such deficiency, satellite remote sensing MODIS product can be used as an alternative. Common statistical models and MODIS 10 km aerosol product are used to develop a relationship between PM2.5 and Aerosol optical depth (AOD). MODIS 3 km aerosol product is readily available since 2014 for estimation of PM 2.5. In this paper, the levels of PM 2.5 are determined by combining Aeronet AOD, MODIS AOD and ground based EPD PM 2.5 in Lahore city. MODIS 3km and 10 km products are used to extract all ground Aeronet stations pixel values and validated with Aerosol Robotic Network AOD (Aeronet AOD) for best estimation. Two variable method (TVM) or simple linear regression model is used to estimate PM 2.5 concentration. Results shows that the 10 km AOD product provide better estimation with higher R-2 values as compared to MODIS 3km product.

T2  - ADVANCES IN AGRONOMY, VOL 154
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The perfect knowledge of yield before harvest has been a wish puzzling human being since the beginning of agriculture because seasonal forecast of crop yield plays a critical role in decision making for different stakeholders-from farmers to policy makers to governments for food security, to commodities traders. Different methods have been used to forecast yield with different levels of granularity, accuracy and timing.This chapter presents a critical review of the current seasonal crop yield forecasting methods found in the scientific literature. Extensive research has been conducted on crop yield forecast, particularly for wheat, maize, rice, barley, and soybean.Yield forecast are mainly based on field surveys, statistical regressions between historical yield and in-season variables (agrometeorological, or remotely sensed data), crop simulation models, or on integration between statistical modeling with dynamic process-based crop simulation models. A low number of studies rely on field surveys as a means to forecast yield, but they remain the main methods of yield forecast and estimation in several countries (i.e., USA). This chapter aims to report results found in peer-review journals for different crops, methods, geographies, and accuracies, and to end with a critical perspective on the advantage and disadvantage of the different methods currently employed by researchers and stakeholders.

AB  - Inland waters are unique ecosystems offering services and habitat resources upon which many species depend. Despite the importance of, and threats to, inland water, global assessments of protected area (PA) coverage and trends have focused on land habitats or have assessed land and inland waters together. We here provide the first assessment of the level of protection of inland open surface waters and their trends (1984-2015) within PAs for all countries, using a globally consistent, high-resolution (30 m) and validated dataset on permanent and seasonal surface waters based on Landsat images. Globally, 15% of inland surface waters are covered by PAs with mapped boundaries. Estimated inland water protection increases to 16.4% if PAs with reported area but delineated only as points are included as circular buffers. These coverage estimates slightly exceed the comparable figure for land but fall below the 17% goal of the Convention on Biological Diversitys Aichi Target 11 for 2020. Protection levels are very uneven across countries, half of which do not yet meet the 17% target. The lowest coverage of surface water by PAs ( Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Lessons from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials for analysis of distributed networks of observational databases
T2  - PHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Networks of constellations of longitudinal observational databases, often electronic medical records or transactional insurance claims or both, are increasingly being used for studying the effects of medicinal products in real-world use. Such databases are frequently configured as distributed networks. That is, patient-level data are kept behind firewalls and not communicated outside of the data vendor other than in aggregate form. Instead, data are standardized across the network, and queries of the network are executed locally by data partners, and summary results provided to a central research partner(s) for amalgamation, aggregation, and summarization. Such networks can be huge covering years of data on upwards of 100 million patients. Examples of such networks include the FDA Sentinel Network, ASPEN, CNODES, and EU-ADR. As this is a new emerging field, we note in this paper the conceptual similarities and differences between the analysis of distributed networks and the now well-established field of meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). We recommend, wherever appropriate, to apply learnings from meta-analysis to help guide the development of distributed network analyses of longitudinal observational databases.

TI  - Toward Global Soil Moisture Monitoring With Sentinel-1: Harnessing Assets and Overcoming Obstacles
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a key environmental variable, important to, e.g., farmers, meteorologists, and disaster management units. Here, we present a method to retrieve surface soil moisture (SSM) from the Sentinel-1 (S-1) satellites, which carry C-hand Synthetic Aperture Radar (CSAR) sensors that provide the richest freely available SAR data source so far, unprecedented in accuracy and coverage. Our SSM retrieval method, adapting well-established change detection algorithms, builds the first globally deployable soil moisture observation data set with 1-km resolution. This paper provides an algorithm formulation to be operated in data cube architectures and high-performance computing environments. It includes the novel dynamic Gaussian upscaling method for spatial upscaling of SAR imagery, harnessing its field-scale information and successfully mitigating effects from the SAR's high signal complexity. Also, a new regression-based approach for estimating the radar slope is defined, coping with Sentinel-1's inhomogeneity in spatial coverage. We employ the S-1 SSM algorithm on a 3-year S-1 data cube over Italy, obtaining a consistent set of model parameters and product masks, unperturbed by coverage discontinuities. An evaluation of therefrom generated S-1 SSM data, involving a 1-km soil water balance model over Umbria, yields high agreement over plains and agricultural areas, with low agreement over forests and strong topography. While positive biases during the growing season are detected, the excellent capability to capture small-scale soil moisture changes as from rainfall or irrigation is evident. The S-1 SSM is currently in preparation toward operational product dissemination in the Copernicus Global Land Service.

AB  - The landscape complexes state assessment, including natural and anthropogenically transformed ecosystems, is the basis for the organization of rational nature management and biological diversity conservation. A significant amount of remote sensing data already accumulated and constantly replenished can become the basis for a large-scale spatial and temporal analysis of the local ecosystems. However, the necessary condition for that, in our opinion, is the use of regionally verified ground survey data along with remote sensing data. Such ground survey data may be represented by regional reference plots of ecosystems having different states (natural, disturbed, converted, and regenerated). As the characteristics associated with species composition and vegetation condition become more detailed, the importance of ground-based measurement increases. On the example of the forest-steppe and steppe areas of Middle Povolzhye (Samara region) as an ecotone with a mosaic combination of preserved natural ecosystems, agroecosystems, urban areas, spontaneously recovering ecosystems, we can demonstrate the importance of regional reference plots network for ground support of remote sensing data processing. In this paper, we discuss some methods of combining regional reference plots with remote sensing data during the ecosystem analysis. These methods are the result of the joint investigations of two research groups of ecologists and remote sensing data processing specialists.

AB  - The maneuverability of a satellite to perform nadir and off-nadir offers an excellent opportunity for gathering valuable information in the time of disaster events. This paper aims to compare how LAPAN-A3 spectral quality changed with different acquisition modes. Three scenes of LAPAN-A3 with different acquisition modes ranging from nadir to extreme off-nadir mode were analyzed. Using Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument data as the reference, geometric co-registration was performed, and the Root Mean Square Error was kept at maximum (<2.5 pixels). Pseudo-invariant features were selected semi-automatically using threshold values based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Water Index. The digital number produced then compared to Sentinel-2A data. Pearson correlation coefficient, as well as linear regression, was calculated for four corresponding bands. Generally, the results show a decreased correlation value between the corresponding datasets as the roll-angle increased. The correlation value went down from 0.623 (Off-Nadir) to 0.497 (Extreme off-nadir) on Near-infrared band.

CL  - Vannes, FRANCE
AB  - Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHIs) show large temporal variability, which introduces considerable uncertainty into studies based on a single or a few acquisitions. Besides short-term and more random influences, they exhibit considerable systematic diurnal and seasonal variation, which has been investigated in several recent studies. Here an enhanced method for seasonal SUHI analysis based on time series analysis is presented and tested in the southwest United States using MODIS day- and nighttime land surface temperature data. Despite large scatter at the daily time scale, the method is able to identify and parameterize seasonal signals in time series. The seasonal patterns vary substantially between cities. Coastal cities show the largest nighttime SUHI intensity in spring and the lowest in late summer, while continental cities have their SUHI intensity peaks in September and October. During summer, some cities show a daytime cool island. Our study underlines the need to consider temporal patterns in SUHI assessment. The method proved useful to investigate the SUHI seasonality.

TI  - Mapping of moraine dammed glacial lakes and assessment of their areal changes in the central and eastern Himalayas using satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The relatively rapid recession of glaciers in the Himalayas and formation of moraine dammed glacial lakes (MDGLs) in the recent past have increased the risk of glacier lake outburst floods (GLOF) in the countries of Nepal and Bhutan and in the mountainous territory of Sikkim in India. As a product of climate change and global warming, such a risk has not only raised the level of threats to the habitation and infrastructure of the region, but has also contributed to the worsening of the balance of the unique ecosystem that exists in this domain that sustains several of the highest mountain peaks of the world. This study attempts to present an up to date mapping of the MDGLs in the central and eastern Himalayan regions using remote sensing data, with an objective to analyse their surface area variations with time from 1990 through 2015, disaggregated over six episodes. The study also includes the evaluation for susceptibility of MDGLs to GLOF with the least criteria decision analysis (LCDA). Forty two major MDGLs, each having a lake surface area greater than 0.2 km2, that were identified in the Himalayan ranges of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim, have been categorized according to their surface area expansion rates in space and time. The lakes have been identified as located within the elevation range of 3800 m and 6800 m above mean sea level (a msl). With a total surface area of 37.9 km2, these MDGLs as a whole were observed to have expanded by an astonishing 43.6% in area over the 25 year period of this study. A factor is introduced to numerically sort the lakes in terms of their relative yearly expansion rates, based on their interpretation of their surface area extents from satellite imageries. Verification of predicted GLOF events in the past using this factor with the limited field data as reported in literature indicates that the present analysis may be considered a sufficiently reliable and rapid technique for assessing the potential bursting susceptibility of the MDGLs. The analysis also indicates that, as of now, there are eight MDGLs in the region which appear to be in highly vulnerable states and have high chances in causing potential GLOF events anytime in the recent future.

TI  - Teachers as Zookeepers? How Picture Books Describe Classroom Management
T2  - LANGUAGE AND LITERACY
M3  - Article
AB  - Engaging the lens of classroom management, this research explores how teachers have been represented in children's picture books as classroom managers. Picture books from the A-Zoo 7th Edition (2005) serve as a foundational data set to explore how the personification of teachers and the reality of the teaching experience are mirrored over time. Charteris's heuristic of epistemological shudders (2014) -identifying a paradox which opens up possibilities for meaning making-was utilized alongside Krippendorff's (1989) content analysis framework. Findings inform how the representation of teachers has portrayed a postmodern, deconstructive worldview regarding classroom management and professional representation, inviting further study into society's ongoing perceptions of the teacher.

CP  - Conference on Active and Passive Microwave Remote Sensing for Environmental Monitoring III
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Fire has a vast influence on the climatic balance, and the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) considers it an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Remote sensing data is a powerful source of information for burned area detection and thus for estimating greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions from fires. Currently, most burned area products are based on optical images. However, cloud cover independent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets are increasingly exploited for burned area mapping. This study assessed temporal indices based on temporal backscatter coefficient to understand their suitability for burned area detection. The analysis was carried out using the random forests machine learning classifier, which provides a rank for each independent variable used as input. Depending on land cover type, soil moisture, and topographic conditions, remarkable differences were observed between the temporal backscatter based indices.

T2  - LINGUAS & LETRAS
M3  - Article
AB  - In its early manifestations in Latin America, literature played a decisive role in the colonizing process, working most of the times as an expression of the colonizer's cultural standards. As it developed, however, the Latin American literary production made possible a resistance against the colonizing tendencies, promoting a retrieval and revaluation of elements of the cultural traditions that are typical in the American , continent. This role of resistance was widely studied by the Uruguayan critic Angel Rama, especially in his writings concerning narrative transculturation, a concept based on the contributions of the Cuban anthropologist Fernando Ortiz. Rama was particularly interested in the way in which some Latin American writers re-articulated in their fiction the aspects inherent to the popular traditions of rural regions in Latin America. Based on the way of speaking of the inhabitants of the interior, they were able to compose a literary language that was more appropriate to express the worldview conveyed by these cultural elements. One of the authors studied by Rama is Guimardes Rosa. In fact, the main aspects of the writer's poetics are consonant with the concept of transculturation developed by the Uruguayan critic. In that sense, this paper aims at analyzing the short story "Meu tio o iauarete" (1961) to elucidate the procedures of narrative transculturation employed by Guimardes Rosa. The goal is to explore the role of cultural resistance played by the Latin American literature based on Rosa's work, showing how his short story contributes to reaffirm and appreciate elements of the indigenous culture facing the problems of colonization.

AB  - Precision agriculture gains more attention from different national and private organizations. One important tool to create a predictable business in agriculture is crop satellite surveying during the year. Processing and interpreting satellite data could help fanners to take reparatory actions or to plan strategies to improve their agricultural land. Another aspect is multiyear evolution of crops on a specific area compared with other vicinities, in order to receive relevant information regarding the evolution of the land quality due to anthropic interventions. This paperfocuses on identifying if the Normalized Difference in Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be used to forecast crop yields. This could help farmers and state organizations to control and plan strategies to maintain or improve the land quality and efficiently spend the available resources. After NDVI mapping using QGIS, the authors adapted Six Sigma methodology in order to develop a mathematical model, using linear regression.

TI  - Traditions of Connoisseurship (<i>Jian</i>) and Eccentricity (<i>Xie</i>) in Fu Shan's Calligraphy (1607-1684)
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The works of the well-known erudite and master of eccentric cursive writing Fu Shan (1607-1684) have been thoroughly studied in China, but there is little research on them in art history in the Western countries, and they are barely known among Russian orientalists. Fu Shan used the legacy of ancient epigraphy to reform both cursive (caoshu) and non-cursive scripts (zhuanshu, lishu, kaishu). Fu Shan relied on the assumption that all scripts have unified plastic principles. His expressive cursive writing has basic elements of non-cursive scripts, while his non-cursive writing has the dynamic potential of a cursive script. Fu Shan's exceptional connoisseurship made him a forerunner of the archaizing trend in the "Stele School" (beixuepai). He was also famous for his eccentric experiments with character forms and the composition of character columns that became an important element of Chinese calligraphy in the tenth and eleventh centuries. This article recounts the milestones of Fu Shan's life, shows trends of continuity in his works, and their evolution. The quotations of Fu Shan and the most prominent examples of his work are used to study his artistic principles. This article explains Fu Shan's "four norms, four taboos" (si nin si wu) that are connected with the specific aesthetics of mastery concealment and the principle of plastic dissonance (zhili). For Fu Shan, the lack of self-confident virtuosity (qiao) and the quality of being crude and ugly (zhuo) meant that a work of art reflected the natural order of Dao. The diversity of his artistic studies and the syncretic character of his worldview made it possible for Fu Shan to retain his artistic freedom while adhering to tradition. Due to the combination of connoisseurship and eccentric innovation, Fu Shan's art has preserved its integrity and the enduring value of his legacy.

AB  - Soil Moisture (SM) estimation is of growing interest. In the recent years, different Machine Learning (ML) methods were developed in order to better understand the spatio-temporal variability of SM. Among the different ML methods, neural networks were the most used for SM estimation. The purpose of this paper is to propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based methodology to estimate the SM. The input data used in the LSTM model include the Soil Moisture Active and Passive mission (SMAP) Brightness Temperature (TB), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Vegetation Water Content (MODIS-VWC) and the soil temperature. The target SM data used to train the LSTM model is provided by the Real-time In situ Soil Monitoring for Agriculture (RISMA) network installed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC). LSTM shows good ability to estimate the SM values with good accuracy.

AB  - Irrigated agriculture is an important strategic sector for Morocco, contributing to food security and employment. Nowadays, irrigation scheme managers shall ensure that water is optimally used. The main objective was to support the irrigation monitoring and management of wheat in the irrigated perimeter using optical remote sensing and crop modeling. The potential of spectral indices derived from SPOT-5 images was explored for quantifying and mapping surface water content changes at large scale. Indices were computed using the reflectance in red, near infrared, and shortwave infrared bands. A field crop model (AquaCrop) was adjusted and tested to simulate the grain yield and the temporal evolution of soil moisture status. This research aimed at providing a scientific and technical approach to assist policymakers and stakeholders to improve monitoring irrigation and mitigating wheat water stress at field and irrigation perimeter levels in semi-arid areas. The approach could lead to operational management tools for an efficient irrigation at field and regional levels.

AB  - Monitoring the extension of irrigated areas at different stages of an agricultural cycle is of great interest for land and water resources management.With a limited training dataset (50 three bands Landsat 8 images), we rely on a transfer learning architecture combining UNet and ResNet50 as backbone to intelligently map irrigated areas.Three optimization methods are evaluated: Adam and two variants of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) associated with two techniques (Cyclical Learning Rate and Warm Restart).We also assess the impact of data augmentation and temporal generalization of the model learned by predicting the location of irrigated areas at specific periods of the same agricultural cycle.

AB  - Assessing the causes of nipa palm reduction is significant for the local government in tambon Khanap Nak whose people's livelihood mainly depends on it. The objectives of the study were to assess quantitatively the change in the distribution of Nipa palm for 16 years, from 1993 to 2009. Optical imagery and SAR (synthetic aperture radar) from JERS-1 and ALOS were synergized to accordingly extract nipa palm. The study findings results show that there was a rapid reduction in the Nipa palm area during 1993-2006, while gradual reduction rate observed in period 2006-2009. Factors that caused the reduction were identified.

AB  - In this research, we compared two different sets of land surface phenological metrics (phenometrics) derived from dense satellite image time series to classify agricultural land in the Cerrado biome. We derived phenometrics from a dense Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data cube with an 8-day temporal resolution and subjected them to classification using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. We used a hierarchical classification with four levels, from land cover to crop rotation classes. We then evaluated the classification results comparing the use of phenometrics extracted using TIMESAT software [1], those obtained by polar representation, proposed by Korting et al. (2013) and the combination of both. We concluded that the accuracies of semi-perennial and winter crop classes increase substantially when using TIMESAT metrics combined with Polar features, and the misclassifications between single crops with non commercial crops are reduced.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - In this paper a new approach based on the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar COSMO-SkyMed products to verify urban change detection and to observe new constructions is presented. SLC products information has been exploited, since the proposed procedure combines backscattering coefficient and coherence information as extracted from two interferometric data, acquired in a short time interval. The algorithm exploits the information from backscatter intensity and interferometric coherence. Firstly, the interferometric SAR couple is processed by an unsupervised Neural-Networks, particularly PCNN (Pulse Coupled Neural Network) is applied to create a preliminary changes map based on the difference of backscatter intensity information. Then, accuracy is further improved by the fusion with the coherence information. The achieved results shown as the combination of backscattering and coherence information, extracted from Very High Resolution SAR data, allows to provide very accurate urban change detections with a fast and unsupervised procedure. The latter is particularly suitable to process quickly huge amount of SAR data since its lower computational requirements with respect to e.g. supervised algorithms.

CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - This paper presents a prototype crop production monitoring pipeline which identifies agricultural fields planted with small grains over 19 countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and monitors those crops over the growing season. The technical approach employs an boundary-based image segmentation algorithm to define units of consistent land use, and clusters Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series within the fields to identify small grains, without requiring labeled examples. The small grain fields are then monitored over the growing season on a monthly basis using time-integrated NDVI beginning at an interval from the planting date to the end of the target month. Classification accuracy is estimated at 82% for the test case, and crop deviations from the mean and/or reference year(s) have been detected within 1-2 months of planting, and are reliably detected several months before harvest.

AB  - An accurate estimation of solar radiation received on ground is essential in many solar energy applications, particularly those relying on concentrating solar technologies. In this work, we present a model to estimate the hourly total radiation for cloudy sky and using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmospheric products. The theoretical model selected is the radiometric model of Davies & Hay. This model has been modified to take into account the effect of clouds by adding a transmittance function that obeys the Beer-Lambert law. Atmospheric parameters (water vapour, ozone, aerosols, etc.) required for the model are obtained from MODIS atmospheric products and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is tested on Tamanrasset site (22 degrees 47'20 '' N, 5 degrees 31'33 '' E) in Algeria. Results of our methodology are compared with those obtained from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) radiation extracted from the SoDa server (Solar radiation Database for environment, www.soda-is.com). Statistical analyses of calculated and CAMS radiation values are in good agreement with the mean correlation coefficients and the mean relative error are 0.60 and 19.8%, respectively.

CP  - 27th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)
CL  - A Coruna, SPAIN
AB  - This paper tackles the oil spills offshore monitoring using satellite Earth Observation tools based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. The proposed processing scheme is based on modelling SAR sea backscattering assuming a Generalized Gamma Distribution clutter. The signal processing scheme includes a first stage to define the non-homogeneous area due to the presence of dark spots in function of the multi-scale estimations of a textural parameter defined as the inverse of the product between shape and scale sea clutter parameters. After an statistical study of this parameter, a robust value can be defined for comparison purposes. In the resulted search area, an adaptive thresholding is performed to obtain a segmented image with the oil slicks candidates contouring at pixel level. Results obtained with SAR images acquired by Sentinel-1 over Corsica, confirm the suitability of the proposed methodology.

AB  - This paper tackles the oil spill look-alikes detection based on multi-resolution technique using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired in X band. SAR sensors are powerful tools for Earth Observation but automatic interpretation is very difficult. As oil spills appear as dark spots, the first processing stage is the look-alikes detection. A segmentation based on texture parameters, to define the potential areas with dark spots, and sea clutter statistics, to determine an adaptive threshold, is proposed. The dark spot detection scheme is evaluated with real X-Band SAR data, and detection performances allow to improve the accuracy in later feature extraction tasks.

AB  - The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) is a free surface, terrain-following, primitive equations ocean model and it was implemented to perform a high-resolution 10-year hindcast study of Solomon's Sea circulation patterns. The model was executed with a resolution of 1/36 degrees, initial conditions from HYCOM+NCODA Global 1/12 degrees and was forced by CFSR/CFSV2 momentum, mass and heat fluxes. The model was validated by comparing the simulated temperatures, salinities and flow patterns with satellite data, Argo floats and Ship ADCP measurements. In general, the model captured the main circulation patterns and performed well for the Solomon Sea. The modelled Temperature and Salinity profiles were comparable with the observations, with some error variability in the thermocline layer, which agreed with previous studies.

AB  - Since late 2013, Inmarsat operated Alphasat GEO communication satellite has been providing a reliable platform for the experimental activities of its 4 hosted Technical Demonstration Payloads (TDPs), procured and operated by ESA. Amongst them, TDP1 is capable to receive observation data from a lower orbit (LEO) spacecraft thanks to its Laser Communication Terminal (LCT), and route the data to ground via a Ka band RF link.With the launch of Sentinel-1A in April 2014, of Sentinel-2A in June 2015, of Sentinel-1B in April 2016, and of Sentinel-2B in March 2017 in their sun-synchronous orbits, an increasing number of in-flight companions for the ASA terminal were made available. Part of the Copernicus program, the Sentinel satellites perform their earth observation missions thanks to a Synthetic Aperture Radar (S1A and S1B) and a Multi-Spectral Imager (S2A and S2B) respectively, and carry on board an Optical Communication Payload, based on the same TESAT LCT embarked on Alphasat.An Optical Inter-Satellite Link demonstration campaign in late 2014 with ASA and S1A using lead to the first data transmission from S1A in November 2014. The campaign was completed with results well beyond expectation in terms of link performances.Following the completion of the in-orbit commissioning of its Optical Communication Payload, S2A joined S1A in the following "Experimentation Phase", aiming at the characterisation of the paired terminal performances over its operational envelope, that has been going on since the beginning of 2015.S1B and recently S2B have also been used as companion to Alphasat TDP1 terminal for their in orbit testing and calibration activities in the light of their commissioning into the now operational European Data Relay Satellite system.The Alphasat and Sentinels experience has provided the ultimate demonstration of the technology underlying the EDRS, and also made available an important opportunity to test the system operations in a realistic scenario and gain valuable experience to be put to fruition for the EDRS GS and operations, as well as for any future optical intersatellite communication system.

AB  - Objective: Training in the final year (FY) of undergraduate medical training currently does not adequately prepare students for the independent performance of medical professional activities after graduation. The concept of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA) offers the opportunity for a competency-based FY training with the focus on medical professional activities.Methodology: In regular meetings, the FY sub-working group of the German Medical Faculty Association (MFT), which includes representatives with clinical and didactic expertise of the Associations of Internal Medicine, Surgery and General Medicine, developed a concept for the competecy-orientated, EPA-based, FY model logbook 2.0. The selection of the units of practice was made in a cross-disciplinary, consensus-orientated discussion process based on the question which medical professional activities a young professional has to master in the inpatient or outpatient working environment.Results: For the FY electives internal medicine, surgery and general medicine, a blueprint of a total of 18 comprehensive, partially interdisciplinary EPAs relating to inpatient and outpatient care contexts were developed. Each EPA was operationalised by a short description, supervision levels were attributed, and the process of transparent entrustment was determined.Conclusions: The concept for a new FY model logbook 2.0 focuses on the interdisciplinary core medical professional activities in an inpatient and outpatient care context, in order to facilitate transition from undergraduate training to professional practice, and to help avoid overload, thus increasing patient safety.

AB  - Climate change will have a significant impact on ecosystem functions, particularly in the Mediterranean. The aim of this study is to estimate responses of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) to four scenarios of regional climate change in the Seyhan watershed of the Eastern Mediterranean, integrating biogeochemical modelling and remote sensing. The CASA model was utilised to predict annual fluxes of regional NPP for baseline (present) (2000-2010) and future (2070-2080) climate conditions. A comprehensive data set including percentage of tree cover, land cover map, soil texture, normalised difference vegetation index, and climate variables was used to constitute the model. The multi-temporal metrics were produced using sixteen-day MODIS composites at a 250-m spatial resolution. The future climate projections were based on the following four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios defined in the 5th Assessment Report of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: RCP 26, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5. The future NPP modelling was performed under CO2 concentrations ranging from 421 to 936 ppm and temperature increases from 1.1 to 2.6 degrees C. Model results indicated that the mean regional NPP was approximately 1185 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Monthly NPP ranged from 10 to 260 g C m(-2) for the baseline period. The total annual NPP was, on average, estimated at 3.19 Mt C yr(-1) for the baseline period and 3.08 Mt C yr(-1) for the future period. NPP in the Seyhan watershed appears to be sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation. The CASA provide promising results for a better understanding and quantification of ecological and economic implications of regional impacts of climate change on biological productivity across the complex and heterogeneous watersheds of Turkey.

AB  - Copernicus is the European program for monitoring the Earth. It consists of a set of complex systems that collect data from satellites and in-situ sensors, process it, and provide users with reliable and up-to-date information on a range of environmental and security issues. Information extracted from Copernicus data is made available to users through Copernicus services addressing six thematic areas: land, marine, atmosphere, climate, emergency and security. The data processed and disseminated puts Copernicus at the forefront of the big data paradigm and gives rise to all relevant challenges: volume, velocity, variety, veracity and value. In this paper we discuss the challenges of big Copernicus data and how the Copernicus program handled them. We also present lessons learned from our project Copernicus App Lab, which takes Copernicus services information and makes it available on the Web using semantic technologies to aid its take up by mobile developers.

AB  - Inundation area time series are important for wetlands monitoring and hydrological model validation. This study is conducted in Biebrza floodplain, which is a natural wetland with complex inundation generation processes. In order to map 2014-2018 series of inundation in the floodplain we test our automatic thresholding method on Sentinel 1 data. The threshold value is optimized using correlation of the inundation area with observed discharge at the floodplain outlet. The inundation maps match well the MODIS 500m reflectance data used as a reference, whereas, the total inundated area per Sentinel 1 image match well the observed discharge pattern. Unfortunately, this approach was unable to identify inundation in remote parts of the floodplain, what may have few reasons and needs further investigation.

AB  - Rapid identification of areas affected by changes is a challenging task in many remote sensing applications. Sentinel-1 (S1) images provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) can be used to monitor such situations due to its high temporal and spatial resolution and indifference to weather. Though a number of deep learning based methods have been proposed in the literature for change detection (CD) in multi-temporal SAR images, most of them require labeled training data. Collecting sufficient labeled multi-temporal data is not trivial, however S1 provides abundant unlabeled data. To this end, we propose a solution for CD in multi-temporal S1 images based on unsupervised training of deep neural networks (DNNs). Unlabeled single-time image patches are used to train a multilayer convolutional-autoencoder (CAE) in unsupervised fashion by minimizing the reconstruction error between the reconstructed output and the input. The trained multilayer CAE is used to extract multi-scale features from both the pre and post change images that are analyzed for CD. The multi-scale features are fused according to a detail-preserving scale-driven approach that allows us to generate change maps by preserving details. The experiments conducted on a S1 dataset from Brumadinho, Brazil confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - This study explores the potential of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data for herbaceous biomass mapping in savanna ecosystems. To this end, 28 Sentinel-1 backscatter intensity images are employed that have been acquired over Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. The time series spans one year (May 2015 to May 2016) and thus covers an entire seasonal cycle, including dry and wet season. For calibration and validation purposes, use is made of in situ fuel biomass values measured as part of the 2016 veld condition assessment (VCA) in KNP. From a methodological perspective, the satellite and reference data are fed into a random forests machine learning approach to make park-wide predictions of herbaceous biomass and to assess modeling performance based on Sentinel-1 imagery. A wall-to-wall herbaceous biomass map of KNP is presented for the period of investigation (i.e., 2015/2016). It has a spatial resolution of 20 m and is the most detailed product available for the park to date. According to the results of a ten-fold cross validation, the generated map is fairly reliable but still leaves room for improvement. This statement is supported by a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.64, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 402.9 kg/ha, and a relative RMSE of 40.9%.

TI  - Assessment of hospital-level adjusted breast cancer sentinel lymph node positivity rates
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Objectives Proficiency of performing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for breast cancer varies among hospitals and may be reflected in the hospital's SLNB positivity rate. Our objectives were to examine whether hospital characteristics are associated with variation in SLNB positivity rates and whether hospitals with lower-than-expected SLNB positivity rates have worse patient survival. Methods Using the National Cancer Data Base, stage I to III breast cancer patients were identified (2004-2012). Hospital-level SLNB positivity rates were adjusted for tumor and patient factors. Hospitals were divided into terciles of SLNB positivity rates (lower-, higher-, as-expected). Hospital characteristics and survival were examined across terciles. Results Of 438 610 SLNB patients (from 1357 hospitals), 78 104 had one or more positive SLN (21.3%). Hospitals in the low and high terciles were more likely to be low volume (low: RRR, 4.40; 95% CI, 2.89-6.57; P < 0.001; and high: RRR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.21-2.64; P < 0.001) compared to hospitals with as-expected (middle tercile) SLNB positivity rates. Stage I patients at low- and high-tercile hospitals had statistically worse survival. Conclusions There is a wide variation in hospital SLNB positivity rates. Hospitals with lower- or higher-than-expected SLNB positivity rates were associated with survival differences. Hospital SLNB positivity rates may be a novel 'process measure' to report to hospitals for internal quality assessment.

AB  - Infectious diseases transmitted by vectors/intermediate hosts constitute a major part of the economic burden related to public health in the endemic countries of the tropics, which challenges local welfare and hinders development. The World Health Organization, in partnership with pharmaceutical companies, major donors, endemic countries and non-governmental organizations, aims to eliminate the majority of these infections in the near future. To succeed, the ecological requirements and real-time distributions of the causative agents (bacteria, parasites and viruses) and their vectors must not only be known to a high degree of accuracy, but the data must also be updated more rapidly than has so far been the case. Current approaches include data collection through terrestrial capture on site and satellite-generated information. This article provides an update of currently available sources of remotely-sensed data, including specific information on satellite-borne sensors, and how such data can be handled by Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Computers, when equipped with GIS software based on common spatial denominators, can connect remotely-sensed environmental records with terrestrial-captured data and apply spatial statistics in ways uniquely suited to manage control activities in areas where vector-borne infections dominate.

AB  - Earth observation from space enables the scientific community to investigate, learn about and understand large-scale, global, processes such as climatological changes. Near-shore ocean wave patterns are important to derive large-scale environmental forcing and relate those to (coastal) societal risks (e.g. flooding). Through earth observation programs such as ESA' Sentinel constellations, revisiting times are reduced to at best a few days and deliver imagery at 10 m to 60 m resolution. Here, a technique is presented based on a local Radon-Transformation to enhance the visibility of wave-patterns and augment their resolution. The latter aims to unify different detector bands of Sentinel-II (10, 20 or 60 m) to 10 m resolution. This results in 9 high-resolution (10 m) wave patterns reconstructions per Sentinel acquisition instead of 4 (RGB+NIR). A further application to other satellite constellation such as NASA' Landsat or CNES' SPOT creates coherency between wave-patterns and allows to join forces, e.g. reducing the revisiting times to near-daily and enlarging the probability of usable optical satellite data.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR)
CL  - Washington, DC
AB  - The low/no-shot problem refers to a lack of available data for training deep learning algorithms. In remote sensing, complete image data sets are rare and do not always include the targets of interest. We propose a method to rapidly generate high-fidelity synthetic satellite imagery featuring targets of interest over a range of solar illuminations and platform geometries. Specifically, we used the Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation model and a custom image simulator to produce synthetic imagery of C130 aircraft in place of real Worldview-3 imagery. Our synthetic imagery was supplemented with real Worldview-3 images to test the efficacy of training deep learning algorithms with synthetic data. We deliberately chose a challenging test case of distinguishing C130s from other aircraft, or neither. Results show a negligible improvement in automatic target classification when synthetic data is supplemented with a small amount of real imagery. However, training with synthetic data alone only achieves F1-scores in line with a random classifier, suggesting that there is still significant domain mismatch between the real and synthetic datasets.

AB  - The probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) model has recently shown a great potential to uncover highly descriptive semantic features from limited amounts of remote sensing data. Nonetheless, the high computational cost of this algorithm often constraints its operational application for land cover categorization tasks. In this scenario, this paper presents an Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) implementation of the pLSA algorithm for unsupervised Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Multi-Spectral Imaging (MSI) image categorization. The experimental results suggest that multi-core systems are an important architecture for the efficient processing of both SAR and MSI datasets. Specifically, the proposed approach is able to cover a real scenario exhibiting good results in both accuracy and performance terms.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients affected by breast ductal carcinoma in situ with and without microinvasion Retrospective observational study
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the introduction of an organized mammographic screening, the incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has experienced an important increase. Our experience with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) among patients with DCIS is reviewed.We collected retrospective data on patients operated on their breasts for DCIS (pTis), DCIS with microinvasion (DCISM) (pT1mi) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) sized <= 2cm (pT1) between January 2002 and June 2016, focusing on the result of SLNB.543 DCIS, 84 DCISM, and 2111 IDC were included. In cases of DCIS and DCISM, SLNB resulted micrometastatic respectively in 1.7% and 6.0% of cases and macrometastatic respectively in 0.9% and 3.6% of cases. 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival in DCISM and IDC were similar, while significantly longer in DCIS. 5-year local recurrence rate of DCIS and DCISM were respectively 2.5% and 7.9%, and their 5-year distant recurrence rate respectively 0% and 4%. IDC, tumor grading >= 2 invasive component in DCIS were tumor multifocality/multicentricity, grading >= 2, ITCs and micrometastases.Our study suggests that despite its rarity, sentinel node metastasis may also occur in case of DCIS, which in most cases are micrometastases. Even in the absence of an evident invasive component, microinvasion should always be suspected in these cases, and their management should be the same as for IDC.

T2  - MATERIALS TODAY-PROCEEDINGS

CP  - International Conference on Materials and Environmental Science (ICMES)
CL  - Mohammed Premier Univ, Oujda, MOROCCO
AB  - The determination of the monthly variations of the ocean mixed layer depth (MLD), in relationship with upwelling and filament is important in a climate change perspective. This paper presents a monthly change of the mixed layer properties, temperature, salinity, oxygen and fluorescence, to provide a better understanding of the relationship between upwelling, filament and the monthly variability of the MLD in the cape Ghir region latitude 31 degrees N in Moroccan Atlantic coast. Firstly, we compared the MLD using the threshold method and the gradient method of temperature and density from CTD profiles in-situ data. Secondly, we observed the activity of upwelling variability in the region by satellite data. In the other hand, we used monthly mean seawater velocity from Mercator model to identify the filament structure. The general pattern of the in-situ MLD varies between 20m in summer and 150m in winter as the MLD variability derived from Mercator model. The deepest MLD occur in December and February, it coincides with a weak activity of upwelling. During April, June and August, the mixed layer is shallow, accompanied with a high activity of upwelling filament. In October, the mixed layer was deeper following a persistent activity of upwelling.

M3  - Article
AB  - We implemented a cross-sectional study in Tana River County, Kenya, a Rift Valley fever (RVF)-endemic area, to quantify the strength of association between RVF virus (RVFv) seroprevalences in livestock and humans, and their respective intra-cluster correlation coefficients (ICCs). The study involved 1932 livestock from 152 households and 552 humans from 170 households. Serum samples were collected and screened for anti-RVFv immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using inhibition IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data collected were analysed using generalised linear mixed effects models, with herd/household and village being fitted as random variables. The overall RVFv seroprevalences in livestock and humans were 25.41% (95% confidence interval (CI) 23.49-27.42%) and 21.20% (17.86-24.85%), respectively. The presence of at least one seropositive animal in a household was associated with an increased odds of exposure in people of 2.23 (95% CI 1.03-4.84). The ICCs associated with RVF virus seroprevalence in livestock were 0.30 (95% CI 0.19-0.44) and 0.22 (95% CI 0.12-0.38) within and between herds, respectively. These findings suggest that there is a greater variability of RVF virus exposure between than within herds. We discuss ways of using these ICC estimates in observational surveys for RVF in endemic areas and postulate that the design of the sentinel herd surveillance should consider patterns of RVF clustering to enhance its effectiveness as an early warning system for RVF epidemics.

TI  - Knowledge of green buildings and environmental worldview among interior design students
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of green buildings is one of the main features of sustainable urbanism. Additionally, sustainability oriented lifestyles have the potential to create a sustainable society, and have recently been understood to be a significant driving force behind sustainable development. Younger generations are the professionals and decision makers of the future. Therefore, both as individuals living in the 21st century which has witnessed many environmental catastrophes and as future professionals with a direct impact on the environment via architectural planning and design, it is crucial for interior architecture undergraduate students to acquire sufficient knowledge and perception with regard to sustainability, ecological design and construction in particular. Within this framework, a survey was conducted among 100 participants who were randomly selected undergraduate students in Nicosia. In the first section, several subjects were asked about their environmental awareness and knowledge regarding various issues, including the concept of green buildings. In the second section, the level of their environmental worldview was assessed and the third section measured the participants' environmental behaviours. Furthermore, interior architecture instructors' environmental awareness was also examined with the help of a disparate survey. The results revealed that the participants did not exhibit a high level of endorsement either for environmental knowledge of the concept of green buildings, environmental worldview or for environmental behaviours.

An example is in the documentation. New tools Added parallel_bundle_adjust which computes image statistics and IP matching in a parallel manner similar to parallel_stereo. Added the cam_gen tool to create a correctly oriented pinhole camera model given camera intrinsics, lon-lat coordinates of the corners (or some other pixels), and optionally a ground truth DEM. It can also parse SkySat's video/frame_index metafile to get this data. It can also take as input any camera supported by ASP via --input-camera and create a most-similar pinhole camera model with given intrinsics. Added the coverage_fraction tool to provide a coverage estimate of the results of a stereo call. Added the image_mosaic tool which merges together images based on interest point matches. Can be used to stitch together Corona scanned images. Added a new tool, n_align, to jointly align n clouds (re-implemented from Matlab, works well for small clouds that are close to each other). stereo_rfne Added the option to run a non-SGM subpixel option after running SGM/MGM. Added the phase correlation subpixel option. This is a Fourier transform based method. pc_align Added a new approach to finding an initial transform between clouds, when they are DEMs, that may be more robust to large scale or translation changes, or to noise. It is based on hillshading the DEMs and finding interest point matches among them, which are then used to find the transform. Can be invoked with --initial-transform-from-hillshading [less than]transform type[greater than]. Supported transforms are: 'similarity' (rotation + translation + scale), 'rigid' (rotation + translation) and 'translation'. Added the expression of the Euler angles in the North-East-Down coordinate system around the center of gravity of the source cloud. Bugfix: intersection of bounding boxes of the clouds takes into account the initial transform applied to the source points. Added a new alignment algorithm, based on https://github.com/IntelVCL/FastGlobalRegistration It can be invoked with --alignment-method fgr. It can perform better than ICP when the clouds are close enough to each other but there is a large number of outliers, when it can function with very large --max-displacement. It does worse if the clouds need a big shift to align. bundle_adjust Two passes of bundle adjustment (with outlier filtering after first pass) is now the default. The flag --skip-rough-homography is on by default as it usually gives more reliable results. Use --enable-rough-homography to turn this option back on (useful when the footprint on the ground and difference in perspective are large). The flag --disable-tri-ip-filter is also the default as input cameras may not be reliable enough for this filter. Can be enabled back with --enable-tri-ip-filter. Added the --intrinsics-limits option to manually specify intrinsic parameter limits. Added the --num-random-passes option to allow repeat solving attempts with randomly distorted initial parameters. Added option to automatically guess overlapping images from Worldview style XML camera files. Removed the non-Ceres bundle adjustment options. Added the option to share or not share selected intrinsic parameters between pinhole cameras when optimizing intrinsics. Improvements in solving simultaneously for both intrinsics and extrinsics of n camera images if underlying ground truth terrain in the form of a DEM or LIDAR point cloud is present. After this bundle adjustment, pairwise stereo and DEM creation, the DEMs are well-aligned to the ground truth. Added the flag --reference-terrain-weight which, when increased, helps align better camera images to a given reference terrain. Added the option --heights-from-dem. It is very helpful in determining an unknown focal length and distortion parameters for pinhole cameras. It can be used together with ---heights-from-dem-weight. Bug fix in outlier filtering for n images. Updated Ceres version from 1.11 to 1.14. When optimizing with multiple threads, results now vary slightly from run to run. Results from single threaded runs are deterministic. Added a new --parameter-tolerance option. Stop when the relative error in the variables being optimized is less than this. Documented the ability to create a roughly positioned pinhole camera model from an image if its intrinsics and the longitude and latitude (and optionally height) of its corners (or some other pixels) are known. When multiple passes happen with outliers removed, match files are not over-written, but a new clean copy of them gets saved. Renamed --create-pinhole-cameras to --inline-adjustments, and distortion_params to other_intrinsics. This is needed since for the panoramic model there will be other intrinsic parameters as well. Added the option --forced-triangulation-distance for when one really needs to triangulate with poor cameras. Can be used with --min-triangulation-angle 0. Added the option --transform-cameras-using-gcp. If there are at least two images with each having at least 3 GCP (each GCP need not show in more than one image), use this to convert cameras from an abstract coordinate system to world coordinates. Increased the default --num-ransac-iterations to 1000 from 100 so that the solver tries harder to find a fit. Increased default --ip-inlier-factor from 1/15 to 0.2 to help with getting more interest points for steep terrain with the pinhole session. Increased the default --ip-uniqueness-threshold from 0.7 to 0.8 to allow for more interest points. Option to filter interest points by elevation limit and lon-lat limit after each pass of bundle adjustment except the last. dem_mosaic Added normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) output option. Added the option --force-projwin to create a mosaic filling precisely the desired box specified via --t_projwin. stereo_gui Added the ability to manually reposition interest points. Can now show non-synchronous .match files (that is, each IP need not be present in all images). Added basic functionality for drawing/editing/merging polygons on top of georeferenced images or DEMs. The polygons can be saved as shape files, and then used to cut out portions of images with GDAL. Added the option --nodata-value. Pixels with value less than or equal to this are shown as transparent. Added the ability to view .vwip files (specify one per image). Can view (but not edit) GCP files, via --gcp-file (creating GCP is supported in a separate mode, per the doc). The option --dem-file specifies a DEM to use when creating manually picked GCP and --gcp-file specifies the name of the GCP file to use upon saving such GCP. mapproject Added the --nearest-neighbor option to use that interpolation method instead of bicubic. This is better for labeled images which should not be interpolated. convert_pinhole_model Can create RPC distortion models of any degree, which can be further optimized in bundle_adjust. Old RPC distortion files are still supported throughout ASP, but not functionality which optimizes them. They can be approximately converted to new type RPC distortion files with this tool if optimization is desired. Misc Comiled against USGS ISIS version 3.6.0. Expanded the documentation explaining how to align cameras to a DEM manually (or initialize such cameras) by selecting matching points between the images and the DEM. The stereo tools and bundle_adjust will now cache image statistics and interest points to files on disk. In stereo and bundle_adjust, when images or cameras are newer than the match files, the latter get recomputed unless the tools are invoked with --force-reuse-match-files. Added a fix to make stereo work with the ZY3 satellite. For stereo and bundle_adjust, added the --no-datum option to find interest points without assuming a reliable datum exists, such as for irregularly shaped bodies. Added the related option --skip-rough-homography to not use the datum in rough homography computation. Added the option --ip-num-ransac-iterations for finer control of interest point matching. Added --ip-triangulation-max-error to control the triangulation error. The cam2rpc tool accepts --t_srs and --semi-major-axis as alternatives to --datum and --dem-file. Add option --theia-overrides to camera_solve to make it easier to customize its behavior via flags. Added an explanation for how the pinhole model works. Copyright: Apache License 2.0 Open Access

AB  - Very High Resolution (VHR) remote sensing optical imagery is a huge source of information that can be utilized for earthquake damage detection and assessment. Time critical task such as performing the damage assessment, providing immediate delivery of relief assistance require immediate response; however, processing voluminous VHR imagery using highly accurate, but computationally expensive deep learning algorithms demands the High Performance Computing (HPC) power.To maximize the accuracy, deep convolution neural network (CNN) model is designed especially for the earthquake damage detection using remote sensing data and implemented using high performance GPU without compromising with the execution time. Geoeye1 VHR disaster images of the Haiti earthquake occurred in year 2010 is used for analysis. Proposed model provides good accuracy for damage detection; also significant execution speed is observed on GPU K80 High Performance Computing (HPC) platform.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Tropical deep convective clouds (DCC) are proven to be an excellent Earth invariant target for post-launch radiometric assessment of satellite imagers. The success of the DCC technique (DCCT) relies on a large ensemble of identified DCC pixels that are collectively analyzed as a stable reflectance reference. The near-Lambertian reflectance of DCC, as well as their high signal-to-noise ratio, location near the tropopause above most of the atmospheric water vapor and aerosol, and availability across the globe make them an ideal target for radiometric scaling of geostationary (GEO) and low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites. The DCCT has been successfully applied to calibrate reflective solar bands (with wavelengths < 1 mu m) of numerous GEO and LEO imagers. The DCC reflectivity in VIS-NIR is mainly a function of cloud optical depth, and the DCCT provides a stable monthly statistical mode that can be tracked over time for monitoring the radiometric stability of the sensor. However, at shortwave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths, the DCC reflectance is affected by both cloud particle size and cloud optical depth. The DCCT for SWIR bands is found to be most sensitive to the BRDF and brightness temperature, resulting in large seasonal cycles of DCC reflectivity that make the implementation of the DCCT more challenging. The key to improving the DCCT at SWIR wavelengths is proper characterization of the DCC reflectance as a function of viewing and solar angular conditions. This paper presents channel-specific seasonal BRDF models for SWIR bands based on five years of SNPP-VIIRS DCC measurements. The seasonal BRDFs are effective in reducing the temporal variability of the DCC time series by up to 65% when applied to both Aqua-MODIS and NPP-VIIRS SWIR bands. The use of seasonal BRDF models for radiometric stability assessment and absolute inter-calibration of the MODIS and SNPP-VIIRS SWIR bands is discussed in the paper. In addition, the modification of the baseline DCCT for daily monitoring of the radiometric stability of the GEO imager L1B radiances is also illustrated. The DCCT is capable of detecting daily GOeS-16 L1B radiance anomalies with a magnitude greater than +/- 3% for bands 2 and 3, and +/- 4% shift for band 1 with 3 sigma significance.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an approach to recognize spatio-temporal changes from remote sensing data. Instead of performing independent analysis on each instance of satellite imagery, we proposed a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the ResNet architecture. Our approach takes as input a 3D spatio-temporal block comprising of spatial as well as temporal data from multiple years. We predict four key transition classes namely construction, destruction, cultivation and decultivation. In our proposed architecture, we introduced Leaky ReLU instead of ReLU which improves the overall performance as it solves the dying ReLU problem. We also provided dataset and annotations1 for these four classes and have evaluated the efficacy of our approach on data from three different cities.

TI  - Simulation of evapotranspiration based on leaf area index, precipitation and pan evaporation: A case study of Poyang Lake watershed, China
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major component of land hydrological processes, where it determines the transfer of moisture and energy in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system. In this study, an empirical ET model (PYH-ET) was established based on the relationships between the monthly ET and the leaf area index (LAI), precipitation (PRE), and pan evaporation (EVP) in the whole Poyang Lake watershed (China). Then, this model was applied to sub-watersheds of the Poyang Lake watershed and analyzed the contributions of the three variables to ET. The results showed that the correlation coefficients between the monthly ET and the monthly LAI, PRE, and EVP were 0.969, 0.380, and 0.894, respectively. The moving average of the PRE per 2 months was used to replace the monthly PRE as a variable in the model. The accuracy of the PHY-ET model was high where the R value for the model was 0.98 and the relative error of the model was 10.2% when the data of 2014 were used to validate the model built according to the data during 2000-2013. The contribution of LAI to ET was highest in all sub-watersheds, followed by EVP, whereas PRE made the lowest contribution. In addition, the contributions of these three factors to ET in this watershed conformed to the law of the minimum, where the variation in ET was limited by the factor with the smallest change. The proposed high accuracy empirical model requires a small number of readily available parameters and it is suitable for integration with hydrological models.

TI  - Snow cover trend analysis using modis snow products: A case of Shayok River Basin in Northern Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF HIMALAYAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To tackle the challenges of the growing water demands, an improved Water resource management is required. The main contributor of water resources in Pakistan is the Indus river, which Inflow largely depends on glacier and snowmelt from Upper Indus Basin located in the mountainous ranges of Himalaya-Karakoram-Hindukush (HKH). Despite such importance, assessment of cryosphere dynamics cannot be done manually with accuracy, especially in mountainous areas comprising difficult terrain. To obtain precision, other sources of information such as station data and remotely sensed snow-covered area, should be used together to make accurate conclusions about the snow cover and climate variability conditions which will affect downstream population for water-related activities and its management and, for example, hydropower generation, etc. Therefore, this study was done to explore the changes in snow-covered area in Shayok River basin (Sub-catchment of the Indus River) through remote sensing and GIS. Satellite images of MODIS sensor were used to examine the variation in snow. Modis 8-day composite images from 2000-2018 were selected to investigate SCA due to its high accuracy. Furthermore, climate data from one (only available) high altitude climate station located at the same basin was used to study correlation among now cover variations with varying preticipation, minimum and maximum year-round temperatures for the period of 2000-2018. Analysis showed that remote sensing is a useful technique for estimation of snow in difficult and complex topography. Moreover, results also indicate that SCA is highly correlated with the climatic parameters (Temperature and Precipitation data) therefore it is important to get accurate climate data to understand snow extent properly. Our results will be helpful to manage water resources properly in downstream population which indicate one-month shift of snow cover accumulation and depletion. However, to make more accurate and conclusions, we recommend on detail study of each river basin and long-term monitoring of whole UIB.

AB  - Volcanic eruptions emit significant amounts of aerosols in the atmosphere and have strong impact on aviation security and air traffic. Our research deals with spatial and temporal improvements of volcanic ash aerosols within the chemistry-transport model MOCAGE [1, 2], the operational air-quality and fast-response model of Meteo-France. To better characterize the source term of volcanic eruptions, we implemented the plume rise model FPLUME [3] and compared it to the Mastin [4] empirical parametrization, which confirmed that uncertainties of the volcanic ash modelling are considerable and very sensitive to the source term. For this reason, we explore the potential of assimilating spaceborne, ground-based and in-situ observations. Assimilation of Aerosols Optical Depth (AOD) from MODIS instrument allowed to correct the extent and intensity of the plume of the 2010 Eyjafjallajokull eruption. Further experiments are ongoing to take advantage of LIDAR soundings from EARLINET network and CALIOP instrument, as well as in-situ airborne measurements.

AB  - The use of SAR data for imaging hazardous events is nowadays a well-consolidated approach. Thanks to the synoptic capabilities of satellite data, their high spatial resolution and high revisit time, fast and accurate analysis can be performed at both regional and local scale. This work presents the results of SAR Interferometry applied to a multi-hazard event induced by the eruption of Etna volcano, occurred in late December 2018. We analyse both the syn-eruptive deformation of volcano edifice and the effects of an induced M(w )4.9 earthquake and a small-scale landslide by exploiting ESA Sentinel-1 data. The data highlight a main horizontal displacement of the Etna summit of more than 40 cm and 65 cm along west and east directions, respectively. The earthquake caused about 15 cm displacement toward east and 20 cm toward west. Finally, approximately 5 cm displacement along satellite Line of Sight was observed associated to the landslide.

TI  - The Reconstruction of Christian Theodicy in Taras Shevchenko's Poetry
T2  - KYIV-MOHYLA HUMANITIES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on the role of Christian theodicy in Taras Shevchenko's works. With a biography marked by trauma and suffering, it is no wonder that Shevchenko orients his poetic worldview in search of understanding the nature of evil and human suffering. Operating through a Christological model, Shevchenko arrives at a poetics based on theodicy, as a means of understanding suffering in the world. He analyses the problem of evil associated with the phenomenology of suffering within the framework of religious ethics. The works of the early period emphasize "truth and revenge," retribution, and physical punishment over the "malicious" in the spirit of Old Testament dogma. The period of Shevchenko's exile and subsequent works is characterized by changes in moods. The theodicy of Shevchenko's works reveals the signs of Christodicy. Shevchenko's concept of "suffering" is theologically based, as he believes that suffering is the key to conversion to faith.

T2  - Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS-KNAW)
M3  - Data study
AB  - As part of the G4AW SMARTSeeds project, this study aims to investigate the potential of dense time series of Sentinel- 1A dual polarization data for the classification of vegetables that are common in East Java, Indonesia. We first analyzed the temporal behavior of three main types of vegetables (i.e. chili, tomato and cucumber) in terms of backscatter (VH and VV) intensity, and of polarimetric features (i.e. entropy, al- pha and anisotropy) derived from polarization decomposition. We then applied a support vector machine with an intersection kernel to the time series data of vegetable samples collected in field. Our results showed that dense time series Sentinel-1A images are of high potential for vegetable classification. Be- sides using backscatter intensity, the polarimetric information can further improve the discrimination between three specific vegetable types.

AB  - The authors state the transition of the modern materialistic worldview paradigm to the idealistic paradigm. The transition to a new view of the nature of reality essentially turns modern education to the defining meanings of Plato's Paideia. The authors reinterpret greek paideia taking into account the current knowledge in science and philosophy. The methods used by the authors have complex cross-disciplinary character. They combine the following basic strategies: the history of ideas, analytics, comparativistics, and phenomenology. The authors conclude that the role of the teacher is changing in the Mental Universe Model or the "Evolving Matter," which forms the basis of an idealistic paradigm. The teacher turns into an important actor of a student's brain neuroprogramming, who is directly responsible for the quality of his work. The authors proposed three basic higher-level cognitive strategies by means of which the teacher embodies the reinterpreted and modernized achievements of the greek paideia. The interrelationship between a teacher and a student gains harmony and provides a joint ascent to the image of a higher idea or to universal consciousness if: 1) a teacher does not provide knowledge, but sets tasks and solves them with a student. 2) the full value of a student's self-realization depends directly on the usefulness of a teacher's self-realization. 3) choosing a teacher, a student chooses his way of life.

AB  - The grid-side energy storage power station is an important means of peak load cutting and valley filling, and it is a powerful guarantee for reliable power supply of the power system. The protection function of the energy storage power station is the sentinel of the safe operation of the power station, which is a key factor for its normal function. Based on the analysis of the operation mode of Lang Li energy storage power station, this paper studies the detection method of anti-island protection, and the configuration principle and scheme of anti-island protection are analyzed in detail. Finally, the coordination strategy with inverter anti-island protection is discussed to eliminate the problem of protection blind zone in the anti-island protection device, ensure safe and reliable operation of the grid-side energy storage power station, and provide effective support for power system peak shaving and fault.

AB  - The precisely and timely extraction of burned areas after forest fire plays an important role in reducing disaster losses, maintaining ecological balance and protecting forest resources. In this article, we propose a method of automatically extracting forest fire burned areas by using Gaofen-1 remote sensing images. Firstly, the geometric correction and atmospheric correction are carried out in Gaofen-1 WFV (Wide Field Viewer) images, and then the normalized vegetation index is calculated using the near-infrared band and red band. In the vegetation index results, the Otsu's method is used to set the threshold value to automatically obtain the burned areas. Taking the forest fire that occurred in the Daxing'anling Khanma Nature Reserve on June 2, 2018 as an example, the method can extract the burned areas fully automatically and the precision is better than 94%.

TI  - Variations of Surface and Subsurface Water Storage in the Lower Mekong Basin (Vietnam and Cambodia) from Multisatellite Observations
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we estimate monthly variations of surface-water storage (SWS) and subsurface water storage (SSWS, including groundwater and soil moisture) within the Lower Mekong Basin located in Vietnam and Cambodia during the 2003-2009 period. The approach is based on the combination of multisatellite observations using surface-water extent from MODIS atmospherically corrected land-surface imagery, and water-level variations from 45 virtual stations (VS) derived from ENVISAT altimetry measurements. Surface-water extent ranges from 6500 to 40,000 km2 during low and high water stages, respectively. Across the study area, seasonal variations of water stages range from 8 m in the upstream parts to 1 m in the downstream regions. Annual variation of SWS is 40 km3 for the 2003-2009 period that contributes to 40-45% of total water-storage (TWS) variations derived from Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) data. By removing the variations of SWS from GRACE-derived TWS, we can isolate the monthly variations of SSWS, and estimate its mean annual variations of 50 km3 (55-60% of the TWS). This study highlights the ability to combine multisatellite observations to monitor land-water storage and the variations of its different components at regional scale. The results of this study represent important information to improve the overall quality of regional hydrological models and to assess the impacts of human activities on the hydrological cycles.

TI  - Land use land cover changes along topographic gradients in Hugumburda national forest priority area, Northern Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the influence of topographic variability on land use land cover (LULC) change in Hugumburda national forest priority area. The study was based on three periods of LULC maps derived from satellite imageries: Landsat TM for 1985, Landsat ETM + for 2000 and Landsat OLI for 2015, and topographic attributes derived from ASTER digital elevation model. Supervised image classification was carried out using Maximum Likelihood classifier algorithm. Changes in LULC vis-a-vis topographic variability (altitude, slope and aspect) were assessed based on overlay analysis in a GIS environment. Six LULC classes were identified with an overall accuracy of 93% and Kappa statistics of 0.90. Shrubland and forest land were the dominant LULC types which respectively accounted for about 36% and 26% in 1985 and 39% and 33% in 2000. Forest land (35%) followed by shrubland (30%) continued to be the dominant LULC types in 2015. Between 1985 and 2015, about 23% of the study area showed changes in LULC which constitute increase in forest cover by about 715 ha mainly at the expense of shrubland. Steep slopes, higher altitudes and Northeast aspect were important topographic attributes where marked increased in forest cover was observed. The increase in forest cover along steep slopes, higher altitudes and Northeast aspect can be used to stimulate further expansion of forest cover along similar topographic conditions. This study demonstrated that topographic variability plays an important role in controlling LULC changes. Detailed investigation of drivers of the increased in forest cover is required to scale up the success in other regions with similar climatic and topographic settings.

TI  - What Does Unsustainable Urban Sprawl Bring? Spatial Patterns Analysis of Built Environment in Cluj Metropolitan Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF SETTLEMENTS AND SPATIAL PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl and population growth are the main triggers of land use reconversion around big cities. Due to the expansion of metropolitan areas, many land use categories (grasslands, arable lands, forests, pastures) have been transformed in living spaces. Determining the built-up area growth rate from satellite images, in correlation with demographics and dwellings data, leads to a better comprehension of sustainable urban development and the negative effects of chaotic urbanization. This study analyses the built-up area expansion growth rate in Cluj Metropolitan Area in 1991-2017 using the normalized difference built-up index and soil-adjusted vegetation index applied on Landsat imagery. Results highlight different spatial patterns within the studied area, based on the correlation between the growth rates of built-up area expansion and demographic data. The land use types most impacted by the urban sprawl are meadows and arable lands near the metropolitan centre and grassland in areas located at the periphery of the metropolitan area.

AB  - Coal fire has been found to be a major problem worldwide in coal mining areas. The surrounding areas get hugely affected, and significant amount of reserves are wasted due to the burning of coal. This severely affects the environment condition, which leads to a rise in temperature of the region, which is a major reason for climate change. Greenhouse gases like CO2 SO2 NO CH4 are also emitted from the cracks and fissures. Large masses of the burning of coal also causes land subsidence and collapse. Underground coal fires ignited by natural causes or human error leads to atmospheric pollution, acid rain, land subsidence, and increased coronary and respiratory diseases. They consume a valuable energy resource, destroy floral and faunal habitats, and promote human suffering because of heat, subsidence, and pollution. Jharia Coalfield, Jharkhand, India, is well known for being the storehouse of prime coking coal and for accommodating the maximum number of coal fires among all the coalfields in the country. In this paper, some of the important issues of coal fire mapping from satellite thermal infrared data have been addressed in particular reference to Jharia Coalfield. Namely, these are: retrieval of spectral radiance from raw digital satellite data using scene-specific calibration coefficients of the detectors from metadata, thermal emissivity of surface to obtain kinetic temperature at each ground resolution cell of satellite data, field-based modelling of pixel-integrated temperature for differentiating surface and subsurface fire pixels in Landsat 8 thermal IR data, identification of surface coal fire locations from infrared data and lateral propagation of coal fire.

AB  - Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) can be used for observing and monitoring land surface change over a large area using multi-temporal SAR images. To remove signal decorrelation issues of DInSAR, Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR) has come into practice over the last decade that can measure deformation at small scales and fine accuracy (mm-level). In this paper, we estimate ground deformation of Kolkata, India during 2007-2011 using a spatial correlation based PSInSAR method. Twenty L-band (ALOS PALSAR) SAR images along ascending orbit over Kolkata city were utilised to extract deformation time series, and a validation exercise was carried out using groundwater level data of two wells. PSInSAR extracted a large number of measurement points (363 per km(2) for a total 568014 points), and we found a mean annual deformation rate of -16 to +16 mm/year in Kolkata area along Line-Of-Sight (LOS) of ALOS PALSAR. Comparison between PSInSAR derived deformation and groundwater level fluctuation reveals a good correlation using time series analysis with some discrepancies.

AB  - DInSAR technique has been long used to observe and monitor ground surface changes over large areas. Multi-temporal SAR image datasets are used for such investigations. To eliminate the issues of signal decorrelation associated with DInSAR based processing, Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR) technique has come in a big way in the recent years where deformation studies at small scales and fine accuracy (mm-level) have been attempted and measured. In this paper, ground deformation of the area near Naples, Italy has been estimated for the year 2014 using a spatial correlation based PSInSAR method. Here, Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) SLC (ascending orbit, single polarisation, stripmap Himage mode) images of Very High Resolution (VHR) were used in this study due to its capability to detect small-scale ground deformation signal over an urban area. The PSInSAR processing, used here, involves two stage selection of PS points or stable scatterers, with the coregistered SLCs and differential interferograms, using amplitude and phase analysis. The PSInSAR results were validated using time series data of two continuous GPS (cGPS) stations over the same period for the study area. The mean deformation rate over the study area was observed to be varying from -15 to +18 mm/year along line-of-sight (LOS) of Cosmo-SkyMed. Comparison between PSI derived deformation time series and cGPS measurements reveal a good correlation with minimal discrepancies. Additionally, distinct differences were observed between the PS based LOS displacements with those obtained from cGPS based observations in case of one station compared to the other.

AB  - We present a study to improve automation and accuracy on a Woody Savannah burned areas' classification process through the use of Machine Learning (ML) classification models. The reference method for this is to extract polygons from images through segmentation and identify changes in polygons extracted from images taken from the same area but in different times through manual labeling. However, not all differences correspond to burned areas: there are also deforestation, change in crops, and clouds. Our objective is to identify the changed areas caused by fire. We propose an approach that employs polygons' attributes for classification and evaluation in order to identify changes caused by fire. This paper presents the more relevant classifier models to the problem, highlighting Random Forest and an Ensemble model, that achieved better results. The developed approach is validated over a study area in the Brazilian Woody Savannah against reference data derived from classifications manually done by experts. The results indicate enhancement of the methods used so far, and will eventually be applied to more data from different areas and biomes.

AB  - The urban area of Las Vegas expanded rapidly between 1990 and 2010 covering large areas of native desert landscape with urban materials. These alterations to the surfaces change the thermal processes in the immediate region. In this research, we study the relation between air temperature and surface temperature in Las Vegas by comparing ground weather station temperature data to land surface temperature images from the Landsat thematic mapper. Urban heat island intensity (UHII) is estimated based on noon and midnight air temperature. The thermometric air and remotely sensed surface temperature are related and used to interpolate UHII for Las Vegas. The resultant UHII map was compared with Landsat 5 true color composite images and a 2006 tree canopy coverage created by the Southern Nevada Water Authority. We find that places with strong UHII typically have less urban development and sparse vegetation. New residential developments in an arid region with high surface vegetation have a cooling effect on the temperature. Averaging the UHII values in areas with similar land use zones show that industrial and commercial areas average a UHI index value that is 0.3 greater than residential land use zone.

T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study reveals the features of ionospheric parameters variations during the geomagnetic storm of September 7-8, 2017. In particular, parameters of vertical (foF2, foEs) and oblique ionospheric sounding (MOF, modes), absorption level, Total Electron Content (TEC) and particle fluxes at high altitudes were under analysis. The storm was characterized by two Dst-index mimima and can be considered as a sequence of two storms: first - with Dstmin = -142 nT at 02 UT on September 8th and second - with Dstmin = -122 nT and at 15 UT on September 8th. It was found that these two storms had different impacts on the ionosphere and HF propagation at mid and high-latitudes of Northern Hemisphere. The signals of vertical and oblique ionospheric sounding were present in all ionograms before the first storm. Further, at the maximum of the first storm these signals were totally absorbed. Then, before the second storm and during its maximum the signals were detected again in the ionograms due to the low absorption. GOES satellite data showed the significant burst of electrons and protons only during the first storm and small particle fluxes - during the second storm. This feature was also confirmed with GPS data: TEC increased during the first storm and decreased during the second storm. (C) 2018 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Ultra-staging as a Supplement for Endometrial Cancer Intraoperative Frozen Section Deficiencies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - For endometrial cancer (EC), most surgeons rely on intraoperative frozen section (IFS) to determine the risk of nodal metastasis and necessity of lymphadenectomy. IFS remains a weak link in this practice due to its susceptibility to diagnostic errors. As a less invasive alternative, sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and ultra-staging have gradually gained acceptance for EC. We aimed to establish the SLN success rate, negative predictive value, and whether SLNs provide useful information for cases misdiagnosed on IFS. From 2013 to 2017, 100 patients (63 low-risk and 37 high-risk EC) underwent hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and SLN. Among them, 56 had additional pelvic lymphadenectomy. A total of 337 SLNs were obtained in 86 cases: 55 bilaterally and 31 unilaterally. The remaining 14 cases failed because of patient obesity or leiomyoma. Pathology ultra-staging detected 2 positive SLNs from 2 patients (1 with isolated tumor cells, 1 with micrometastases). One of 773 nonsentinel pelvic nodes was positive on the contralateral hemi-pelvis in a patient who was mapped unilaterally, resulting in negative predictive value of 100%. During IFS, tumor grade and/or depth of myometrial invasion was misdiagnosed in 22 cases (22%). These errors would have resulted in under-staging in 10 high-risk patients or over-staging in 4 low-risk patients. SLNs were mapped in these misestimated patients, with one revealing metastases. SLN provides invaluable information on nodal status while detecting occult metastases in cases misdiagnosed on IFS. Our findings justify the incorporation of SLN in initial surgery for EC as an offset to IFS diagnostic errors, minimizing their negative impact on patient care.

AB  - In this paper, we evaluate the possibility of using a machine learning Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) approach to monitor Chlorophyll-a content in Arctic waters by using the Sentinel 3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument. We develop the GPR model on a synthetic dataset, which represents both open ocean and coastal Arctic waters. This allows the model to be exposed to and trained on data from both kinds of aquatic environments. The chosen GPR model has previously been trained and tested in a different aquatic environment, representing a variety of complexity conditions, where it was demonstrated to have strong generalization capabilities. Our results suggest that this model can also be used for diverse Arctic water conditions as well.

TI  - Reduction in Length of Stay and Morphine Use for NAS With the "Eat, Sleep, Console" Method.
T2  - Hospital pediatrics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To reduce average length of stay (ALOS) in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) transferred to the inpatient floor from the mother-infant unit. Secondarily, we aimed to reduce morphine exposure in these infants.METHODS: Using quality improvement methodology, we redesigned our approach to NAS on the inpatient floor. Key interventions included transitioning from a modified Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System to the "Eat, Sleep, Console" method for withdrawal assessment, reeducation on nonpharmacologic interventions, and adding as-needed morphine as initial pharmacotherapy. Data for infants ≥35 weeks' gestation with confirmed in utero opioid exposure and worsening symptoms of NAS requiring transfer to the inpatient floor were obtained, including ALOS, number of morphine doses, and total morphine amount administered. Infants with conditions requiring nothing by mouth for >12 hours or morphine initiation in the ICU were excluded.RESULTS: ALOS for infants (baseline n = 40; intervention n = 36) with NAS transferred to the inpatient floor decreased from 10.3 to 4.9 days. Average morphine administered decreased from 38 to 0.3 doses per infant. No infant in the intervention period required scheduled morphine. The percent of all infants transferred to the floor for NAS requiring any morphine decreased from 92% at baseline to 19% postimplementation. There were no observed adverse events or NAS-related readmissions in the intervention period.CONCLUSIONS: Transitioning to the Eat, Sleep, Console assessment with re-enforcement of nonpharmacologic care and use of as-needed morphine as initial pharmacotherapy resulted in a notably decreased ALOS and near elimination of postnatal opioid treatment of infants with NAS managed on our inpatient floor.

AB  - This article argues that descriptive representation, or demographic similarities between legislators and the public, can provide effective substantive representation of citizens concerns. We examine representation through the lens of opinion congruence or alignment in the policy preferences of legislators and citizens sharing various identities. Congruence may result from shared material interests or from self-selection into an identity group on the basis of policy views, but it can also be a product of networks and organizations that socialize masses and elites into a common worldview. Though political parties were historically the most important agents of political socialization, we argue that religious organizations constitute a more powerful socializing force in many new democracies. Examining the case of Brazil, we draw on three legislative surveys and fifteen mass surveys to analyze congruence across seven issue areas. Legislators and voters from underrepresented groups--women, Afro-Brazilians, evangelical Christians, and those of lower social class--are generally closer in their opinions than those sharing a party or electoral district. Evangelicals are often the most congruent. Analyzing original surveys of congregations and clergy, we argue that this finding results from the socializing role of churches.

TI  - Modeling Scattering Differences between Sea Ice Ridges
T2  - OCEANS 2019 - MARSEILLE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - OCEANS - Marseille Conference
CL  - Marseille, FRANCE
AB  - Sea ice ridges pose some of the greatest threats to navigation in polar and sub-polar regions and it is important to characterize ridges using remote sensing data. First year (FY) ridges and multi-year (MY) ridges may be present in the same region, but MY ridges are stronger and have the potential to cause greater damage to vessels and structures. A new approach has been developed to model electromagnetic (EM) scattering from sea ice ridges. Ridges are represented as having a rough surface over horizontally stratified and isotropic layers. The total scatter from the ridge is the sum of the scatter from the surface and the layers. This paper provides an overview of the modeling process and provides some initial simulation results showing the impacts of radar frequency and ice salinity on the scattered wave. Ice ridge surface and structure characteristics affect the nature of the scattered signal and additional work is required to determine if it is possible to reliably distinguish between ridge types. Future work will involve simulations using more detailed modeling of ice ridge profiles to better determine how radar frequency and ice ridge structure and phenology affect ice discrimination.

TI  - Influenza vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation due to laboratory-confirmed influenza in children in England in the 2015-2016 influenza season - a test-negative case-control study
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - England has recently started a newpaediatric influenza vaccine programme using a live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). There is uncertainty over how well the vaccine protects against more severe end-points. A test-negative case-control study was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) in vaccine-eligible children aged 2-16 years of age in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalisation in England in the 2015-2016 season using a national sentinel laboratory surveillance system. Logistic regression was used to estimate the VE with adjustment for sex, risk-group, age group, region, ethnicity, deprivation and month of sample collection. A total of 977 individuals were included in the study (348 cases and 629 controls). The overall adjusted VE for all study ages and vaccine types was 33.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-54.6) after adjusting for age group, sex, index of multiple deprivation, ethnicity, region, sample month and risk group. Risk group was shown to be an important confounder. The adjusted VE for all influenza types for the live-attenuated vaccine was 41.9% (95% CI 7.3-63.6) and 28.8% (95% CI -31.1 to 61.3) for the inactivated vaccine. The study provides evidence of the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in preventing hospitalisation due to laboratory-confirmed influenza in children in 2015-2016 and continues to support the rollout of the LAIV childhood programme.

TI  - Relationships Among Immature-Stage Metrics and Adult Abundances of Mosquito Populations in Baltimore, MD
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing water-holding containers that provide habitat for immature-stage (eggs, larvae, pupae) mosquitoes is often an effective means of managing urban mosquito-borne diseases. It is generally accepted that adult mosquito abundances are strongly influenced by the availability of container habitat. Yet few studies have directly examined if adult abundances are associated with the presence and abundance of immature stages among city blocks, which is the spatial scale at which common urban mosquitoes disperse and management is often conducted. In this study, we compared larval and pupal population metrics to adult female abundances of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Culex pipiens/restuans (Diptera: Culicidae) across 12 blocks in four socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods in Baltimore, MD. Aedes albopictus and Cx. pipiens/restuans were the most abundant taxa, constituting 81.8 and 95.8% of collected adult and immature-stage individuals, respectively. Despite being collected on all blocks in all neighborhoods, adult female Ae. albopictus but not Cx. pipiens/restuans were predicted by immature-stage population metrics. Adult female Ae. albopictus abundance was positively and consistently predicted by the mean number of occupied discarded containers per parcel across the four socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Our results suggest that immature-stage monitoring in landscapes dominated by container habitat may not be an effective predictor of adult Cx. pipiens/restuans abundance, but removing discarded container habitat should be a priority action to manage Ae. albopictus, which is usually the most pestiferous species in temperate cities in the eastern United States and many regions worldwide.

TI  - Integrating snow science and wildlife ecology in Arctic-boreal North America
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow covers Arctic and boreal regions (ABRs) for approximately 9 months of the year, thus snowscapes dominate the form and function of tundra and boreal ecosystems. In recent decades, Arctic warming has changed the snowcover's spatial extent and distribution, as well as its seasonal timing and duration, while also altering the physical characteristics of the snowpack. Understanding the little studied effects of changing snowscapes on its wildlife communities is critical. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the urgent need for, and suggest an approach for developing, an improved suite of temporally evolving, spatially distributed snow products to help understand how dynamics in snowscape properties impact wildlife, with a specific focus on Alaska and northwestern Canada. Via consideration of existing knowledge of wildlife-snow interactions, currently available snow products for focus region, and results of three case studies, we conclude that improving snow science in the ABR will be best achieved by focusing efforts on developing data-model fusion approaches to produce fitfor-purpose snow products that include, but are not limited to, wildlife ecology. The relative wealth of coordinated in situ measurements, airborne and satellite remote sensing data, and modeling tools being collected and developed as part of NASA's Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment and SnowEx campaigns, for example, provide a data rich environment for developing and testing new remote sensing algorithms and retrievals of snowscape properties.

TI  - Spectrum of illness in migrants to Canada: sentinel surveillance through CanTravNet
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Due to ongoing political instability and conflict in many parts of the world, migrants are increasingly seeking asylum and refuge in Canada.Methods We examined demographic and travel correlates of illnesses among migrants to Canada to establish a detailed epidemiologic framework of this population for Canadian practitioners. Data on ill-returned Canadian travellers presenting to a CanTravNet site between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2015 were analyzed.Results During the study period, 2415 ill travellers and migrants presented to a CanTravNet site, and of those, 519 (21.5%) travelled for the purpose of migration. Sub-Saharan Africa (n = 160, 30.8%), southeast Asia (n = 84, 16.2%) and south central Asia (n = 75, 14.5%) were the most common source regions for migrants, while the top specific source countries, of 98 represented, were the Philippines (n = 45, 8.7%), China (n = 36, 6.9%) and Vietnam (n = 31, 6.0%). Compared with non-migrant travellers, migrants were more likely to have a pre-existing immunocompromising medical condition, such as HIV or diabetes mellitus (P < 0.0001), and to require inpatient management of their illness (P < 0.0001). Diagnoses such as tuberculosis (n = 263, 50.7%), hepatitis B and C (n = 78, 15%) and HIV (n = 11, 2.1%) were over-represented in the migrant population compared with non-migrant travellers (P < 0.0001). Most cases of tuberculosis in the migrant population (n = 263) were latent (82% [n = 216]); only 18% (n = 47) were active.Conclusions Compared with non-migrant travellers, migrants were more likely to present with a communicable infectious disease, such as tuberculosis, potentially complicated by an underlying immunosuppressing condition such as HIV. These differences highlight the divergent healthcare needs in the migrant population, and underscore the importance of surveillance programmes to understand their burden of illness. Intake programming should be adequately resourced to accommodate the medical needs of this vulnerable population of new Canadians.

TI  - Persistence of leprosy in household social networks: overlapping cases and vulnerability in endemic regions in Brazil
T2  - CADERNOS DE SAUDE PUBLICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study sought to analyze the magnitude of occurrence and the sociodemographic, economic and clinical profiles of leprosy associated with household social networks (HSN), with disease overlap in cities from the states of Bahia, Piaui and Rondonia, Brazil, from 2001 to 2014. This is a cross-sectional study using primary and secondary data regarding new cases of leprosy notified to the Brazilian Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN, in Portuguese) residing in the cities. We applied a standardized instrument to the new cases and reviewed data from charts and from SINAN. Of a total of 1,032 (29.6%) assessed cases, .538 (.521%) had more than one case in their HSN. There were larger frequencies of female sex (292; 54.3%), age between 41 and 60 years (240; 44.6%), primary education (272; .50.6%), income lower than the minimum wage (265; 49.3%) and living with 5 or more people (26.5; 49.3%). The overlap of cases in the HSN was associated in the multivariate analysis with residing in cities in the state of Rondonia (PR = 1.2.3; 95%CI: 1.07-1.43; p = 0.003), as well as living with 3 to 4 people in the same household (PR = 1.66; 95%CI: 1.112.49; p = 0.014) and having leprosy reaction (PR = 1.31; 95%CI: 0.99-1.70; p = 0050). Case repetition within the same HSN is a frequent event in the situations we studied. Its occurrence must be considered as a sentinel indicator of greater epidemiological severity in primary health care surveillance. We highlight the vulnerability of affected families.

AB  - TerraSAR-X and its almost identical twin satellite TanDEM-X have provided high resolution radar images and Digital Elevation Models with unprecedented accuracy for years. Between December 2010 and early 2015, radar data of all land surfaces has been acquired and as of September 2016 the final global DEM dataset has been available. Furthermore a science phase generating radar products for scientific and technology related applications, was successfully conducted. As the satellites are still in good condition and resources are plentiful their mission was extended to generate a change layer as an update of the global DEM. This paper gives a summary of the current mission status and future planning. Furthermore, an outline of the proposed future L-band mission Tandem-L is drawn.

TI  - Seasonal monitoring of urban heat island using multi-temporal Landsat and MODIS images in Tehran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the relationship between seasonal changes in land surface temperature (LST) and various land use/land cover (LULC) classes in Tehran in 2010. For this purpose, urban heat island (UHI) cores were detected. The relationship between spatiotemporal variations of UHIs and the LULC classes was studied. The results showed that UHIs have different causes due to the type of LULC classes in the region. The average temperature of the five LULC classes in different seasons revealed full compliance of the spreading pattern of UHIs in the city with the type of LULC. Daytime and nighttime MODIS LST maps were prepared to verify the results. The daytime LST map also confirmed the compliance of the spatial pattern of UHIs with the types of LULC. The consequences from the nighttime LST map revealed the movement and conduction of main cores of heat islands towards the central and densely populated areas of the city, which could be expected to be due to the high absorption rate of heat during the day by unnatural materials and energy emissions at night.

T2  - ADVANCES IN NEURAL NETWORKS - ISNN 2019, PT II
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 16th International Symposium on Neural Networks (ISNN)
CL  - Moscow, RUSSIA
AB  - In response to the growing importance of geospatial data, its analysis including semantic segmentation becomes an increasingly popular task in computer vision today. Convolutional neural networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features and practitioners widely use them to process remote sensing data. When performing remote sensing image segmentation, multiple instances of one class with precisely defined boundaries are often the case, and it is crucial to extract those boundaries accurately. The accuracy of segments boundaries delineation influences the quality of the whole segmented areas explicitly. However, widely-used segmentation loss functions such as BCE, IoU loss or Dice loss do not penalize misalignment of boundaries sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, namely a differentiable surrogate of a metric accounting accuracy of boundary detection. We can use the loss function with any neural network for binary segmentation. We performed validation of our loss function with various modifications of UNet on a synthetic dataset, as well as using real-world data (ISPRS Potsdam, INRIA AIL). Trained with the proposed loss function, models outperform baseline methods in terms of IoU score.

TI  - Occurrence, evolution and ice content of ice-debris complexes in the Ak-Shiirak, Central Tien Shan revealed by geophysical and remotely-sensed investigations
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rock glaciers and large ice-debris complexes are common in many mountain ranges and are especially prominent in semi-arid mountains such as the Andes or the Tien Shan. These features contain a significant amount of ice but their occurrence and evolution are not well known. Here, we present an inventory of the ice-debris complexes for the Ak-Shiirak, Tien Shan's second largest glacierised massif, and a holistic methodology to investigate two characteristic and large ice-debris complexes in detail based on field investigations and remote sensing analysis using Sentinel-1 SAR data, 1964 Corona and recent high resolution stereo images. Overall, we found 74 rock glaciers and ice-debris complexes covering an area of 11.2 km(2) (3.2% of the glacier coverage) with a mean elevation of about 3950 m asl. Most of the complexes are located south-east of the main ridge of Ak-Shiirak. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) measurements reveal high ice content with the occurrence of massif debris-covered dead-ice bodies in the parts within the Little Ice Age glacier extent. These parts showed significant surface lowering, in some places exceeding 20 m between 1964 and 2015. The periglacial parts are characterised by complex rock glaciers of different ages. These rock glaciers could be remnants of debris-covered ice located in permafrost conditions. They show stable surface elevations with no or only very low surface movement. However, the characteristics of the fronts of most rock glacier parts indicate slight activity and elevation gains at the fronts slight advances. GPR data indicated less ice content and slanting layers which coincide with the ridges and furrows and could mainly be formed by glacier advances under permafrost conditions. Overall, the ice content is decreasing from the upper to the lower part of the ice-debris complexes. Hence, these complexes, and especially the glacier-affected parts, should be considered when assessing the hydrological impacts of climate change. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

CP  - SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications X held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - With our study presented at the SPIE conference "Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications" last year, we discussed a concept for change analysis in sequences of SAR sub-aperture images. The main aspect of this concept is to investigate an adaption of our approach for incoherent time series change analysis on such short-term time series data.In a first step, sub-aperture amplitude images of two maritime scenes were calculated leading to time series stacks being considered as input for our incoherent change detection method. As output, so-called ActivityMaps (AMs) were constructed aiming on a recognition of high activity areas. Focusing on short-term time series, such areas are caused by Ground Moving Targets (GMTs) which denote objects that were in motion during the image acquisition. With respect to the maritime scenes considered in this study, GMTs might be ships, cars, trucks, cranes with moving components, etc. It was observed, that GMTs show different signatures in the AMs, depending for example on their size and their velocity.In the paper at hand, we link to this previous study by discussing different features being reliable for a later categorization of the detected change objects. Moreover, it is investigated, whether High Activity Objects (HAOs) are of solely interest, or, if other change objects have to be included. The relevance of the discussed features to produce categories being clearly distinguishable from each other is tested by an unsupervised clustering procedure. As test data, a TerraSAR-X (TSX) Staring Spotlight (ST) Single Look Complex (SLC) image of Rotterdam (NED) was used.

AB  - This paper presents a conceptual system design by which the requirements of the Landsat mission, or Sentinel-2, or potential commercial missions may be accomplished and extended. For simplicity, I will just refer to Landsat or Smart Landsat (SL). These new methods enable the Landsat system to significantly increase the quality of the information acquired while meeting all of the requirements of the Landsat Mission. The key difference between the old and new Landsat system designs is in the data acquisition strategy. The traditional Landsat acquires images of all the Earth's surface it passes over. This means that the vast majority of the data is redundant as most of the surface had not changed since the previous data acquisition. The Smart Landsat (SL) employs active data acquisition rather than passive. This means that it only acquires data from areas that are changing. In other words, it acquires Information.

AB  - Classical methods for image segmentation such as pixel thresholding, clustering, region growing, maximum likelihood have been used regularly and relied on for a long time. However, these classical methods have limitations, particularly on images where there are many overlapping pixel values between features, which is common in remote sensing images. The advent of machine learning, in particular, deep learning in computer vision and image analysis, has gained interest in the remote sensing field. Current deep learning architecture has been able to achieve high accuracy for image recognition, object detection, and segmentation. This study performed image segmentation on the coastal area with high water turbidity using Landsat-8 images. Currently, the standard tool to derive water turbidity data from Landsat-8 images is the level-2 plugin of SEADAS software. However, due to its rigorous processing method, the processing time using SEADAS Level-2 Plugin is quite long; for example, processing one Landsat-8 image took around 8 hours. As a consequence, the amount of time needed to process multiple images is increasing. Deep learning has advantages once the model trained, the inference or prediction process is quite fast. Therefore it has the potential to be used as a complementary tool to predict and segment high turbidity areas, because in deep learning. In this study, we implemented U-Net architecture with ResNet connection and used Generative-Adversarial Network (GAN) to refined segmentation results.

AB  - In this study, we propose the SUHI analysis of the Bangkok megacity, Thailand, from two standpoints: exploiting satellite thermal data at lower spatial resolution (from MODIS, 1-km pixel size) and at higher spatial resolution (from Landsat 8, 100-m pixel size). First, Bangkok was monitored during a long-time interval (2003-2016), both daytime and nighttime, using 728 MODIS scenes. To analyze the SUHI patterns in terms of temporal and spatial trends, a two-dimensional Gaussian fitting technique was applied to quantify the phenomenon. Results highlight that SUHI in the daytime is more evident with respect to nighttime, mainly due to the solar forcing and to the intense traffic and human activities. The SUHI maximum intensities are during daytime, with values reaching 6 degrees C; during nighttime, they are around 1-2 degrees C. Then, by means of seven Landsat 8 images in the time interval 2014-2016, the SUHI pattern analysis within the land use categories of the Bangkok zoning plan was performed. This monitoring not only describes the current situation, but also provides a perspective insight of the municipal urban plan policy. Overall, the analysis shows that the classes in the city center area, i.e. high-density residential, commercial, historical and military categories, exhibit the highest mean SUHI intensities. The vegetated pixels of these classes exert a less cool effect with respect to the ones placed far from the city core.

AB  - The article sets the task to find explanations for the structural, architectural, and artistic features of the Acropolis of Athens in the mythological conceptions of the ancient Greeks regarding the cosmic world order. For this purpose, correlations of the objects located on the Acropolis, with their probable heavenly prototypes imprinted on the starry sky are carried out. It is established that the terrestrial projection of constellations corresponded to such turn of the sky at which the Milky Way followed a latitudinal direction, and the plane of ecliptic surrounded by a belt of the Zodiac rose in the West and lowered in eastern direction. In general, the Acropolis was like the ship Argo, aimed at the rising sun. Its southern - right side corresponded with the constellations of the Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio, and the northern - left - Taurus, Aries, Pisces and Aquarius. The first of them was associated with the mother earth and the light wise maiden Athena, while the second one - with the dark and stormy water elements embodied by Poseidon.

TI  - Mapping of Lineament Structures from Aeromagnetic and Landsat Data Over Ankpa Area of Lower Benue Trough, Nigeria
T2  - OPEN PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Structural analysis of aeromagnetic and Landsat data over Ankpa area, Benue state was carried out to delineate the basement topography, hydrocarbon potentials, groundwater availability and the structures that control basin formation. The Landsat imagery generated from this study was further processed using Geomatica software (version 9.0). The results obtained revealed that the drainage pattern is dendritic which could be associated to the lithological, structural and topographic differences. Also, this may indicate the presence of alluvial rocks, typically of the same geology, mainly of sedimentary rocks. This present study is in good agreement with the areas in the lineament map of high-density structures. The observation showed that the study area constitutes densely lineaments that cut across each other, which may be attributed to groundwater availability and upward migration of hydrocarbon-bearing formation. The structural trend is predominantly in the NE-SW direction and agrees with the Landsat data structural trends. Significantly, this NE-SW trend is in agreement with the trend of Benue Trough (NE -SW) and could be that they have the same structural control.

AB  - Field surveys are an important part of a sustainable forest management. Using GIS technology and software in forest monitoring maximizes the value of timber resources, decreases expenses, minimizes the catastrophic ecological and financial impacts of illegal land clearings and improves forest management with information collection, map analytics and remote sensing solutions. The paper presents a working methodology based on the GIS technology for forestry monitoring. Using this modern technology, applied to the Romanian national forest fund, a series of thematic maps were developed in order to track the deforested or reforested areas. LANDSAT raster images, CORINE Land Cover layers from 2000 to 2015, as well as local thematic GIS layers were used in order to create the specific maps. The paper is intended to assist government and regional authorities in identifying possibilities for improving the effectiveness of current forest surveillance capacities and reducing illegal deforestation.

TI  - A Radical Reinterpretation of Quinean Naturalism and Its View of Consciousness
T2  - FILOSOFIJA-SOCIOLOGIJA
M3  - Article
AB  - McGinn maintains that Quinean naturalism cannot provide a viable position in the debate on the existence of consciousness and the external world for it does not have a place for phenomenal experience in its naturalized epistemology. In effect, it cannot or will refuse to address any version of a sceptic's argwnent regarding the lack of sufficient grounds to prove the existence of consciousness and the external world. I argue otherwise by pointing out that Quinean naturalism must provide an account of phenomenal experience to ensure the consistency of its epistemic and ontic assumptions with its naturalistic worldview. In the process, I demonstrate that Quinean naturalism allows us to infer that the best explanation for the existence of both consciousness and the external world can be derived from how the roles of subjectivity and objectivity in our creation and assessment of our conceptual schemes arc primarily derived from our phenomenal experience of the external world.
