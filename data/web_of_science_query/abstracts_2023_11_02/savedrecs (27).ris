TI  - Introducing a merged precipitation satellite model using satellite precipitation products, land surface temperature, and precipitable water vapor
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite precipitation have a lot of uncertainty and the spatial resolution is still quite coarse. Hence, the purpose of this study is to introduce a new approach based on multivariate linear modelling and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for the first time using four multisource satellite precipitation products and some other satellite data. Four different satellite precipitation products with different algorithms, along with Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) data on a daily scale were used (to benefit interactions of atmospheric content). Five linear merge models, including five ANN models were introduced and calibrated using harmony search algorithm. The performance of the models was evaluated over Iran using observational rainfall data of 2014 to 2020. The findings of this study highlighted that the model based on ANN, which merged four rainfall products together with LST and PWV has outperformed individual satellite products and other presented models.

TI  - GEOPOLITICAL MAP OF FYODOR DOSTOEVSKY'S WORLD: A SYSTEMATIC DESCRIPTION
T2  - TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZDANIE-TEXT BOOK PUBLISHING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the study lies in the facts that it explores the issues related to the global significance of Dostoevsky's literary heritage and interdisciplinary approaches to analyzing Russian literature. The significance of the study is stipulated by the current state of scientific knowledge concerning a particular role of literary works in describing and interpreting global political and state processes. The aim of the study is to reconstruct and map Dostoevsky's geopolitical worldview based on the analysis of his literary and journalistic works. To consider the writer's works from the standpoint of his involvement into the political issues is the first attempt within Dostoevsky studies. The analysis of Dostoevsky's literary heritage from a geopolitical perspective was carried out on the basis of Statisticheskiy slovar' yazyka Dostoevskogo [ Statistical Dictionary of Dostoevsky's Language]. However, since this book does not contain draft notes and earlier versions, preliminary drafts and notebook materials, these texts were intentionally explored. This is the first literary study of its kind which is based on a variety of modern statistical methods. This fact makes it possible to state that the obtained results present new knowledge about Dostoevsky and are of undisputed novelty. The study is focused on big geopolitical subjects, i.e. countries, transnational and national unions, prominent regions; therefore, the present article is only the first stage of the study. In accordance with the conducted analysis and calculations, the following frequency of geopolitical subjects' mentions is proposed: Russia (4420); France (848); Germany (735); Britain (397); Turkey (304); Siberia (223); Italy (173); Switzerland (172); Poland (145); Austria (141); America (119); Bulgaria ( 83); Serbia (83); China (49); Spain (40); Montenegro (38); Caucasus (38); Crimea (30); Egypt (26); Greece (23); Hungary (19); Balkans (18); Central Asia (18); Holland (15); Syria (14); Herzegovina (13); Novorossiya (10); Sweden (7); Japan (6); Altai (5); Arabia, Africa, Bosnia, Dagestan, India, Lithuania, Mexico, Sicily, Finland (each 4); Belgium, Iceland, Malta, Peru, Sandwich Islands (each 3); Brazil, Brittany, Denmark, Israel, Moldova, Romania, Sakhalin (each 2); and Galicia (1). The frequency of geopolitical subjects' mentions by years is as follows: 1877 (2100), 1876 (1516), 1860 (567), 1880 (502), 1872 (388), 1873 (381), 1868 (366), 1862 (328), 1866 (265), 1875 (264), 1869 (170), 1863 (155), 1881 (135), 1867 (128), 1878 (122), 1864 (120), 1859 (102), 1874 (100), 1870 (96), 1856 (75), 1861 (61), 1871 (54), 1865 (52), 1846 (43), 1847 (41), 1849 ( 38), 1858 (25), 1854 (21), 1848 (15), 1857 (12), 1845 (5), 1843-1844 (3), 1838-1839 (2), 1879 (1); geopolitical subjects were not mentioned in 1841, 1842, 1850, 1851, 1852, 1853, and 1855.

TI  - Soil-climate factors have a greater influence on the presence of winter cover crops than regulatory constraints in France
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the benefits associated with winter soil cover before sowing a spring crop, this practice is adopted unevenly by farmers. The goal of this paper is to identify and hierarchize the main soil-climate factors that hinder the adoption of cover crops. It is the first study to carry out this analysis at the scale of France, which is a country with a wide variety of soil types and climates. For this country, maps of vegetated winter soil cover prior to the establishment of a spring crop were previously produced for years 2018 and 2019, using Sentinel-2 multispectral images. For approximately half of France's acreage with spring crops, the estimation concerning the presence or absence of a winter cover crop was correlated here with the main soil-climate factors of each field. The inclusion within Nitrate Vulnerable Zones is another potentially important variable to explain cover crop adoption, as regulatory requirements of the Nitrates Directives strongly encourage winter soil cover in these zones to reduce nitrogen losses. Because of the regulatory requirements of the Nitrates Directives regarding winter soil cover, the influence of being located in a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone was also evaluated. But despite these incentives for winter soil cover, inclusion in a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone had little influence on cover crop adoption. Principal component analyses performed for different crop rotations showed that the clay content was the soil-climate factor most negatively correlated with the adoption of cover crops. Cover crops were more frequently established on sandy fields with high organic carbon stocks, which corresponds rather to the characteristics of livestock regions. The development of technical solutions for the establishment and destruction of winter cover crops on clay soils could facilitate the adoption of these crops, and thus improve global water quality.

TI  - Remote sensing of the decant pond of tailings dams: Insights from a South African case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High-profile failures of tailings dams illustrate the significant safety challenge they pose. The decant pond of such facilities plays an important role in their mechanical stability. This study investigates the feasibility of using public multispectral data collected by the Sentinel-2 satellite mission to monitor the area of the decant pond. The Sentinel-2 mission has a revisit time of 5 days and the data used herein has a spatial resolution of 10 m/pixel. We considered two water-detection metrics: the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the near-infrared (NIR) reflectance. Implementation of the method at a South African platinum tailings dam illustrates the capabilities and limitations. Public, sub-metre resolution true-colour imagery served as validation data. There is good agreement between pond area measurements based on Sentinel-2 and the validation imagery. These results suggest the feasibility of using Sentinel-2 data to supplement the monitoring of the decant pond.

TI  - Life Course and Emerging Adulthood: Protestant Women's Views on Intimate Partner Violence and Divorce
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - There are inconsistent findings on the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and religiosity or Biblical inerrancy. The Biblical text accepts divorce in cases of infidelity and desertion-but does not specify abuse or IPV as legitimate reasons. In this study, I interviewed twenty White Protestant women (ages 18-22) at a large southern university. In emerging adulthood, a critical period for young adults (ages 18-29), I examined their current levels of religious participation, beliefs in Biblical inerrancy, and their perceptions of IPV as a legitimate reason for divorce. During this process of identity formation as emerging adults, they may reevaluate their religious socialization and parents' values as well as engage in various social relationships, including romantic ones. Emerging adult women are also at the highest risk for IPV. The findings suggest Protestant women in emerging adulthood reevaluated their religious socialization to formulate a more adaptive worldview. Their religious participation and belief in Biblical inerrancy declined during emerging adulthood and they all accepted divorce as acceptable in cases of IPV. It is an important finding because they are in a key period of potential IPV exposure in their life course.

AB  - CASE: A 37-year-old pregnant woman arrived at our hospital with an abnormal mammogram.MEDICAL HISTORY: Mammography performed in June 2018 revealed an abnormal shadow on the left breast. Cytology from the 6-mm tumor in the left upper-outer quadrant revealed a malignancy. At the same time, a transvaginal echo revealed cysts, and the patient was diagnosed at 5 weeks gestation. Needle biopsy revealed a luminal A-like cStage Ⅰ, cT1bN0M0 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Tumor resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed under local anesthesia at 12 weeks gestation, and post-delivery adjuvant therapy was planned. Histologic examination of the resected tumor revealed that it was HER2-positive( immunohistochemistry score 3+); therefore, we had to reconsider the use of trastuzumab and decided to administer it to the patient after childbirth. The patient gave birth by cesarean section, and weekly paclitaxel plus trastuzumab was initiated 7 months after surgery. The patient is currently alive without recurrence.DISCUSSION: We faced several difficulties during the treatment of this patient. Postoperative adjuvant therapy is recommended to be administered 8 weeks after the surgical resection of the tumor. However, in our case, given that the tumor was HER2-positive, we could administer adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab only after delivery. Although the prevalence of breast cancer in women below the age of 40 years in Japan is currently as low as 4-6%, the incidence of pregnancy-associated breast cancer is predicted to increase as the number of elderly primigravida increases due to later marriage.

TI  - METASTABILITY IN LOSS NETWORKS WITH DYNAMIC ALTERNATIVE ROUTING
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED PROBABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Consider N stations interconnected with links, each of capacity K, forming a complete graph. Calls arrive to each link at rate lambda and depart at rate 1. If a call arrives to a link xy, connecting stations x and y, which is at capacity, then a third station z is chosen uniformly at random and the call is attempted to be routed via z: if both links xz and zy have spare capacity, then the call is held simultaneously on these two; otherwise the call is lost.We analyse an approximation of this model. We show rigorously that there are three phases according to the traffic intensity alpha := lambda/K: for alpha is an element of (0, alpha(c)) boolean OR (1, infinity), the system has mixing time logarithmic in the number of links n := ((N)(2)); for alpha is an element of (alpha(c), 1) the system has mixing time exponential in n, the number of links. Here alpha(c) := 1/3(5 root 10 - 13) approximate to 0.937 is an explicit critical threshold with a simple interpretation. We also consider allowing multiple rerouting attempts. This has little effect on the overall behaviour; it does not remove the metastability phase.Finally, we add trunk reservation: in this, some number sigma of circuits are reserved; a rerouting attempt is only accepted if at least sigma + 1 circuits are available. We show that if sigma is chosen sufficiently large, depending only on alpha, not K or n, then the metastability phase is removed.

TI  - Worldview disagreement and subjective epistemic obligations
T2  - SYNTHESE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, I provide an account of subjective epistemic obligations. In instances of peer disagreement, one possesses at least two types of obligations: objective epistemic obligations and subjective epistemic obligations. While objective epistemic obligations, such as conciliationism and remaining steadfast, have been much discussed in the literature, subjective epistemic obligations have received little attention. I develop an account of subjective epistemic obligations in the context of worldview disagreements. In recent literature, the notion of worldview disagreement has been receiving increasing attention (e.g., Lougheed 2020, Ranalli 2020, Lougheed 2021), and I discuss how understanding worldview disagreements through different classes of beliefs might clarify our understanding of subjective epistemic obligations. I first distinguish between three classes of beliefs, by virtue of their justificatory functions within worldviews: fundamental, crucial and incidental. I then discuss four kinds of worldview disagreements based on this account. Finally, I argue that each disagreement results in different subjective epistemic obligations for each disputant. I conclude by discussing some implications this analysis has for issues such as defeat, peerhood, and epistemic injustice.

TI  - Measuring Coastal Subsidence after Recent Earthquakes in Chile Central Using SAR Interferometry and GNSS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal areas concentrate a large portion of the country's population around urban areas, which in subduction zones commonly are affected by drastic tectonic processes, such as the damage earthquakes have registered in recent decades. The seismic cycle of large earthquakes primarily controls changes in the coastal surface level in these zones. Therefore, quantifying temporal and spatial variations in land level after recent earthquakes is essential to understand shoreline variations better, and to assess their impacts on coastal urban areas. Here, we measure the coastal subsidence in central Chile using a multi-temporal differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR). This geographic zone corresponds to the northern limit of the 2010 Maule earthquake (Mw 8.8) rupture, an area affected by an aftershock of magnitude Mw 6.8 in 2019. The study is based on the exploitation of big data from SAR images of Sentinel-1 for comparison with data from continuous GNSS stations. We analyzed a coastline of similar to 300 km by SAR interferometry that provided high-resolution ground motion rates from between 2018 and 2021. Our results showed a wide range of subsidence rates at different scales, of analyses on a regional scale, and identified the area of subsidence on an urban scale. We identified an anomalous zone of subsidence of similar to 50 km, with a displacement <-20 mm/year. We discuss these results in the context of the impact of recent earthquakes and analyze the consequences of coastal subsidence. Our results allow us to identify stability in urban areas and quantify the vertical movement of the coast along the entire seismic cycle, in addition to the vertical movement of coast lands. Our results have implications for the planning of coastal infrastructure along subduction coasts in Chile.

TI  - Southern Range Expansion of the Emerald Ash Borer, <i>Agrilus planipennis</i>, in Russia Threatens Ash and Olive Trees in the Middle East and Southern Europe
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is the most serious invasive pest of ash trees (Fraxinus spp., Oleaceae) in the world. It has not yet reached the range of olive tree plantations, however it has been shown to complete its life cycle in this host tree. This pest native to East Asia was first found in Europe in Moscow in 2003 and has been spreading ever since. The aims of this study were to determine if the southern border of the range has already reached the Caucasus and to assess the potential range in this region based on host availability and heat availability. In 2021, we surveyed ash trees south to the known range in Russia. We did not find the pest in six cities in the North Caucasus region but found it in the city of Azov close to the Caucasus. Analysis of information about 550 localities of ash trees in the Caucasus showed that Fraxinus spp. is common throughout the region. The calculation of annual growing degree days base 10 degrees C indicated that the places where Fraxinus spp. grow above 1500 m are too cold for A. planipennis and therefore could potentially become a refuge for ash trees. The spread of A. planipennis to the Caucasus is of concern. First, the forest ecosystems of this region are endangered, since European ash Fraxinus excelsior is much more common there than in the currently infested regions in Russia. Second, the Russian Caucasus can become the gateway to Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and other countries of the Middle East and Southern Europe. We propose using Fraxinus angustifolia, F. ornus and Olea europaea growing in the Caucasus and adjacent regions as sentinel trees for the monitoring and pest risk assessment of these tree species.

TI  - Mapping Impervious Surface Using Phenology-Integrated and Fisher Transformed Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The impervious surface area (ISA) is a key indicator of urbanization, which brings out serious adverse environmental and ecological consequences. The ISA is often estimated from remotely sensed data via spectral mixture analysis (SMA). However, accurate extraction of ISA using SMA is compromised by two major factors, endmember spectral variability and plant phenology. This study developed a novel approach that incorporates phenology with Fisher transformation into a conventional linear spectral mixture analysis (PF-LSMA) to address these challenges. Four endmembers, high albedo, low albedo, evergreen vegetation, and seasonally exposed soil (H-L-EV-SS) were identified for PF-LSMA, considering the phenological characteristic of Shanghai. Our study demonstrated that the PF-LSMA effectively reduced the within-endmember spectral signature variation and accounted for the endmember phenology effects, and thus well-discriminated impervious surface from seasonally exposed soil, enhancing the accuracy of ISA extraction. The ISA fraction map produced by PF-LSMA (RMSE = 0.1112) outperforms the single-date image Fisher transformed unmixing method (F-LSMA) (RMSE = 0.1327) and the other existing major global ISA products. The PF-LSMA was implemented on the Google Earth Engine platform and thus can be easily adapted to extract ISA in other places with similar climate conditions.

TI  - The Utility of Ambulance Dispatch Call Syndromic Surveillance for Detecting and Assessing the Health Impact of Extreme Weather Events in England
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme weather events present significant global threats to health. The National Ambulance Syndromic Surveillance System collects data on 18 syndromes through chief presenting complaint (CPC) codes. We aimed to determine the utility of ambulance data to monitor extreme temperature events for action. Daily total calls were observed between 01/01/2018-30/04/2019. Median daily 'Heat/Cold' CPC calls during "known extreme temperature" (identified a priori), "extreme temperature"; (within 5th or 95th temperature percentiles for central England) and meteorological alert periods were compared to all other days using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. During the study period, 12,585,084 calls were recorded. In 2018, median daily "Heat/Cold" calls were higher during periods of known extreme temperature: heatwave (16/day, 736 total) and extreme cold weather events (28/day, 339 total) compared to all other days in 2018 (6/day, 1672 total). Median daily "Heat/Cold" calls during extreme temperature periods (16/day) were significantly higher than non-extreme temperature periods (5/day, p < 0.001). Ambulance data can be used to identify adverse impacts during periods of extreme temperature. Ambulance data are a low resource, rapid and flexible option providing real-time data on a range of indicators. We recommend ambulance data are used for the surveillance of presentations to healthcare related to extreme temperature events.

TI  - Google Earth Engine for Large-Scale Flood Mapping Using SAR Data and Impact Assessment on Agriculture and Population of Ganga-Brahmaputra Basin
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ganga-Brahmaputra basin is highly sensitive to the impacts of climate change and experiences recurrent flooding, which affects large agricultural areas and poses a high risk to the population. The present study is focused on the recent flood disaster in the Ganga-Brahmaputra basin, which mainly affected the regions of Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam in India and neighboring Bangladesh during July, August, and September 2020. Using the Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, the flood extent was derived in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The composite area under flood inundation for July-September was estimated to be 25,889.1 km(2) for Bangladesh, followed by Bihar (20,837 km(2)), West Bengal (17,307.1 km(2)), and Assam (13,460.1 km(2)). The Copernicus Global Land Cover dataset was used to extract the affected agricultural area and flood-affected settlement. Floods have caused adverse impacts on agricultural lands and settlements, affecting 23.68-28.47% and 5.66-9.15% of these areas, respectively. The Gridded Population of the World (GPW) population density and Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) population dataset were also employed to evaluate flood impacts, which revealed that 23.29 million of the population was affected by floods in the Ganga-Brahmaputra basin. The highest impacts of floods can be seen from the Bihar state, as people reside in the lower valley and near to the riverbank due to their dependency on river water. Similarly, the highest impact was from Bangladesh because of the high population density as well as the settlement density. The study provided a holistic spatial assessment of flood inundation in the region due to the combined impact of the Ganga-Brahmaputra River basin. The identification of highly flood-prone areas with an estimated impact on cropland and build-up will provide necessary information to decision-makers for flood risk reduction, mitigation activities, and management.

M3  - Article
AB  - The direct radiative effects of atmospheric aerosols are essential for climate, as well as for other societal areas, such as the energy sector. The goal of the present study is to exploit the newly developed ModIs Dust AeroSol (MIDAS) dataset for quantifying the direct effects on the downwelling surface solar irradiance (DSSI), induced by the total and dust aerosol amounts, under clear-sky conditions and the associated impacts on solar energy for the broader Mediterranean Basin, over the period 2003-2017. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and dust optical depth (DOD) derived by the MIDAS dataset, along with additional aerosol and dust optical properties and atmospheric variables, were used as inputs to radiative transfer modeling to simulate DSSI components. A 15-year climatology of AOD, DOD and clear-sky global horizontal irradiation (GHI) and direct normal irradiation (DNI) was derived. The spatial and temporal variability of the aerosol and dust effects on the different DSSI components was assessed. Aerosol attenuation of annual GHI and DNI were 1-13% and 5-47%, respectively. Over North Africa and the Middle East, attenuation by dust was found to contribute 45-90% to the overall attenuation by aerosols. The GHI and DNI attenuation during extreme dust episodes reached 12% and 44%, respectively, over particular areas. After 2008, attenuation of DSSI by aerosols became weaker mainly because of changes in the amount of dust. Sensitivity analysis using different AOD/DOD inputs from Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalysis dataset revealed that using CAMS products leads to underestimation of the aerosol and dust radiative effects compared to MIDAS, mainly because the former underestimates DOD.

TI  - Mapping of the Buried Paleochannels on the Terminal Fans in the Western Ganga Plain: A Geomorphological and Ground Penetrating Radar-based Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Paleochannels are valuable tools for delineating tectonics, climate, anthropogenic activities, reconstructing the paleogeography, and studying the geomorphological evolution of the alluvial plains. Paleochannels on the terminal fans provide crucial information regarding their geomorphic evolution in space and time. Furthermore, paleochannels could be a good source for groundwater exploration. Exposed paleochannels in the recent alluvial plains are mappable by remote sensing and field evidence. However, mapping becomes difficult due to burial in relatively older alluvial surfaces, and anthropogenic disturbances complicate the case. This paper deals with an integrated method of mapping the buried paleochannels in the terminal fans from the western Ganga plain. Paleochannels have been mapped on three Holocene terminal fans, using remote sensing and Google Earth images, and Cartosat DEM. As continuity of the entire length of paleochannels could not be traced by the above tools due to burial and intense anthropogenic modifications, aligned surface water bodies were helpful at places to ascertain their continuity. The ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey by bistatic antennae (100 MHz frequency in distance mode) detected the subsurface existence of these buried paleochannels up to a maximum depth of about 35 m. Field evidence of some of these buried channels was confirmed at few excavations by the presence of channel sand. A previous study of these terminal fans through optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating suggests that channel abandonment occurred between 4.7 to 2.3 Ka, coinciding with the period of the dry climate and intense surface faulting episodes in the Ganga plain.

TI  - Assessment of Adjacency Correction over Inland Waters Using Sentinel-2 MSI Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing data have been used for water quality mapping, but accurate water reflectance retrieval is dependent on multiple procedures, such as atmospheric and adjacency corrections. For the latter, physical-based methods are used to minimize the adjacency effects caused by neighboring land targets close to water pixels, and implementation requires atmospheric and environmental parameters, such as aerosol optical depth and horizontal range (i.e., distance in meters) of the adjacency effect (H-Adj). Generally, the H-Adj is empirically defined by users and can lead to substantial errors in water reflectance when incorrectly used. In this research, a physical-based approach with three empirical methods to determine the H-Adj (fixed, SIMilarity Environment Correction-SIMEC, and Adaptative Window by Proportion-AWP-Inland Water) were used to correct and characterize the adjacency effects in Sentinel-2 images over Brazilian inland waters. An interactive inversion method of the deep blue waveband estimated the aerosol loading for the atmospheric correction procedure. The results of atmospheric and adjacency corrections were validated against in-situ reflectance data. The inverted aerosol loading achieved a good agreement with in-situ measurements, especially at visible wavelengths (Mean Absolute Percentage Error-MAPE for eutrophic (similar to 56%), bright (similar to 80%), and dark (similar to 288%) waters). The adjacency correction performance was near similar between the SIMEC and AWP-Inland Water methods in eutrophic and bright waters (MAPE difference < 3%). However, only the AWP-Inland Water method provided a smaller error (MAPE similar to 53%) for dark waters compared to the fixed (similar to 108%) and SIMEC (similar to 289%) methods, which shows how critical HAdj parametrization is for low water reflectance values. Simulations of different atmospheric and adjacency effects were performed, and they highlighted the importance of adjacency correction under aerosol loading higher 0.1, which is a typical aerosol loading in a dry climate season, and over extremely dark, low-reflectance waters. This paper contributes to further understanding adjacency effects in medium spatial resolution imagery of inland waters using a physical-based approach including the uncertainties in H-Adj determination.

TI  - <i>Sentinel lymph node: The pathologist's point of view</i> with a focus on breast cancer's experience
T2  - BULLETIN DE L ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MEDECINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The advent of sentinel node biopsy has changed the way pathologists have approached the histopathological examination of lymph nodes. Through the experience of the sentinel node in breast cancer, we will see how practices have evolved from minimalist examination to ultra-staging and back to a quasi-conventional examination as clinical evidence accumulated, and the improvement of locoregional and general treatments. However, in other tumor types such as, for example, gynecological cancers, the evaluation of a lymph node disease of low volume remains relevant. The experience accumulated by pathologists in sentinel lymph node handling in breast pathology, has enabled rapid adaptation. to the needs of surgeons and oncologists in other oncologic fields.

TI  - Distribution and drivers of Vietnam mangrove deforestation from 1995 to 2019
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vietnam mangrove forests have long been recognized to play important roles in coastal protection against soil erosion and storms/strong waves, supplying seafood, land reclamation, and carbon accumulation. Mangrove forests were severely damaged by the Second Indochina War and the shrimp aquaculture boom of the 1980s and 1990s. In recent decades, the rate of mangrove forest decline has been reduced due to increased efforts in mangrove restoration, though mangrove conversions to other land uses still occur locally. In this study, we analyzed Landsat data using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to (1) determine the national distribution of mangroves; (2) identify the spatiotemporal change of mangrove cover; and (3) quantify the proportional conversion of mangroves to different land uses in Vietnam between 1995 and 2019. Vietnam lost 13,261 ha (7.3%) of its mangrove forest during the study period at a rate of 0.3% per year. Mangrove extent decreased 24,966 ha during 1995-2010, but increased 11,705 ha during 2010-2019. Spatially, mangrove extent decreased in southern regions, but increased in northern and central regions. Aquaculture and agriculture expansion were the major drivers that accounted for 43.4% and 24.8% of the total mangrove loss, respectively. In northern and central regions, infrastructure development was also identified as an additional driver of mangrove deforestation, while in the southern regions, erosion was identified as an increasing threat to mangroves. These results can assist managers and decision makers in mangrove, management, and ecological service evaluations as well as in forest inventories and national reporting. Our findings also suggest using the GEE platform to analyze public archive satellite images is an effective tool to monitor nationwide mangrove forest change over time in Vietnam.

TI  - GPS, LiDAR and VNIR data to monitor the spatial behavior of grazing sheep
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR AND BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional knowledge about the behavior of grazing livestock is about to disappear. Shepherds well know that sheep behavior follows non-random patterns. As a novel alternative to seeking behavioral patterns, this study quantified the grazing activities of two sheep flocks of Churra breed (both in the same area but separated by 10 years) based on Global Position System (GPS) monitoring and remote monitoring sensing techniques. In the first monitoring period (2009-10), geolocations were recorded every 5 min (4,240 records), while in the second one (2018-20), records were taken every 30 min (7,636 records). The data were clustered based on the day/night and the activity (resting, moving, or grazing). An airborne LiDAR dataset was used to study the slope, aspect, and vegetation height. Four visible-infrared orthophotographs were mosaicked and classified to obtain the land use/land cover (LU/LC) map. Then, GPS locations were overlain on the terrain features, and a Chi-square test evaluated the relationships between locations and terrain features. Three spatial statistics (directional distribution, Kernel density, and Hot Spot analysis) were also calculated. Results in both monitoring periods suggested that the spatial distribution of free-grazing ewes was non-random. The flocks showed strong preferences for grazing areas with gentle north-facing slopes, where the herbaceous layer formed by pasture predominates. The geostatistical analyses of the sheep locations corroborated those preferences. Geotechnologies have emerged as a potent tool to demonstrate the influence of environmental and terrain attributes on the non-random spatial behavior of grazing sheep.

TI  - Quantifying Post-Fire Changes in the Aboveground Biomass of an Amazonian Forest Based on Field and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a major forest degradation component in the Amazon forests. Therefore, it is important to improve our understanding of how the post-fire canopy structure changes cascade through the spectral signals registered by medium-resolution satellite sensors over time. We contrasted accumulated yearly temporal changes in forest aboveground biomass (AGB), measured in permanent plots, and in traditional spectral indices derived from Landsat-8 images. We tested if the spectral indices can improve Random Forest (RF) models of post-fire AGB losses based on pre-fire AGB, proxied by AGB data from immediately after a fire. The delta normalized burned ratio, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and green vegetation (Delta NBR, Delta NPV, and Delta GV, respectively), relative to pre-fire data, were good proxies of canopy damage through tree mortality, even though small and medium trees were the most affected tree size. Among all tested predictors, pre-fire AGB had the highest RF model importance to predicting AGB within one year after fire. However, spectral indices significantly improved AGB loss estimates by 24% and model accuracy by 16% within two years after a fire, with Delta GV as the most important predictor, followed by Delta NBR and Delta NPV. Up to two years after a fire, this study indicates the potential of structural and spectral-based spatial data for integrating complex post-fire ecological processes and improving carbon emission estimates by forest fires in the Amazon.

TI  - Influence of Transport Infrastructure on Surface Temperature in a BRT corridor. in the city of Goiania/GO
T2  - ATELIE GEOGRAFICO
M3  - Article
AB  - The artificialization in urban areas has contributed to the concentration of several environmental problems, among which is the change in urban microclimate, including surface temperature. Thus, this research aims to analyze the impacts of the construction of a Bus Rapid Transit System (BRT), which is located in the city of Goiania, on surface temperature, before and after its implementation. The methodology involved the analysis of orbital remote sensing images from the Landsat 8 satellite, OLI, and TIRS sensors, manipulated in a Geographic Information System (GIS). For that purpose, it was necessary to calculate the brightness temperature; emissivity correction, and; surface temperature calculation. The results have revealed the alteration of the urban landscape influenced by the transportation corridor, the main ones being in the land surface temperature (SST), with the intensification of high temperatures in areas where there was an increase of paved and commercial surfaces and reduction of the temperature where arborization managements were employed.

M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the ocular manifestations in the acute stage of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed all the medical records of patients diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme between 2012 and 2019. Demographics, ophthalmic manifestations, and the treatment given systemically and locally were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: We had forty-five patients admitted to our hospital between Jan 2012 to Dec 2019 with SJS/TEN as a diagnosis.Twenty-six (57.5%) of them were females, and 19(42.2%) were males. The mean age was 27.5 years.Forty (88.9%) of our cases were diagnosed as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and five (11.9%) as toxic epidermal necrolysis.We found antiepileptics as a triggering agent in thirteen cases (28.8%).Fever (84.4%) and mucosal lesions (86.7%) were the most common presenting symptom.We found ocular symptoms in only 22 (48.9%) patients.The treating physicians referred only thirty-one cases to the ophthalmologist, out of which 22 cases were referred within three days of admission.The most common ocular involvement was conjunctival congestion (69%).Ocular grading showed that mild grade included 42.9%, moderate grade 28.6%, and severe grade 28.6% of the cases.The ocular treatment involved medical management with lubricating drops (100%), topical steroids (58.6%), and topical antibiotics (68.9%). Five individuals with a severe grade of ocular involvement underwent amniotic membrane transplantation. CONCLUSION: Ocular examination and grading are essential in the acute stage of SJS/TEN. It helps the ophthalmologist recognize the sentinel findings and institute appropriate treatment in the acute stage as early as possible.

TI  - Surface runoff response to long-term land use changes: Spatial rearrangement of runoff-generating areas reveals a shift in flash flood drivers
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, rapid growths of urban areas and associated land use/land cover (LULC) changes notably affect the surface runoff response to rainfall in urbanised catchments. This effect of urbanisation on surface runoff is frequently ad-dressed since it relates to the increasing incidence of pluvial floods worldwide. Studies on this issue commonly assess runoff changes over several most recent decades. However, human-induced factors likely resulted in increased surface runoff and associated flash floods in rural catchments even in the past centuries. Such long-term changes have been rarely studied and thus are not well documented. This paper aims to fill this gap and assess the surface runoff response to LULC changes in a small catchment in southwestern Slovakia over more than two centuries. To meet this goal, we applied the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method. We mapped past (1784) and present (2018) LULC classes based on historical maps and modern remote sensing data. Then, we estimated surface runoff depths for specific design rainstorms for both periods by executing CN method equations in the ArcGIS environment. Results revealed significant changes in surface runoff conditions between evaluated periods. In total, surface runoff magni-tudes increased by-230 and -130% for 40-and 65-mm design rainstorms, respectively, compared to 1784. More -over, surface runoff values show different spatial patterns on historical and present-day output raster images revealing spatial redistribution of runoff-enhancing and runoff-preventing areas during the evaluated period. Although both infiltration-enhancing and runoff-enhancing effects of LULC changes were identified, the latter effect associated with urbanised lowland areas was recognised as prevailing at present. In contrast, runoff-promoting conditions were associated with hilly vineyard areas in the past. These findings likely have important implications for understanding the past and present LULC-based controls of surface runoff generation and flash floods initiation.

TI  - Spatial Analysis of Inequality in Thailand: Applications of Satellite Data and Spatial Statistics/Econometrics
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - To formulate and monitor the progress of development policies, acquiring data with sufficient spatiotemporal details is inevitable. With the increasing availability of open remote-sensing data and open-source software packages, this research suggested the novelty integration of satellite data and spatial analytical methods, enabling a timely and costless framework for assessing the nationwide socioeconomic condition. Specifically, the spatial statistical and spatial econometrical methods were applied to geospatial data to identify the clustering patterns and the localized associations of inequality in Thailand. The spatial statistical results showed that Bangkok and its vicinity had been a cluster of high socioeconomic conditions, representing the spatial inequality of development. In addition, results of the spatial econometrical models showed that the satellite-based indicators could identify the socioeconomic condition (with p-value < 0.010 and R-squared ranging between 0.345 and 0.657). Inequality indicators (i.e., Gini, Thiel and Atkinson) were then constructed by using survey-based and satellite-based data, informing that spatial inequality has been slowly declining. These findings recommended the new establishment of polycentric growth poles that offer economic opportunities and reduce spatial inequality. In addition, in accordance with Sustainable Development Goal 10 (reduced inequalities), this analytical framework can be applied to country-specific implications along with the global scale extensions.

TI  - Mapping large area tea plantations using progressive random forest and Google Earth Engine
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A timely and accurate understanding of the spatial distribution of tea plantations is beneficial for agricultural management and regional sustainable development. However, obtaining detailed distribution data on large-area tea plantations remains challenging owing to limitations in computational capabilities, training data, and workflow design. Utilizing the Google Earth Engine, which provides a catalog of multisource data in a cloud-based environment, we developed a methodology to generate a highly accurate tea plantation map, with a 10-m resolution, for Anhui Province, China, by integrating a random forest model with a progressive model. Our major contribution lies in this hybrid approach, which comprises two major components: (1) an optimal classification band combination derived from Sentinel-2 products and the digital elevation model filtered by the J-M distance model and (2) a progressive random forest method introduced for tea plantation classification. The experimental results show that our proposed workflow achieved an average classification accuracy of 89.27% for the entire Anhui Province. In addition, this approach is semiautomatic and can effectively reduce the labor required during the generation of training data compared with traditional classification approaches. These findings demonstrate the potential of integrating machine learning and progressive models to produce high-precision remote sensing classification maps. (c) The Authors.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of NO<sub>2</sub> Production Using TROPOMI Time-Series Images and Google Earth Engine in a Middle Eastern Country
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Like many developing countries, Iran faces air pollution, especially in its metropolises and industrial cities. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the significant air pollutants; therefore, this study aims to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of NO2 using Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) sensor mounted on the Sentinel-5P (S5P) satellite and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform over Iran. In addition, we used ground truth data to assess the correlation between data acquired by this sensor and ground stations. The results show that there is a strong correlation between products of the TROPOMI sensor and data provided by the Air Quality Monitoring Organization of Iran. The results also display that the correlation coefficient (R) of NO2 between ground truth data and the TROPOMI sensor varies in the range of 0.4 to 0.92, over three years. Over an annual period (2018 to 2021) and wide area, these data can become valuable points of reference for NO2 monitoring. In addition, this study proved that the tropospheric NO2 concentrations are generally located over the northern part of Iran. According to the time and season, the concentration of the tropospheric NO2 column shows higher values during winter than in the summertime. The results show that a higher concentration of the tropospheric NO2 column is in winter while in some southern and central parts of the country more NO2 concentration can be seen in the summertime. This study indicates that these urban areas are highly polluted, which proves the impact of pollutants such as NO2 on the people living there. In other words, small parts of Iran are classified as high and very highly polluted areas, but these areas are the primary location of air pollution in Iran. We provide a code repository that allows spatiotemporal analysis of NO2 estimation using TROPOMI time-series images within GEE. This method can be applied to other regions of interest for NO2 mapping.

TI  - High-Precision Measurement of Height Differences from Shadows in Non-Stereo Imagery: New Methodology and Accuracy Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The shadow-height method has been extensively used to extract the heights of buildings from the shadows they cast in non-stereo (single view) aerial and satellite imagery. However, the use of this method in Earth sciences has been limited, partially due to the relatively low accuracy reported, the fuzziness of shadow edges, the complexities of the scanning sensors, and a lack of software tools. In this paper, we present an enhanced shadow-height methodology offering significant accuracy improvement. These improvements are mainly the result of using a physical approach to model the illumination gradient through the edge of shadows and by leveraging meteorological data to precisely estimate atmospheric refraction. We validated 91 shadow-derived height estimations from images obtained by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) at three sites with latitudes between 33 and 78 degrees S: The Andes Mountains, Sentinel Range, and Abbot ice shelf. Reference measurements were obtained from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) surveys and the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). The observed errors fell below 6% for small height differences (similar to 20 m) and below 2% for larger height differences (greater than or similar to 300 m). Our validation data cover solar elevations ranging from 3.7 to 42.2 degrees, and we observed smaller absolute errors at lower solar elevations. This novel information can be valuable for studying surface elevation changes in present and old imagery and extending glacier volume variation time-series.

TI  - The verbalization of notion absence in the english language and culture
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article identifies the relevance of studying the notion of absence in English vocabulary from the linguocultural perspective. The focus on phraseology enables to analyze vocabulary units as the reflection of cultural code, ethnic traditions and history. The mental notion of absence, recorded in English lexical and phraseological units, represents their national and cultural identity that was formed for centuries and has been manifested in the naive linguistic worldview of English native speakers. The analysis involved phraseological units, verbalizing absence in different ways: using set expressions with not; nominative units absence, absent, where absence is reflected directly in the root morpheme, and also in idioms, which implicitly express this notion. It was found that phraseological units with the semantic component of absence determine typical features of thinking, mentality, and behavior of the English native speakers. Ready-made phrases with lexemes absence, absent, and not were characterized and described axiologically. It was pointed out that the semantic component of absence emerged at the early stages of the English ethnicity evolution, and from the very beginning it has been axiologically marked as it identifies the absence of important life elements for an English native speaker.

TI  - Soil Salinity Detection and Mapping in an Environment under Water Stress between 1984 and 2018 (Case of the Largest Oasis in Africa-Morocco)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water stress is one of the factors controlling agricultural land salinization and is also a major problem worldwide. According to FAO and the most recent estimates, it already affects more than 400 million hectares. The Tafilalet plain in Southeastern Morocco suffers from soil salinization. In this regard, the GIS tools and remote sensing were used in the processing of 19 satellite images acquired from Landsat 4-5, (Landsat 7), (Landsat 8), and (Sentinel 2) sensors. The most used indices in the literature were (16 indices) tested and correlated with the results obtained from 25 samples taken from the first soil horizon at a constant depth of 0.20 m from the 2018 campaign. The linear model, at first, allows the selection of five better indices of the soil salinity discrimination (SI-Khan, VSSI, BI, S3, and SI-Dehni). These last indices were the subject of the application of a logarithmic model and polynomial models of degree two and four to increase the prediction of saline soil.. After studies and analysis, we concluded that the second-degree polynomial model of the salinity index (SI-KHAN) is the most efficient one for detecting and mapping soil salinity in the Tafilalet oasis, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) equal to 0.93 and 0.86, respectively. Percent bias (PBIAS) calculated for this model equal was 1.868% < 10%, and the low value of the root mean square error (RMSE) confirms its very good performance. The drought cyclicity led to the intensification of the soil salinization process and accelerated soil degradation. The standardized precipitation anomaly index (SPAI) is strongly correlated to soil salinity. The hydroclimate condition is the factor that further controls this phenomenon. An increase in salinized surfaces is observed during the periods of 1984-1996 and 2000-2005, which cover a surface of 11.50 and 24.20 km(2), respectively, while a decrease of about 50% is observed during the periods of 1996-2000 and 2005-2018.

TI  - Compressed High Resolution Satellite Image Processing to Detect Water Bodies with Combined Bilateral Filtering and Threshold Techniques
T2  - TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Water body extraction has become an increasingly important source of information for the prediction of heavy flood situations over the last few decades. Several approaches for identifying water bodies from separate High Resolution satellite data with varying spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics have been developed. The vast amount of data available, supported by open access regulations adopted by many agencies, is transforming the remote sensing environment, underlining the necessity of data processing speed and efficiency. The current study presents an autonomous method for extracting water bodies from satellite pictures that use a single-band threshold approach with bilateral filtering. One important goal is to use low-cost software to understand raw picture data to evaluate multi-temporal and multi-sensor images. Using the proposed framework, the workflow is constructed on a free and open-source software processing framework. Water was detected properly and quickly from other land cover features.

TI  - Uncertainty Analysis in SAR Sea Surface Wind Speed Retrieval through C-Band Geophysical Model Functions Inversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study is to assess the suitability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to provide sea surface wind (SSW) fields along with a spatial distribution of both SSW speed and direction uncertainty. A simple methodology based on geophysical model function (GMF) inversion to obtain a spatial distribution of both SSW speed and its uncertainty is proposed. Exploiting a dataset of Sentinel-1 images, a sensitivity analysis of the SSW speed uncertainty is carried out on both the uncertainties and the mean values of SAR normalised radar cross section (NRCS), incidence angle and SSW direction, at different spatial scales. The results show that SSW speed uncertainty significantly increases with wind vector cell (WVC) dimension. Moreover, the dominant contribution to the SSW speed uncertainty due to both NRCS and SSW direction uncertainty must always be taken into account. A better precision and accuracy in the estimation of SSW speed and its uncertainty is evidenced by C-band model 7 (CMOD7) GMF rather than the C-band model 5.N (CMOD5.N). To evaluate the results of SSW retrievals, wind data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model are also exploited for comparisons. Findings indicate a high correlation between the uncertainty from SAR estimations and that from the comparison of SAR vs. ECMWF.

TI  - A Metaheuristics Framework for Weighted Multi-band Image Fusion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND GRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of hyper/multispectral image fusion is producing a composite color image that allows for an appropriate visualization of the relevant spatial and spectral information. In this paper, we propose a general framework for spectral weighting-based image fusion. The proposed methodology relies on weight updates conducted using nature-inspired algorithms and a goodness-of-fit criterion defined as the average root mean square error. Simulations on four public data sets and a recent Landsat 8 image of Brullus Lake, Egypt, as an area of study prove the efficiency of the proposed framework. The purpose of the study is to present a framework of multi-band image fusion that produces a fused image of high quality to be further used in computer processing and the results show that the image produced by the presented framework has the highest quality compared with some of the state-of-the art algorithms. To prove the increase in the image quality, we used general quality metrics such as Universal Image Quality Index, Mutual Information, the Variance and Information Measure.

TI  - Identifying the Potential Dam Sites to Avert the Risk of Catastrophic Floods in the Jhelum Basin, Kashmir, NW Himalaya, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In September 2014, Kashmir witnessed a catastrophic flood resulting in a significant loss of lives and property. Such massive losses could have been avoided if any structural support such as dams were constructed in the Jhelum basin, which has a history of devastating floods. The GIS-based multicriteria analysis (MCA) model provided three suitability zones for dam locations. The final suitable dam sites were identified within the highest suitability zone based on topography (cross-sections), stream order, high suitable zone, minimum dam site interval, distance from roads, and protected area distance to the dam site. It was discovered that 10.98% of the total 4347.74 km(2) area evaluated falls in the high suitability zone, 28.88% of the area falls in the medium suitability zone, and 60.14% of the area falls in the low suitability zone. Within the study area, four viable reservoir sites with a holding capacity of 4,489,367.55 m(3) were revealed.

TI  - Active VLF Transmission Experiments Between the DSX and VPM Spacecraft
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents results from magnetic field line conjunctions between the medium-Earth orbiting Demonstration and Science Experiments (DSX) satellite and the low-Earth orbiting (LEO) very low frequencies (VLF) Propagation Mapper (VPM) satellite. DSX transmitted at VLF toward VPM, which was equipped with a single-axis dipole electric field antenna, when the two spacecraft passed near the same magnetic field line. VPM did not observe DSX signals in any of the 27 attempted conjunction experiments; the goal of this study, therefore, is to explain why DSX signals were not received. Explanations include (a) the predicted power at LEO from DSX transmissions was too low for VPM to observe; (b) VPM's trajectory missed the "spot" of highest intensity due to the focused ray paths reaching LEO; or (c) rays mirrored before reaching VPM. Different combinations of these explanations are found. We present ray-tracing analysis for each conjunction event to predict the distribution of power and wave normal angles in the vicinity of VPM at LEO altitudes. We find that, for low-frequency (below 4 kHz) transmissions, nearly all rays mirror before reaching LEO, resulting in low amplitudes at LEO. For mid- and high-frequency transmissions (similar to 8 and 28 kHz respectively), the power at LEO is above the noise threshold of the VPM receiver (between 0.5 mu V/m and 1 mu V/m). We conclude that the antenna efficiency and plasmasphere model are critical in determining the predicted power at LEO, and are also the two most significant sources of uncertainty that could explain the apparent discrepancy between predicted amplitudes and VPM observations.

TI  - Detection of Grassland Mowing Events for Germany by Combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands cover one-third of the agricultural area in Germany and play an important economic role by providing fodder for livestock. In addition, they fulfill important ecosystem services, such as carbon storage, water purification, and the provision of habitats. These ecosystem services usually depend on the grassland management. In central Europe, grasslands are grazed and/or mown, whereby the management type and intensity vary in space and time. Spatial information on the mowing timing and frequency on larger scales are usually not available but would be required in order to assess the ecosystem services, species composition, and grassland yields. Time series of high-resolution satellite remote sensing data can be used to analyze the temporal and spatial dynamics of grasslands. Within this study, we aim to overcome the drawbacks identified by previous studies, such as optical data availability and the lack of comprehensive reference data, by testing the time series of various Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinal-1 (S1) parameters and combinations of them in order to detect mowing events in Germany in 2019. We developed a threshold-based algorithm by using information from a comprehensive reference dataset of heterogeneously managed grassland parcels in Germany, obtained by RGB cameras. The developed approach using the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from S2 led to a successful mowing event detection in Germany (60.3% of mowing events detected, F1-Score = 0.64). However, events shortly before, during, or shortly after cloud gaps were missed and in regions with lower S2 orbit coverage fewer mowing events were detected. Therefore, S1-based backscatter, InSAR, and PolSAR features were investigated during S2 data gaps. From these, the PolSAR entropy detected mowing events most reliably. For a focus region, we tested an integrated approach by combining S2 and S1 parameters. This approach detected additional mowing events, but also led to many false positive events, resulting in a reduction in the F1-Score (from 0.65 of S2 to 0.61 of S2 + S1 for the focus region). According to our analysis, a majority of grasslands in Germany are only mown zero to two times (around 84%) and are probably additionally used for grazing. A small proportion is mown more often than four times (3%). Regions with a generally higher grassland mowing frequency are located in southern, south-eastern, and northern Germany.

TI  - Yield, Physiology, Fruit Quality and Water Footprint in Persian Lime (<i>Citrus latifolia</i> Tan.) in Response to Soil Moisture Tension in Two Phenological Stages in Campeche, Mexico
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sixteen irrigation treatments were applied on Persian lime, based on the combination of four soil moisture tensions (SMTs) used to define the start of irrigation: -10, -35, -60, and -85 kPa during the phenological stages (PSs) of flowering (FL) and fruiting (FR). Variables evaluated were, among others: leaf water potential (psi), leaf stomatal conductance (g(s)), fruit weight (FW), fruit juice content (FJC), total soluble solids in juice (TSS), fruit yield (FY), and water footprint (WF). Greater values on the psi and g(s) variables were observed in plants subjected to SMTs of -10 and -35 kPa (p < 0.05). The SMT of -85 kPa during FR produced a low FW value, while the lower SMTs in this PS increased it (p < 0.05). FY was greater in the treatments including -10 kPa or -35 kPa during either of the two PSs, with the exception of those with -85 kPa in one of the stages (p < 0.05). Lower FJC values were obtained at a SMT of -85 kPa in FR, and higher TSS values were observed in the two driest treatments (p < 0.05). The smallest WF values were observed in the -60 kPa FL and -60 kPa FR treatment (p <= 0.05). Irrigation management based on the SMT significantly affected almost all the response variables evaluated. It is recommended to irrigate the crop at a SMT of -35 kPa in FL and -60 kPa in FR, the treatment in which the greatest FW, FY, and FJC values and the lowest TSS and WF values were obtained (p < 0.05) and in which only 93 L of water was used by the trees to produce one kilogram of fruit (16% of the amount used in the treatment with the largest WF). The use of blue water is limited by its scarcity and high opportunity cost, an aspect that can be mitigated if blue water is used efficiently in Persian lime production systems, based on the results of this study.

TI  - The concept of the sentinel node: A revolution in the management of lymph node invasion - review article with a focus in breast cancer
T2  - BULLETIN DE L ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MEDECINE
M3  - Review
AB  - The sentinel node is the first lymph node reached by metastatic cells from a primary tumor. Its resection is a minimally invasive technique which can make it possible to select patients who, having occult lymph node metastases, could benefit from adjuvant regional orsystemic treatment. The first attempts to remove this node were based on standard anatomical models and never replaced classical lymphadenectomies. The development of more fonctional pre- and intraoperative lymphatic mapping techniques in the 1990s, on the other hand, made it possible to validate the concept of a sentinel node as an alternative to dissection. The hypothesis of sequential tumor dissemination and the concept of the first filter have been validated innumerous studies of sentinel lymph node biopsy with regional lymph node dissection for confirmatory purposes. This paper reviews the history and validation of the technique, its lessons and its perspectives, with a particular focus on breast cancer. (C) 2022 l'Academie nationale de medecine.

TI  - Visible to Mid-Infrared Optical Constants of Orthopyroxenes
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiative transfer models of remotely acquired infrared spectra result in quantitative identification of minerals on planetary surfaces. Optical constants, or the real (n) and imaginary (k) indices of refraction are necessary inputs in such models. Pyroxenes are ubiquitous on the surfaces of terrestrial bodies within our solar system and can be readily used as thermo-barometers to interpret magmatic histories. However, optical constants for intermediate pyroxene compositions are undetermined. Here, we have determined the optical constants of two natural orthopyroxenes both in the visible/near-infrared (VNIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) regions. VNIR reflectance spectra were measured using powdered samples and modeled using a combination of Hapke theory and Kramers-Kronig analysis. MIR reflectance spectra were measured on oriented single crystal samples with non-normal incidence and modeled using Lorentz-Lorenz dispersion theory. The optical constants derived here are available to the scientific community at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4758045 to be used in the interpretation of remote sensing data.

TI  - Determination of Forest Structure from Remote Sensing Data for Modeling the Navigation of Rescue Vehicles
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the primary purposes of forest fire research is to predict crisis situations and, also, to optimize rescue operations during forest fires. The research results presented in this paper provide a model of Cross-Country Mobility (CCM) of fire brigades in forest areas before or during a fire. In order to develop a methodology of rescue vehicle mobility in a wooded area, the structure of a forest must first be determined. We used a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to determine the Canopy Height Model (CHM). DSM and DEM data were scanned by LiDAR. CHM data and field measurements were used for determining the approximate forest structure (tree height, stem diameters, and stem spacing between trees). Due to updating the CHM and determining the above-mentioned forest structure parameters, tree growth equations and vegetation growth curves were used. The approximate forest structure with calculated tree density (stem spacing) was used for modeling vehicle maneuvers between the trees. Stem diameter data were used in cases where it was easier for the vehicle to override the trees rather than maneuver between them. Although the results of this research are dependent on the density and quality of the input LiDAR data, the designed methodology can be used for modeling the optimal paths of rescue vehicles across a wooded area during forest fires.

TI  - Relationship Between Breast and Axillary Pathologic Complete Response According to Clinical Nodal Stage: A Nationwide Study From Korean Breast Cancer Society
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: We evaluated the relationship between breast pathologic complete response (BpCR) and axillary pathologic complete response (ApCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) according to nodal burden at presentation. As the indications for NACT have expanded, clinicians have started clinical trials for the omission of surgery from the treatment plan in patients with excellent responses to NACT. However, the appropriate indications for axillary surgery omission after excellent NACT response remain unclear.Methods: Data were collected from patients in the Korean Breast Cancer Society Registry who underwent NACT followed by surgery between 2010 and 2020. We analyzed pathologic axillary nodal positivity after NACT according to BpCR stratified by tumor subtype in patients with cT1-3/N0-2 disease at diagnosis.Results: A total of 6,597 patients were identified. Regarding cT stage, 528 (9.5%), 3,778 (67.8%), and 1,268 (22.7%) patients had cT1, cT2, and cT3 disease, respectively. Regarding cN stage, 1,539 (27.7%), 2,976 (53.6%), and 1,036 (18.7%) patients had cNO, cN1, and cN2 disease, respectively. BpCR occurred in 21.6% (n = 1,427) of patients, while ApCR and pathologic complete response (ypCR) occurred in 59.7% (n = 3,929) and ypCR 19.4% (n = 1,285) of patients, respectively. The distribution of biologic subtypes included 2,329 (39.3%) patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative disease, 1,122 (18.9%) with HR-positive/HER2-positive disease, 405 (6.8%) with HR-negative/HER2-positive disease, and 2,072 (35.0%) with triple-negative breast cancer. Among the patients with BpCR, 89.6% (1,122/1,252) had ApCR. Of those with cNO disease, most (99.0%, 301/304) showed ApCR. Among patients with cN1-2 disease, 86.6% (821/948) had ApCR.Conclusion: BpCR was highly correlated with ApCR after NACT. In patients with cN0 and BpCR, the risk of missing axillary nodal metastasis was low after NACT. Further research on axillary surgery omission in patients with cN0 disease is needed.

TI  - Mapping Underwater Bathymetry of a Shallow River from Satellite Multispectral Imagery
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers play an important role in water supply, waterway transport, and riverine species habitations. The underwater depth of a river channel is a fundamental geometric element and a key input to studies for the aforementioned and other applications. Traditional in-situ field surveys for flow depth measurements would incur high costs and encounter technical and/or logistical difficulties, particularly for river channels of large extents, very shallow channels, and remote, inaccessible channels. Recent advances in satellite remote sensing of inland water bodies like rivers, streams, and creeks have allowed mapping flow depth in an inexpensive, convenient, and efficient manner. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the retrieval of river flow depth from high-resolution (1.2 m) WorldView-3 satellite imagery. The depth retrieval methods are based on the ratio of top-of-atmosphere reflectance between two pairing wavelength bands of multispectral imagery. The originality of the methods lies in using analytical relationships without resorting to ground data of river flow depth for calibration, which improves from previous studies of remote sensing of river flow depth. The methods are successfully applied to mapping the underwater bathymetry of a 26 km reach of the Nicolet River in Quebec, Canada. This study shows the importance of geometric and radiometric corrections to the satellite images. The obtained flow depths using the ratio of reflectance of the red band (630-690 nm) to that of the green band (510-580 nm), among the eight bands in the visible spectrum, agree best with in-situ measurements. This study is perhaps the first use of the analytical approach for mapping river bathymetry. It is feasible to implement the approach to other river channels, with a good potential to reduce the costs and increase the efficiency of mapping river bathymetries.

TI  - Geomorphological and geophysical analyses of the Hebron Fault, SW Namibia: implications for stable continental region seismic hazard
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the geomorphological expression and geological context of a normal fault scarp in a stable continental region (SCR) which we interpret as having failed in large (M-w >7) earthquakes. Records of such large normal faulting events in an SCR (or even in more rapidly deforming regions) are extremely rare, and so understanding this feature is of international interest. The scarp is exceptionally well-preserved due to the extensive calcrete/silcrete cementation. In areas where this cementation is reduced or absent the scarp is more diffuse, as expected for a feature formed by one or more paleoearthquakes. The exceptional preservation aids comparison with data sets based on scarps which have formed more recently. Our analysis is based on a high-resolution digital elevation model of the Hebron Fault scarp in southern Namibia using pan-sharpened Worldview-3 satellite stereophotos (0.31 m resolution). We make scarp height measurements at 160 locations providing improved estimates of the average displacement (5.9 m), maximum displacement (10.1 m), and the minimum fault length (45 km). No consistent evidence of lateral displacements in water courses or alluvial fan margins were found implying predominantly normal displacement. A newly described section in the northwest has en-echelon scarps consistent with a component of strike-slip motion that may be explained by its difference in strike from the central section. Most channels crossing the fault show a single knick-point. The displacement varies smoothly as it crosses a number of different generations of alluvial fan surfaces. No evidence of a multiscarp or a composite scarp were observed. We have therefore found no evidence for a mutiple-event origin for the scarp, although, this lack of evidence does not conclusively demonstrate a single-event origin. Published regressions, based on the limited data available for SCRs, suggest that the mean expected average displacement ((D) over bar (av)) for a faults of this length is 1.2-3.1 m implying that the scarp is likely to have formed in 2-5 events with an expected M-w = similar to 7.1 though displacements in individual events may exceed these average values. Comparison with the regional geology and aeromagnetic data sets suggests that the fault reactivates a Mesoproterozoic ductile structure, the Nam Shear Zone, and that the location, orientation and segmentation of the scarp is controlled by the alignment of pre-existing structurally weak zones with the present-day stress regime. The fault has undergone repeated brittle reactivation, accumulating similar to 110 m of vertical offset since the deposition of the Ediacaran-to-Cambrian Nama Group. This is less than expected from global compilations of total displacement and fault length data, suggesting that the fault rapidly attained its current length by recruiting an existing weak zone and is expected to accumulate displacement at a relatively constant length in the future.

TI  - The Global Atmosphere-aerosol Model ICON-A-HAM2.3-Initial Model Evaluation and Effects of Radiation Balance Tuning on Aerosol Optical Thickness
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hamburg Aerosol Module version 2.3 (HAM2.3) from the ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3 global atmosphere-aerosol model is coupled to the recently developed icosahedral nonhydrostatic ICON-A (icon-aes-1.3.00) global atmosphere model to yield the new ICON-A-HAM2.3 atmosphere-aerosol model. The ICON-A and ECHAM6.3 host models use different dynamical cores, parameterizations of vertical mixing due to sub-grid scale turbulence, and parameter settings for radiation balance tuning. Here, we study the role of the different host models for simulated aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and evaluate impacts of using HAM2.3 and the ECHAM6-HAM2.3 two-moment cloud microphysics scheme on several meteorological variables. Sensitivity runs show that a positive AOT bias over the subtropical oceans is remedied in ICON-A-HAM2.3 because of a different default setting of a parameter in the moist convection parameterization of the host models. The global mean AOT is biased low compared to MODIS satellite instrument retrievals in ICON-A-HAM2.3 and ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3, but the bias is larger in ICON-A-HAM2.3 because negative AOT biases over the Amazon, the African rain forest, and the northern Indian Ocean are no longer compensated by high biases over the sub-tropical oceans. ICON-A-HAM2.3 shows a moderate improvement with respect to AOT observations at AERONET sites. A multivariable bias score combining biases of several meteorological variables into a single number is larger in ICON-A-HAM2.3 compared to standard ICON-A and standard ECHAM6.3. In the tropics, this multivariable bias is of similar magnitude in ICON-A-HAM2.3 and in ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3. In the extra-tropics, a smaller multivariable bias is found for ICON-A-HAM2.3 than for ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3.

TI  - Impact of Climate Change and Variability on Spatiotemporal Variation of Forest Cover; World Heritage Sinharaja Rainforest, Sri Lanka
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainforests are continuously threatened by various anthropogenic activities. In addition, the ever-changing climate severeLy impacts the world's rainforest cover. The consequences of these are paid back to human at a higher cost. NevertheLess, Mlle or no significant attention was broadly given to this critical environmental issue. The World Heritage Sinharaja Rainforest in Sri Lanka is originating news on its forest cover due to human activities and changing climates. The scientific analysis is yet to be presented on the related issues. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive study on the possible impact on the Sinharaja Rainforest due to changing climate. Landsat images with measured rainfall data for 30 years were assessed and the relationships are presented. Results showcased that the built-up areas have drastically been increased over the Last decade in the vicinity and the declared forest area. The authorities found the issues are serious and a sensitive task to negotiate in conserving the forest. The rainfall around the forest area has not shown significant trends over the years. Therefore, the health of forest cover was not severeLy impacted. NevertheLess, six cleared-up areas were found inside the Singaraja Rainforest under no human interactions. This can be due to a possible influence from the changing climate. This was justified by the temporal variation of Land Surface Temperature (LST) assessments over these six cleared-up areas. Therefore, the World Heritage rainforest is threatened due to human activities and under the changing climate change. Hence, the conservation of the Sinharaja Rainforest would be challenging in the future.

TI  - Remote Sensing, Yield, Physical Characteristics, and Fruit Composition Variability in Cabernet Sauvignon Vineyards
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ENOLOGY AND VITICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil texture, topographical data, fruit zone light measurements, yield components, and fruit composition data were taken from 125 locations in each of four Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards in the Lodi region of California during the 2017, 2018, and 2019 seasons. Data were compared against three sources of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with different spatial resolutions: Landsat 8 (LS8(NDVI); 30 m), Sentinel-2 (S2(NDVI); 10 m), and manned aircraft (at high resolution, HR) with the interrow removed (HRNDVI; 20 cm). The manned aircraft also captured canopy temperature (CT) derived from infrared (thermal) wavelengths (HRCT; 40 cm) for additional comparisons. HRNDVI was inversely related to HRCT, as well as to several chemical components of fruit composition including tannins and anthocyanins. While some constituents of fruit composition such as anthocyanins may be related to NDVI, canopy temperature, and/or indirect measurements collected in the field, results presented here suggest that yield and fruit composition have a strong seasonal response and therefore environmental conditions should be considered if more accurate predictions are desired. Furthermore, freely available public satellite data sources with mixed canopy and interrow pixels, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8, provided similar information related to predicting specific fruit composition parameters compared to higher resolution imagery from contracted manned aircraft, from which the interrow signal was removed. Growers and wineries interested in predicting fruit composition that accounts for spatial variability may be able to conserve resources by using publicly available imagery sources and small numbers of targeted samples to achieve this goal.

T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sanchez-Sanchez, J, Raya-Gonzalez, J, Ramirez-Campillo, R, Chaabene, H, Petisco, C, and Nakamura, FY. The increased effectiveness of resistance training on unstable vs. stable surfaces on selected measures of physical performance in young male soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 36(4): 888-894, 2022-To examine the effects of 10-week (2/wk) resistance training on stable vs. unstable surfaces on selected measures of physical performance in young male soccer players, national-level U19 players participated in this study. They were randomly allocated to an unstable resistance training group (uRT, n = 27) or a stable resistance training group (sRT, n = 28). Before and after the training, horizontal jumping with dominant (Hop D) and nondominant leg (Hop non-D), repeated sprint ability (RSA best time [RSA(best)] and RSA mean time [RSA(mean)]), change-of-direction (COD) speed (Illinois COD test), and aerobic endurance (YoYo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 1 [YoYo IR1]) were assessed. To establish the effects of the interventions on the dependent variables, a 2 (group: uRT and sRT) x 2 (time: pre, post) analysis of variance with repeated measures on time was computed. A significant main effect of time was observed for Hop non-D, RSA(best), and RSA(mean) (p = 0.003-0.06, effect size [ES] = 0.06-0.15). Furthermore, significant group x time interactions were shown for RSA(best) (p = 0.007, ES = 0.13) and RSA(mean) (p = 0.002, ES = 0.2). Post hoc analysis revealed significant pre- to post-training improvements for RSA(best) (p = 0.002, ES = 0.35) and RSA(mean) (p = 0.0002, ES = 0.36) in the uRT. In the sRT, however, no significant pre-post performance changes were observed in RSA(best) and RSA(mean). In conclusion, 10 weeks of an in-season resistance training on unstable conditions in addition to regular soccer training was effective in improving repeated-sprint ability performance in youth male elite soccer players including maximal linear sprinting and the ability to perform repeated sprint.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis for Land-Take Assessment in Basilicata Region (Southern Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use is one of the drivers of land-cover change (LCC) and represents the conversion of natural to artificial land cover. This work aims to describe the land-take-monitoring activities and analyze the development trend in test areas of the Basilicata region. Remote sensing is the primary technique for extracting land-use/land-cover (LULC) data. In this study, a new methodology of classification of Landsat data (TM-OLI) is proposed to detect land-cover information automatically and identify land take to perform a multi-temporal analysis. Moreover, within the defined model, it is crucial to use the territorial information layers of geotopographic database (GTDB) for the detailed definition of the land take. All stages of the classification process were developed using the supervised classification algorithm support vector machine (SVM) change-detection analysis, thus integrating the geographic information system (GIS) remote sensing data and adopting free and open-source software and data. The application of the proposed method allowed us to quickly extract detailed land-take maps with an overall accuracy greater than 90%, reducing the cost and processing time.

AB  - Moravian Christianity. He did so, Pointer argues, because the Moravian to maintaining the independence of his community from both colonial predation and the Indigenous cultural practices he had rejected, make him a "surprising, countercultural figure in the eighteenth century"(5). Pacifist Prophet begins by exploring the context of Papunhank's Munsee upbringing. Born around 1705, Papunhank lived most of his seventy years away from European or Indigenous recordkeepers. Pointer traces how the Munsee (living primarily in the lower Hudson Valley) had to navigate relationships with the powerful Six Nations and neighboring colonies. Chapter 2 examines Papunhank's road to becoming a prophet and then his gradual moves toward Christianity. Pointer argues Papunhank's first recorded statement in 1760 reveals that his "pilgrimage" involved "mostly indigenous spiritual practices and methods" (51). Papunhank's journey began with a vision, which led him to gain renown as a prophet and healer. But a journey that began with the sort of neotraditionalist practices becoming common at the time led him first to absolute pacifism and then Christianity. Chapter 3 traces Papunhank's meeting with Moravians that included both German missionaries and Indigenous converts. Although intrigued by the Quakers he met, Papunhank decided to join the Moravians, whose emphasis on Christ's bloody sacrifice as a source of spiritual power, Pointer suggests, would have appealed to a Munsee worldview. Chapter 4 details Papunhank and his followers' struggle to avoid both the conflict known as Pontiac's War and the violent reprisals of Indian-hating whites. Chapter 5 traces their refounding of Wyalusing as a Moravian town with the permission of the Six Nations. Chapter 6 details how, in the wake

TI  - Minimally invasive surgery in gynecological cancers: update and systematic review
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: In the last decades, the introduction of laparoscopy and, more recently, of robotic surgery, offered new options for surgical treatment also in gynecological malignancies, as an alternative to open surgery. When considering the best surgical treatment option for gynecological malignancies, evidence about safety, feasibility, and oncological outcomes must be taken into account, to offer the best treatment to the patient. The present review aims to provide an updated scenario over the available evidence in the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in gynecological malignancies. Material and methods: An electronic search was performed using the following keywords: 'minimally invasive surgery' and 'gynecology', 'minimally invasive surgery' and 'endometrial cancer', 'minimally invasive surgery' and 'ovarian cancer', 'minimally invasive surgery' and 'cervical cancer'. The agreement about potential relevance was reached by consensus of the researchers and according to PRISMA statement guidelines. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical trials, and original articles were included in the present review. Results: Fifty-eight studies were considered eligible for the study, 23 studies regarding MIS in endometrial cancer (EC), 19 studies on MIS in ovarian cancer (OC), and 16 studies regarding MIS in cervical cancer (CC). The total of patients enrolled was 180,057, 131,430 in the EC group, 23,774 in the OC groups, and 24,853 in the CC group. Conclusions: According to the available evidence and current clinical practice, MIS is undoubtedly the gold standard for early-stage EC treatment and may represent an acceptable option even in high-risk EC patients. Concerning OC, MIS is a safe and useful tool for staging purposes in advanced-stage disease, and a treatment option only in high volume centres with expert oncologic surgeons. On the contrary, MIS should be abandoned in the context of CC, exception made for well-selected patients, who received adequate counselling about current evidence.

TI  - Multidisciplinarity, Interdisciplinarity, and Transdisciplinarity: The Tower of Babel in the Age of Two Cultures
T2  - PHILOSOPHIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the continuous emphasis on globalization, we witness increasing divisions and divisiveness in all domains of human activities. One of the reasons, if not the main one, is the intellectual fragmentation of humanity, compared in the title to the failed attempt at building the Biblical Tower of Babel. The attempts to reintegrate worldview, fragmented by the specialization of education (C.P. Snow's The Two Cultures) and expected to be achieved through reforms in curricula at all levels of education, were based on the assumption that the design of a curriculum should focus on the wide distribution of subjects of study, as if the distribution was the goal. The key point is not the distribution of themes, but the development of skills in the integration of knowledge. The quantitative assessment of the width of knowledge by the number of disciplines is of secondary importance. We cannot expect the miracle that students without any intellectual tools developed for this purpose would perform the job of integration, which their teachers do not promote or demonstrate, and which they cannot achieve for themselves. There are many other reasons for the increasing interest in making inquiries interdisciplinary, but there is little progress in the methodology of the integration of knowledge. This paper is a study of the transition from multidisciplinarity to interdisciplinarity, and further, to transdisciplinarity, with some suggestions regarding the use of methodological tools of structuralism and the choice of a conceptual framework.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Meteorological Data Fusion in Predicting Bushfire Severity: A Case Study from Victoria, Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The extent and severity of bushfires in a landscape are largely governed by meteorological conditions. An accurate understanding of the interactions of meteorological variables and fire behaviour in the landscape is very complex, yet possible. In exploring such understanding, we used 2693 high-confidence active fire points recorded by a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor for nine different bushfires that occurred in Victoria between 1 January 2009 and 31 March 2009. These fires include the Black Saturday Bushfires of 7 February 2009, one of the worst bushfires in Australian history. For each fire point, 62 different meteorological parameters of bushfire time were extracted from Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (BARRA) data. These remote sensing and meteorological datasets were fused and further processed in assessing their relative importance using four different tree-based ensemble machine learning models, namely, Random Forest (RF), Fuzzy Forest (FF), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Landsat images were used in deriving the response variable-Relative Difference Normalised Burn Ratio (RdNBR), which was selected by comparing its performance against Difference Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR). Our findings demonstrate that the FF algorithm utilising the Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) method has the best predictive performance of 96.50%, assessed against 10-fold cross-validation. The result shows that the relative influence of the variables on bushfire severity is in the following order: (1) soil moisture, (2) soil temperature, (3) air pressure, (4) air temperature, (5) vertical wind, and (6) relative humidity. This highlights the importance of soil meteorology in bushfire severity analysis, often excluded in bushfire severity research. Further, this study provides a scientific basis for choosing a subset of meteorological variables for bushfire severity prediction depending on their relative importance. The optimal subset of high-ranked variables is extremely useful in constructing simplified and computationally efficient surrogate models, which can be particularly useful for the rapid assessment of bushfire severity for operational bushfire management and effective mitigation efforts.

AB  - This research is about developing stochastic worldview formation among high school students (grades 10 and 11) based on integrating scientific approaches, namely, information and technology, interdisciplinary, system, and activity approaches. Developing the structural components of a stochastic worldview, such as motivation-value relations, intuitive-figurative perception, and rational-logic acceptance, determines the most effective way for students in grades 10 and 11 to form a worldview when teaching stochastics. The research site was School Gymnasium No. 11 in Yelets, located in the Lipetsk region. Tests, questionnaires, and documentation were used as data collection methods. The methodology of data analysis included descriptive statistics. According to Fisher's angular transformation criterion (phi), the validation of the experimental data confirmed the research efficiency. This study showed that the proposed tool improves students' motivation, value, and worldview constructs, guiding them to understand the stochastic component of the world around them.The results complement the methodological and methodical features of math education, which aims to develop helpful worldview qualities of students. These results can be beneficial for methodical science since, with their help, it specifies the known approaches, ideas, methodological means in mathematics education, and upbringing of high school students.

TI  - Inter- and Intra-Annual Glacier Elevation Change in High Mountain Asia Region Based on ICESat-1&2 Data Using Elevation-Aspect Bin Analysis Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are sensitive indicators of climate change and have a significant influence on regional water cycle, human survival and social development. Global warming has led to great changes in glaciers over the High Mountain Asia (HMA) region. Glacier elevation change is a measure of glacier mass balance driven by the processes of energy and mass exchange between the glacier surface and the atmosphere which are influenced by climatic factors and glacier surface properties. In this study, we estimated the inter-annual and intra-annual elevation changes of glaciers in the HMA region in 2003-2020 using Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data and Shuttle Radar Terrain Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) data by developing an "elevation-aspect bin analysis method" that considered the difference of glacier elevation changes in different elevations and aspects of glacier topography. The results showed that: (1) The inter-annual change of glacier elevation in 2003-2020 had large spatial heterogeneity. Glacier elevation reduction mainly occurred in the marginal region of the HMA with the maximum decline in the Nyainqentanglha region, while glacier elevation showed increase in the West Kunlun of inner HMA regions in 2003-2020. The glacier elevation change rate showed an accelerating reduction trend in most of the HMA regions, except in the west HMA where the glacier elevation reduction rate showed slowdown tendency. Specifically, the glacier elevation change rate in the entire HMA was -0.21 +/- 0.12 m/year in 2003-2008 and -0.26 +/- 0.11 m/year in 2003-2020, respectively. (2) The intra-annual change of HMA glacier elevation in 2019 and 2020 showed obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and the glacier thickening period was gradually delayed from the marginal area to the inner area of the HMA. The glaciers in the western marginal part of the HMA (the Tienshan Mountains, Pamir and Hindu Kush and Spiti Lahaul) and Karakoram thickened in winter or spring, the glaciers in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains exhibited spring accumulation. The glaciers in West Kunlun accumulated in two time periods, i.e., from March to June and from July to September. The glaciers in the Inner Tibetan Plateau and Bhutan and Nepal areas experienced spring or summer accumulation, especially in June or July. Moreover, we found that the inter-annual and intra-annual change of glacier elevation could be explained by the changes in temperature and precipitation. A similar analysis can be extended to mountain glaciers in other regions of the world, and glacier change trends could be further explored over a longer time span with the continuous operation of ICESat-2.

TI  - Atmospheric Exploration of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau during the East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) from a Ground-Based Microwave Radiometer
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The investigation of atmospheric characteristics is of great significance in properly exploiting air and water resources, and quantitatively estimating and nowcasting precipitation. Microwave radiometers are widely used in this field because they can operate unattended for a long time under almost all weather conditions, and obtain high-quality remote sensing data. This research focuses on the applications of ground-based microwave radiometers in retrieving meteorological characteristics of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) during the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), such as humidity and temperature structures, stability/convection indices, and cloud and precipitation retrievals. Vertical structures of atmospheric temperature, pressure, humidity, and other variables were investigated under clear-sky and snowy-sky conditions. The statistical characteristics of stability/convection indices in the QTP region, such as convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN), were investigated, with a special focus on snowy-sky conditions. The relationship between potential cloud water resources and atmospheric and thermodynamics and instability conditions were taken into consideration. The results showed that the peak CAPEs under clear-sky and snowy-sky conditions were 1349.11 J/kg and 1165.12 J/kg, which were relatively larger than the corresponding values during the summer monsoon. CINs during the EAWM were small enough to be negligible. For quantitative precipitation forecasting (QPF), brightness temperatures at 30.0 GHz and 51.24 GHz sampling channels were sensitive to the snowfall process. Within 1 h before snowfall, the precipitable water vapour (PWV) and liquid water content (LWC) increased sharply by 0.05 cm and 0.12 mm, respectively, while the CAPE and downwards CAPE decreased by 225.60 J/kg and 180.31 J/kg, respectively. The findings of this article may be meaningful for characterizing meteorology and precipitation in the QTP and similar regions during the winter monsoon.

TI  - Identifying Key Environmental Factors for <i>Paulownia coreana</i> Habitats: Implementing National On-Site Survey and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and preserving natural habitats has become an essential activity in many countries today. As a native tree species in Korea, Paulownia coreana has periodically been surveyed in national ecological surveys and was identified as an important target for conservation as well as habitat monitoring and management. This study explores habitat suitability models (HSMs) for Paulownia coreana in conjunction with national ecological survey data and various environmental factors. Together with environmental variables, the national ecological survey data were run through machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree & Rules, which were used to identify the impact of individual variables and create HSMs for Paulownia coreana, respectively. Unlike other studies, which used remote sensing data to create HSMs, this study employed periodical on-site survey data for enhanced validity. Moreover, localized environmental resources such as topography, soil, and rainfall were taken into account to project habitat suitability. Among the environment variables used, the study identified critical attributes that affect the habitat conditions of Paulownia coreana. Therefore, the habitat suitability modelling methods employed in this study could play key roles in planning, monitoring, and managing plants species in regional and national levels. Furthermore, it could shed light on existing challenges and future research needs.

T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of tourism infrastructure causes land-use change or land conversion from green open spaces into tourism economic areas. The utilization of mangrove areas as an ecotourism attraction needs to be monitored regularly so that facilities and infrastructure development do not threaten the sustainability of mangrove vegetation. This article aims to identify the distribution of mangroves using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Combined Mangrove Recognize Index (CMRI) model in Morotai Island Regency, North Maluku Province, Indonesia. The perspective of sustainable ecotourism is used to discuss the socio -cultural context of the Morotai community, especially the people of Kolorai Island. This study adopted a mixed-method. Data processing is divided into two stages: the first stage, mapping the distribution of mangroves on Dodola Island using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite imagery from 2013-2021 based on NDVI, NDWI, and CMRI calculations; the second stage, triangulation. The results of this study indicate that in 2017, there was a decrease in the value of NDVI and CMRI in Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3 as a mangrove ecotourism area on Dodola Island. It indicates a threat to the mangrove ecosystem if infrastructure development causes a decrease in the value of the vegetation index significantly significant from year to year. Thus, it is necessary to control infrastructure development programs by involving local communities in the maintenance of mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Urban Trees in the Arctic City: Case of Nadym
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees in Arctic cities perform not only important provisional and regulating ecosystem services, but also bring predominantly settler population closer to the visual images and household standards of their home southern regions. However, maintenance of green infrastructure in the Arctic has specific difficulties associated with the harsh climatic and environmental conditions. This paper focuses on state and dynamics of vegetation in the city of Nadym, Russia, with a particular focus on native and introduced trees as the main ecosystem service providers and an articulation of local values towards green spaces. The research is based on interdisciplinary approach which includes interviews with local residents, geobotanical survey and analysis of remote sensing data. The results of the study show that maintaining of natural vegetation requires specific measures due to environmental the critical impact of anthropogenic activity. The active introduction of plants from more southern regions is manifested both in the deliberate practice of landscaping the city's streets and courtyards, and in spontaneous attempts to introduce plants from more southern (not Subarctic) agricultural regions of Russia, which are privately brought by city residents from other regions.

TI  - Evaluating sampling strategies for enzootic Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus vectors in Florida and Panama
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining effective sampling methods for mosquitoes are among the first objectives in elucidating transmission cycles of vector-borne zoonotic disease, as the effectiveness of sampling methods can differ based on species, location, and physiological state. The Spissipes section of the subgenus Melanoconion of Culex represents an understudied group of mosquitoes which transmit Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses (VEEV) in the Western Hemisphere. The objective of this study was to determine effective collection methods that target both blood-engorged and non-engorged females of the Spissipes section of Culex subgenus Melanoconion to test the hypothesis that favorable trapping methods differ between species and by physiological status within a species. Mosquitoes were collected using two commercially available traps, (CDC-light trap and BG-Sentinel trap), two novel passive traps (a novel mosquito drift fence and pop-up resting shelters), and two novel aspirators, (a small-diameter aspirator and a large-diameter aspirator) in Darien, Panama, and Florida, USA. The total number of female mosquitoes collected for each species was compared using rarefaction curves and diversity metrics. We also compared the utility of each trap for collecting total females and blood-engorged females of four Spissipes section mosquito species in Florida and Darien. In Darien, it was found that both blood-engorged and unfed females of Cx. pedroi were most effectively collected using the mosquito drift fence at 57.6% and 61.7% respectively. In contrast, the most unfed Cx. spissipes were collected using the mosquito drift fence (40.7%) while blood-engorged females were collected effectively by pop-up resting shelters (42.3%). In Florida, the best sampling technique for the collection of blood-engorged Cx. panocossa was the large diameter aspirator at 41.9%, while the best trap for collecting Cx. cedecei was the pop-up resting shelter at 45.9%. For unfed female Spissipes section mosquitoes in Florida, the CDC light trap with CO2 collected 84.5% and 98.3% of Cx. cedecei and Cx. panocossa respectively in Florida. Rarefaction analysis, and both the Shannon and Simpsons diversity indices all demonstrated that the mosquito drift fence was capable of collecting the greatest diversity of mosquito species regardless of location. The finding that the proportions of unfed and blood-engorged mosquitoes collected by traps differed both among and between species has implications for how studies of VEEV vectors will be carried out in future investigations. In Florida a combination of pop-up resting shelters and use of a large-diameter aspirator would be optimal for the collection of both VEEV vectors for host-use studies. Results demonstrate that traps can be constructed from common materials to collect mosquitoes for VEEV vector studies and could be assessed for their utilization in vectors of other systems as well. Unfortunately, no single method was effective for capturing all species and physiological states, highlighting a particular need for assessing trap utility for target species of a study.Author summaryVenezuelan equine encephalitis virus is a potentially deadly human pathogen that is transmitted by an understudied group of tropical mosquitoes (Spissipes section of the Culex subgenus Melanoconion). These mosquitoes reside in swamps and jungles, and are challenging to identify, so studying their biology and importance in transmitting VEEV has been neglected. To further our understanding of VEEV, we compared six novel and commercially available traps to determine which traps are best for capturing these species in Panama and Florida. We found that several different types of traps are effective for collecting blood-engorged females of different species of VEEV vectors, and that traps utilized for collecting unfed specimens are not necessarily the same traps one should use for collecting blood-engorged females of the same species. Results of this study will enable researchers to better capture these important disease vectors, particularly those that are blood-engorged, which will allow researchers to determine host associations necessary for understanding VEEV transmission. This information can be used to make decisions on controlling vector species.

TI  - Diagnosis and Prognosis of Canine Melanocytic Neoplasms
T2  - VETERINARY SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Canine melanocytic neoplasms have a highly variable biological behavior ranging from benign cutaneous melanocytomas to malignant oral melanomas that readily metastasize to lymph nodes and internal organs. This review focuses on the diagnosis and prognosis of canine melanocytic neoplasms. While pigmented melanocytic neoplasms can be diagnosed with fine-needle aspirates, an accurate prognosis requires surgical biopsy. However, differentiating amelanotic spindloid melanomas from soft tissue sarcomas is challenging and often requires immunohistochemical labeling with a diagnostic cocktail that contains antibodies against Melan-A, PNL-2, TRP-1, and TRP-2 as the current gold standard. For questionable cases, RNA expression analysis for TYR, CD34, and CALD can further differentiate these two entities. The diagnosis of amelanotic melanomas will be aided by submitting overlying and/or lateral flanking epithelium to identify junctional activity. Wide excision of lateral flanking epithelium is essential, as lentiginous spread is common for malignant mucosal melanomas. Combining histologic features (nuclear atypia, mitotic count, degree of pigmentation, level of infiltration, vascular invasion; tumor thickness and ulceration) with the Ki67 index provides the most detailed prognostic assessment. Sentinel lymph nodes should be evaluated in cases of suspected malignant melanomas using serial sectioning of the node combined with immunohistochemical labeling for Melan-A and PNL-2.

T2  - TECNOLOGIA EN MARCHA
M3  - Article
AB  - Eucalyptus grandis plantations are of great importance, from a social point of view due to their great commercial value, and from an ecological point of view because they are capable of harboring a certain biodiversity of species. The leaf area index (LAI) is an important indicator to measure the health of these plantations related to productivity. The objective of this research is to estimate the LAI from Sentinel images in Eucalyptus grandis plantations. Sentinel satellite images were used to estimate the LAI in the plantations, later the statistical analyzes were carried out by means of a comparison of independent means. Values were obtained as the mean that was 2.0 of the leaf area index in the plantations, these results were very similar to those obtained in other investigations carried out in the field. Therefore, it is recommended to use this methodology in other types of plantations, since it can be used to be applied in other equations to calculate the potential yield of crops.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion causes land degradation which negatively impacts not only natural resources but also livelihoods of people due to low agricultural productivity. Cambodia is prone to soil erosion due to poor agricultural practices. In this research we use Battambang province as a case study to quantify impact of land use and land cover change (LULC) on soil erosion. This study assessed the impact from LULC changes to soil erosion. LULC change maps were analyzed based on Landsat satellite imagery of 1998, 2008, and 2018, computed in QGIS 6.2.9, while the soil erosion loss was estimated by the integration of remote sensing, GIS tools, and Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. The results showed that the area of agricultural land of Battambang province significantly increased from 44.50% in 1998 to 61.11% in 2008 and 68.40% in 2018. The forest cover significantly decreased from 29.82% in 1998 to 6.18% in 2018. Various soil erosion factors were estimated using LULC and slope. Based on that, the mean soil loss was 2.92 t/ha.yr in 1998, 4.20 t/ha.yr in 2008, and 4.98 t/ha.yr in 2018. Whereas the total annual soil loss was 3.49 million tons in 1998, 5.03 million tons in 2008, and 5.93 million tons in 2018. The annual soil loss at the agricultural land dramatically increased from 190,9347.9 tons (54%) in 1998 to 3,543,659 tons (70.43%) in 2008 and to 4,267,439 tons (71.91%) in 2018 due to agricultural land expansion and agricultural practices. These losses were directly correlated with LULC, especially agricultural land expansion and forest cover decline. Our results highlight the need to develop appropriate land use and crop management practices to decrease land degradation and soil erosion. These data are useful to bring about public awareness of land degradation and alert local citizens, researchers, policy makers, and actors towards land rehabilitation to bring the area of land back to a state which is safe for increasing biodiversity and agricultural productivity. Measures to reduce or prevent soil erosion and the use of conservation agriculture practices, along with water and soil conservation, management, agroforestry practices, vegetation cover restoration, the creation of slope terraces, and the use of direct sowing mulch-based cropping systems should be considered.

TI  - Syndromic Surveillance Systems for Mass Gatherings: A Scoping Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Syndromic surveillance involves the near-real-time collection of data from a potential multitude of sources to detect outbreaks of disease or adverse health events earlier than traditional forms of public health surveillance. The purpose of the present study is to elucidate the role of syndromic surveillance during mass gathering scenarios. In the present review, the use of syndromic surveillance for mass gathering scenarios is described, including characteristics such as methodologies of data collection and analysis, degree of preparation and collaboration, and the degree to which prior surveillance infrastructure is utilized. Nineteen publications were included for data extraction. The most common data source for the included syndromic surveillance systems was emergency departments, with first aid stations and event-based clinics also present. Data were often collected using custom reporting forms. While syndromic surveillance can potentially serve as a method of informing public health policy regarding specific mass gatherings based on the profile of syndromes ascertained, the present review does not indicate that this form of surveillance is a reliable method of detecting potentially critical public health events during mass gathering scenarios.

TI  - Multi-Sensor Analysis of Snow Seasonality and a Preliminary Assessment of SAR Backscatter Sensitivity to Arctic Vegetation: Limits and Capabilities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow melt timing and the last day of snow cover have a significant impact on vegetation phenology in the Svalbard archipelago. The aim of this study is to assess the seasonal variations of the snow using a multi-sensor approach and to analyze the sensitivity of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter to vegetation growth and soil moisture in an arctic environment. A combined approach using time series data from active remote sensing sensors such as SAR and passive optical sensors is a known technique in snow monitoring, while there is little knowledge of the radar C-band's response pattern to vegetation dynamics in the arctic. First, we created multi-sensor masks using the HV backscatter coefficients from Sentinel-1 and the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) time series from Sentinel-2, monitoring the snow dynamics in Adventdalen (Svalbard) for the season from 2017 to 2018. Second, radar sensitivity analysis was performed using the HV polarized channel responses to vegetation growth and soil moisture dynamics. (1) Our results showed that the C-band radar data are capable of monitoring the seasonal variability in timing of snow melting in Adventdalen, revealing an earlier start by approximately 20 days in 2018 compared to 2017. (2) From the sensitivity analyses, the HV channel showed a major response to the vegetation component in areas with drier graminoid dominated vegetation without water-saturated soil (R = 0.69). However, the temperature was strongly correlated with the HV channel (R = 0.74) during the years with delayed snow melting. Areas of frozen tundra with drier vegetation dominated by graminoids had delayed soil thawing processes and therefore this may limit the ability of the radar to follow the vegetation growth pattern and soil moisture.

TI  - A Call for Evidence-Based Conservative Management of Nail Unit Malignancies
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nail unit squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma are the most common malignancies of the nail apparatus. Compared to their cutaneous counterparts, they are diagnosed later and perceived as more aggressive. This may result in overzealous management, including radiographic imaging with poor sensitivity and specificity, interventional nodal staging by sentinel lymph node biopsy, amputation over digit-sparing tumor resections, and elaborate reconstructions after tumor extirpation. In this review article, the authors evaluate the evidence behind several misconceptions in nail malignancy management and provide evidence-based guidance for more conservative care.

TI  - Ice Detection with Sentinel-1 SAR Backscatter Threshold in Long Sections of Temperate Climate Rivers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change leads to more variable meteorological conditions. In many Northern Hemisphere temperate regions, cold seasons have become more variable and unpredictable, necessitating frequent river ice observations over long sections of rivers. Satellite SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar)-based river ice detection models have been successfully applied and tested, but different hydrological, morphological and climatological conditions can affect their skill. In this study, we developed and tested Sentinel-1 SAR-based ice detection models in 525 km sections of the Nemunas and Neris Rivers. We analyzed three binary classification models based on VV, VH backscatter and logistic regression. The model sensitivity and specificity were used to determine the optimal threshold between ice and water classes. We used in situ observations and Sentinel-2 Sen2Cor ice mask to validate models in different ice conditions. In most cases, SAR-based ice detection models outperformed Sen2Cor classification because Sen2Cor misclassified pixels as ice in areas with translucent clouds, undetected by the scene classification algorithm, and misclassified pixels as water in cloud or river valley shadow. SAR models were less accurate in river sections where river flow and ice formation conditions were affected by large valley-dammed reservoirs. Sen2Cor and SAR models accurately detected border and consolidated ice but were less accurate in moving ice conditions. The skill of models depended on how dense the moving ice was. With a lowered classification threshold and increased model sensitivity, SAR models detected sparse frazil ice. In most cases, the VV polarization-based model was more accurate than the VH polarization-based model. The results of logistic and VV models were highly correlated, and the use of VV was more constructive due to its simpler algorithm.

AB  - The problem underlying the study is the fact that the approaches used to increase the involvement of representatives of generations prior to generation Z in the practice of philanthropy turn out to be ineffective when involving zoomers, as they do not fit into the system of worldview practices and value orientations of Generation Z representatives. The study aims to analyze the problems and prospects for the development of approaches used to involve Generation Z representatives in philanthropy and develop recommendations for improving the technologies for involving zoomers in philanthropy based on the analysis of their value orientations. To reach the aim of the study, the author (a) analyzed the currently existing scientific studies (including empirical ones) on the specifics of Generation Z's value system and its correlation with philanthropic practices; (b) systematized the acquired knowledge and assessed how reasonable the distinction in value systems between Generation Z and its predecessors is from the standpoint of philanthropic practices. In practical terms, the author (1) explored the involvement of Generation Z's representatives in philanthropy; (2) on the basis of the obtained data and their analysis, determined the features of the influence of Generation Z's value system on involving zoomers in philanthropy; (3) developed recommendations to improve the involvement of zoomers in philanthropy.

TI  - Effects of the new Priestly-Taylor equation on determining the boundary of LST/FVC space for soil moisture monitoring
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature and Fractional Vegetation Coverage (LST/FVC) space is a classical model in remote sensing of soil moisture (SM). Its most vital issue is the determination of the boundary i.e. dry and wet edges. Visual interpretation and automatic fitting methods are very demanding for the research area. In contrast, theoretical calculation of the boundary has great application potential, where the traditional Priestley-Taylor (PT) equation has been introduced to derive a Sun2016 method. Recently, a new Priestly-Taylor equation was suggested. In order to furtherly improve the optical & thermal remote sensing of SM, we evaluated the new PT equation for boundary determination through deriving a Sun 2021 method. The evaluation was conducted using data from three aircraft experiments for SM observation i.e. SMAPVEX12, SMAPVEX16 in Iowa, and SMAPVEX16 in Manitoba. Simulated data with the Simsphere model was also used. Results demonstrated that the effects of the new PT equation are related to air temperature (Ta). For a certain range of Ta such as from 290K to 310K, the Sun 2021 method is close to the Sun2016 method, which implies limited influence of the new PT equation within that range. For Ta out of that range, the Sun 2021 method presented better performance than the Sun2016, which implies stronger suitability of the new PT equation. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the new PT equation increases the sensitivity of calculated wet edge to Ta while decreases its sensitivity to the other input variables. For future extensive application, we also explored convenient ways for determining some essential parameters in the Sun 2021 method. The new PT equation has potential to promote the optical & thermal remote sensing of SM, evapotranspiration, drought, etc.

TI  - A THREAT, A NEW RELIGION OR A CHANCE FOR IMMORTALITY? POLISH OPINION-FORMING PRESS DISCOURSE ON TRANSHUMANISM
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The conducted research aims to determine the scope of the understanding of transhumanism disseminated in opinion-forming magazines in Poland. Eight weeklies from 2019 to 2020 were analysed, and the study showed that the topic of transhumanism appeared in the studied publications quite rarely. The attitude of the weeklies towards transhumanism also reveals a relationship to each weekly's worldview. While the discourse of the weeklies generally does not fuel fears associated with transhumanism, it nonetheless shows that social development in Poland has not kept pace with technological development. Especially religious-conservative magazines do little to bring their readers closer to one of the most pressing and up-to-date ethical and theological challenges facing humanity.

TI  - Leveraging time series of satellite and aerial images to promote the long-term monitoring of restored plant communities
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Ecological restoration is integral to meeting conservation goals in rapidly changing landscapes, but outcomes vary substantially with some projects failing to meet their targets. To understand the causes of this variability, long-term monitoring of existing projects is critical, but this comes at considerable costs. Current literature counts several studies using time series of satellite images to assess vegetation responses to disturbances and landscape transformations. Yet such methods are seldom used in the restoration literature and in practice. This synthesis seeks to identify how common remote sensing approaches for the assessment of plant recovery could inform the monitoring and management of restored plant communities. Methods This paper reviews the methods and metrics used to detect trajectories (i.e., change through time) in plant properties from rich time series of aerial and satellite images following change drivers including fire, extreme climatic events, climate change, and pest outbreaks. Specifically, it reviews the sensors, vegetation properties, modeling approaches, and indicators that can help measure plant stress and response to interventions. Results and Conclusions Remote sensing methods commonly used in disturbance ecology and assessments of land-cover changes could inform the monitoring of restoration projects at low cost and over large spatio-temporal scales, thus bridging the gap between field surveys to rapidly identify stressors or unexpected vegetation responses. Potential applications include comparing sites to identify factors impacting their responses to restoration, assessing restoration success, and testing ecological hypotheses to guide future project planning and design.

TI  - High Compliance With Choosing Wisely Breast Surgical Guidelines at a Safety-Net Hospital
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Professional organizations recently set guidelines for avoiding surgeries of low utility and overutilization for the Choosing Wisely campaign. These include re-excision for invasive cancer close to margins, double mastectomy in patients with unilateral breast cancer, axillary lymph node dissection in patients with limited nodal disease, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients >70 years with early-stage breast cancer. Variable adherence to these recommendations led us to evaluate implementation rates of low-value surgical guidelines at a safety-net hospital. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed breast cancer patients who underwent surgery from 2015 to 2020. Each patient was assessed for eligibility for omission of the listed surgeries. Trends were evaluated by cohorts before and after a fellowship-trained breast surgeon joined the faculty in 2018. Outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test. Results: Among 195 patients, none underwent re-excision for close margins of invasive cancer. Only 6.7% of patients (3/45) received contralateral mastectomy and 1.8% of eligible patients (3/169) received axillary lymph node dissection. Overall, 60% of patients > 70 years with stage 1 hormone-positive breast cancer (9/15) received SLNB. There was a downward trend from 71% of eligible patients receiving SLNB in 2015-2018 to 50% in 2019-2020. Conclusions: De-implementation of traditional surgical practices, deemed as low-value care, toward newer guidelines is achievable even at community hospitals serving a low socioeconomic community. By avoiding overtreatment, hospitals can achieve effective resource allocation which allow for social distributive justice among patients with breast cancer and ensure strategic use of scarce health economic resources while preserving patient outcomes.

TI  - Ecotourism risk assessment in Yaoluoping Nature Reserve, Anhui, China based on GIS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As tourism development and human disturbance increase, they have been affecting the functional structure distribution, sustainable utilization of resources, and ecological benefits of nature reserves. At the same time, ecological risk has increased significantly. This study proposes ecotourism development patterns for risk areas at each level, to provide a basis for stabilizing and promoting the ecological sustainable development of nature reserves. Yaoluoping National Nature Reserve in China is used as a study case. Based on GaoFen-2 satellite data within the reserve area in 2017, ENVI, Fragstats and ArcGIS10.2 are used for land use classification as well as evaluation indicators selection and analysis. The ecotourism risk assessment model of the reserve is constructed, which is also imbedded with analytic hierarchy process and Ecological Risk Index. The model consists of landscape ecology, topographic hydrology, land use and human activities factors, and it can produce the distribution map at the ecotourism risk level of the reserve. Results show that the high ecotourism risk areas in the reserve are mainly located around rivers and roads, and they are distributed in strips. Overall, the ecotourism risk level in the northern part of the reserve is higher than that in the southern part. Nearly 90% of the regional ecotourism risk is at the middle or low level, implying the reserve in a healthy level overall. However, except for low-risk areas, the proportion of risk areas at all levels in the core zone is higher than that in the buffer zone.

TI  - Flood Detection in Urban Areas Using Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban flooding poses risks to the safety of drivers and pedestrians, and damages infrastructures and lifelines. It is important to accommodate cities and local agencies with enhanced rapid flood detection skills and tools to better understand how much flooding a region may experience at a certain period of time. This results in flood management orders being announced in a timely manner, allowing residents and drivers to preemptively avoid flooded areas. This research combines information received from ground observed data derived from road closure reports from the police department, with remotely sensed satellite imagery to develop and train machine-learning models for flood detection for the City of San Diego, CA, USA. For this purpose, flooding information are extracted from Sentinel 1 satellite imagery and fed into various supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), to detect flooded pixels in images and evaluate the performance of these ML models. Moreover, a new unsupervised machine learning framework is developed which works based on the change detection (CD) approach and combines the Otsu algorithm, fuzzy rules, and iso-clustering methods for urban flood detection. Results from the performance evaluation of RF, SVM, MLC and CD models show 0.53, 0.85, 0.75 and 0.81 precision measures, 0.9, 0.85, 0.85 and 0.9 for recall values, 0.67, 0.85, 0.79 and 0.85 for the F1-score, and 0.69, 0.87, 0.83 and 0.87 for the accuracy measure, respectively, for each model. In conclusion, the new unsupervised flood image classification and detection method offers better performance with the least required data and computational time for enhanced rapid flood mapping. This systematic approach will be potentially useful for other cities at risk of urban flooding, and hopefully for detecting nuisance floods, by using satellite images and reducing the flood risk of transportation design and urban infrastructure planning.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) characteristics on shoreline demarcation and change assessment along Mandaikadu, south-west coast of India for the year 2018-2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The southwest coast of India has changed dramatically as a result of natural and anthropogenic influences. The Mandaikadu coast in Tamilnadu has witnessed severe erosion activities. To understand the spatial and temporal beach morphological changes of this coast is being studied for the years 2018 and 2019. An attempt is made to map the coastal reforms using active Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing data by delineating shoreline based on backscattering coefficient (sigma degrees dB). The shoreline tracking and beach profiling were collected using a real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) for the two seasons. The study to examine; (i) SAR being able to distinguish between beach and sea in real-time conditions based on their backscattering coefficient values (ii) Otsu threshold algorithm is being used to study the backscattering signal response at grey-scale for conformity (iii) DSAS being used to compute the statistical shoreline change rate by calculating End Point Rate (EPR) for short-term changes. The results showed that the cumulative distribution difference between beach and sea backscattering values (sigma degrees(B) -sigma degrees(S)) tends to yield a higher value of maximum probability in co-polarised sigma degrees(VV) (53%) accuracy compared to cross-polarised sigma degrees(VH) (16%). The study concluded that the Mandaikadu coast experienced an average erosion rate of (-55.34 m/yr) from 2018 to 2019 mainly due to the reduction of sediment discharge and other man-made activities. This study aims to help compensate for existing shoreline mapping especially with adverse weather conditions during the monsoon season. In the future, based on the findings of the study will be carried out for the entire Indian coast.

TI  - Modelling Land Use and Land Cover in the Transboundary Mono River Catchment of Togo and Benin Using Markov Chain and Stakeholder's Perspectives
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating both modeling approach and stakeholders' perspectives to derive past and future trends of land use land cover (LULC) is a key to creating more realistic results on LULC change trajectories and can lead to the implementation of appropriate management measures. This article assessed the past changes of LULC in the Mono River catchment using Landsat images from the years 1986, 2000, 2010, and 2020 by performing Machine Learning Classification Method Random Forest (RF) technique, and using Markov chain method and stakeholder's perspective to simulate future LULC changes for the years 2030 and 2050. LULC was classified as savanna, cropland, forest, water bodies, and settlement. The results showed that croplands and forests areas declined from 2020 to 2050 with decreases of -7.8% and -1.9%, respectively, a modest increase in settlement (1.3%), and savanna was the dominant LULC in the study region with an increase of 8.5%. From stakeholders' perspective, rapid population growth, deforestation, rainfall variability/flood, urbanization, and agricultural expansion were the most important drivers associated with the observed LULC changes in the area. Other factors, such as lack of political commitment, distance to river, and elevation were also mentioned. Additionally, most the land-use scenarios identified by stakeholders would intensify land degradation and reduce ecosystem services in the area. By considering all of these potential LULC changes, decision-makers need to develop and implement appropriate solutions (e.g., land use planning strategies, reforestation campaigns, forest protection measures) in order to limit the negative effects of future LULC changes.

TI  - Predictors for the Recurrence of Clinically Uterine-Confined Endometrial Cancer and the Role of Cytokeratin Immunohistochemistry Stain in the Era of Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in women with endometrial cancer is gradually gaining popularity worldwide. The objectives of this retrospective study were to elucidate the predictors for cancer recurrence in the era of SLN mapping, and to compare the clinical outcomes between SLN mapping and traditional lymphadenectomy, as well as to investigate the role of cytokeratin immunohistochemistry stain in detecting lymph node metastases. Para-aortic lymph node metastasis was found to be the sole predictor for cancer recurrence. Cytokeratin immunohistochemistry stain detects more lymph node metastases. In addition, both SLN mapping and traditional lymphadenectomy have similar probabilities of cancer recurrence. Background: The primary objective of this study was to elucidate the predictors for cancer recurrence in women with clinically uterine-confined endometrial cancer in the era of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. Methods: All consecutive women with clinically determined uterine-confined endometrial cancer who had lymph node assessment by either SLN mapping or traditional pelvic lymphadenectomy were reviewed. Results: Women in the SLN mapping group had lower total dissected pelvic nodes, lower incidence of para-aortic lymph node dissection, less intraoperative blood loss and lower complication rates, but a longer operation time compared to the traditional lymphadenectomy group. Para-aortic lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio = 7.60, p = 0.03) was the sole independent predictor for recurrence-free survival. In addition, the utilization of cytokeratin immunohistochemistry stain detected more lymph node metastases (adjusted odds ratio = 3.04, p = 0.03). Recurrence-free survival did not differ between SLN mapping and traditional lymphadenectomy groups (p = 0.24). Conclusions: Para-aortic lymph node metastasis is an important predictor of cancer recurrence. Women with negative hematoxylin and eosin stain should undergo cytokeratin immunohistochemistry stain to increase the detection rate of positive lymph node metastasis. Besides, the probabilities of recurrence seem to be similar between SLN mapping and traditional lymphadenectomy groups in women with clinically uterine-confined endometrial cancer.

TI  - Role of draining lymph nodes in the era of cancer immunotherapy
T2  - BULLETIN DE L ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MEDECINE
M3  - Review
AB  - With the advent of immunotherapy as standard treatment in medical oncology in the metastatic setting, and more recently in the early phase for several types of cancer, the question of the role of the tumor draining lymph nodes and the consequences of their systematic surgical resection on the efficacy of the various immunotherapies becomes relevant. From an immunological point of view, tumor draining lymph nodes are a privileged site of initiation of T cell activation and of the anti-tumor immune response. Tumor draining lymph nodes are enriched in tumor-specific immune cells which represent ideal targets that can be therapeutically activated by immunotherapy treatments such as vaccines or modulated by antibodies blocking the immune checkpoints, but also a valuable source of cells for adoptive cell therapy. The degree of invasion and remodeling of the immune response in the lymph nodes by the presence of tumor cells will eventually more or less deregulate the immune response by creating an immunosuppressive environment, and thus conditioning the sensitivity to immunotherapies. It is important to consider, for each particular situation, what would be the optimal medical, surgical and immunological strategy to restore lymph node function and facilitate the response to therapies that promote the reactivation of the anti-tumor immune response.

TI  - Performance and the Optimal Integration of Sentinel-1/2 Time-Series Features for Crop Classification in Northern Mongolia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and early crop-type maps are essential for agricultural policy development and food production assessment at regional and national levels. This study aims to produce a crop-type map with acceptable accuracy and spatial resolution in northern Mongolia by optimizing the combination of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) images with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. A total of three satellite data combination scenarios are set, including S1 alone, S2 alone, and the combination of S1 and S2. In order to avoid the impact of data gaps caused by clouds on crop classification, this study reconstructed the time series of S1 and S2 with a 10-day interval using the median composite method, linear moving interpolation, and Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter. Our results indicated that crop-type classification accuracy increased with the increase in data length to all three data combination scenarios. S2 alone has higher accuracy than S1 alone and the combination of S1 and S2. The crop-type map with the highest accuracy was generated using S2 data from 150 days of the year (DOY) (11 May) to 260 DOY (18 September). The OA and kappa were 0.93 and 0.78, respectively, and the F1-score for spring wheat and rapeseed were 0.96 and 0.80, respectively. The classification accuracy of the crop increased rapidly from 210 DOY (end of July) to 260 DOY (August to mid-September), and then it remained stable after 260 DOY. Based on our analysis, we filled the gap of the crop-type map with 10 m spatial resolution in northern Mongolia, revealing the best satellite combination and the best period for crop-type classification, which can benefit the achievement of sustainable development goals 2 (SDGs2).

TI  - The Application of Satellite Image Analysis in Oil Spill Detection
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, there has been an increasing use of satellite sensors to detect and track oil spills. The satellite bands, namely visible, short, medium infrared, and microwave radar bands, are used for this purpose. The use of satellite images is extremely valuable for oil spill analysis. With satellite images, we can identify the source of leakage and assess the extent of potential damage. However, it is not yet clear how to approach a specific leakage case methodologically. The aim of this study is the remote sensing analysis of environmental changes with the development of oil spill detection processing methods. Innovative elements of the work, in addition to methodological proposals, include the long-term analysis of surface water changes. This is very important because oil is very likely to enter the soil when water levels change. The classification result was satisfactory and accurate by 85%. The study was carried out using images from Landsat 5, Landsat 7, Landsat 8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 satellites. The results of the classification of the oil stains in active and passive technologies differ. This difference affects the methodology for selecting processing methods in similar fields. In the case of this article, the oil spill that occurred on 29 May 2020 in Norilsk was investigated and compared with data from other years to determine the extent of biodegradation. Due to the tank failure that occurred at the Nornickel power plant on that day, a large amount of crude oil leaked into the environment, contaminating the waters and soil of local areas. Research shows that oil spills may be caused by human error or may be the effect of climate change, particularly global warming.

TI  - Temporal Variations of NDVI and LAI and Interactions With Hydroclimatic Variables in a Large and Agro-Ecologically Diverse Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite based vegetation indices are increasingly used to characterize vegetation's response to climate variability and change over large spatial extents. The use of a given index assumes that the index adequately describes the vegetation's response to hydroclimatic forcing. The objective of this study is to compare the temporal behaviors of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and leaf area index (LAI) and their associations with hydroclimatic variables. Observations of monthly precipitation, streamflow, temperature, vapor pressure deficit, evapotranspiration, and total water storage anomalies (TWSA) are processed for the combined Sacramento River and San Joaquin River basins in California for 13 water years (October 2002 to September 2015). Estimates of NDVI and LAI are obtained for the same period from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The seasonal cycle of NDVI peaks 2-3 months earlier than LAI. The seasonal variation in NDVI follows the seasonality of TWSA (i.e., water availability) whereas the seasonal cycle of LAI follows the seasonality in mean temperature and vapor pressure deficit (i.e., atmospheric water demand). Cross-correlation analyses of NDVI and LAI with the hydroclimatic variables show that LAI is more strongly correlated with most of the hydroclimatic variables considered.

TI  - Trends of Rainfall Variability and Drought Monitoring Using Standardized Precipitation Index in a Scarcely Gauged Basin of Northern Pakistan
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused on the trends of rainfall variability and drought monitoring in the northern region of Pakistan (Gilgit-Baltistan). Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) model data were used for the period of 1981 to 2020. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was applied to assess the dry and wet conditions during the study period. The Mann-Kendall (MK) and Spearman's rho (SR) trend tests were applied to calculate the trend of drought. A coupled model intercomparison project-global circulation model (CMIP5-GCMs) was used to project the future precipitation in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) for the 21st century using a multimodel ensemble (MME) technique for representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5. From the results, the extreme drought situations were observed in the 12-month SPI series in 1982 in the Diamir, Ghizer, and Gilgit districts, while severe drought in 1982-1983 was observed in Astore, Ghizer, Gilgit, Hunza-Nagar, and Skardu. Similarly, in 2000-2001 severe drought prevailed in Diamir, Ghanche, and Skardu. The results of MK and SR indicate a significant increasing trend of rainfall in the study area, which is showing the conversion of snowfall to rainfall due to climate warming. The future precipitation projections depicted an increase of 4% for the 21st century as compared with the baseline period in the GB region. The results of the midcentury projections depicted an increase in precipitation of about 13%, while future projections for the latter half of the century recorded a decrease in precipitation (about 9%) for both RCPs, which can cause flooding in midcentury and drought in the latter half of the century. The study area is the host of the major glaciers in Pakistan from where the Indus River receives its major tributaries. The area and volume of these glaciers are decreasing due to warming impacts of climate change. Therefore, this study is useful for proper water resource management to cope up with water scarcity in the future.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Impact of Urbanization on Urban Heat Island and Urban Thermal Field Variance Index of Tianjin City, China
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid infrastructure development in densely populated areas has had several negative impacts. Increases in urbanization have led to increased LST, and urban ecological systems have been negatively affected. Urban heat islands (UHIs) can be mitigated by understanding how current and future LST phenomena are linked to changes in landscape composition and land use cover (LUC). This study investigated the multi-scale spatial analysis of LUC and LST in Tianjin using remote sensing and GIS data. We used Landsat data from 2005 to 2020 to examine the effects of LUC on LST in urban agglomeration. According to the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI), the city's ecological evaluation was carried out. Results show that changes in LUC and other anthropogenic activities affect the spatial distribution of LST. For the study years (2004-2009), the estimated mean LST in Tianjin was 25.32 degrees C, 26.73 degrees C, 27.62 degrees C, and 27.93 degrees C. Between LST and urban areas with other infrastructures, and NDBI, significant positive correlation values were found about 0.53, 0.48, and 0.76 (p < 0.05), respectively. Temperatures would almost certainly increase by 3.87 degrees C to 7.26 degrees C as a result of decreased plant cover and increased settlements. These findings strongly imply a correlation between LST and the vegetation index. Between 2005 and 2020, the anticipated increase in LST of 3.39 degrees C is expected to harm urban environmental health. This study demonstrates how Tianjin and other cities can achieve ecological sustainability.

TI  - Learnings from COVID-19 Forced Lockdown on Regional Air Quality and Mitigation Potential for South Asia
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - South Asia is a hotspot of air pollution with limited resilience and hence, understanding the mitigation potential of different sources is critically important. In this context the country lockdown initiated to combat the COVID-19 pandemic (during March and April 2020 that is the pre-monsoon season) provides an unique opportunity for studying the relative impacts of different emission sources in the region. Here, we analyze changes in levels of air quality species across the region during selected lockdown periods using satellite and in-situ datasets. This analysis compares air quality levels during the lockdown against pre-lockdown conditions as well as against regional long-term mean. Satellite derived AOD, NO2, and CO data indicates an increase of 9.5%, 2%, and 2.6%, respectively, during the 2020 lockdown period compared to pre-lockdown over the South Asia domain. However, individual country statistics, urban site data, and industrial grid analysis within the region indicate a more varied picture. Cities with high traffic loads reported a reduction of 12-39% in columnar NO 2 during lockdown, in-situ PM2.5 measurements indicate a 23-56% percent reduction over the country capitals and columnar SO2 has an approximate reduction of 50% over industrial areas. In contrast, pollutant emissions from natural sources e.g., from biomass burning were observed to be adversely affecting the air quality in this period potentially masking expected lockdown related air quality improvements. This study demonstrates the need for a more nuanced and situation specific understanding of sources of air pollutants (anthropogenic and natural) and for these sources to be better understood from the local to the regional scale. Without this deeper understanding, mitigation strategies cannot be effectively targeted, wasting limited resources as well as risking unintended consequences both for the atmosphere and how mitigation action is perceived by the wider public.

TI  - Determination of impervious area of Saroor Nagar Watershed of Telangana using spectral indices, MLC, and machine learning (SVM) techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization affects the local wind and water cycle by changing the natural surface and atmospheric conditions, which further changes the local climate and climate system. Assessment of built-up-area changes in a rapidly growing urban area within a short time is a prime factor for administrators for better environmental assessment and sustainable development of urban areas. Traditional survey approaches, on the other hand, are unable to meet the demand for rapid urban land management development, and there is a pressing need to develop new methods to address the limitations of existing ones. This study compares various urban spectral indices to other existing approaches in order to determine which index provides a better representation of the impervious area in the urban watershed. Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) satellite images acquired on 15 March 2014 and 31 March 2020 are used in the present study. Indices, namely Modified Built-up Index (MBUI), SwiRed Index (SwiRed), and Enhanced Built-up and Bareness Index (EBBI), were utilized to extract impervious areas. Thresholding of indices is done by comparing them with 1000 reference points taken from Google Earth imagery of the respective years. The accuracy of the urban indices is assessed by comparing the results with high-resolution Google Earth Satellite Images. The impervious area is extracted from spectral indices and other remote sensing techniques such as maximum likelihood classification and support vector machine classification techniques. The overall accuracy of SVM, MLC, MBUI, EBBI, and SwiRed for the 2014 dataset was found to be 95.1%, 90.8%, 83.9%, 78.9%, and 87.3%, respectively, and the overall accuracy of SVM, MLC, MBUI, EBBI, and SwiRed was found to be 96%, 89.2%, 89.1%, 85.5%, and 92.6%, respectively. Impervious areas in the heterogeneous urban environment can be monitored in a better way and within lesser time by using spectral indices generated using Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) satellite data.

TI  - A Review of Nuclear Medicine Approaches in the Diagnosis and the Treatment of Gynecological Malignancies
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary In this literature review, we will provide a short overview of the role of nuclear medicine in the diagnosis of obstetric and gynecological cancers. Nuclear medicine is defined as the diagnosis and the treatment of disease using radiolabeled compounds known as radiopharmaceuticals. Single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and positron emission tomography/computer tomography (PET/CT) based radiopharmaceuticals have proven reliable in diagnostic imaging in nuclear medicine and cancer treatment. One of the most critical cancers that also relies on an early diagnosis is gynecological cancer. Given that approximately 25% of all cancers in developing countries are a subset of gynecological cancer, investigating this cancer subtype is of significant clinical worth, particularly in light of its high rate of mortality. With accurate identification of high grade distant abdominal endometrial cancer as well as extra abdominal metastases, 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ([F-18]FDG) PET/CT imaging is considered a valuable step forward in the investigation of gynecological cancer. Considering these factors, [F-18]FDG PET/CT imaging can assist in making management of patient therapy more feasible. In this literature review, we will provide a short overview of the role of nuclear medicine in the diagnosis of obstetric and gynecological cancers.

TI  - Indigenous Ontology in Zo Oral Narratives: A Study of the Zo Indigenous Cosmovision
T2  - RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is an exploration of Indigenous ontologies and ways of thinking and worldview that deviates from the Eurocentric critical frameworks that often insufficiently portray or interpret the nature of specific indigenous cultures and native epistemology. The focal point of this study is to explore the indigenous ontology and knowledge found in the folktales and oral narratives of the Zo tribes of Southern Manipur. The Zo's geo-political state of existence has been in a muddle since colonial times. The territorial demarcation that was done for administrative purposes had caused permanent displacement and obscurity of the Zo Indigenous identity. Colonial ethnographical records that have been perceived as infallible evidences, fall short of impartial facts and accounts. The series of under and misrepresentation of their socio-cultural and political history has narrowed the general interest and scope for the discursive study of Zo indigeneity, whose relevance to the modern world is only confined to their conflict-ridden state of political affairs. Therefore, this study will be carried out in the hope of decolonising and re-aligning the `Zoness' through the exploration of the lesser-known indigenous ways of knowledge, philosophies, and worldview found in the reservoir of their oral literature. Zo orality is accentuated by certain indigenous concepts and philosophies that find expression in proverbs, aphorisms, allegorical tales, customary laws, rituals and the folksongs. The paper argues that these concepts are not adequately represented by ethnocentric appreciation, but are elements of indigeneity that deserve specialized set of conceptual introspections

TI  - The August 2019 Piton de la Fournaise (La Reunion Island) Eruption: Analysis of the Multi-Source Deformation Pattern Detected through Sentinel-1 DInSAR Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Piton de la Fournaise is one of the most active worldwide volcanoes, located on the southeastern part of La Reunion Island. In this work, we focus on the eruption that occurred on the southeastern flank of this volcano, inside the Enclos Fouque caldera, from 11 to 15 August 2019. This distal event was characterized by the opening of two eruptive fissures and accompanied by shallow volcano-tectonic earthquakes. We exploit the ground displacements using Sentinel-1 Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) measurements, which include the ground deformations generated during both the pre- and co-eruptive phases. To investigate the sources responsible for the detected ground displacements, we perform an analytical modeling of the retrieved DInSAR measurements. Our results reveal the presence of five volcanic sources (i.e., one sill-like source and four dikes), whose concomitant action during the pre- and co-eruptive phases generated the complex detected deformation pattern. The retrieved volcanic sources correlate well with the location of the opened fissures, the spatial distribution and the temporal evolution of the recorded seismicity, and other geophysical evidence already known in the literature.

TI  - Hegemonic masculinities in the 'Manosphere': A thematic analysis of beliefs about men and women on The Red Pill and Incel
T2  - ANALYSES OF SOCIAL ISSUES AND PUBLIC POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Websites, blogs, and message boards of the "manosphere" are dedicated to a worldview that celebrates hegemonic masculinity and decries feminism. In a reflexive thematic analysis of 227 posts (389,189 words) from two manosphere message boards (The Red Pill and Incel), we analyzed how posters viewed women and men. We found that beliefs about women and men formed an ideology comprised of (a) evolution-based views of gender essentialism, (b) an informal psychology of women's motivations, and (c) a typology of men. Women were seen as having three primary motives: to deceive and manipulate men, to promiscuously satisfy their own sexual needs, and to trade sex for power. Men were seen as falling into two (The Red Pill) or three (Incel) types: alpha men who are attractive, powerful, and sexually successful, beta men who give to women as their only route to sexual interactions, and incel (involuntarily celibate) men who are too unattractive to achieve sexual success. Posters acted on these beliefs either to improve themselves (The Red Pill) or give up on life and endorse suicide and/or violence (Incel). We discuss these beliefs and actions in relation to theories of sexual aggression, the psychology of radicalization, and the American Psychological Association's Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Boys and Men.

TI  - MINING FIRE HOTSPOTS OVER NUSA TENGGARA AND BALI ISLANDS
T2  - INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are still one of the most common problems in Indonesia. In fact, many of these forest fires origin from human activities, namely fires that are intentionally raised for a purpose such as widening the land to prepare for the planting season in the Nusa Tenggara Island. Forest fire events can be identified by observing hotspot data which are monitored through remote sensing satellites. Hotspot is an area that has a relatively higher surface temperature than the surrounding area based on certain temperature thresholds monitored by remote sensing satellites. The area is represented as a point that has certain coordinates. The actual fires can be monitored by observing the hotspot attribute, namely Confidence, Brightness Temperature and FRP (Fire Radiate Power). To find the similarities of the three mentioned attributes, the clustering process is carried out to make monitoring easier. The objective of this research is to cluster hotspots in the Nusa Tenggara and Bali Islands from year 2013 to 2018 using the K-Means Clustering Method with 28,519 hot spot data. This could be a benefit for the Ministry of Environment and Forestry in Indonesia to identify the priority level of the area to be monitored. By knowing this result, the ministry can use this data for patrol priority management. This research successfully clustered three types of hotspot classes based on the risk of fire with details as follow; High Risk Class contains 12,212 data with ranges of mean values of confidence in the range of 49.3-100%, brightness in the range of 305.1-421.3 degrees K and FRP in the range of 2.5-714.3; Medium Risk contains 12,250 data mean values of confidence with a range of 20.3-74.3%, brightness in the range of 301.06-341.86 degrees K and FRP in the range of 3.6-141.4; and Low Risk contains 4,057 data with a range of mean values of confidence in the range of 0-39.8%, brightness in the range of 300-365.86o K and FRP in the range of 3.5-275.6. All of the clusters were obtained by the implementation of K-Means clustering over the hotspot data and its parameter as mentioned, respectively. The cluster performance showed the confidential value of 88.45% accuracy using 100 hotspot data from 2019.

TI  - Evaluation of Doses to Target volume and Organs at Risk by Conventional versus RTOG Contouring Based 3D Conformal Plans in Breast Cancer: A Prospective Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In radiotherapy, conventional field borders have often little anatomical correlation with the draining lymphatics. So, with the availability of more conformal techniques and delineation guidelines, an evident need exists to optimise our treatment plans with more focus on planning and dosimetric aspects.Aim: To evaluate the differences in dosimetric parameters to the Organs at Risk and target volumes in patients treated with conventional plans vis-a-vis Radiation Therapy Oncology Group contour guided treatment plans.Materials and Methods: A prospective interventional study was conducted in which 30 patients of histopathologically proven Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) breast, with age range of 18 to 80 years were enrolled. Patients were treated with 50 Gray in 25 fractions of radiation with additional 10 Gray in 5 fractions boost in Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS) patients by conventional treatment plans. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) guidelines were used for breast/Chest Wall (CW), axillary nodes, Supraclavicular Fossa (SCF), and Internal Mammary Node (IMN) delineation. Organs At Risk (OARs) included heart, Ipsilateral WO lung, Contralateral (C/L) breast, oesophagus and spinal cord. Dose-Volume Histograms (DVHs) for these contours were generated from conventional treatment plans. Further, new treatment plans were generated to cover >90% of Planning Target Volume (PTV) by 90% isodose line. DVH parameters of these two plans were compared using paired t-test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: Of the total 30 cases, the mean volume of breast/CW PTV covered by 90% isodose line (V90) was better in RTOG plan as compared to Conventional plan (93.39 vs 90.39, p-value=0.001). Similarly, mean V90 for total axilla (97.44 vs 90.39, p-value=0.0001) and combined PTV (92.60 vs 88.81, p-value=0.0001) was better with RTOG plan. For OARs, conventional vs RTOG plans; Dmean for heart was 2.56 vs 2.60Gy, p-value=0.63), I/L lung V20Gy was 28.77 vs 28.94%, p-value=0.71) and V5Gy for C/L breast was 0.48 vs 0.54%, p-value=0.47), respectively. In cases where IMN was irradiated, mean doses to the heart, I/L lung V20Gy, and contralateral breast V5Gy increased significantly.Conclusion: The present study showed that RTOG target volumes had inadequate coverage in conventional plans. On the contrary, plans directed at RTOG contours provided statistically better coverage for target volumes without increase in the doses to the OARs. In patients with IMN irradiation, the doses to some OARs were increased in RTOG as compared to conventional plans.

TI  - An enhanced retrieval of the wet tropospheric correction for Sentinel-3 using dynamic inputs from ERA5
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-3 (S3) satellites are equipped with microwave radiometers that perform brightness temperature (TB) measurements at 23.8 and 36.5 GHz to determine the wet tropospheric correction (WTC). The analysis of the two MWR-derived WTC present in S3 products, retrieved from three- and five-input neural network (NN) algorithms, suggest the need for their improvement. Focusing on the inputs and physical component, this paper aims at improving the WTC retrieval for open ocean, considering a suitable learning for S3 and a better accounting for the surface contribution to the WTC retrieval. Adopting a purely empirical approach, the learning database has been built using 1 year (2017) of valid S3A measurements, ERA5-derived WTC, and dynamic sea surface temperature (SST) from ERA5. The proposed approach is a similar NN with four inputs: TB at 23.8 and 36.5 GHz, altimeter backscattering coefficient and SST. Results show that the use of a dynamic SST, instead of static tables as currently adopted in S3, makes the fifth input (vertical temperature decrease) redundant. Comparisons with reference and independent WTC sources show that the WTC derived from this algorithm, when compared with those available in the S3 products, leads to a decrease in the RMS values of WTC differences, with respect to these independent WTC, by about 1 mm globally, that locally can reach almost 1 cm. This study proposes a new approach for the WTC of Sentinel-3 by considering a suitable set of dynamic inputs that better characterize the atmosphere, which is a significant enhancement over the current algorithms.

TI  - Innovations in social service (education) in state-church relations in the conditions of digitalization of society and pandemic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study was to identify innovative approaches to activities in the system of state-church relations in social service (education) within the framework of interaction between an Orthodox Monastery and the Russian State Social University. The interaction between St. Nicholas Chernoostrovsky Convent and Russian State Social University (RSCU) has developed from conceptual foundations to the formation of a training system for Orthodox media. This article is the first to identify innovations: implementation of a modular, continuous model for the development of orphans in modern society, combining the efforts of secular and spiritual education; unification of philosophy and worldview, both religious and cultural, in the context of the digitalization of society and pandemic restrictions; formation of a multi-vector model of education with simultaneous development in several professional (church) directions and (or) an increase in social significance; use of hybrid forms of preparation and conduct of classes in a secular and church educational environment. The strong point of the article is a systematic approach to the study of the problem and the identified innovations, which make it possible to improve social service in the context of the digitalization of society and the COVID 19 pandemic. The use of the results obtained by other researchers can serve to develop the system of state-church relations in social service (education) of different faiths. (c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Seasonal Features of the Spatial Distribution of Atmospheric Gravity Waves in the Earth's Polar Thermosphere
T2  - KINEMATICS AND PHYSICS OF CELESTIAL BODIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The features of the spatial distribution of atmospheric gravity waves (AGW) in the polar thermosphere of the Earth are investigated. The research is based on data from direct satellite measurements of the parameters of the neutral atmosphere. According to satellite data, the amplitudes of AGWs that are systematically observed in the polar regions of both hemispheres are usually several times higher than the amplitudes of these waves in the middle and low latitudes. At the same time, the polar AGWs of large amplitudes are recorded against the background of high-speed spatially inhomogeneous wind flows, which indicates their possible amplification caused by interaction with the wind. Based on the analysis of measurement data on the Dynamics Explorer 2 satellite, the relationship between the spatial distribution of the atmospheric gravitational waves and the auroral oval has been revealed. On a large volume of experimental data, seasonal patterns of the distribution of the wave field over the Antarctic and the Arctic have been established. A comparative analysis of the features of the AGWs in the polar thermosphere of both hemispheres for the conditions of the polar day and polar night has been carried out. Some differences in the distribution of the AGWs were noted depending on the Kp-index. It has been suggested that the observed seasonal features of the AGW distribution and its dependence on the level of geomagnetic activity are associated with the restructuring of the polar wind circulation when the conditions of solar illumination and geomagnetic conditions change.

M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Surgical management of vulvar cancer is associated with high morbidity rates. The main aim of the GROINSS-V studies is reducing treatment-related morbidity by finding safe alternative treatment options in patients with early-stage vulvar cancer. This article reviews the history, results, and updates of the GROINSS-V studies. Surgical management of vulvar cancer is associated with high morbidity rates. The main aim of the GROINSS-V studies is reducing treatment-related morbidity by finding safe alternative treatment options in early-stage vulvar cancer patients. This article reviews the history, results, and updates of the GROINSS-V studies. The first GROINSS-V study was a multicenter observational study (from 2000 to 2006), which investigated the safety and clinical applicability of the sentinel lymph node procedure in patients with early-stage vulvar cancer. GROINSS-V-I showed that omitting inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy was safe in early-stage vulvar cancer patients with a negative sentinel lymph node, with an impressive reduction in treatment-related morbidity. GROINSS-V-II, a prospective multicenter phase II single-arm treatment trial (from 2005 to 2016) investigated whether radiotherapy could be a safe alternative for inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy in patients with a metastatic sentinel lymph node. This study showed that radiotherapy in patients with sentinel lymph node micrometastases (<= 2 mm) was safe in terms of groin recurrence rate and with less treatment-related morbidity. These results, published in August 2021, should be implemented in (inter)national treatment guidelines for vulvar cancer. GROINSS-V-III recently started including patients. This study investigates the effectiveness and safety of chemoradiation in patients with a macrometastasis (>2 mm) in the sentinel lymph node.

TI  - Multiscale ship detection based on cascaded dense weighted networks in synthetic aperture radar images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sizes of ships vary by type in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and this multiscale problem degrades the accuracy of ship detection. We present a multiscale ship detection method based on cascaded dense weighted networks in SAR images. Dense weighted fusion is performed in the feature extraction module and feature fusion module by cascading, i.e., feature weighting is achieved by embedding a convolutional block attention module after feature layers at different scales, followed by dense connection to fuse features at different scales. This makes it possible to refine the cascaded feature mapping, enhance the information transfer of shallow and deep features, and build a multiscale feature representation model. Experiments on the extended high-resolution SAR images dataset show that the accuracy of this method is 74.87% in inshore scenes, and 97.39% in offshore scenes, which exceeds that of other ship detection methods. In addition, in two SAR images from TerraSAR-X, the detection accuracy of multiscale ships reaches 86.63%, which indicates the method's better robustness.

TI  - Estimation of Daily and Instantaneous Near-Surface Air Temperature from MODIS Data Using Machine Learning Methods in the Jingjinji Area of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorologically observed air temperature (T-a) is limited due to low density and uneven distribution that leads to uncertain accuracy. Therefore, remote sensing data have been widely used to estimate near-surface T-a on various temporal scales due to their spatially continuous characteristics. However, few studies have focused on instantaneous T-a when satellites overpass. This study aims to produce both daily and instantaneous T-a datasets at 1 km resolution for the Jingjinji area, China during 2018-2019, using machine learning methods based on remote sensing data, dense meteorological observation station data, and auxiliary data (such as elevation and normalized difference vegetation index). Newly released Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 surface Downward Shortwave Radiation (DSR) was introduced to improve the accuracy of T-a estimation. Five machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared so that the optimal one could be selected. The random forest (RF) algorithm outperformed the others (such as decision tree, feedforward neural network, generalized linear model) and RF obtained the highest accuracy in model validation with a daily root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.29 degrees C, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.94 degrees C, daytime instantaneous RMSE of 1.88 degrees C, MAE of 1.35 degrees C, nighttime instantaneous RMSE of 2.47 degrees C, and MAE of 1.83 degrees C. The corresponding R-2 was 0.99 for daily average, 0.98 for daytime instantaneous, and 0.95 for nighttime instantaneous. Analysis showed that land surface temperature (LST) was the most important factor contributing to model accuracy, followed by solar declination and DSR, which implied that DSR should be prioritized when estimating T-a. Particularly, these results outperformed most models presented in previous studies. These findings suggested that RF could be used to estimate daily instantaneous T-a at unprecedented accuracy and temporal scale with proper training and very dense station data. The estimated dataset could be very useful for local climate and ecology studies, as well as for nature resources exploration.

TI  - Leveraging Google Earth Engine and Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Networks to Assess Initial Burn Severity in Forest
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring initial burn severity is a critical aspect of forest management and landscape restoration. Recently, supervised learning has achieved great success in evaluating the post-fire forest condition, but plenty of labeled samples are needed to carry out training for supervised learning. However, due to the limitation of accessible labeled data, it is often arduous to put supervised learning into practice in the remote sensing field. In this paper, a novel semi-unsupervised image classification framework by using generative adversarial networks under the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform is proposed to undertake the burn severity assessment with limited samples. The generative model can produce additional adversarial samples that look like the real samples; therefore, the discriminative model gains better classification capabilities in burn severity assessment with the extra training data provided by the generator. The detailed evaluation and comparative experiments are done in the context of post-fire assessment on eleven forest fires in northern California in the United States. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the two other most well-known methods.

TI  - Experimental Study on Ultrasonic-Assisted End Milling Forces in 2195 Aluminum-Lithium Alloy
T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve high-quality machining of the 2195 aluminum-lithium alloy, this paper presents an experimental study on the effect of milling processing parameters on milling forces and surface topography, during which conventional milling and longitudinal-torsional ultrasonic vibration milling of the 2195 Al-Li alloy were performed. The characterization of the tool tip trajectory illustrates some of the advantages of ultrasonic machining, which include variable depth of cut and tool chip pulling. The differences in milling forces between conventional milling and longitudinal-torsional ultrasonic vibration machining were compared using orthogonal tests, and the effect of ultrasonic vibration on milling forces was investigated in detail. The maximum reduction of milling force Fy in the feed direction under the influence of torsional vibration is 62% and 54% for larger feed per tooth and cutting depth, respectively. The high-frequency impact generated by the longitudinal vibration not only reduces the chip accumulation on the surface, but also smooths out the tool-tooth scratches and creates a regular surface profile. In addition, the characteristics of the milling force signals of the two machining methods were analyzed, and the analysis of the spectrum of the collected milling forces revealed that the ultrasonic vibration caused the high-frequency components of the milling forces Fy and Fz. The orthogonal result analysis and single-factor result analysis verified the superiority of ultrasonic machining, provided parameter selection for subsequent aluminum-lithium alloy machining, and bridged the gap of longitudinal torsional ultrasonic vibration machining of 2195 aluminum-lithium alloy in the study of milling force.

TI  - Application of Domestic High-Resolution Satellite Data in Remote Sensing Geological Survey of the Metallogenic Belt in Zhejiang Province
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A metallogenic belt is a metallogenic geological unit with rich mineral resources and potential. The study of metallogenic belts can provide a basis for mineral monitoring and deployment. Research of the metallogenic belt in Zhejiang Province is too deficient. This paper uses the domestic high-resolution satellite data from 2018 to 2021 to carry out the application of remote sensing in a comprehensive geological survey on different metallogenic belts in Zhejiang Province. The survey results show that the area of each metallogenic belt is decreasing year by year, which shows that under the regulation of the natural resources department, the unqualified mining activities in key control areas such as nature reserves, ecological red lines, and the Yangtze River economic belt are timely stopped and forcibly closed, so that the mining development order gradually tends to be good. The restoration and control points show a trend of less in the south and more in the north, mainly distributed in the economically developed areas of the northern, central, and eastern plains of Zhejiang Province. According to the statistics of the degree of mine environment restoration and treatment (treatment percentage), the Taishun-Zhoushan metallogenic belt is the highest, and treatment percentage from 2018 to 2021 is 83.01%, 80.07%, 76.91%, and 73.78%, respectively. For four consecutive years, the number of restoration and treatment projects has been increasing, and the restoration and treatment area has increased significantly. The countermeasures and suggestions for mine environmental restoration in the metallogenic belt have been put forward. In the mining area, if the geological environment is good, the rainfall is sufficient, and so on, then natural re greening can be considered. According to the brief evaluation criteria, a total of 2983 mines can be restored naturally, including 311 in the Si'an-Changxing metallogenic belt, 325 in the Lin'an-Huzhou metallogenic belt, 387 in the Kaihua-Hangzhou metallogenic Belt, 598 in the Quzhou-Shaoxing metallogenic belt, 765 in the Longquan-Shangyu metallogenic belt, and 597 in the Taishun-Zhoushan metallogenic belt. A total of 1911 mines were involved within 1 km of the "three zones and two lines". There are 50 places in the Si'an-Changxing metallogenic belt, 151 in the Lin'an-Huzhou metallogenic belt, 236 in the Kaihua-Hangzhou metallogenic belt, 326 in the Quzhou-Shaoxing metallogenic belt, 513 in the Longquan-Shangyu metallogenic belt, and 635 in the Taishun-Zhoushan metallogenic belt. The survey results and suggestions can provide scientific basis and important reference for the local mining administration department to carry out the restoration of the mine ecological environment in metallogenic belts, and they are of great significance to promote the wide and in-depth application and technological progress of remote sensing technology.

AB  - Radargrammetry is a useful approach to generate Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and an alternative to InSAR techniques that are subject to temporal or atmospheric decorrelation. Stereo image matching in radargrammetry refers to the process of determining homologous points in two images. The performance of image matching influences the final quality of DSM used for spatial-temporal analysis of landscapes and terrain. In SAR image matching, local matching methods are commonly used but usually produce sparse and inaccurate homologous points adding ambiguity to final products; global or semi-global matching methods are seldom applied even though more accurate and dense homologous points can be yielded. To fill this gap, we propose a hierarchical semi-global matching (SGM) pipeline to reconstruct DSMs in forested and mountainous regions using stereo TerraSAR-X images. In addition, three penalty functions were implemented in the pipeline and evaluated for effectiveness. To make accuracy and efficiency comparisons between our SGM dense matching method and the local matching method, the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) local matching method was also applied to generate DSMs using the same test data. The accuracy of radargrammetric DSMs was validated against an airborne photogrammetric reference DSM and compared with the accuracy of NASA's 30 m SRTM DEM. The results show the SGM pipeline produces DSMs with height accuracy and computing efficiency that exceeds the SRTM DEM and NCC-derived DSMs. The penalty function adopting the Canny edge detector yields a higher vertical precision than the other two evaluated penalty functions. SGM is a powerful and efficient tool to produce high-quality DSMs using stereo Spaceborne SAR images.

TI  - Surveys of <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> (Diptera: Drosophilidae) and Its Host Fruits and Associated Parasitoids in Northeastern China
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Drosophila suzukii has become a globally invasive pest of thin-skinned berries and stone fruits such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, and cherries. D. suzukii has caused severe economic losses to the fruit industries in more than 30 countries and has been listed as an important quarantine pest in many countries around the world. To better understand the ecology of this invasive pest for its effective management, it is essential to investigate the occurrence of D. suzukii and its wild host fruits and natural enemies in its native range. Here, we report the occurrence of D. suzukii and its wild host fruits and associated parasitoids in Liaoning, Northeast China for the first time. Four species of wild berries from non-crop habitats were found infested by D. suzukii, and two species of parasitoids (Leptopilina japonica and Asobara japonica) were discovered. Over the survey period from June to October, D. suzukii adult populations increased and peaked in August, and then declined until it was no longer detectable in October. Spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), is a worldwide quarantine pest that is currently undergoing a rapid range expansion in the Americas, Europe, and parts of Africa. It feeds and breeds on soft-skinned fruits such as raspberries, blueberries, and cherries, and can cause significant economic losses to fruit production. This study investigated the occurrence of D. suzukii and its wild host fruits and parasitoids in Liaoning, Northeast China for the first time. Sentinel traps were used to monitor D. suzukii adults, and suspected fruits were collected weekly in four different locations (Wafangdian, Faku, Fengcheng, and Shenyang). The results showed that D. suzukii were distributed in the sweet soft-skinned fruit-production areas of Liaoning, and raspberry was the most infested fruit. During the field survey, four species of wild berries from non-crop habitats were found infested by D. suzukii, and two species of parasitoids (Leptopilina japonica and Asobara japonica) were collected. D. suzukii adult-population dynamics throughout the survey period (June to October) were similar in different survey locations; adult fly populations increased and peaked in August, and then declined until the fly was no longer detectable in October.

TI  - A Population Spatialization Model at the Building Scale Using Random Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Population spatialization reveals the distribution and quantity of the population in geographic space with gridded population maps. Fine-scale population spatialization is essential for urbanization and disaster prevention. Previous approaches have used remotely sensed imagery to disaggregate census data, but this approach has limitations. For example, large-scale population censuses cannot be conducted in underdeveloped countries or regions, and remote sensing data lack semantic information indicating the different human activities occurring in a precise geographic location. Geospatial big data and machine learning provide new fine-scale population distribution mapping methods. In this paper, 30 features are extracted using easily accessible multisource geographic data. Then, a building-scale population estimation model is trained by a random forest (RF) regression algorithm. The results show that 91% of the buildings in Lin'an District have absolute error values of less than six compared with the actual population data. In a comparison with a multiple linear (ML) regression model, the mean absolute errors of the RF and ML models are 2.52 and 3.21, respectively, the root mean squared errors are 8.2 and 9.8, and the R-2 values are 0.44 and 0.18. The RF model performs better at building-scale population estimation using easily accessible multisource geographic data. Future work will improve the model accuracy in densely populated areas.

TI  - Agroecological Efficiency Evaluation Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data in a Typical County of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating agricultural ecology can help us to understand regional environmental status and contribute to the sustainable development of agricultural ecosystems. Furthermore, the results of eco-environmental assessment can provide data support for policy-making and agricultural production. The application of multi-source remote-sensing technology has the advantages of being fast, accurate and wide ranging. It can reveal the status of regional ecological environments, and is of great significance to monitoring their quality. In this paper, an agroecological efficiency evaluation model was constructed by combining remote sensing data and ecological index (EI). Multi-source remote-sensing data were used to obtain the evaluation index. Indicators collected from satellites, such as biological richness, vegetation cover, water network density, land stress, and pollution load, were used to quantitatively evaluate the agroecological efficiency of Rangtang County in the Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that the EI of Rangtang County increased from 61.77 to 65.10 during 2000-2020, which means that the eco-environmental quality of this area was good, and it has shown an obviously improving trend over the past 20 years. Rangtang County has converted more than 30 km(2) of grassland into woodland over the past 20 years. Climate change and human activities have had combined effects on the ecological environment of this area. The change in ecological environment quality is greatly affected by human disturbance. Policymakers should continue setting up nature reserves and should implement the policy of returning farmland to forests. Unreasonable grazing and rational allocation of land resources are still critical points of concern for future ecological environment construction. EI, combined with remote sensing and statistical data, is proven to be able to reasonably represent changes in ecological environment in Rangtang County, thus providing more possibilities for ecological evaluation on the Tibetan Plateau, and even the whole world.

TI  - GF-1 Image Fusion Based on Regression Kriging
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the problem that it is difficult for remote sensing data to achieve both high spatial and spectral resolution, a quadtree-based adaptive block area-to-point regression Kriging method (QAATPRK) is proposed to fuse the panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) data of GF-1. The proposed method is based on the area to point regression Kriging method, where the whole image is segmented into several independent fusion units and fused, splicing the results. For each individual fusion unit, spatial information of high-resolution PAN images were used for regression modeling and the residuals were treated by the regression Kriging method. The proposed method is compared with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method, wavelet transform method, Intensity-Hue-Saturation and Gram-Schmidt (IGS) method, and DenseNet. Root mean square error (RMSE), structure similarity (SSIM), universal image quality index (UIQI), relative global-dimensional synthesis error (ERGAS), and spectral angle mapper (SAM) demonstrate that the fusion image quality of the proposed method is the best and the spectral properties of the MS image are maintained.

TI  - Investigating Flood Impact on Crop Production under a Comprehensive and Spatially Explicit Risk Evaluation Framework
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the projected increased frequency of occurrence of extreme flood events, it is becoming increasingly important to pay attention to agricultural flood management. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB), as one of the most important agricultural areas in the world, frequently suffer from the ravages of long-duration extreme flood events. Comprehensive flood risk evaluation can provide important support for effective management strategies by focusing on the combination of flood hazard and the consequences of flooding in areas exposed to the inundation. Previous satellite-based flood disturbance detection methods intended for use in single-cropping agricultural systems cannot be applied to the MLYRB with multi-cropping practices and long-duration flood events. Additionally, comprehensive agricultural flood risk evaluations traditionally neglect the characteristics of the impact of flooding with strong spatial and temporal variability. Thus, in this research, an integrated disturbance index (IDI) was developed to detect the impact of flood disturbance on crop growth, aiming to acquire a map of crop damage condition for a multi-cropping agricultural system with long-duration flood events that is spatially explicit and has a sufficiently high spatial resolution. A coupled hydrological and 2D hydraulic model parallelized using the GPU approach was employed to simulate flood flows, aiming at deriving sufficient meaningful detail at the local scale in terms of flood inundation patterns and processes over the whole natural watershed. Additionally, a spatial map of the combined effects of flood hazard and the consequences of flooding was used to investigate the relationship between flood characteristics and associated loss extent with the random forest model. The comprehensive evaluation framework was applied for the 2010 flood event in the MLYRB. The evaluation results indicate that the detection results based on IDI are consistent with the governmental statistics, the most hard-hit areas in related reports, and the spatial characteristics of river floods. The coupled hydrological-hydraulic model offers a clear picture of the flood characteristics over the whole basin, while simultaneously ensuring a sufficiently high spatial resolution. Our findings show that flood duration is the most important predictor in predicting crop damage extent.

TI  - Long-term changes in habitat use of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in response to anthropogenic coastline shift in Lingding Bay of Pearl River Estuary, China.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Cetacean living coastal habitat often suffer from anthropogenic disturbance, which would change their original distribution and core habitat use. Pearl River Estuary-Moyang River Estuary (PRE-MRE) population is the largest known (putative) population of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin in the world. Lingding Bay is a critical habitat of PRE-MRE population, where human activities have become frequently in recent years and dolphin survival pressure is increasing. Analysis the response of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin to environment change and making corresponding conservation strategy are urgent. This research mainly discussed coastal waters loss process in the past 43 years from sea reclamation in the Lingding Bay using the multi-source Landsat imageries. To examine the change of distribution and core habitat of dolphins, a new kernel density estimation approach that accounted for physical barriers to movements was applied with sighting records from line-transect surveys during past 20 years. Our results showed that about 344.08 km2 waters became unavailable from 1986 to 2015; average proximity of sighting sites to artificial shoreline was farther than to natural shoreline and average proximity of sighting sites to artificial shoreline and natural shoreline decreased, which indicated that dolphin habitat use changed and dolphin had to adapt anthropogenic disturbance; habitat use of dolphin focused on eastern Lingding Bay waters and distribution range reached peak in 2005-2006, but fell sharply in 2015-2016; dolphin's core habitat approaching main channels and around undeveloped islands might be the only option result from resource depletion. The proportion of core habitat showed a decreasing trend in the Chinese White Dolphin National Nature Reserve of Guangdong Pearl River Estuary, which decreased from 79.9% to 49.4% in different period. We recommend that the government should adjust current protected range to fulfill the change pattern from habitat use.

TI  - A New Perspective on Four Decades of Changes in Arctic Sea Ice from Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic sea ice characteristics have been changing rapidly and significantly in the last few decades. Using a long-term time series of sea ice products from satellite observations-the extended AVHRR Polar Pathfinder (APP-x)-trends in sea ice concentration, ice extent, ice thickness, and ice volume in the Arctic from 1982 to 2020 are investigated. Results show that the Arctic has become less ice-covered in all seasons, especially in summer and autumn. Arctic sea ice thickness has been decreasing at a rate of -3.24 cm per year, resulting in an approximate 52% reduction in thickness from 2.35 m in 1982 to 1.13 m in 2020. Arctic sea ice volume has been decreasing at a rate of -467.7 km(3) per year, resulting in an approximate 63% reduction in volume, from 27,590.4 km(3) in 1982 to 10,305.5 km(3) in 2020. These trends are further examined from a new perspective, where the Arctic Ocean is classified into open water, perennial, and seasonal sea ice-covered areas based on sea ice persistence. The loss of the perennial sea ice-covered area is a major factor in the total sea ice loss in all seasons. If the current rates of sea ice changes in extent, concentration, and thickness continue, the Arctic is expected to have ice-free summers by the early 2060s.

TI  - AHSWFM: Automated and Hierarchical Surface Water Fraction Mapping for Small Water Bodies Using Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping surface water fractions is essential to understanding the distribution and area of small water bodies (SWBs), which are numerous and widespread. Traditional spectral unmixings based on the linear mixture model require high-quality prior endmember information, and are not appropriate in situations such as dealing with multiple scattering effects. To overcome difficulties with unknown mixing mechanisms and parameters, a novel automated and hierarchical surface water fraction mapping (AHSWFM) for mapping SWBs from Sentinel-2 images was proposed. AHSWFM is automated, requires no endmember prior knowledge and uses self-trained regression using scalable algorithms and random forest to construct relationships between the multispectral data and water fractions. AHSWFM uses a hierarchical structure that divides pixels into pure water, pure land and mixed water-land pixels, and predicts their water fractions separately to avoid overestimating water fractions for pure land pixels and underestimating water fractions for pure water pixels. Results show that using the hierarchical strategy can increase the accuracy in estimating SWB areas. AHSWFM predicted SWB areas with a root mean square error of approximately 0.045 ha in a region using more than 1200 SWB samples that were mostly smaller than 0.75 ha.

TI  - Refined InSAR tropospheric delay correction for wide-area landslide identification and monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR Interferometry (InSAR) proves to be effective for investigating landslides. However, its measurement accuracy is largely limited by the complex atmospheric delay distortion in alpine valley regions, resulting in poor performance of landslides detection and monitoring. Particularly, the spatial atmospheric heterogeneity over wide areas cannot be accurately reflected by conventional empirical phase-elevation models or external databased methods. In this study, we proposed a multi-temporal moving-window linear model (MMLM) to correct the tropospheric delay for wide-area landslides investigation. This is a linear regression model based on the elevation-phase relationship for modeling multi-temporal phases within a sliding local window. It mitigates the influence of local turbulent phase, local landslide deformation, and phase unwrapping error on parameter estimation, providing precise heterogeneous atmospheric corrections for wide-area InSAR landslide identification and monitoring. A simulation experiment was conducted to analyze the sensitivity of model parameters settings and evaluate the effectiveness of the MMLM model. Furthermore, we demonstrated the performance of the MMLM model through a comparison with the ERA5, GACOS, spatial-temporal filtering, and traditional linear model using descending and ascending Sentinel-1 data over the reservoir area of the Lianghekou hydropower station. Among the above-mentioned methods, the standard deviation of original unwrapped phases achieved the largest decrease of more than 35% and 50% after correction by the MMLM model for the descending and ascending Sentinel-1 tracks, respectively. In addition, the accurate deformation corrected by the MMLM model improved the landslides investigation, not only can help for delineating landslide boundaries in space but also retrieving movement evolution in time.

TI  - Mapping Crop Distribution Patterns and Changes in China from 2000 to 2015 by Fusing Remote-Sensing, Statistics, and Knowledge-Based Crop Phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maps of different kinds of crops offer information about both crop distribution and crop mix, which support analyses on food security, environmental change, and climate change. Despite the growing capability for mapping specific crops, the majority of studies have focused on a few dominant crops, whereas maps with a greater diversity of crops lack research. Combining cropping seasons derived from MODIS EVI data, regional crop calendar data, and agricultural statistical surveys, we developed an allocation model to map 14 major crops at a 1 km resolution across China for the years 2000, 2010, and 2015. The model was verified based on the fitness between the area of the three typical combinations of region, crop/crop group derived from remote sensing data, and statistical data. The R-2, indicating fitness, ranged from 0.51 to 0.75, with a higher value for the crops distributed in plain regions and a lower value in regions with topographically diverse landscapes. Within the same combination of region and crop/crop group, the larger harvest area a province has, the higher its fitness, suggesting an overall reliable result at the national level. A comparison of paddy rice between our results and the National Land Use/Cover Database of China showed a relatively high R-2 and slope of fitness (0.67 and 0.71, respectively). Compared with the commonly used average allocation model, and without lending cropping season information, the diversity index of the results from our model is about 30% higher, indicating crop maps with greater spatial details. According to the spatial distribution analysis of the four main crops, the grids showing decreased trends accounted for 74.92%, 57.32%, and 59.00% of the total changed grid for wheat, rice, and soybean crops, respectively, while accounting for only 37.71% for maize. The resulting data sets can be used to improve assessments for nutrient security and sustainability of cropping systems, as well as their resilience in a changing climate.

TI  - Interference image registration combined by enhanced scale-invariant feature transform characteristics and correlation coefficient
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To realize the digital elevation inversion of the interferometric imaging radar altimeter (InIRA), an interference complex images registration algorithm combining enhanced scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) characteristics with correlation coefficient is proposed. First, the locally tuned nonlinear method is used to enhance the image features. Then, SIFT algorithm is used to extract the matched feature points that are used as control points after screening. Based on these control points, the affine transformation is applied to calculate the coarse matching relation. Second, multiple control points are chosen uniformly. The local accurate offsets are determined by interpolating and calculating the maximum of correlation coefficients. The least-squares method is used to fit the difference between the two images. Third, the two images are matched by interpolating and resampling the one to be registered. Finally, the simulated InIRA sea surface images and the Sentinel-1A images of the Mount Hua area are employed to experiment. The results show that the proposed algorithm combines the advantages of SIFT algorithm and correlation coefficient algorithm. It is robust and its registration accuracy is better than the particle swarm optimization sample consensus algorithm, unsupervised deep-learning algorithm, SIFT algorithm, and correlation coefficient algorithm.

TI  - Characterising the Aboveground Carbon Content of Saltmarsh in Jervis Bay, NSW, Using ArborCam and PlanetScope
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems, including saltmarsh, provide important ecosystem services, including blue carbon storage, nutrient cycling, and coastal protection. The loss or degradation of saltmarsh ecosystems may undermine their capacity to provide these services and drive carbon emission increases. The accurate mapping and monitoring of the aboveground carbon content in these ecosystems supports protection and rehabilitation activities. Previous studies have used medium resolution satellites (e.g., Landsat and Sentinel-2) to characterise saltmarsh communities; however, these platforms are not well suited to the fine-scale patchiness of the saltmarsh ecosystems found in Australia. Here we explore the potential of a very high spatial resolution (0.15 m), seven-band multispectral ArborCam airborne sensor and 3 m images captured by the PlanetScope satellite constellation for mapping and monitoring the aboveground carbon content of a saltmarsh ecosystem in Jervis Bay National Park, Australia. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from an ArborCam image was calibrated to aboveground carbon content using field survey data. Strong linear relationships between the ArborCam NDVI and aboveground carbon content were found when survey data were partitioned by species. The mean aboveground carbon content derived from the calibrated ArborCam image was 1.32 Mg C ha(-1) across the study area; however, this is likely to have been underestimated. A monthly NDVI time series derived from 12 PlanetScope images was analysed to investigate the short-term temporal variation in saltmarsh phenology, and significant intra-annual variation was found. An exploration of potential drivers for the variation found that local rainfall was a potential driver. The combination of the very high spatial resolution airborne ArborCam image and the regular 3 m capture by PlanetScope satellites was found to have potential for accurate mapping and monitoring of aboveground carbon in saltmarsh communities. Future work will focus on improving aboveground carbon estimates by including a very high spatial resolution species distribution map and investigating the influence of temporal variations in saltmarsh spectral response on these estimates.

TI  - Occurrence and Discrepancy of Surface and Column Mole Fractions of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> at a Desert Site in Dunhuang, Western China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are the two major radiative forcing factors of greenhouse gases. In this study, surface and column mole fractions of CO2 and CH4 were first measured at a desert site in Dunhuang, west China. The average column mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2) and CH4 (XCH4) were 413.00 +/- 1.09 ppm and 1876 +/- 6 ppb, respectively, which were 0.90 ppm and 72 ppb lower than their surface values. Diurnal XCO2 showed a sinusoidal mode, while XCH4 appeared as a unimodal distribution. Ground observed XCO2 and XCH4 were compared with international satellites, such as GOSAT, GOSAT-2, OCO-2, OCO-3, and Sentinel-5P. The differences between satellites and EM27/SUN observations were 0.26% for XCO2 and -0.38% for XCH4, suggesting a good consistency between different satellites and ground observations in desert regions in China. Hourly XCO2 was close to surface CO2 mole fractions, but XCH4 appeared to have a large gap with CH4, probably because of the additional chemical removals of CH4 in the upper atmosphere. It is necessary to carry out a long-term observation of column mole fractions of greenhouse gases in the future to obtain their temporal distributions as well as the differences between satellites and ground observations.

TI  - Retrieval of Soil Moisture from FengYun-3D Microwave Radiation Imager Operational and Recalibrated Data Using Random Forest Regression
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Three Microwave Radiation Imagers (MWRI) were carried onboard the FengYun-3B/C/D satellites and have collected more than 10 years of data since 2010. To create a robust climate quality of data, MWRI level one data were reprocessed with new calibration. This study evaluates the performance of retrieving global soil moisture from recalibrated MWRI data (RCD) and quantifies the difference of retrieved soil moisture between operational calibration data (OCD) and RCD. Soil Moisture Operational Products System (SMOPS) products from NOAA on four days of different seasons were collocated with MWRI brightness temperatures, and then the collocated data were used for training an algorithm through machine learning. The retrieved soil moisture products using OCD and RCD were evaluated against the independent SMOPS products, in situ networks and SMAP soil moisture product. It is shown that the algorithm from the random forest is suitable for FY-3D recalibrated MWRI data, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.7223, a mean bias of -0.0062 and an unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) of 0.0476 m(3) m(-3) compared with SMOPS products over the period from 12 July 2018 to 31 December 2019. The difference of retrieved soil moisture using OCD and RCD is spatially heterogeneous. Both temporal and spatial coverage and accuracy of the existing FY-3D operational soil moisture products are significantly improved.

TI  - Investigating the Potential of Sentinel-2 MSI in Early Crop Identification in Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Early crop identification can provide timely and valuable information for agricultural planting management departments to make reasonable and correct decisions. At present, there is still a lack of systematic summary and analysis on how to obtain real-time samples in the early stage, what the optimal feature sets are, and what level of crop identification accuracy can be achieved at different stages. First, this study generated training samples with the help of historical crop maps in 2019 and remote sensing images in 2020. Then, a feature optimization method was used to obtain the optimal features in different stages. Finally, the differences of the four classifiers in identifying crops and the variation characteristics of crop identification accuracy at different stages were analyzed. These experiments were conducted at three sites in Heilongjiang Province to evaluate the reliability of the results. The results showed that the earliest identification time of corn can be obtained in early July (the seven leaves period) with an identification accuracy up to 86%. In the early stages, its accuracy was 40 similar to 79%, which was low, and could not reach the satisfied accuracy requirements. In the middle stages, a satisfactory recognition accuracy could be achieved, and its recognition accuracy was 79 similar to 100%. The late stage had a higher recognition accuracy, which was 90 similar to 100%. The accuracy of soybeans at each stage was similar to that of corn, and the earliest identification time of soybeans could also be obtained in early July (the blooming period) with an identification accuracy up to 87%. Its accuracy in the early growth stage was 35 similar to 71%; in the middle stage, it was 69 similar to 100%; and in the late stage, it was 92 similar to 100%. Unlike corn and soybeans, the earliest identification time of rice could be obtained at the end of April (the flooding period) with an identification accuracy up to 86%. In the early stage, its accuracy was 58 similar to 100%; in the middle stage, its accuracy was 93 similar to 100%; and in the late stage, its accuracy was 96 similar to 100%. In terms of crop identification accuracy in the whole growth stage, GBDT and RF performed better than other classifiers in our three study areas. This study systematically investigated the potential of early crop recognition in Northeast China, and the results are helpful for relevant applications and decision making of crop recognition in different crop growth stages.

TI  - Thermal Responses of the Largest Freshwater Lake in the Tibetan Plateau and Its Nearby Saline Lake to Climate Change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are thousands of lakes in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), and most are saline. However, little is known about the responses of TP lakes to climate change, especially saline ones. We investigated the thermal responses of the largest freshwater lake (Ngoring Lake) in the TP and its nearby small saline lake (Hajiang Salt Pond) to climate change using the improved lake scheme in the Community Land model (CLM4-LISSS), in which we primarily developed the salinity parameterizations previously evaluated in the Great Salt Lake in USA and further considered the effect of salinity on the temperature of the maximum density of saline water in the present study. The improved lake model with salinity parameterizations was first applied to a saline lake in the TP, where saline lakes make up the majority of water bodies. The CLM4-LISSS model could effectively simulate lake surface water temperature (LSWT), lake water temperature (LT) and ice thickness in Ngoring Lake. Additionally, the model including our salinity parameterizations significantly improved simulations of LSWT and LT in Hajiang Salt Pond, especially in winter. The LSWT of the two completely opposite lakes were warming in the simulations at a rate above 0.6 degrees C/decade. Meteorological forces were the main driving factor, with increasing downward longwave radiation, air temperature and air humidity, as well as weakening winds contributing to LSWT increase. Compared to a hypothetical shallow freshwater lake, the greater depth of Ngoring Lake made its surface warm faster, and salinity slightly accelerated the warming of Hajiang Salt Pond. Monthly mean LSWT differences between the two lakes were induced by salinity effects in cold periods and lake depth in the unfrozen period. In response to a warming climate, the LSWT in the ice-free Hajiang Salt Pond rapidly increased from January to April due to the warming climate, whereas the LSWT of Ngoring Lake increased faster in the first and last month of the ice-cover period due to later ice-on and earlier ice-off. This study will provide a useful tool for saline lakes in the TP and help deepen our knowledge about the responses of TP lakes, especially the saline lakes, to climate change, as well as response differences between freshwater and saline lakes and the reasons for these differences.

TI  - Advances in modelling large river basins in cold regions with Modelisation Environmentale Communautaire-Surface and Hydrology (MESH), the Canadian hydrological land surface scheme
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cold regions provide water resources for half the global population yet face rapid change. Their hydrology is dominated by snow, ice and frozen soils, and climate warming is having profound effects. Hydrological models have a key role in predicting changing water resources but are challenged in cold regions. Ground-based data to quantify meteorological forcing and constrain model parameterization are limited, while hydrological processes are complex, often controlled by phase change energetics. River flows are impacted by poorly quantified human activities. This paper discusses the scientific and technical challenges of the large-scale modelling of cold region systems and reports recent modelling developments, focussing on MESH, the Canadian community hydrological land surface scheme. New cold region process representations include improved blowing snow transport and sublimation, lateral land-surface flow, prairie pothole pond storage dynamics, frozen ground infiltration and thermodynamics, and improved glacier modelling. New algorithms to represent water management include multistage reservoir operation. Parameterization has been supported by field observations and remotely sensed data; new methods for parameter identification have been used to evaluate model uncertainty and support regionalization. Additionally, MESH has been linked to broader decision-support frameworks, including river ice simulation and hydrological forecasting. The paper also reports various applications to the Saskatchewan and Mackenzie River basins in western Canada (0.4 and 1.8 million km(2)). These basins arise in glaciated mountain headwaters, are partly underlain by permafrost, and include remote and incompletely understood forested, wetland, agricultural and tundra ecoregions. These illustrate the current capabilities and limitations of cold region modelling, and the extraordinary challenges to prediction, including the need to overcoming biases in forcing data sets, which can have disproportionate effects on the simulated hydrology.

TI  - Comparing Fire Extent and Severity Mapping between Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 Satellite Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of fire extent and severity across broad landscapes and timeframes using remote sensing approaches is valuable to inform ecological research, biodiversity conservation and fire management. Compiling imagery from various satellite sensors can assist in long-term fire history mapping; however, inherent sensor differences need to be considered. The New South Wales Fire Extent and Severity Mapping (FESM) program uses imagery from Sentinel and Landsat satellites, along with supervised classification algorithms, to produce state-wide fire maps over recent decades. In this study, we compared FESM outputs from Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 sensors, which have different spatial and spectral resolutions. We undertook independent accuracy assessments of both Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 sensor algorithms using high-resolution aerial imagery from eight training fires. We also compared the FESM outputs from both sensors across 27 case study fires. We compared the mapped areas of fire severity classes between outputs and assessed the classification agreement at random sampling points. Our independent accuracy assessment demonstrated very similar levels of accuracy for both sensor algorithms. We also found that there was substantial agreement between the outputs from the two sensors. Agreement on the extent of burnt versus unburnt areas was very high, and the severity classification of burnt areas was typically either in agreement between the sensors or in disagreement by only one severity class (e.g., low and moderate severity or high and extreme severity). Differences between outputs are likely partly due to differences in sensor resolution (10 m and 30 m pixel sizes for Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8, respectively) and may be influenced by landscape complexity, such as terrain roughness and foliage cover. Overall, this study supports the combined use of both sensors in remote sensing applications for fire extent and severity mapping.

TI  - Altitude-dependent probability of vertical, cloud-free line-of-sight from European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting Re-Analysis-interim cloud cover
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A method to calculate the altitude-dependent, vertical, cloud-free line-of-sight (CFLOS) using the fractional cloud cover from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting Re-Analysis Interim (ERA-I) dataset has been developed. This method enables users of airborne and satellite collections of optical ground data to understand the statistical coverage limitations of these collection systems by informing them of global probabilities of CFLOS versus altitude as well as time of year. This method is accurate for regions between +/- 60 deg of latitude; it should not be applied to polar regions due to limitations in the underlying ERA-I data. Our CFLOS calculations have been compared to the results of CloudSAT/Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation analysis and with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) total cloud cover data. It is shown that the ERA-I reports on average less cloud cover by about 7.5% (absolute) for regions within +/- 60 deg of the equator relative to MODIS cloud cover retrievals. Our CFLOS calculation leverages the resolution and diversity of ERA-I that enables spatial coverage as well as frequency of occurrence CFLOS calculations for nearly all non-polar regions on earth.

TI  - Evaluating Atmospheric Correction Algorithms Applied to OLCI Sentinel-3 Data of Chesapeake Bay Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing permits large-scale monitoring of coastal waters through synoptic measurements of water-leaving radiance that can be scaled to relevant water quality metrics and in turn help inform local and regional responses to a variety of stressors. As both the incident and water-leaving radiance are affected by interactions with the intervening atmosphere, the efficacy of atmospheric correction algorithms is essential to derive accurate water-leaving radiometry. Modern ocean color satellite sensors such as the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3A and -3B satellites are providing unprecedented operational data at the higher spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution that is necessary to resolve optically complex coastal water quality. Validating these satellite-based radiance measurements with vicarious in situ radiometry, especially in optically complex coastal waters, is a critical step in not only evaluating atmospheric correction algorithm performance but ultimately providing accurate water quality metrics for stakeholders. In this study, a regional in situ dataset from the Chesapeake Bay was used to evaluate the performance of four atmospheric correction algorithms applied to OLCI Level-1 data. Images of the Chesapeake Bay are processed through a neural-net based algorithm (C2RCC), a spectral optimization-based algorithm (POLYMER), an iterative two-band bio-optical-based algorithm (L2gen), and compared to the standard Level-2 OLCI data (BAC). Performance was evaluated through a matchup analysis to in situ remote sensing reflectance data. Statistical metrics demonstrated that C2RCC had the best performance, particularly in the longer wavelengths (>560 nm) and POLYMER contained the most clear day coverage (fewest flagged data). This study provides a framework with associated uncertainties and recommendations to utilize OLCI ocean color data to monitor the water quality and biogeochemical dynamics in Chesapeake Bay.

TI  - A Second Planet Transiting LTT 1445A and a Determination of the Masses of Both Worlds
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - LTT 1445 is a hierarchical triple M-dwarf star system located at a distance of 6.86 pc. The primary star LTT 1445A (0.257 M-circle dot) is known to host the transiting planet LTT 1445Ab with an orbital period of 5.36 days, making it the second-closest known transiting exoplanet system, and the closest one for which the host is an M dwarf. Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, we present the discovery of a second planet in the LTT 1445 system, with an orbital period of 3.12 days. We combine radial-velocity measurements obtained from the five spectrographs, Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations, High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher, High-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer, MAROON-X, and Planet Finder Spectrograph to establish that the new world also orbits LTT 1445A. We determine the mass and radius of LTT 1445Ab to be 2.87 +/- 0.25 M-circle plus and 1.304(-0.060)(+0.067) R-circle plus, consistent with an Earth-like composition. For the newly discovered LTT 1445Ac, we measure a mass of 1.54(-0.19)(+0.20) M-circle plus and a minimum radius of 1.15 R-circle plus, but we cannot determine the radius directly as the signal-to-noise ratio of our light curve permits both grazing and nongrazing configurations. Using MEarth photometry and ground-based spectroscopy, we establish that star C (0.161 M-circle dot) is likely the source of the 1.4 day rotation period, and star B (0.215 MY circle dot) has a likely rotation period of 6.7 days. We estimate a probable rotation period of 85 days for LTT 1445A. Thus, this triple M-dwarf system appears to be in a special evolutionary stage where the most massive M dwarf has spun down, the intermediate mass M dwarf is in the process of spinning down, while the least massive stellar component has not yet begun to spin down.

TI  - Natality and Relational Transcendence in Humanist Chaplaincy
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Every life has a beginning and an end. Natality and mortality are both profound existential fundaments of life that may lead us to question meaning in life as well as to find meaning. In spiritual care, the focus is often on mortality as a source of existential suffering, and on ways to deal with such suffering according to worldview traditions. In humanist traditions, mortality is not only seen as an existential threat but also as an existential given that people need to embrace to find meaning in life. Natality has received much less attention, both in spiritual care and in humanist thought. In this article, we build on philosophical ideas of Arendt and Butler to explore the significance of natality for a humanist perspective on meaning in life and spiritual care. We argue that taking natality into account results in a relational understanding of humanist spiritual care in which the notion of "relational transcendence" is a central element. Natality also means that we can initiate, create, and act in the world, which highlights the political dimension of humanist spiritual care. We reflect on the implications of natality and relational transcendence for humanist spirituality and chaplaincy and formulate some concrete building blocks for working from this perspective.

TI  - Active Nitrogen Cycle Driven by Solar Radiation in Clean Desert Air
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deserts have been recognized as constantly releasing reactive nitrogen compounds to the atmosphere due to the subsoil-storage leaching and surface-deposit evaporation induced by solar radiative heating. However, this release and the consequent response of the nitrogen cycles in desert air have not been evaluated and are overlooked in most regional and global models. In our nitrate measurements, including nitric acid and particulate nitrate, in clean air, that is, in the absence of or with minor anthropogenic influences, in a Chinese desert, diurnal nitrate variations consisting of daytime increases and nighttime decreases were observed in the range of 1.3-3.7 mu gm(-3) in summer, 0.1-2.6 mu gm(-3) in spring, and 0.2-1.3 mu gm(-3) in autumn. These values are considerably higher than those observed in remote marine and forest areas. Simulations with a regional transport model demonstrate that the variation could be largely accounted for by the oxidation of soil-emitted reactive nitrogen compounds by photochemical-reactions products. These results indicate an active nitrogen cycle in clean desert air, which is the consequence of the coordination of solar radiation-induced surface soil emission and subsequent photochemical reactions. Satellite data of NO2 further indicate possible similar cycles in most major desert areas worldwide. By including this nitrogen cycle in the vast desert areas and its subsequent effects, such as those on ozone chemistry, climate models may thus provide a better understanding of the global nitrogen budget in the historical and developing Earth ecosystems.

TI  - A Serverless-Based, On-the-Fly Computing Framework for Remote Sensing Image Collection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth of remote sensing data calls for the construction of new computational models for algorithmic exploration, which requires on-demand execution, instant response, and multitenancy. We call this model on-the-fly computing, which could reduce the complexity of cloud programming for remote sensing data analysis and benefit from efficient multiplexing. As an advancement of cloud computing, serverless computing makes it possible to realize the on-the-fly computational model. In the study, the concise definition of an on-the-fly computing model for remote sensing data analysis and the corresponding software architecture based on the serverless computing commodities are presented. The proof-of-concept experiments have suggested that the on-the-fly computing model for remote sensing data analysis can be efficiently implemented as a serverless software. The response time is mainly related to the tile reading operation and data structure conversion. In the case of high concurrency, the system can scale to hundreds of instances in seconds.

TI  - GA-Net-Pyramid: An Efficient End-to-End Network for Dense Matching
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense matching plays a crucial role in computer vision and remote sensing, to rapidly provide stereo products using inexpensive hardware. Along with the development of deep learning, the Guided Aggregation Network (GA-Net) achieves state-of-the-art performance via the proposed Semi-Global Guided Aggregation layers and reduces the use of costly 3D convolutional layers. To solve the problem of GA-Net requiring large GPU memory consumption, we design a pyramid architecture to modify the model. Starting from a downsampled stereo input, the disparity is estimated and continuously refined through the pyramid levels. Thus, the disparity search is only applied for a small size of stereo pair and then confined within a short residual range for minor correction, leading to highly reduced memory usage and runtime. Tests on close-range, aerial, and satellite data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significantly higher efficiency (around eight times faster consuming only 20-40% GPU memory) and comparable results with GA-Net on remote sensing data. Thanks to this coarse-to-fine estimation, we successfully process remote sensing datasets with very large disparity ranges, which could not be processed with GA-Net due to GPU memory limitations.

TI  - A Bibliometric Analysis of the Application of Remote Sensing in Crop Spatial Patterns: Current Status, Progress and Future Directions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - The crop spatial pattern (CSP) is the spatial expression of the planting structure, maturity and planting pattern of crops in a region or production unit. It reflects the situation of human agricultural production using agricultural production resources, and is very important for human survival and development. Based on 5356 publications collected from the Web of Science Core Collection(TM) (WoS), this paper's aim is to illustrate a comprehensive run-through and visualization of the subject of CSP. A time series evolution diagram of hot topics and the evolution of research hotspots are discussed in detail. Then, remote sensing monitoring methods of the crop planting area, multiple cropping, crop planting patterns and the mechanisms of crop spatial patterns are summarized, respectively. In the discussion, we focus on three important issues, namely, the remote sensing cloud platform, the changes in characteristics of the crop spatial pattern and the simulation of the crop spatial pattern. The main objective of the paper is to assist research workers interested in the area of CSP in determining potential research gaps and hotspots.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Organic Carbon Content in the Ebinur Lake Wetland, Xinjiang, China, Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Data and Ensemble Learning Algorithms
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC), as the largest carbon pool on the land surface, plays an important role in soil quality, ecological security and the global carbon cycle. Multisource remote sensing data-driven modeling strategies are not well understood for accurately mapping soil organic carbon. Here, we hypothesized that the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Sensor Instrument (MSI) data-driven modeling strategy produced superior outcomes compared to modeling based on Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data due to the finer spatial and spectral resolutions of the Sentinel-2A MSI data. To test this hypothesis, the Ebinur Lake wetland in Xinjiang was selected as the study area. In this study, SOC estimation was carried out using Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 data, combining climatic variables, topographic factors, index variables and Sentinel-1A data to construct a common variable model for Sentinel-2A data and Landsat 8 data, and a full variable model for Sentinel-2A data, respectively. We utilized ensemble learning algorithms to assess the prediction performance of modeling strategies, including random forest (RF), gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms. The results show that: (1) The Sentinel-2A model outperformed the Landsat 8 model in the prediction of SOC contents, and the Sentinel-2A full variable model under the XGBoost algorithm achieved the best results R-2 = 0.804, RMSE = 1.771, RPIQ = 2.687). (2) The full variable model of Sentinel-2A with the addition of the red-edge band and red-edge index improved R-2 by 6% and 3.2% over the common variable Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A models, respectively. (3) In the SOC mapping of the Ebinur Lake wetland, the areas with higher SOC content were mainly concentrated in the oasis, while the mountainous and lakeside areas had lower SOC contents. Our results provide a program to monitor the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems through a satellite perspective.

TI  - Urban forestry detection by deep learning method with GaoFen-2 remote sensing images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forestry is regarded as the green infrastructure of cities, the analysis of which is of great significance for research on statistical analysis, such as greening, carbon sink, etc. on the basis of remote sensing detection. However, current urban forestry detection algorithms are focused on typical machine learning, whose results are limited by the manually selected features. Therefore, an innovative detection algorithm for analyzing urban forestry is proposed. First, the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm is adopted to segment the dataset, and the edge information of the object is preserved as much as possible. Second, a new network structure is constructed on the basis of Mask-RCNN to refine the detection results: (1) dilated convolution is adopted to replace the normal convolution of C1 in backbone (ResNet101) to increase the size of receptive field; (2) convolutional block attention module is introduced in C2 to give more weight to the shallow features such as edges and colors; and (3) atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) is added to branch of C3, enhancing the ability of multiscale fusion. With the effect of ASPP on detection results at different positions of backbone compared, the results show that the more backward the ASPP is, the more obvious the trend of negative correlation between network convergence speed and detection accuracy (C3: 89.2%, C4: 84.3%, and C5: 81.6%) is. The accuracy of random forest and support vector machines is also compared, with the former of 69.4% and the latter of 71.2%. In addition, the method of transfer learning to unmanned aerial vehicle data is used in this research, with the accuracy of 81.6%. The result shows that the improved segmentation model features better ability of learning shallow features than the original, able to accurately extract urban forestry from remote sensing images, which provides the reference for the further research on urban forestry detection, mapping, as well as the multisource remote sensing data fusion.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Reconstruction of MODIS Normalized Difference Snow Index Products Using U-Net with Partial Convolutions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover product is one of the prevailing datasets for global snow monitoring, but cloud obscuration leads to the discontinuity of ground coverage information in spatial and temporal. To solve this problem, a novel spatial-temporal missing information reconstruction model based on U-Net with partial convolutions (PU-Net) is proposed to recover the cloud gaps in the MODIS Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) products. Taking the Yellow River Source Region as a study case, in which the snow cover is characterized by shallow, fast-changing and complex heterogeneity, the MODIS NDSI product in the 2018-2019 snow season is reconstructed, and the reconstruction accuracy is validated with simulated cloud mask and in situ snow depth (SD) observations. The results show that under the simulated cloud mask scenario, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the reconstructed missing pixels is from 4.22% to 18.81% under different scenarios of the mean NDSI of the patch and the mask ratio of the applied mask, and the coefficient of determination (R-2) ranges from 0.76 to 0.94. The validation based on in situ SD observations at 10 sites shows good consistency, the overall accuracy is increased by 25.66% to 49.25% compared with the Aqua-Terra combined MODIS NDSI product, and its value exceeds 90% at 60% of observation stations.

TI  - Impacts of Climate Oscillation on Offshore Wind Resources in China Seas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term stability and sustainability of offshore wind energy resources are very important for wind energy exploration. In this study, the Cyclostationary Empirical Orthogonal Function (CSEOF) method, which can determine the time varying spatial distributions and long-term fluctuations in the cyclostationary geophysical process, was adopted to investigate the geographical and temporal variability of offshore wind resources in China Seas. The CSEOF analysis was performed on wind speeds at 70 m height above the sea surface from a validated combined Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) wind product (2000-2016) with high spatial resolution of 12.5 km, and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) wind data (1979-2016) with a grid size of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees. The decomposition results of the two datasets indicate that the first CSEOF mode represents the variability of wind annual cycle signal and contributes 77.7% and 76.5% to the wind energy variability, respectively. The principal component time series (PCTS) shows an interannual variability of annual wind cycle with a period of 3-4 years. The second mode accounts for 4.3% and 4.7% of total wind speed variability, respectively, and captures the spatiotemporal contribution of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on regional wind energy variability. The correlations between the mode-2 PCTS of scatterometer or CFSR winds and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) are greater than 0.7, illustrating that ENSO has a significant impact on China's offshore wind resources. Moreover, the mode-1 or mode-2 spatial pattern of CFSR winds is basically consistent with that of scatterometer data, but CFSR underestimates the temporal variability of annual wind speed cycle and the spatial changes of wind speed related to ENSO. Compared with reanalysis data, scatterometer winds always demonstrate a finer structure of wind energy variability due to their higher spatial resolution. For ENSO events with different intensities, the impact of ENSO on regional wind resources varies with time and space. In general, El Nino has reduced wind energy in most regions of China Seas except for the Bohai Sea and Beibu Bay, while La Nina has strengthened the winds in most areas except for the Bohai Sea and southern South China Sea.

TI  - Digital soil mapping of soil total nitrogen based on Landsat 8, Sentinel 2, and WorldView-2 images in smallholder farms in Yellow River Basin, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting spatial explicit information of soil nutrients is critical for sustainable soil management and food security under climate change and human disturbance in agricultural land. Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques can utilize soil-landscape information from remote sensing data to predict the spatial pattern of soil nutrients, and it is important to explore the effects of remote sensing data types on DSM. This research utilized Landsat 8 (LT), Sentinel 2 (ST), and WorldView-2 (WV) remote sensing data and employed partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to characterize the spatial pattern of soil total nitrogen (TN) in smallholder farm settings in Yellow River Basin, China. The overall relationships between TN and spectral indices from LT and ST were stronger than those from WV. Multiple red edge band-based spectral indices from ST and WV were relevant variables for TN, while there were no red band-based spectral indices from ST and WV identified as relevant variables for TN. Soil moisture and vegetation were major driving forces of soil TN spatial distribution in this area. The research also concluded that farmlands of crop rotation had relatively higher TN concentration compared with farmlands of monoculture. The soil prediction models based on WV achieved relatively lower model performance compared with those based on ST and LT. The effects of remote sensing data spectral resolution and spectral range on enhancing soil prediction model performance are higher than the effects of remote sensing data spatial resolution. Soil prediction models based on ST can provide location-specific soil maps, achieve fair model performance, and have low cost. This research suggests DSM research utilizing ST has relatively high prediction accuracy, and can produce soil maps that are fit for the spatial explicit soil management for smallholder farms.

TI  - Satellite-Based Evidences to Improve Cropland Productivity on the High-Standard Farmland Project Regions in Henan Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the pressure of limited arable land and increasing demand for food, improving the quality of existing arable land has become a priority to ensure food security. The Chinese government gives great importance to improving cropland productivity by focusing on the construction of high-standard farmland (HSF). The government puts forward the goal of constructing 1.2 billion mu (100 mu approximate to 6.67 hectares) of HSF by 2030. Therefore, how to apply remote sensing to monitor the ability to increase and stabilize yields in HSF project regions has become an essential task for proving the efficiency of HSF construction. Based on HSF project distribution data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (Landsat8-OLI) data, this study develops a method to monitor cropland productivity improvement by measuring cropland productivity level (CPL), disaster resistance ability (DRA) and homogeneous yield degree (HYD) in the HSF project region. Taking China's largest grain production province (Henan Province) as a case study area, research shows that a light use efficiency model that includes multiple cropping data can effectively detect changes in cropland productivity before and after HSF construction. Furthermore, integrated Landsat8-OLI and MODIS data can detect changes in DRA and HYD before and after HSF construction with higher temporal and spatial resolution. In 109 HSF project regions concentrated and distributed in contiguous regions in Henan Province, the average cropland productivity increased by 145 kg/mu; among the eight sample project regions, DRA was improved in seven sample project regions; and the HYD in all eight sample project regions was greatly improved (the degree of increase is more than 75%). This evidence from satellites proves that the Chinese HSF project has significantly improved the CPL, DRA and HYD of cropland, while this study also verifies the practicability of the three indices to monitor the efficiency of HSF construction.

TI  - A Review of Remote Sensing for Water Quality Retrieval: Progress and Challenges
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Water pollution has become one of the most serious issues threatening water environments, water as a resource and human health. The most urgent and effective measures rely on dynamic and accurate water quality monitoring on a large scale. Due to their temporal and spatial advantages, remote sensing technologies have been widely used to retrieve water quality data. With the development of hyper-spectral sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and artificial intelligence, there has been significant advancement in remotely sensed water quality retrieval owing to various data availabilities and retrieval methodologies. This article presents the application of remote sensing for water quality retrieval, and mainly discusses the research progress in terms of data sources and retrieval modes. In particular, we summarize some retrieval algorithms for several specific water quality variables, including total suspended matter (TSM), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). We also discuss the significant challenges to atmospheric correction, remotely sensed data resolution, and retrieval model applicability in the domains of spatial, temporal and water complexity. Finally, we propose possible solutions to these challenges. The review can provide detailed references for future development and research in water quality retrieval.

TI  - First Assessment of GF3-02 SAR Ocean Wind Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 23 November 2021, the Gaofen-3-02 (GF3-02) satellite was successfully launched in the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center of China. The primary payload is C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with a maximum resolution of 1 m, and includes 12 imaging modes such as Spotlight, Strip, and TOPSAR, which will play an essential role in marine environment monitoring. As an important marine environmental parameter, the wind speed accuracy retrieved by GF3-02 SAR directly reflects its performance and effectiveness as an operational product. Therefore, based on the wind data of buoys of the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), ECMWF reanalysis V5 (ERA5), and HY-2B Scatterometer (SCA), a preliminary accuracy assessment of the wind speed retrieved by GF3-02 SAR is carried out in this paper. The wind speed retrieval accuracy of GF3-02 SAR in the co-polarization (HH+VV) data under different Geophysical Model Functions (GMFs) is discussed by using 478 level-1A Single Look Complex (SLC) ocean products acquired in Quad-Polarization Strip I (QPSI) and produced by the National Satellite Ocean Application Service (NSOAS) from January to March 2022. The results show that the optimal root mean square errors (RMSE) are 1.40 m/s, 1.18 m/s, and 1.24 m/s for the VV polarization and 1.39 m/s, 1.19 m/s, and 1.52 m/s for the HH polarization compared to the NDBC wind speed, the ERA5 wind speed, and the HY-2B SCA wind speed, respectively. The preliminary results show that GF3-02 SAR has good wind speed retrieval ability and can meet the needs of operational products.

TI  - Evaluation and Comparison of MODIS C6 and C6.1 Deep Blue Aerosol Products in Arid and Semi-Arid Areas of Northwestern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue (DB) algorithm was developed for aerosol retrieval on bright surfaces. Although the global validation accuracy of the DB product is satisfactory, there are still some regions found to have very low accuracy. To this end, DB has updated the surface database in the latest version of the Collection 6.1 (C6.1) algorithm. Some studies have shown that DB aerosol optical depth (AOD) of the old version Collection 6 (C6) has been seriously underestimated in Northwestern China. However, the status of the new version of the C6.1 product in this region is still unknown. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the MODIS DB product in Northwestern China. The DB AOD with high quality (Quality Flag = 2 or 3) was selected to validate against the 23 sites from the China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network (CARSNET) and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) during the period 2002-2014. By the overall analysis, the results indicate that both C6 and C6.1 show significant underestimation with a large fraction of more than 54% of collocations falling below the Expected Error (EE = +/-(0.05 + 20% AOD(ground))) envelope and with a large negative Mean Bias (MB) of less than -0.14. Furthermore, the new C6.1 products failed to achieve reasonable improvements in the region of Northwestern China. Besides, C6.1 has slightly fewer collocations than C6 due that some pixels with systematic biases have been removed from the new surface reflectance database. From the analysis of the site scale, the scatter plot of C6.1 is similar to that of C6 in most sites. Furthermore, a significant underestimation of DB AOD was observed at most sites, with the most severe underestimation at two sites located in the Taklimakan Desert region. Among 23 sites in Northwestern China, there are only two sites where C6.1 has largely improved the underestimation of C6. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that there are also two sites where the accuracy of the new C6.1 has declined. Moreover, it is surprising that there is one site where a large overestimation was observed in C6 and improved in C6.1. Additionally, we found a constant value of about 0.05 for both C6 and C6.1 at several sites with low aerosol loading, which is an obvious artifact. The significant improvements of C6.1 were observed in the Middle East and Central Asia but not in most sites of Northwestern China. The results of this study will be beneficial to further improvements in the MODIS DB algorithm.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Southeast Asia is one of the largest biomass burning (BB) regions in the world, and the air pollutants generated by this BB have an important impact on air pollution in southern China. However, the mechanism of the cross-border transport of BB pollutants to neighboring regions is yet to be understood. Based on the MODIS remote sensing products and conventional observation data of meteorology and the environment, the WRF-Chem and FLEXPART-WRF models were used to simulate a typical PM2.5 pollution episode that occurred during 24-26 March 2017 to analyze the mechanism of cross-border transport of BB pollutants over Yunnan Plateau (YP) in southwest China. During this air pollution episode, in conjunction with the flourishing BB activities over the neighboring Indo-China Peninsula (ICP) regions in Southeast Asia, and driven by the southwesterly winds prevailing from the ICP to YP, the cross-border transport of pollutants was observed along the transport pathway with the lifting plateau topography in YP. Based on the proximity to the BB sources in ICP, YP was divided into a source region (SR) and a receptor region (RR) for the cross-border transport, and the negative and positive correlation coefficients (R) between PM2.5 concentrations and wind speeds, respectively, were presented, indicating the different impacts of BB emissions on the two regions. XSBN and Kunming, the representative SR and RR sites in the border and hinterland of YP, respectively, have distinct mechanisms that enhance PM2.5 concentrations of air pollution. The SR site is mainly affected by the ICP BB emissions with local accumulation in the stagnant meteorological conditions, whereas the RR site is dominated by the regional transport of PM2.5 with strong winds and vertical mixing. It was revealed that the large PM2.5 contributions of ICP BB emissions lift from the lower altitudes in SR to the higher altitudes in RR for the regional transport of PM2.5. Moreover, the contributions of regional transport of PM2.5 decrease with the increase in transport distance, reflecting an important role of transport distance between the source-receptor areas in air pollution change.

TI  - Improved Daily Evapotranspiration Estimation Using Remotely Sensed Data in a Data Fusion System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) represents crop water use and is a key indicator of crop health. Accurate estimation of ET is critical for agricultural irrigation and water resource management. ET retrieval using energy balance methods with remotely sensed thermal infrared data as the key input has been widely applied for irrigation scheduling, yield prediction, drought monitoring and so on. However, limitations on the spatial and temporal resolution of available thermal satellite data combined with the effects of cloud contamination constrain the amount of detail that a single satellite can provide. Fusing satellite data from different satellites with varying spatial and temporal resolutions can provide a more continuous estimation of daily ET at field scale. In this study, we applied an ET fusion modeling system, which uses a surface energy balance model to retrieve ET using both Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and then fuses the Landsat and MODIS ET retrieval timeseries using the Spatial-Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM). In this paper, we compared different STARFM ET fusion implementation strategies over various crop lands in the central California. In particular, the use of single versus two Landsat-MODIS pair images to constrain the fusion is explored in cases of rapidly changing crop conditions, as in frequently harvested alfalfa fields, as well as an improved dual-pair method. The daily 30 m ET retrievals are evaluated with flux tower observations and analyzed based on land cover type. This study demonstrates improvement using the new dual-pair STARFM method compared with the standard one-pair STARFM method in estimating daily field scale ET for all the major crop types in the study area.

TI  - Inner Dynamic Detection and Prediction of Water Quality Based on CEEMDAN and GA-SVM Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban water quality is facing strongly adverse degradation in rapidly developing areas. However, there exists a huge challenge to estimating the inner features and predicting the variation of long-term water quality due to the lack of related monitoring data and the complexity of urban water systems. Fortunately, multi-remote sensing data, such as nighttime light and evapotranspiration (ET), provide scientific data support and reasonably reveal the variation mechanisms. Here, we develop an integrated decomposition-reclassification-prediction method for water quality by integrating the CEEMDN method, the RF method mothed, and the genetic algorithm-support vector machine model (GA-SVM). The degression of the long-term water quality was decomposed and reclassified into three different frequency terms, i.e., high-frequency, low-frequency, and trend terms, to reveal the inner mechanism and dynamics in the CEEMDAN method. The RF method was then used to identify the teleconnection and the significance of the selected driving factors. More importantly, the GA-SVM model was designed with two types of model schemes, which were the data-driven model (GA-SVMd) and the integrated CEEMDAN-GA-SVM model (defined as GA-SVMc model), in order to predict urban water quality. Results revealed that the high-frequency terms for NH3-N and TN had a major contribution to the water quality and were mainly dominated by hydrometeorological factors such as ET, rainfall, and the dynamics of the lake water table. The trend terms revealed that the water quality continuously deteriorated during the study period; the terms were mainly regulated by the land use and land cover (LULC), land metrics, population, and yearly rainfall. The predicting results confirmed that the integrated GA-SVMc model had better performance than single data-driven models (such as the GA-SVM model). Our study supports that the integrated method reveals variation rules in water quality and provides early warning and guidance for reducing the water pollutant concentration.

TI  - Vegetation phenology and its response to climate change in Hedong area of Gansu Province
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding vegetation phenology of temperate regions and its responses to climate change is crucial for diagnosing the responses of ecosystems to regional climate change and projecting regional ecosystem carbon cycle. Based on MODIS EVI data from 2000 to 2018, we used asymmetric Gaussian (A-G) function and dynamic threshold method to extract the phenological parameters of forest and grassland in Hedong, Gansu Province. Combining meteorological data, we explored the response of vegetation phenology to climate change. A significant difference in phenological parameters was found between forest and grassland , both of which with a trend of advancing SOS, but advancing EOS for forest and delaying EOS for grassland. SOS displayed an advanced trend in 61% of the total area, a delayed trend of EOS in 41%, and a lengthened trend of LOS in 53%. With increasing elevation and latitude, SOS, EOS, and LOS presented a delayed, advanced, and shortened trend, respectively, but such a trend was weakening. The degrees and directions of the effects of preseason climate on SOS and EOS were different. Warming autumn and winter delayed SOS, while warming spring advanced SOS. Increasing precipitation in spring and summer advanced EOS, but warming autumn delayed EOS. The effect of minimum temperature was more critical in Hedong area. Forest and grassland differed in the degree of their response to climate change. The correlation between SOS of forest and the minimum temperature changed from positive to negative in March , and the grassland was only positive in February and negative in other months. Precipitation only had a significant impact in some individual months. The relationship between EOS of forest (grassland) and precipitation and minimum temperature changed from positive to negative in September (July).

TI  - Comparative analysis of the mass elevation effect and its implication for the treeline between the Tibetan and Bolivian plateaus based on solar radiation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the main non-zonal factors, the mass elevation effect (MEE) has significant impacts on both regional climates and mountain ecological patterns. In recent years, with the development of quantitative techniques and methods, quantitative studies on the MEE and its implication on mountain altitudinal belts have developed rapidly. However, some issues have not been solved yet, such as high errors in spatial temperature estimations and difficulties in the definition and extraction of intramountain base elevation. Moreover, there is still a lack of comparative studies on the MEE and its influence on treelines and snowlines as most studies were conducted on specific mountains or plateaus. To compare the MEE magnitudes of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the Bolivian Plateau (BP), we estimated the correspondent air temperatures and simulated the solar radiations based on MODIS surface temperature, station observation, and treeline data. Then, we analyzed the elevation of the 10 degrees C isotherms on the two plateaus, the temperatures at the same elevation, and the solar radiations. According to the mechanism of the MEE and the relationship of solar radiation and treeline, we constructed treeline models for the two plateaus through a stepwise regression analysis by considering several influencing factors of the MEE (e.g., air temperature and precipitation) and using solar radiation as its proxy. The results showed that: (1) the MEE magnitude on the TP is equivalent to that on the BP although the former is slightly higher than the latter; (2) the MEE strongly influences the highest treelines in the northern and southern hemispheres, which both occur on the two plateaus. Notably, the treeline distribution models based on solar radiation had higher accuracies than those models with parameters of temperature and precipitation (the adjusted R-2 values were 0.76 for the TP and 0.936 for the BP), indicating that solar radiation can be used to quantify the MEE and its implications on treelines. Overall, the results of this study can serve as a basis for subsequent analyses on the MEE's impact factors.

TI  - Haze Grading Using the Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - As an air pollution phenomenon, haze has become one of the focuses of social discussion. Research into the causes and concentration prediction of haze is significant, forming the basis of haze prevention. The inversion of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) based on remote sensing satellite imagery can provide a reference for the concentration of major pollutants in a haze, such as PM2.5 concentration and PM10 concentration. This paper used satellite imagery to study haze problems and chose PM2.5, one of the primary haze pollutants, as the research object. First, we used conventional methods to perform the inversion of AOD on remote sensing images, verifying the correlation between AOD and PM2.5. Subsequently, to simplify the parameter complexity of the traditional inversion method, we proposed using the convolutional neural network instead of the traditional inversion method and constructing a haze level prediction model. Compared with traditional aerosol depth inversion, we found that convolutional neural networks can provide a higher correlation between PM2.5 concentration and satellite imagery through a more simplified satellite image processing process. Thus, it offers the possibility of researching and managing haze problems based on neural networks.

TI  - Monitoring Temperature Variation in Rising Small Defunct Volcano on Jeju Island, Republic of Korea, Using High-Resolution Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is not an expectation but a reality in the "oreums" (common local name for rising, small defunct volcanoes on Jeju Island, Republic of Korea). The oreums exhibit wide biodiversity. However, their ecology is threatened by its associated climate change and their ecological changes have rarely been monitored or recorded. We used three years of Sentinel-2 image data to generate a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map of the Geum-oreum area. We found that the NDVI was highly associated with temperature, implying that Sentinel-2 images could be utilized to monitor the temperature variation in the oreums to assist in planning and preparation to conserve their ecosystems before they are jeopardized. The results indicated that the NDVI maps derived from Sentinel-2 images were highly associated with temperature in Geum-oreum. We expect this method could be applied in other regions to detect temperature variation for ecological management planning in large areas (such as forests).

TI  - Multicenter Study of Carbapenemase-Producing <i>Enterobacterales</i> in Havana, Cuba, 2016-2021
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Surveillance of carbapenem resistance is particularly important for Enterobacterales, mainly in countries with limited healthcare resources. We conducted a cross-sectional study to detect carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales at 10 sentinel hospitals in Havana, Cuba for a six year-period (2016-2021) by the National Reference Laboratory for Health Care-Associated Infections in the Pedro Kouri Institute. A total of 152 isolates were collected with phenotypic production of metallo-beta-lactamase. NDM-type carbapenemase was detected in all the 152 isolates, and KPC-type enzyme gene was simultaneously identified in four NDM-positive isolates. The most abundant carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) species was Klebsiella pneumoniae (69.7%), followed by Enterobacter cloacae complex (13.2%), and Escherichia coli (5.9%). Over the study period, among CPE, prevalence of K. pneumoniae was almost constant, while Enterobacter spp. showed slightly increasing tendency. The urinary tract (36.2%) was the most prevalent source of infection with CPE, followed by bloodstream (26.3%) and surgical wound (17.1%), being frequently derived from Intensive Care Units (35.5%) and urology wards (21.7%). This study revealed the present situation of CPE in hospitals in Havana, Cuba, showing the emergence and dissemination of Enterobacterales producing NDM-type carbapenemase, mainly K. pneumoniae.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This article presents a review on spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R), which is an important part of GNSS-R technology and has attracted great attention from academia, industry and government agencies in recent years. Compared with ground-based and airborne GNSS-R approaches, spaceborne GNSS-R has a number of advantages, including wide coverage and the ability to sense medium- and large-scale phenomena such as ocean eddies, hurricanes and tsunamis. Since 2014, about seven satellite missions have been successfully conducted and a large number of spaceborne data were recorded. Accordingly, the data have been widely used to carry out a variety of studies for a range of useful applications, and significant research outcomes have been generated. This article provides an overview of these studies with a focus on the basic methods and techniques in the retrieval of a number of geophysical parameters and the detection of several objects. The challenges and future prospects of spaceborne GNSS-R are also addressed.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays a critical role in land surface processes. However, as one of the effective means for obtaining global LST observations, remote sensing observations are inherently affected by cloud cover, resulting in varying degrees of missing data in satellite-derived LST products. Here, we propose a solution. First, the data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (DINEOF) method is used to reconstruct invalid LSTs in cloud-contaminated areas into ideal, clear-sky LSTs. Then, a cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching-based method is developed to correct the ideal, clear-sky LSTs to the real LSTs. Experimental results prove that this method can effectively reconstruct missing LST data and guarantee acceptable accuracy in most regions of the world, with RMSEs of 1-2 K and R values of 0.820-0.996 under ideal, clear-sky conditions and RMSEs of 4-7 K and R values of 0.811-0.933 under all weather conditions. Finally, a spatiotemporally continuous MODIS LST dataset at 0.05 degrees latitude/longitude grids is produced based on the above method.

TI  - An Operational Model for Remote Estimating Absorption of Optical Activity Constituents
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The need for an accurate model that can derive the absorption coefficient of optical activity constituents from both marine water and coastal water remains necessary. This study aimed to develop an algorithm for determining the absorption coefficients for both phytoplankton and non-phytoplankton pigments [a(ph)(lambda) and a(dg)(lambda), respectively]. This algorithm included two portions: (1) the total absorption coefficients at the blue and green bands were computed using a neural network technology-based, quasi-analytical algorithm; and (2) the relationship between the a(dg)(lambda) coefficient and the coefficient of total absorption was analyzed. This algorithm was evaluated with both in-situ observations and remote-sensed satellite data. The results showed that the algorithm could produce acceptable results in the retrievals of a(dg)(lambda) and a(ph)(lambda) in both turbid and clear waters. The results also indicated that the proposed algorithm was effective for distinguishing between a(dg)(lambda) and a(ph)(lambda) from the total coefficients of absorption, even though more independent assessments using in-situ and remote-sensed data are required to further improve the approach.

TI  - Land Use Hotspots of the Two Largest Landlocked Countries: Kazakhstan and Mongolia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the two largest landlocked countries, Kazakhstan and Mongolia have similar biophysical conditions and socioeconomic roots in the former Soviet Union. Our objective is to investigate the direction, extent, and spatial variation of land cover change at three administrative levels over three decades (1990-2020). We selected three provinces from each country (Aktobe, Akmola, and Almaty province in Kazakhstan, and Arkhangai, Tov, and Dornod in Mongolia) to classify the land cover into forest, grassland, cropland, barren, and water. Altogether, 6964 Landsat images were used in pixel-based classification method with random forest model for image processing. Six thousand training data points (300 training points x 5 classes x 4 periods) for each province were collected for classification and change detection. Land cover changes at decadal and over the entire study period for five land cover classes were quantified at the country, provincial, and county level. High classification accuracy indicates localized land cover classification have an edge over the latest global land cover product and reveal fine differences in landscape composition. The vast steppe landscapes in these two countries are dominated by grasslands of 91.5% for Dornod in Mongolia and 74.7% for Aktobe in Kazakhstan during the 30-year study period. The most common land cover conversion was grassland to cropland. The cyclic land cover conversions between grassland and cropland reflect the impacts of the Soviet Union's largest reclamation campaign of the 20th century in Kazakhstan and the Atar-3 agriculture re-development in Mongolia. Kazakhstan experienced a higher rate of land cover change over a larger extent of land area than Mongolia. The spatial distribution of land use intensity indicates that land use hotspots are largely influenced by policy and its shifts. Future research based on these large-scale land use and land cover changes should be focused the corresponding ecosystem and society functions.

TI  - Classification of GaoFen-3 full-polarization data based on combining polarization characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore potential applications of GaoFen-3 (GF-3) fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in ground-feature classification, we selected Jiangxiang Town, Nanchang County as the research area and used GF-3 quad-polarization strip I (QPSI) data for classification. Pauli decomposition, Krogager decomposition, and the H/A/alpha decomposition model were used to decompose the GF-3 full-polarization data; combined with the backscattering coefficient values of GF-3's HH, HV, VH, and VV polarization data, feature optimization was performed, and the optimal ground-object features for feature classification were obtained. The random forest (RF) method was used to classify the optimal features, and the results were then compared and verified. The results demonstrate that the component after polarization decomposition of H/A/alpha is more important in classification than the original backscattering coefficient values of HH, HV, VH, and VV. GF-3 single-phase SAR data were used for ground-feature classification in a crop-intensive area of South China, and the optimal feature optimization results included H/A/alpha decomposition and synthesis components of the alpha, anisotropy, red, entropy, blue, green, and polarization backscattering coefficients of VV. The RF method's classification accuracy was higher than that of the maximum-likelihood, support-vector-machine, and neural-network methods. Using this approach, GF-3 data classification's overall accuracy was up to 78.17%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.738. This study has clear practical significance and reference value for the selection of classification methods for ground features based on GF- 3 data in cloudy and rainy areas.

TI  - Observation of Variations of Ambient CO<sub>2</sub> Using Portable FTIR Spectrometer
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurement of CO2 concentration with high accuracy and precision is essential for monitoring local emission sources of greenhouse gases at regional and city scales. Based on Fourier transform spectroscopy and near-infrared solar absorption spectra collected by portable FTIR spectrometer, the column concentration of CO2 in the Hefei area from September 2016 to May 2020 was retrieved using the nonlinear least-squares algorithm. As the observation results show, the column concentration of CO2 has obvious seasonal variation, with the maximum value in spring, the fast decline in summer, and the minimum in autumn. The daily average value of XCO2 is between (401. 23 +/- 0. 60) and (418. 41 +/- 0. 31) ppm, while the monthly average value shows a seasonal amplitude of 6. 96 ppm during 2017. XCO2 showed an increasing trend during the observation, with an annual growth rate of (2. 71 +/- 0. 66) ppm . yr(-1). In order to verify the accuracy and reliability of portable FTIR spectrometer observations, we compared the observations with the high-resolution FTIR measurements. It is found that the mean deviation of XCO2 was about 1. 32 ppm, the linear fitting coefficient was 1. 08 +/- 0. 03, and the correlation coefficient r was 0. 97. Further, our data are compared with GOSAT satellite data, the average deviation of the two data is (0. 63 +/- 1. 76) ppm, and the correlation coefficient r is 0. 86, showing a high correlation between ground-based data and satellite data. Also, ground-based observations in Shanghai were compared with the simultaneous observations in Hefei. The results showed that the variation of XCO2 in Shanghai is similar to our results. The daily average of XCO2 in Shanghai is between (411. 87 +/- 1. 07) and (416. 63 +/- 1. 70) ppm, and the value is between (415. 09 +/- 0. 84) and (417. 80 +/- 0. 67) ppm in Hefei in autumn. It is found that XCO2 in Hefei was slightly higher than that in Shanghai during the observation. The results provide the data for tracking carbon sources and sinks of greenhouse gases in the Hefei area.

TI  - Longitudinal Prospective Evaluation of Quality of Life After Axillary Lymph Node Dissection
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Patients often fear axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) because of its associated complications; however, its effect on quality of life (QOL) is not well described. We aimed to evaluate the effect of ALND on QOL over time and to identify predictors of worse QOL. Patients and Methods Breast cancer patients undergoing ALND were enrolled in a prospective lymphedema screening study. Arm volumes were measured and QOL questionnaires completed at baseline, postoperatively, and at 6-month intervals. The upper limb lymphedema-27 questionnaire was used to assess the effect of upper extremity symptoms on QOL in three domains (physical, psychological, and social). Predictors of QOL were identified by univariate and multivariable regression analyses. Results From November 2016 through March 2020, 304 ALND patients were enrolled; 242 patients with at least two measurements and 6 months of follow-up were included. Median age was 48 years, and median follow-up was 1.2 years. The 18-month lymphedema rate was 18%. Overall, QOL scores in all three domains decreased postoperatively and improved over time. On multivariable analysis, after adjusting for baseline scores, symptoms necessitating lymphedema therapy referral (p = 0.006) were associated with worse physical QOL. Younger age (p = 0.005) and lymphedema therapy referral (p = 0.006) were associated with worse psychological QOL. Arm volume was not correlated with QOL. Conclusions QOL scores initially decreased after ALND but improved by 6 months post-surgery. Decreases in QOL were independent of arm volume. Patients with worse QOL more often sought lymphedema therapy, although the effect of therapy on QOL remains unknown.

TI  - Experimental Investigation and Prediction Model of the Loads Exerted by Oblique Internal Solitary Waves on FPSO
T2  - CHINA OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - By using a 30-meter-long wave flume equipped with a double-plate wave maker, a series of depression ISWs were generated in a density stratified two-layer fluid and the forces exerted by oblique internal solitary waves (ISWs) on fixed FPSO model had been measured. According to the laboratory experiments, a numerical flume taken the applicability of KdV, eKdV and MCC ISWs theories in consideration was adopted to study the force components. Based on the experimental data and the force composition, the simplified prediction model was established. It was shown that the horizontal and transversal loads consisted of two parts: the Froude-Krylov force that could be calculated by integrating the dynamic pressure induced by ISW along the FPSO wetted surface, as well as the viscous force that could be obtained by multiplying the friction coefficient C-fx (C-fy), correction factor K-x (K-y) and the integration of particle tangential velocity along the FPSO wetted surface. The vertical load was mainly the vertical Froude-Krylov force. Based on the experimental results, a conclusion can be drawn that the friction coefficient C-f and correction factor K were regressed as a relationship of Reynolds number Re, Keulegan-Carpenter number KC, upper layer depth h(1)/h and ISW accident angle alpha. Moreover, the horizontal friction coefficient C-fx yielded the logarithmic function with Re, and transversal friction coefficient C-fy obeyed the exponent function with Re, while the correction factors K-x and K-y followed power function with KC. The force prediction was also performed based on the regression formulae and pressure integral. The predicted results agreed well with the experimental results. The maximum forces increase linearly with the ISWs amplitude. Besides, the upper layer thickness had an obvious influence on the extreme value of the horizontal and transversal forces.

TI  - Lake Expansion under the Groundwater Contribution in Qaidam Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between groundwater and lakes in Qaidam Basin is often overlooked. Therefore, we employed Landsat satellite images and meteorological data to investigate the causes of lake expansion through model calculation and statistical analysis and then determine groundwater sources through isotope analysis (H-2, H-3, and O-18). In the two study periods of 2003-2011 and 2011-present, temperature, precipitation, and runoff increased at a steady rate, whereas the expansion rate of Tuosu Lake increased from 1.22 km(2)/yearr to 3.38 km(2)/yearr. This significant increase in the rate of lake expansion reflects the substantial contribution of groundwater to lake expansion. The groundwater contribution to the lake includes not only the glacial meltwater that infiltrates the piedmont plain but also other, more isotopically deleted water sources from other basins. It is speculated that the 2003 M-s 6.4 earthquake in the northwest of the Delingha region was a possible mechanism for lake expansion. Earthquakes can enhance crustal permeability and keep fractures open, which promotes groundwater contribution to lakes and in turn causes rapid lake expansion and an increased groundwater level. This study is important for understanding the sources, circulation, and evolution of groundwater in Qaidam Basin.

TI  - Continuous Change Detection and Classification-Spectral Trajectory Breakpoint Recognition for Forest Monitoring
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest is one of the most important surface coverage types. Monitoring its dynamics is of great significance in global ecological environment monitoring and global carbon circulation research. Forest monitoring based on Landsat time-series stacks is a research hotspot, and continuous change detection is a novel approach to real-time change detection. Here, we present an approach, continuous change detection and classification-spectral trajectory breakpoint recognition, running on Google Earth Engine (GEE) for monitoring forest disturbance and forest long-term trends. We used this approach to monitor forest disturbance and the change in forest cover rate from 1987 to 2020 in Nanning City, China. The high-resolution Google Earth images are collected for the validation of forest disturbance. The classification accuracy of forest, non-forest, and water maps by using the optima classification features was 95.16%. For disturbance detection, the accuracy of our map was 86.4%, significantly higher than 60% of the global forest change product. Our approach can successfully generate high-accuracy classification maps at any time and detect the forest disturbance time on a monthly scale, accurately capturing the thinning cycle of plantations, which earlier studies failed to estimate. All the research work is integrated into GEE to promote the use of the approach on a global scale.

TI  - The Dynamic Changes of Lake Issyk-Kul from 1958 to 2020 Based on Multi-Source Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Issyk-Kul is the largest alpine lake in arid Central Asia. In recent years, the lake has become a subject of special concern due to the dramatic fluctuations in its water level. In this study, the long-term continuous changes in the water level of Lake Issyk-Kul were derived from hydro-meteorological stations, CryoSat-2, and ICESat-2 satellites. Changes in area were analyzed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset based on the Google Earth Engine and the variations in water volume were estimated by an empirical formula. The results indicate that the water level of Lake Issyk-Kul fluctuated between 1606.06 m and 1608.32 m during 1958-2020, showing a slight decrease of 0.02 m/year on average. The water level first experienced a significant decreasing trend of 0.05 m/year from 1958 to 1998, and then began to rise rapidly by 0.10 m/year during 1998-2006, followed by a fluctuating decline after 2006. The area of Lake Issyk-Kul exhibited a downward trend before 1998, then a rapid expansion during 1998-2006, and short-term fluctuations in decline thereafter. Meanwhile, changes in water volume of Lake Issyk-Kul followed a similar pattern of variations in water level and area. According to comprehensive analyses, the continuous downward trend of the water level before 1998 was primarily affected by substantial anthropogenic water consumption in the basin. However, since the 21st century, the increases in precipitation and glacier meltwater and the reduced water consumption have collectively facilitated the short-term recovery of Lake Issyk-Kul in water level, area, and water volume.

TI  - Cloudformer: Supplementary Aggregation Feature and Mask-Classification Network for Cloud Detection
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is an important step in the processing of optical satellite remote-sensing data. In recent years, deep learning methods have achieved excellent results in cloud detection tasks. However, most of the current models have difficulties to accurately classify similar objects (e.g., clouds and snow) and to accurately detect clouds that occupy a few pixels in an image. To solve these problems, a cloud-detection framework (Cloudformer) combining CNN and Transformer is being proposed to achieve high-precision cloud detection in optical remote-sensing images. The framework achieves accurate detection of thin and small clouds using a pyramidal structure encoder. It also achieves accurate classification of similar objects using a dual-path decoder structure of CNN and Transformer, reducing the rate of missed detections and false alarms. In addition, since the Transformer model lacks the perception of location information, an asynchronous position-encoding method is being proposed to enhance the position information of the data entering the Transformer module and to optimize the detection results. Cloudformer is experimented on two datasets, AIR-CD and 38-Cloud, and the results show that it has state-of-the-art performance.

TI  - Robust Clutter Suppression and Radial Velocity Estimation for High-Resolution Wide-Swath SAR-GMTI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moving targets are usually smeared and imaged at incorrect positions in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images due to the target motions during the illumination time. Moreover, a moving target will cause multiple artifacts in the reconstructed image since pulse repetition frequency (PRF) operated in high-resolution wide-swath (HRWS) SAR is very low. In order to reliably indicate moving targets, a robust cancellation algorithm is derived in this paper for clutter suppression in multichannel HRWS SAR, which is free by velocity searching and covariance matrix estimation of clutter plus noise. The proposed multilayer channel-cancellation combined with the deramp processing is designed to sequentially suppress the seriously aliased clutter in HRWS SAR. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and robust in tough situations, and have a superior detection ability in weak targets and low-velocity targets. In addition, the radial velocity estimation algorithm combined with the channel cancellation is exploited to relocate moving targets. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated by actual spaceborne SAR data acquired by a coordination experiment with two controllable vehicles.

TI  - The Staring Mode Properties and Performance of Geo-SAR Satellite with Reflector Antenna
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geosynchronous synthetic aperture radar (Geo-SAR) with a short revisit time can obtain wide-area images. This paper advances a new two-dimensional pitch and roll squint controlling (2D-PRSC) method that can make satellites continuously stare at any scene in the whole orbital period. The maximum attitude steering angle is less than +/- 7.6 degrees, and the attitude controlling time can be greatly shortened compared with the yaw steering method. Furthermore, a Geo-SAR staring mode model is illustrated and compared with that of low earth orbital SAR (Leo-SAR). Finally, Geo-SAR's ambiguity property is discussed. The simulation results illuminate that the cross-term ambiguity to signal ratio (CASR) also needs to be considered in addition to the azimuth and range ambiguity to signal ratio (AASR, RASR), and the whole orbital ergodic analysis should be carried out. To ensure that RASR, AASR, and CASR meet the requirement of -20 dB, it is necessary to select an appropriate PRF in the range of a few hundred Hertz.

TI  - Dynamics and Drivers of Water Clarity Derived from Landsat and In-Situ Measurement Data in Hulun Lake from 2010 to 2020
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity (Secchi disk depth, SDD), as a proxy of water transparency, provides important information on the light availability to the lake ecosystem, making it one of the key indicators for evaluating the water ecological environment, particularly in nutrient-rich inland lakes. Hulun Lake, the fifth largest lake in China, has faced severe water quality challenges in the past few decades, e.g., high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen, leading to lake eutrophication. However, under such a serious context, the temporal and spatial dynamics of SDD in Hulun Lake are still unclear. In this paper, we obtained the best model input parameters by using stepwise linear regression models to test field measurements against remote sensing band information, and then developed the SDD satellite algorithm suitable for Hulun Lake by comparing six models (i.e., linear, quadratic, cubic, exponential, power, and logarithmic). The results showed that (1) B3/(B1 + B4) [red/(blue-near-infrared)] was the most sensitive parameter for transparency (R = 0.84) and the exponential model was the most suitable transparency inversion model for Hulun Lake (RMSE = 0.055 m, MAE = 0.003 m), (2) The annual mean SDD of Hulun Lake was higher in summer than in autumn, the summer SDD decreased from 2010 (0.23 m) to 2020 (0.17 m), and the autumn SDD increased from 2010 (0.06 m) to 2020 (0.16 m). The SDD in the littoral zones of Hulun Lake was less than that in the central part; (3) meteorological conditions (i.e., precipitation and wind speed) were highly correlated with the variation of SDD. Cropland expansion was the possible reason for the low SDD at the entrance of Hulun Lake flow. The findings of this study have important implications for the development and implementation of ecological protection and restoration strategies in the Hulun Lake basin.

TI  - A Framework of Generating Land Surface Reflectance of China Early Landsat MSS Images by Visibility Data and Its Evaluation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat time-series dataset is one of the most widely used datasets for land surface research due to its long time-series and Land Surface Reflectance (LSR) product. Though the United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides Landsat LSR products for later Landsat 4-5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), no early Landsat 1-5 Multispectral Scanner System (MSS) LSR product is generated currently, limiting the research traced back to the 1970s. Atmospheric correction is one of the necessary preprocesses for generating LSR products. However, it is challenging for MSS images, not only because the image quality is lower and bands are different compared with the current sensors, but also because of the multiple effects of other preprocesses, such as radiometric calibration. Based on the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum Vector (6SV) model, we propose a novel framework for generating Landsat 1-5 MSS LSR data of China. Ground-based visibility records are introduced to replace the images-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) to effectively generate MSS LSR data of the 1970s. We evaluate the generated MSS LSR data by the cross-validation of the simultaneous observation of MSS and TM sensors in Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 using Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) surface reflectance product as the truth value. The evaluation result shows that the generated MSS LSR data is comparable with the later Landsat TM LSR product, with slightly larger uncertainties. In addition, it shows that the non-atmospheric factors (e.g., the difference of relative spectral responses of TM and MSS, the georegistration errors, the radiometric calibration uncertainty, and image noises) bring larger uncertainties than the atmospheric factors (e.g., the AOD retrieval method by visibility) to the cross-validation results. We apply the MSS LSR data generated by the proposed framework on time series analysis in the regions of interest (ROIs) of the spectral-stable land cover in China for all the MSS sensors. The application demonstrates the potential and promise of the MSS LSR data generated by the proposed framework.

TI  - Spatial patterns and drivers of smallholder oil palm expansion within peat swamp forests of Riau, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Protecting the tropical peat swamp forests in Southeast Asia is critical for addressing global sustainability challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss. However, more than half of these forests have been lost since 1990 due to the rapid expansion of drainage-based agriculture and forestry. Within the oil palm sector, the number of regional smallholder oil palm plantings on peat soils has risen quickly. These activities are challenging to govern and manage, due to their fragmented nature and the numerous farmers involved. It is imperative to understand the spatial distribution and drivers of the smallholder oil palm-related conversion of peat swamp forests. In contrast to existing studies based on farm surveys, we used state-of-art maps of smallholder oil palm plantings, derived from 2019 remote sensing data. Spatial data about socioeconomic and biophysical factors (e.g. mills, roads, water ways, and concessions) was then used to develop logistic regression models to investigate the relative influence of these factors. We show that the spatial patterns of smallholder oil palm plantings are distinct from those of industrial oil palm plantations, revealing the critical roles of roads, especially service roads, residential roads and tracks, in driving smallholder oil palm expansion within peatlands. We found that 90% of smallholder oil palm areas were located within 2 km of roads and 25 km of mills. The mean likelihood of a given land area being converted from peat swamp forests to smallholder oil palm declined rapidly with increasing distance from roads and mills. In addition to roads and mills, land use zones (e.g. the setting of concessions and migration settlements) and other environmental factors (e.g. precipitation and elevation) were identified as important drivers of smallholder oil palm expansion on peatland. Based on these findings, we identify priority regions for the protection of the remaining peat swamp forests in Indonesia and discuss strategies for tackling these sustainability challenges on local and global scales.

TI  - An Overview of the Applications of Earth Observation Satellite Data: Impacts and Future Trends
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - As satellite observation technology develops and the number of Earth observation (EO) satellites increases, satellite observations have become essential to developments in the understanding of the Earth and its environment. However, the current impacts to the remote sensing community of different EO satellite data and possible future trends of EO satellite data applications have not been systematically examined. In this paper, we review the impacts of and future trends in the use of EO satellite data based on an analysis of data from 15 EO satellites whose data are widely used. Articles that reference EO satellite missions included in the Web of Science core collection for 2020 were analyzed using scientometric analysis and meta-analysis. We found the following: (1) the number of publications and citations referencing EO satellites is increasing exponentially; however, the number of articles referencing AVHRR, SPOT, and TerraSAR is tending to decrease; (2) papers related to EO satellites are concentrated in a small number of journals: 43.79% of the articles that were reviewed were published in only 13 journals; and (3) remote sensing impact factor (RSIF), a new impact index, was constructed to measure the impacts of EO satellites and to predict future trends in applications of their data. Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, Gaofen, and WorldView were found to be the most significant current EO satellite missions and MODIS data to have the widest range of applications. Over the next five years (2021-2025), it is expected that Sentinel will become the satellite mission with the greatest influence.

TI  - Soil Salinity Inversion Model of Oasis in Arid Area Based on UAV Multispectral Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization severely restricts the development of global industry and agriculture and affects human beings. In the arid area of Northwest China, oasis saline-alkali land threatens the development of agriculture and food security. This paper develops and optimizes an inversion monitoring model for monitoring the soil salt content using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral remote sensing data. Using the multispectral remote sensing data in three research areas, the soil salt inversion models based on the support vector machine regression (SVR), random forest (RF), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and extreme learning machine (ELM) were constructed. The results show that the four constructed models based on the spectral index can achieve good inversion accuracy, and the red edge band can effectively improve the soil salt inversion accuracy in saline-alkali land with vegetation cover. Based on the obtained results, for bare land, the best model for soil salt inversion is the ELM model, which reaches the determination coefficient (R-v(2)) of 0.707, the root mean square error RMSEv of 0.290, and the performance deviation ratio (RPD) of 1.852 on the test dataset. However, for agricultural land with vegetation cover, the best model for soil salinity inversion using the vegetation index is the BPNN model, which achieves R-v(2) of 0.836, RMSEv of 0.027, and RPD of 2.100 on the test dataset. This study provides technical support for rapid monitoring and inversion of soil salinization and salinization control in irrigation areas.

TI  - Development of the Yearly Mode-1 M<sub>2</sub> Internal Tide Model in 2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The yearly mode-1 M-2 internal tide model in 2019 is constructed using sea surface height measurements made by six concurrent satellite altimetry missions: Jason-3, Sentinel-3A, Sentinel-3B, CryoSat-2, Haiyang-2A, and SARAL/AltiKa. The model is developed following a three-step procedure consisting of two rounds of plane wave analysis with a spatial bandpass filter in between. Prior mesoscale correction is made on the altimeter data using AVISO gridded mesoscale fields. The model is labeled Y2019, because it represents the 1-yr-coherent internal tide field in 2019. In contrast, the model developed using altimeter data from 1992 to 2017 is labeled MY25, because it represents the multiyear-coherent internal tide field in 25 years. Thanks to the new mapping technique, model errors in Y2019 are as low as those in MY25. Evaluation using independent altimeter data confirms that Y2019 reduces slightly less variance (similar to 6%) thanMY25. Further analysis reveals that the altimeter data from five missions (without Jason-3) can yield an internal tide model of almost the same quality. Comparing Y2019 and MY25 shows that mode-1 M-2 internal tides are subject to significant interannual variability in both amplitude and phase, and their interannual variations are a function of location. Along southward internal tides from Amukta Pass, the energy flux in Y2019 is 2 times larger and the phase speed is about 1.1% faster. This mapping technique has been applied successfully to 2017 and 2018. This work demonstrates that yearly internal tides can be observed by concurrent altimetry missions and their interannual variations can be determined.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This work is motivated to study the interannual variations of internal tides using observation-based yearly internal tide models from satellite altimetry. Previous satellite observations of internal tides are usually based on 25 years of altimeter data from 1993 to 2017. The yearly subsetted altimeter data are short, so that the resultant yearly models are overwhelmed by noise. A new mapping technique is developed and demonstrated in this paper. It paves a path to study the interannual and decadal variations of internal tides on a global scale and monitor the global ocean changes by tracking long-range internal tides.

TI  - Estimation of Aboveground Vegetation Water Storage in Natural Forests in Jiuzhaigou National Nature Reserve of China Using Machine Learning and the Combination of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground vegetation water storage (AVWS) is a fundamental ecological parameter of terrestrial ecosystems which participates in plant metabolism, nutrient and sugar transport, and maintains the integrity of the hydraulic system of the plant. The Jiuzhaigou National Nature Reserve (JNNR) is located in the Eastern Tibet Plateau and it is very sensitive to climate change. However, a regional estimate of the AVWS based on observations is still lacking in the JNNR and improving the model accuracy in such mountainous areas is challenging. Therefore, in this study, we combined the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data to estimate AVWS using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) with the linkage of 54 field observations in the JNNR. The results showed that AVWS varied among different forest types. The coniferous forests had the highest AVWS (212.29 +/- 84.43 Mg ha(-1)), followed by mixed forests (166.29 +/- 72.73 Mg ha(-1)) and broadleaf forests (142.60 +/- 46.36 Mg ha(-1)). The average AVWS was 171.2 Mg ha(-1). Regardless of the modelling approaches, both Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 successfully estimated AVWS separately. Prediction accuracy of AVWS was improved by combining Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images. Among the three machine learning approaches, the XGBoost model performed best with a model efficiency of 0.57 and root mean square error of 48 Mg ha(-1). Predicted AVWS using XGBoost showed a strong spatial pattern of across the study area. The total AVWS was 5.24 x 10(6) Mg with 67.2% coming from conifer forests. The results highlight the potential of improving the accuracy of AVWS estimation by integrating different optical images and using machine learning approaches in mountainous areas.

TI  - Estimation of the Urban Heat Island Effect in a Reformed Urban District: A Scenario-Based Study in Hong Kong
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI), a phenomenon in which land surface temperatures (LSTs) in an urban area are notably higher than that in the surrounding rural area, has made the living environment thermally uncomfortable, endangered public health, and increased the energy consumption on indoor air cooling. To develop a liveable and sustainable city, it is crucial to provide an accurate estimation of the UHI effect for urban planners when an area is transformed from bare lands to a high density of buildings. With this objective, the study develops multivariate spatial regression models based on LSTs retrieved from Landsat-8 thermal images to estimate the distribution of urban heat magnitudes (i.e., UHMs, relative temperatures referenced to rural temperature), by considering four types of causative factors that include land use and land cover, urban morphology, heat source, and local climate zones. Partial correlation analysis is performed to determine explainable variables and R-2 is used to evaluate the models. Based on the constructed models and a master plan of buildings in Kowloon East, Hong Kong, the future UHM distributions are forecasted on four representative days in different seasons. Results show that the UHI effect will be mitigated significantly when the new buildings are built, suggesting appropriate urban planning regarding the urban thermal environment. We found that the considered factors can largely explain the daytime UHIs in both the built-up areas and land-cover areas. The proposed method can also be used to optimize the urban design for creating a more thermo-friendly urban environment.

TI  - Machine-Learning Based Analysis of Liquid Water Path Adjustments to Aerosol Perturbations in Marine Boundary Layer Clouds Using Satellite Observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in marine boundary layer cloud (MBLC) radiative properties in response to aerosol perturbations are largely responsible for uncertainties in future climate predictions. In particular, the relationship between the cloud droplet number concentration (N-d, a proxy for aerosol) and the cloud liquid water path (LWP) remains challenging to quantify from observations. In this study, satellite observations from multiple polar-orbiting platforms for 2006-2011 are used in combination with atmospheric reanalysis data in a regional machine learning model to predict changes in LWP in MBLCs in the Southeast Atlantic. The impact of predictor variables on the model output is analysed using Shapley values as a technique of explainable machine learning. Within the machine learning model, precipitation fraction, cloud top height, and N-d are identified as important cloud state predictors for LWP, with dynamical proxies and sea surface temperature (SST) being the most important environmental predictors. A positive nonlinear relationship between LWP and N-d is found, with a weaker sensitivity at high cloud droplet concentrations. This relationship is found to be dependent on other predictors in the model: N-d-LWP sensitivity is higher in precipitating clouds and decreases with increasing SSTs.

TI  - Interferometric SAR Observation of Permafrost Status in the Northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau by ALOS, ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 between 2007 and 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With global warming, permafrost is undergoing degradation, which may cause thawing subsidence, collapse, and emission of greenhouse gases preserved in previously frozen permafrost, change the local hydrology and ecology system, and threaten infrastructure and indigenous communities. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is the world's largest permafrost region in the middle and low latitudes. Permafrost status monitoring in the QTP is of great significance to global change and local economic development. In this study, we used 66 scenes of ALOS data (2007-2009), 73 scenes of ALOS-2 data (2015-2020) and 284 scenes of Sentinel-1 data (2017-2021) to evaluate the spatial and temporal permafrost deformation over the 83,000 km(2) in the northern QTP, passing through the Tuotuohe, Beiluhe, Wudaoliang and Xidatan regions. We use the SBAS-InSAR method and present a coherence weighted least squares estimator without any hypothetical model to calculate long-term deformation velocity (LTDV) and maximum seasonal deformation (MSD) without any prior knowledge. Analysis of the ALOS results shows that the LTDV ranged from -20 to +20 mm/year during 2007-2009. For the ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 results, the LTDV ranged from -30 to 30 mm/year during 2015-2021. Further study shows that the expansion areas of permafrost subsidence are concentrated on braided stream plains and thermokarst lakes. In these areas, due to glacial erosion, surface runoff and river alluvium, the contents of water and ground ice are sufficient, which could accelerate permafrost subsidence. In addition, by analyzing LTDV and MSD for the different periods, we found that the L-band ALOS-2 is more sensitive to the thermal collapse of permafrost than the C-band sensor and the detected collapse areas (LTDV < -10 mm/year) are consistent with the GF-1/2 thermal collapse dataset. This research indicates that the InSAR technique could be crucial for monitoring the evolution of permafrost and freeze-thaw disasters.

TI  - Uses of Sentinel-1 and -2 Images in Heritage Management: A Case Study from Lednica Landscape Park (Poland)
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to demonstrate the use of Sentinel images to develop strategies for heritage protection and management in rural landscapes that are currently undergoing dynamic transformations. Construction works are causing rapid and extensive land use changes that threaten archaeological structures. Moreover, the modernisation of farming practices may also negatively affect the efficiency of archaeological prospection. The rapidity of those processes requires the application of relevant tools to monitor changes and highlight negative tendencies in areas surrounding archaeological sites. High frequency of Sentinel-1 and -2's acquisition may offer an immediate insight into current tendencies. Radar and optical data obtained from those satellites between 2016 and 2020 were analysed to identify trends in building development and land use/cover changes in Lednica Landscape Park. Preliminary results indicate a considerable potential of spectral analysis based on Sentinel-2 to monitor changes related to building development, as well as for the precise planning of a field survey. Sentinel-1 proved more problematic due to a range of factors related to data characteristics and processing. Using those results, we will discuss the potential and limitations of the proposed methodology and data.

TI  - An inventory of Norway's glaciers and ice-marginal lakes from 2018-19 Sentinel-2 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We used Sentinel-2 satellite imagery at 10 m resolution to map the extent of Norway's glaciers and ice-marginal lakes over 2018-19. We applied a standardized semi-automated band ratio method to derive glacier outlines and ice-marginal lakes. To optimise the results, we manually edited the ice-lake interfaces, debris, snow and parts of the glaciers situated under shadow. We compared our Sentinel-2 derived outlines with very high-resolution aerial orthophotos and Pleiades satellite orthoimages. Glaciers larger than 0.3 km(2) have area differences within 7%, whereas values are larger for smaller glaciers. The orthophotos and orthoimages provide more details and a higher mapping accuracy for individual glaciers, but require manual digitisation, have smaller spatial and temporal coverage and can have adverse snow conditions. We found a total glacier area of 2328 +/- 70 km(2) of which the ten largest glaciers accounted for 52%. The glacier area decreased 15% since the previous inventory (Landsat data from 1999 to 2006), the reduction being largest in northern Norway (22%) compared to southern Norway (10%). We detected more than 2000 previously undetected smaller glaciers and ice patches (covering 37 km(2)) and 360 new ice-marginal lakes.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the possibility of high resolution mapping of PM2.5 concentration over Tehran city using high resolution satellite AOD (MAIAC) retrievals. For this purpose, a framework including three main stages, data preprocessing; regression modeling; and model deployment was proposed. The output of the framework was a machine learning model trained to predict PM2.5 from MAIAC AOD retrievals and meteorological data. The results of model testing revealed the efficiency and capability of the developed framework for high resolution mapping of PM2.5, which was not realized in former investigations performed over the city. Thus, this study, for the first time, realized daily, 1 km resolution mapping of PM2.5 in Tehran with R2 around 0.74 and RMSE better than 9.0 m3lg. (c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The rice yield gap estimation using integrated system approaches: a case study-Guilan province, Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, food security is a major human concern. Therefore, research on crop yield and yield gap has been seriously increasing in recent years. For this purpose, the yield gap of rice fields in Guilan province was investigated using the ORYZA2000 model and integrated GIS-RS approaches. First, to estimate the coefficients of the ORYZA2000 model, an experimental survey was performed in the Rice Research Institute of Iran in the 2016 and 2017 years. At first, with the help of the model, the potential yield of rice in Guilan province was predicted. SDVIs (Satellite imagery-derived vegetation indices) were extracted from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellite images. SDVIs were evaluated to select the most proper one for generating the actual yield raster. Finally, the map of the yield gap was prepared from the differences between potential yield and actual yield rasters. The result showed that the NRMSE in the simulation of grain yield and aboveground biomass was less than 8%. The yield gap in rice cultivated farms of Guilan province during the two years of the experiment was estimated to be between 37 and 3090 kg ha(-1). The results of this study can provide good basic information for optimizing rice yield.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes the use of D. trunculus as a bioindicator of microplastic (MPs) pollution due to beach urbanization related to the development of the Taghazout Bay tourist resort in Morocco. In six sites located on the coast, MPs densities ranged from 1.75 to 5.93 items per gram of D. trunculus wet weight. MPs contamination was significantly influenced spatiotemporally by the urbanization degree in the area. The shapes found were fibers (90.5%) and fragments (9.5%). The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis reported two polymers: polyethylene (65%) and polypropylene (35%). MPs colors were dark and light, with a predominance of light blue (23.8%). The species ingested different sizes of MPs, mainly the 0.1 and 0.5 mm fractions. Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM/EDX) revealed weathered MPs with chemical elements adhered to their surface (Cu, Fe, Mg, S, Cl, etc.). The results of this study recommend the use of D. trunculus as a new bioindicator of MPs pollution following an urban change in the coastal scenery. Also, a sustainable coastal management must be implemented in the study area.

TI  - Quantifying the variability in water use efficiency from the canopy to ecosystem scale across main croplands
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Current, how to use limited water resources efficiently and improve agricultural water use efficiency, has become one of the greatest challenges for global food security. In this study, multiple site-years of carbon and water flux data across the major crops including maize, winter wheat and soybean, were used to quantify the variability in canopy-scale transpiration (T), ecosystem-scale evapotranspiration (ET) as well as the associated water use efficiencies (WUET and WUEET). On the basis of ET partitioning, the results indicated that the transpiration ratio-T/ET as well as T and ET exhibited an obvious single-peak seasonal pattern across the typical croplands. However, at the early and late growing stages, there existed large discrepancies in T and ET owing to low vegetation coverage, while T and ET were very close during the peak period. Among them, maize exhibited the largest T/ET by 0.50 +/- 0.12, followed by soybean of 0.43 +/- 0.08 and winter wheat of 0.38 +/- 0.09, respectively. Furthermore, the coupling relationships between gross primary productivity (GPP) and water fluxes including T and ET changed from linear to nonlinear. The study also found that the variability in WUET and WUEET were not consistent. Specifically, WUEET showed distinct seasonal characteristic whereas WUET kept constant as a plateau almost throughout the growth period, which reflected the inherent physiological property controlled by plant stomata at the canopy scale. Among these crops, maize exhibited the largest WUET and WUEET (5.30 +/- 0.89 and 2.48 +/- 1.14 g C kg(-1) H2O), followed by winter wheat (4.97 +/- 1.52 and 2.35 +/- 0.64 g C kg(-1) H2O) and soybean (4.88 +/- 1.59 and 1.89 +/- 0.99 g C kg(-1) H2O), respectively.

TI  - Camera traps enable the estimation of herbaceous aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in an African savanna at high temporal resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the drivers of aboveground net primary production (ANPP), a key ecosystem process, is an important goal of ecosystem ecology. However, accurate estimation of ANPP across larger areas remains challenging, especially for savanna ecosystems that are characterized by large spatiotemporal heterogeneity in ANPP. Satellite remote sensing methods are frequently used to estimate productivity at the landscape scale but generally lack the spatial and temporal resolution to capture the determinants of productivity variation. Here, we developed and tested methods for estimating herbaceous productivity as an alternative to labour-intensive repeated biomass clipping and caging of small plots. We compared measures of three spectral greenness indices, normalized difference vegetation index derived from Sentinel-2 (NDVIs) and a handheld radiometer (NDVIg), and green chromatic coordinate derived from digital repeat cameras (GCC) and tested their relationship to biweekly field-measured herbaceous ANPP using movable exclosures. We found that a satellite-based model including average NDVIs and its rate of change (Delta NDVIs) over the biweekly productivity measurement interval predicted herbaceous ANPP reasonably well (Jackknife R-2 = 0.26). However, the predictive accuracy doubled (Jackknife R-2 = 0.52) when including the sum of day to day increases in camera trap-derived vegetation greenness (tGCC). This result can be considered promising, given the current lack of productivity estimation methods at comparable spatiotemporal resolution. We furthermore found that the fine (daily) temporal resolution of GCC time series captured fast vegetation responses to rainfall events that were missed when using a coarser temporal resolution (>2 days). These findings demonstrate the importance of measuring at a fine temporal resolution for predicting herbaceous ANPP in savanna ecosystems. We conclude that camera traps are promising in offering a reliable and cost-effective method to estimate productivity in savannas and contribute to a better understanding of ecosystem functioning and its drivers.

TI  - Replication and transmission features of two experimental vaccine candidates against bovine tuberculosis subcutaneously administrated in a murine model
T2  - TUBERCULOSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cattle vaccination is an attractive approach in compliance with control and eradication programs against Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB). Today, there is no anti bTB vaccine licensed. Two vaccine candidates, Mb Delta mce2 and Mb Delta mce2-phoP previously designed were evaluated in BALB/c mice, including the parental M. bovis NCTC10772 and a M. bovis hypervirulent Mb04-303 strains as controls. Sentinel mice (non-inoculated) cohoused with subcutaneous inoculated mice. Persistence, visible tuberculosis lesions (VTL) in lungs and spleens and bacillary load were investigated subcutaneously delivered at 60 and 90 days after inoculation (dpi) as well as their potential transmission to naive mice.While a 100% survival was observed at 90 dpi without VTL in all groups, transmission was not evidenced in the sentinels mice. Vaccine candidates and control strains were isolated from the spleen of all inoculated mice, while Mb04-303 was isolated from the lungs of one inoculated mouse. Vaccine candidate's attenuation considering survival, lung bacillary load and VTL was confirmed, administrated by the subcutaneous route. Future experiments are necessary to demonstrate whether the persistence of both mutants in the spleen, with low CFU, remains over time to increase the potential increasing risk of dissemination to organs and subsequent transmission to other animals by airborne or other routes.

TI  - Quantifying urban, industrial, and background changes in NO<sub>2</sub> during the COVID-19 lockdown period based on TROPOMI satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 lockdown had a large impact on anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants and particularly on nitrogen dioxide (NO2). While the overall NO2 decline over some large cities is well-established, understanding the details remains a challenge since multiple source categories contribute. In this study, a new method of isolation of three components (background NO2, NO2 from urban sources, and NO2 from industrial point sources) is applied to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on each of them. The approach is based on fitting satellite data by a statistical model with empirical plume dispersion functions driven by a meteorological reanalysis. Population density and surface elevation data as well as coordinates of industrial sources were used in the analysis. The tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) values measured by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor over 261 urban areas for the period from 16 March to 15 June 2020 were compared with the average VCD values for the same period in 2018 and 2019. While the background NO2 component remained almost unchanged, the urban NO2 component declined by -18 % to -28 % over most regions. India, South America, and a part of Europe (particularly, Italy, France, and Spain) demonstrated a -40 % to -50 % urban emission decline. In contrast, the decline over urban areas in China, where the lockdown was over during the analysed period, was, on average, only -4.4 +/- 8 %. Emissions from large industrial sources in the analysed urban areas varied greatly from region to region from -4.8 +/- 6 % for China to -40 +/- 10 % for India. Estimated changes in urban emissions are correlated with changes in Google mobility data (the correlation coefficient is 0.62) confirming that changes in traffic were one of the key elements in the decline in urban NO2 emissions. No correlation was found between changes in background NO2 and Google mobility data. On the global scale, the background and urban components were remarkably stable in 2018, 2019, and 2021, with averages of all analysed areas all being within +/- 2.5 % and suggesting that there were no substantial drifts or shifts in TROPOMI data. The 2020 data are clearly an outlier: in 2020, the mean background component for all analysed areas (without China) was -6.0 % +/- 1.2 % and the mean urban component was -26.7 +/- 2.6 % or 20 sigma below the baseline level from the other years.

TI  - The burning island: Spatiotemporal patterns of fire occurrence in Madagascar
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic fire use is widespread across Madagascar and threatens the island's unprecedented endemic biodiversity. The vast majority (96%) of lemur species are already threatened with extinction, and Madagascar has already lost more than 44% of its forests. Previous conservation assessments have noted the role of fire in the rampant deforestation and habitat degradation across Madagascar, but published, quantified data on fire use across the island are incredibly limited. Here, we present the first quantification of spatiotemporal patterns in fire occurrence across Madagascar using VIIRS satellite fire detection data. We assess which regions of Madagascar have the most prevalent fire use, how fire use is changing over time, and what this means for Madagascar's remaining forest ecosystems. An average of 356,189 fires were detected every year in Madagascar from 2012-2019, averaging 0.604 fires/km(2). Fire use was near-ubiquitous across the island, but was most prevalent in the western dry deciduous forests and succulent woodlands ecoregions. Fire frequency in the eastern lowlands was highest around the remaining humid rainforest, and fire frequency was increasing over time around much of the remaining humid and dry forest. We found that 18.6% of all remaining forest was within 500 m of a fire within a single year, and 39.3% was within 1 km. More than half of remaining forest was within 1 km of a fire in a single year in the dry deciduous forests, succulent woodlands, and mangroves ecoregions. However, fire frequency within national park protected areas was, on average, 65% lower than their surroundings. Only 7.1% of national park forest was within 500 m of a fire within one year, and 17.1% was within 1 km, suggesting that national parks are effective at reducing fire frequency in Madagascar's tropical forests.

TI  - Testing the utility of the resampled nSight-2 spectral configurations in discriminating wetland plant species using Random Forest classifier
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral sensors have the potential of discerning subtle differences among wetland plant species. Assessment of wetland plant species is critical for the effective management of wetland ecosystems. We evaluated the utility of the forthcoming nSight-2 hyperspectral sensor in wetland plant species differentiation, by testing the utility of its spectral settings and compared its performance to EnMap and WorldView-2 sensors in classifying four dominant wetland plant species in Verloren Vallei Nature Reserve, South Africa. For this purpose, we used the Random Forest classifier and field spectrometer data of various wetland plant species. The results showed that the spectral settings of nSight-2, EnMap, and WorldView-2 yielded high overall accuracies of 84.09%, 81.82% and 77.77%, respectively. The best accuracies were achieved with spectral bands sampled across the visible, red-edge and near-infrared spectral regions. Overall, the findings demonstrate the potential of the upcoming hyperspectral satellite missions for wetland ecosystems monitoring and management.

TI  - A convolutional neural network for spatial downscaling of satellite-based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIFnet)
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the sum of leaf photosynthesis and represents a crucial component of the global carbon cycle. Space-borne estimates of GPP typically rely on observable quantities that co-vary with GPP such as vegetation indices using reflectance measurements (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, near-infrared reflectance of terrestrial vegetation, NIRv, and kernel normalized difference vegetation index, kNDVI). Recent work has also utilized measurements of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) as a proxy for GPP. However, these SIF measurements are typically coarse resolution, while many processes influencing GPP occur at fine spatial scales. Here, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN), named SIFnet, that increases the resolution of SIF from the TRO-POspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board of the satellite Sentinel-5P by a factor of 10 to a spatial resolution of 500 m. SIFnet utilizes coarse SIF observations together with high-resolution auxiliary data. The auxiliary data used here may carry information related to GPP and SIF. We use training data from non-US regions between April 2018 until March 2021 and evaluate our CNN over the conterminous United States (CONUS). We show that SIFnet is able to increase the resolution of TROPOMI SIF by a factor of 10 with a r(2) and RMSE metrics of 0.92 and 0.17 mW M-2 sr(-1) nm(-1), respectively. We further compare SIFnet against a recently developed downscaling approach and evaluate both methods against independent SIF measurements from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 and 3 (together OCO-2/3). SIFnet performs systematically better than the downscaling approach (r = 0.78 for SIFnet, r = 0.72 for downscaling), indicating that it is picking up on key features related to SIF and GPP. Examination of the feature importance in the neural network indicates a few key parameters and the spatial regions in which these parameters matter. Namely, the CNN finds low-resolution SIF data to be the most significant parameter with the NIR v vegetation index as the second most important parameter. NIR v consistently outperforms the recently proposed kNDVI vegetation index. Advantages and limitations of SIFnet are investigated and presented through a series of case studies across the United States. SIFnet represents a robust method to infer continuous, high-spatial-resolution SIF data.

TI  - National rates and disparities in childhood vaccination and vaccine-preventable disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: English sentinel network retrospective database study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To describe rates and variation in uptake of pneumococcal and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines in children and associated change in vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) across the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods Retrospective database study of all children aged <19 registered with a general practice in the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre English national sentinel surveillance network between 2 November 2015 and 18 July 2021.Results Coverage of booster dose of pneumococcal vaccine decreased from 94.5% (95% CI 94.3% to 94.7%) at its height on International Organization for Standardization (ISO) week 47 (2020) to 93.6% (95% CI 93.4% to 93.8%) by the end of the study. Coverage of second dose of MMR decreased from 85.0% (95% CI 84.7% to 85.3%) at its height on ISO week 37 (2020) to 84.1% (95% CI 83.8% to 84.4%) by the end of the study. The break point in trends for MMR was at ISO week 34 (2020) (95% CI weeks 32-37 (2020)), while for pneumococcal vaccine the break point was later at ISO week 3 (2021) (95% CI week 53 (2020) to week 8 (2021)). Vaccination coverage for children of white ethnicity was less likely to decrease than other ethnicities. Rates of consultation for VPDs fell and remained low since August 2020.Conclusion Childhood vaccination rates started to fall ahead of the onset of the second wave; this fall is accentuating ethnic, socioeconomic and geographical disparities in vaccine uptake and risks widening health disparities. Social distancing and school closures may have contributed to lower rates of associated VPDs, but there may be increased risk as these measures are removed.

TI  - Generating large-scale sea ice motion from Sentinel-1 and the RADARSAT Constellation Mission using the Environment and Climate Change Canada automated sea ice tracking system
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - As Arctic sea ice extent continues to decline, remote sensing observations are becoming even more vital for the monitoring and understanding of sea ice. Recently, the sea ice community has entered a new era of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites operating at C-band with the launch of Sentinel-1A in 2014 and Sentinel-1B (S1) in 2016 and the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) in 2019. These missions represent five spaceborne SAR sensors that together routinely cover the pan-Arctic sea ice domain. Here, we describe, apply, and validate the Environment and Climate Change Canada automated sea ice tracking system (ECCC-ASITS) that routinely generates large-scale sea ice motion (SIM) over the pan-Arctic domain using SAR images from S1 and RCM. We applied the ECCC-ASITS to the incoming image streams of S1 and RCM from March 2020 to October 2021 using a total of 135 471 SAR images and generated new SIM datasets (7 d 25 km and 3 d 6.25 km) by combining the image stream outputs of S1 and RCM (S1 + RCM). Results indicate that S1 + RCM SIM provides more coverage in the Hudson Bay, Davis Strait, Beaufort Sea, Bering Sea, and directly over the North Pole compared to SIM from S1 alone. Based on the resolvable S1 + RCM SIM grid cells, the 7 d 25 km spatiotemporal scale is able to provide the most complete picture of SIM across the pan-Arctic from SAR imagery alone, but considerable spatiotemporal coverage is also available from 3 d 6.25 SIM products. S1 + RCM SIM is resolved within the narrow channels and inlets of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, filling a major gap from coarser-resolution sensors. Validating the ECCC-ASITS using S1 and RCM imagery against buoys indicates a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.78 km for dry ice conditions and 3.43 km for melt season conditions. Higher speeds are more apparent with S1 + RCM SIM as comparison with the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) SIM product and the Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) SIM product indicated an RMSE of u=4.6 km d(-1) and v=4.7 km d(-1) for the NSIDC and u=3.9 km d(-1) and v=3.9 km d(-1) for OSI SAF. Overall, our results demonstrate the robustness of the ECCC-ASITS for routinely generating large-scale SIM entirely from SAR imagery across the pan-Arctic domain.

TI  - Comprehensive evaluation of multisource aerosol optical depth gridded products over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is one of the most crucial parameters for reflecting aerosol characteristics. This study systematically evaluated daily AOD from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily gridded products over China from 2012 to 2019. Both the VIIRS aerosol Deep Blue (DB) and MODIS Deep Blue algorithm products had significant missing values in areas, for example, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Xinjiang, and Northeast China. High AODs were mainly concentrated in areas closely related to economic development and population density geomorphology factors, such as the North China Plain, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Sichuan Basin. Notably, VIIRS products captured higher AOD values in desert regions than the other products. In overall accuracy, MODIS DB product was characterized by a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.82, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.21, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.14, and VIIRS (RMSE = 0.23 and MAE = 0.15) and MERRA-2 (RMSE = 0.27 and MAE = 0.17) had a slightly larger bias. MODIS performed best, with 55% of matched samples falling within the expected error (within EE), higher than the 53% of VIIRS. However, the MERRA-2 product performed worst, with only 48% of matched samples falling within the EE. Based on the accuracy comparison of the same number of matched samples, MODIS DB product still performed best, with R = 0.88, RMSE = 0.17, MAE = 011 and 64% of matched samples falling within the EE. Moreover, snow cover and the complex surface features in South-West areas may limit the performance of DB algorithm products, but MODIS DB products are available in most other areas of China. Land cover type applicability analysis demonstrated that DB algorithm products performed well in low vegetation cover and impervious surface types. In the analysis of elevation applicability, the MERRA-2 product has obviously higher robustness at high elevations than the MODIS and VIIRS products. These evaluation results are expected to guide users of aerosol products in China.

TI  - Is river-course change associated with the crustal movement ?
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an integrated study on the effects of human activity, climate change and crustal movement on the changes of the middle reaches of the Tarim River in China. Remote sensing images and rainfall data from 38 stations from 1970 to 2021 were used for the research. The precise point positioning (PPP) approach was applied to ascertain the crustal movement of the study area using 256 Global Positioning System (GPS) station data of the recent 20 years. The results show that in the past 50 years the studied reaches of the river has moved north at maximum 2940 m or 57.9 m on average, and human activity may have played a dominant role in this change though extreme events of climate may have also taken a part in it. However, before the Anthropocene, its northeast migration is likely associated with crustal movement as the basin bottom inclines to northeast.

TI  - Improving land surface temperature prediction using spatiotemporal factors through a genetic-based selection procedure (Case Study: Tehran, Iran)
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, land surface temperature (LST) has been considered as an important satellite product for thermal monitoring of the environment. Despite the great development of LST retrieval technology from satellite data, especially from Landsat images, up-to-date thermal information cannot always be obtained. Predicting LST values for future times is a pressing issues to understand and mitigate the effects of climate change, especially in urban environments. This highlights the importance of LST forecasting methods. Accordingly, in this study a combination of Genetic Algorithm and Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) is presented to predict LST based on nine selected spatiotemporal factors affecting LST in the urban areas. The genetic algorithm is used to determine weights of different factors in the LST prediction with respect to the GTWR as the regression model. Then, these weights are used to obtain predicted LST values for experimental points. Landsat-derived LST bands is used to train the genetic algorithm and extract the factors' weights. Tehran city in the summer is selected as the case study in our work. Landsat LST data from 2013 to 2016 are used for training. To assess the performance of our scheme, we apply it in 2017. We find a correlation coefficient of 0.99 and a root-meansquare error of 0.5 K with respect to the Landsat data. The results of this study also indicate that LST prediction using weighted factors is superior to using all factors with equal contributions. (c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Photosynthetic trends in India derived from remote sensing measurements during 2000-2019: vegetation dynamics and key climate drivers
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant changes in the photosynthesis of terrestrial vegetation are observed in recent decades due to climate variability, land use and land cover changes, frequent disasters and anthropogenic forcing, but this situation in the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Here, therefore, we estimate the long-term changes in photosynthesis and its key climate drivers in India. The gross photosynthetic activity peaks (FPAR (mean) = 0.57) in post-monsoon (September, October and November) due to high soil moisture (87.26 kg/m(2)), good precipitation (5.2 mm/day) and optimum temperature (21.46 degrees C) conditions, whereas it is smallest (FPAR (mean) = 0.4) in summer (March, April and May) due to very high temperature (27.37 degrees C) and lower soil moisture (55.45 kg/m(2)). The trend in FPAR over 2000-2019 reveals enhanced photosynthetic activity in India. In the northwest, both soil moisture and temperature have a positive influence on greening (i.e. moisture induced greening). Conversely, the unfavourable soil moisture and temperature conditions dominate in the peninsular region to trigger browning there (i.e. warming induced moisture stress). Our analyses suggest that the photosynthetic trend is primarily controlled by trend in the soil moisture (44.31%) and air temperature (32.54%). The warming induced moisture stress can be a serious threat in the future to drive browning in more areas. Extreme events such as droughts, landslides and fires are expected to increase in the hilly regions such as the northeast due to browning. Furthermore, as food production and forest resources influence the economy of a country like India, management and conservation of greenery are inevitable for a sustainable ecosystem.

M3  - Article
AB  - LULC maps are important thematic maps that provide a baseline for monitoring, assessing, and planning activities. This study incorporates spatio-temporal land use/ land cover (LULC) monitoring (1991-2021) and urban growth modeling (2021-2041) of Islamabad, Pakistan to deduce the changes in various LULC classes in the past and the future by incorporating realistic influential thematic layers and Artificial Neural Network-Cellular Automata (ANN-CA) machine learning algorithms. Three decades of Landsat satellite imagery were used to classify LULC maps using a random forest algorithm with high Kappa indexes ranging from 0.93 to 0.97. Simulations for 2011 and 2021 were done for well-calibration of the model with Kappa (> 0.85) and spatial similarity (> 75%) using the MOLUSCE plugin in QGIS software. Future predictions were done for the years 2031 and 2041 to analyze and study the future urban growth patterns. The satellite-based LULC maps during 1991-2021 exhibited a 142.4 km(2) increase in net urban growth. This had detrimental effects on other classes: net decrease of forests by 38.4 km(2) and waterbodies by 2.9 km2. The projected increase of urban areas in 2021-2041 will be 58.2 km(2). Visual urban sprawl assessment on LULC maps was done to highlight the type of sprawls. Overall, it was sensed that the city's urbanization has been unplanned and erratic; leading to dire consequences on the environmental and urban systems. Therefore, the study necessitates better monitoring and better planning of urbanization by enforcing policies and necessary measures. (C) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Detection, characterization, and analysis of land subsidence in Nairobi using InSAR
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nairobi, Kenya's capital city, is one of the fastest-growing cities on the continent. The rapid expansion of human activities has resulted in the overexploitation of natural resources, such as water. In the past, Nairobi had been identified as a vulnerable area to environmental hazards, such as land subsidence. Due to the lack of a functioning deformation-monitoring system in Kenya, the subsidence in Nairobi has yet to be empirically quantified. In this paper, we report the results of the first InSAR-based spatial assessment of land subsidence in Nairobi. Our analysis indicates both localized and regionalized subsidence in several locations in the west and north west of Nairobi. The largest deforming unit in Nairobi's western part is subsiding at approximately 62 mm/yr. Land subsidence can be attributed to groundwater overexploitation because it coincides with regions with the highest decline in groundwater levels. However, subsidence can also be attributed to consolidation associated with rapid urbanization in other areas such as east of Nairobi. This evaluation corroborates previous hydrogeological investigations which indicated that Nairobi was at risk of subsidence, contributing to flooding in some residential areas. The findings will help guide future decision-making in several agencies as well as provide an effective tool for planning mitigation measures to prevent further subsidence. A few of these include regulating borehole drilling, planning of roads and buildings, and locating groundwater observation wells. In addition, the observed significant land subsidence stresses the need for an updated geodetic reference system. Since Nairobi plays a significant role in the economy of Kenya, the effects of subsidence may be devastating and it is imperative that steps are taken to minimize their impact.

TI  - Retrieving daytime distributions of O, H, OH, HO<sub>2</sub>, and chemical heating rate in the mesopause region from satellite observations of ozone and OH* volume emission: The evaluation of the importance of the reaction H + O<sub>3</sub> ? O<sub>2</sub> + OH in the ozone balance
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on data from the SABER (Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry) instrument onboard the TIMED (Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics) satellite observations 2003-2015, we retrieved atomic oxygen and atomic hydrogen distributions in the mesopause region (-77 km-100 km) for daytime conditions taking into account the reaction of the ozone with atomic hydrogen in the ozone balance equation (OBE). Subsequently we calculated daytime distributions of OH, HO2, and the corresponding total chemical heating rate (CHR) from seven exothermic chemical reactions. The novelty of our approach is that we consider, to the best of our knowledge, the reaction H + O-3 -> O-2 + OH in the daytime OBE for the retrieving procedure for the first time. It is shown that neglecting this reaction has little effect on H distributions, but it leads to O and CHR underestimations (up to -35- 40%) and HO2 and OH overestimations (up to -50-85%).

TI  - Relative radiometric normalization for mosaicking IRS CartoSat-2 panchromatic images using genetic algorithm
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban features can be analysed using high-resolution satellite images. Satellites procure panchromatic images at a spatial resolution even better than 1 m. However, it cannot cover the large area of a city in one scene. Therefore, satellite images from different dates and times must be mosaicked to study the urban region as a whole. Efficient and seamless mosaicking requires relative radiometric normalization (RRN), which generally is an iterative process. In this paper, an approach using the genetic algorithm has been developed for normalization in a single step. The algorithm has been tested on Jaipur city in India. Results produced for the mosaic using genetic algorithm provide visually seamless mosaic over the study region with significant improvement of the RMSE among the images' overlap region. The algorithm has been compared against the mean-standard deviation (MS) and histogram matching (HM) methods of RRN with average RMSE improvement of 40% and 38%, respectively.

TI  - High-resolution satellite imagery meets the challenge of monitoring remote marine protected areas in the Antarctic and beyond
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote, high-latitude oceans can prove challenging for the designation and implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs), partly due to issues in monitoring inaccessible localities and large spatial scales. A lack of protection combined with damage from growing human activities has contributed to the degradation of some of the Earth's richest marine biodiversity and highlights the urgent need to support improved marine conservation. High-resolution satellite imagery (VHR; 0.3-0.6 m spatial resolution) provides a much-needed tool for monitoring sentinel species in remote oceans, which would strengthen current and future MPA research and monitoring programs across the globe. This perspective specifies how recent advances in VHR studies have contributed to knowledge regarding occurrence, habitat suitability, and abundance of mesopredators in the Southern Ocean. We demonstrate how knowledge gained through VHR offers a cost-effective and easily accessible method for collecting previously unobtainable data to inform a representative network of Southern Ocean MPAs, and how the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) could utilize this technology. As VHR and automated detection algorithms continue to improve, we showcase a promising opportunity to use these methods to complement current research and monitoring efforts, thus strengthening MPA efforts in the Southern Ocean and beyond.

TI  - Variation of the land surface temperature field in rare-Earth ore mining areas based on temperature downscaling
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - During the mining process of ionic rare earth elements (REE), mining disturbances, such as land surface excavation, stripped vegetation, injection holes, and tailings discharge, have led to large-scale vegetation degradation and land desertification, ultimately resulting in land surface temperature (LST) differentiation. The surface thermal anomaly is an important ecological parameter, and its spatiotemporal variation has become a powerful tool for identifying surface ecological disturbance. Because the REE mining areas have the characteristics of scattered ore and small areas, it is of great value to obtain LST data with strong practicality and high spatial resolution for sustainable ecological environment monitoring. In this study, the Lingbei mining area in Dingnan County, Ganzhou, China was selected as the study area. Via the use of Landsat and GaoFen-1 (GF-1) remote sensing images, and based on data fusion and the mixed-pixel decomposition method, the temperature downscaling with image fusion and spectral unmixing (TDIFSU) model and the temperature downscaling with data fusion and spectral unmixing (TDDFSU) model were constructed. In addition, they were compared with the commonly used temperature-downscaling disaggregation procedure for radiometric LST (DisTrad) model to explore the accuracy and applicability of different downscaling models for REE mining areas. Finally, based on remote sensing data from the past 20 years, a suitable downscaling model was selected and the temperature difference index (TDI) was used to analyze the spatiotemporal evolutions of ecological disturbances caused by REE mining. The results showed TDDFSU model had the highest accuracy and the smallest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), which were 1.062 K and 1.386 K in February and 0.877 K and 1.094 K in October, respectively, but it had limitations in spatiotemporal study. The accuracy of TDIFSU model was the second, and TDIFSU model based on Landsat data has more advantages in long time series research. DisTrad model has the lowest accuracy. The most suitable model can be selected according to the time span and accuracy; The LST obtained by downscaling can reflect the actual land surface in more detail, and the boundaries between different ground objects were clearer; The high-temperature areas were mainly concentrated in the vicinity of long-term ore occurrences covered with a large amount of tailings. Medium-temperature areas were mainly bare soil and in situ leaching vegetation areas, and low-temperature areas were mainly natural and reclaimed vegetation areas; During the monitoring of the LST in Lingbei mining area for nearly 20 years, the temperature differences caused by different mining activities were revealed, and the land surface disturbance situation has improved after the state actively carried out REE mining environmental control.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Spatiotemporal assessment of potential drivers of salt marsh dieback in the North Inlet-Winyah Bay estuary, South Carolina (1990-2019)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic states have suggested that a suite of possibly abiotic and biotic attributes is responsible for salt marsh dieback, e.g., drought, soil waterlogging, soil chemistry, top-down consumers control, etc. However, there are no conclusive answers in current literature explaining what led to marsh dieback in past decades, especially from the spatiotemporal perspective. Exploring all Landsat-retrieved marsh dieback events in 1990-2019, this research investigates the spatiotemporal relationships between the dieback series and the associated environmental variables in an intertidal marsh in South Carolina (SC). Based on our previous study, a series of marsh dieback events in the past 30 years were identified and dieback pixels in the estuary were extracted. Among these were the most severe marsh dieback events (1991, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2013). Daily Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI), daily precipitation data from Parameter Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM), and station-based water quality observations (dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity, salinity, turbidity, pH, and temperature) in the estuary were retrieved. Integrated with the proof-by-exhaustion method, statistical analysis showed marsh dieback were highly related to moisture imbalance in a period of 90 days before the dieback events. Respectively, pH for Clambank and Debidue Creek, salinity and turbidity for Thousand Acre were found to be the key water quality variables influencing marsh dieback besides drought. This study cogitates the environmental influence on coastal marsh dieback from a spatiotemporal perspective using a long-term satellite time series analysis. The findings could provide insights into marsh ecological resilience and facilitate coastal ecosystem management.

TI  - Policy Allocation for Settlement Development Using Simple Allocation Matrix Rules and Geographic Information System
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The settlement growth is potentially increased by the rural-to-urban perspective change due to the new era of aerotropolis in Kulon Progo. Land-use planning evaluation is required, especially settlement, which has a significant impact on the environment. However, land-use evaluation studies are currently focused on conforming analysis of official land-use planning (OLUP) toward existing or predicted land use partially or in combination with the performance assessment unit. Consequently, it affects the quality of policy products by disregarding crucial considerations of diverse conditions at points of time and aspects of ideality, reality, and regulation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to design a comprehensive policy allocation for settlements using a matrix allocation rule that integrates conformity and performance analysis in three aspects of planning simultaneously. Land allocation was proposed using a geographic information system (GIS) of land capability, settlement suitability, and agricultural and forest land protection. The current land use/land cover (LULC) was classified using visual interpretation of SPOT 7 satellite imagery and a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) to predict the LULC in 2035. The result indicated that the stock of land allocation for settlement development is sufficient to meet the demands in 2035. However, there is a problem in the settlement distribution pattern in which 64.3% of existing settlements are located in non-recommended allocation. That number is predicted to increase by 1,145.8 ha. Land-use control instruments need to be conducted to prevent extensive settlement growth in non-recommended allocation. Conversely, zoning allocation should be directed to trigger the growth of settlements in recommended allocation.

TI  - Wheat growth monitoring and yield estimation based on remote sensing data assimilation into the SAFY crop growth model
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop growth monitoring and yield estimate information can be obtained via appropriate metrics such as the leaf area index (LAI) and biomass. Such information is crucial for guiding agricultural production, ensuring food security, and maintaining sustainable agricultural development. Traditional methods of field measurement and monitoring typically have low efficiency and can only give limited untimely information. Alternatively, methods based on remote sensing technologies are fast, objective, and nondestructive. Indeed, remote sensing data assimilation and crop growth modeling represent an important trend in crop growth monitoring and yield estimation. In this study, we assimilate the leaf area index retrieved from Sentinel-2 remote sensing data for crop growth model of the simple algorithm for yield estimation (SAFY) in wheat. The SP-UCI optimization algorithm is used for fine-tuning for several SAFY parameters, namely the emergence date (D-0), the effective light energy utilization rate (ELUE), and the senescence temperature threshold (STT) which is indicative of biological aging. These three sensitive parameters are set in order to attain the global minimum of an error function between the SAFY model predicted values and the LAI inversion values. This assimilation of remote sensing data into the crop growth model facilitates the LAI, biomass, and yield estimation. The estimation results were validated using data collected from 48 experimental plots during 2014 and 2015. For the 2014 data, the results showed coefficients of determination (R-2) of the LAI, biomass and yield of 0.73, 0.83 and 0.49, respectively, with corresponding root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values of 0.72, 1.13 t/ha and 1.14 t/ha, respectively. For the 2015 data, the estimated R-2 values of the LAI, biomass, and yield were 0.700, 0.85, and 0.61, respectively, with respective RMSE values of 0.83, 1.22 t/ha, and 1.39 t/ha, respectively. The estimated values were found to be in good agreement with the measured ones. This shows high applicability of the proposed data assimilation scheme in crop monitoring and yield estimation. As well, this scheme provides a reference for the assimilation of remote sensing data into crop growth models for regional crop monitoring and yield estimation.

TI  - Parabolic reflectarray antenna to generate multiple beams for geostationary high throughput satellites in Ka-band
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MICROWAVE AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This contribution describes the design and simulations of a multibeam 1.8 m parabolic reflectarray antenna for geostationary high throughput satellites (HTS) in Ka-band. The parabolic reflectarray generates two orthogonal circularly polarized beams per feed simultaneously at 19.7 and 29.5 GHz, by the variable rotation technique. The antenna is made of 62 654 reflectarray cells, which include two types of printed elements independently rotated and adjusted. The elements have been optimized one by one to ensure the required phase-shift at each frequency. A novel design approach has made it possible to promptly obtain an initial layout of every element with a very low computational cost. The simulated radiation patterns show that the parabolic reflectarray, illuminated by 27 dual-circularly polarized feeds, can generate 54 spot-beams in two orthogonal polarizations, with a beam spacing of 0.56 degrees between adjacent beams. The design and simulation tools have been validated by a parabolic reflectarray scaled in a factor of 0.5, which has been manufactured and tested. The proposed reflectarray would allow to generate a complete multi-spot coverage from a geostationary HTS with only two parabolic reflectarrays, instead of four reflector antennas, also reducing the number of feeds by half, since every feed generates two beams.

TI  - Uncovering forest dynamics using historical forest inventory data and Landsat time series
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - While many countries regularly produce timely and accurate estimates for a range of forest attributes through national forest inventory programs, many have access to no such inventory or their inventory is discontinuous in space and time, such as a sample-based approach in Ukraine limited to two regional (Ivano-Frankivsk and Sumy) inventories conducted in 2008-2015 at a total area of 37,700 ha. This study addresses the extent to which limited historical forest inventory data may facilitate forest mapping efforts using dense Landsat time series (LTS) and mapping techniques (i.e., classification and imputation) to predict multiyear forest dynamics. We used the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) segmentation approach to extract inter-and intra-annual trends in LTS and utilized these fitted trends as covariates in further modeling. We developed random forest (RF) classification models for forest mapping based on field data collection and LTS, and then generated yearly forest maps for 1990-2020. The RF model accuracies were high for both producer's and user's accuracy (> 0.93 +/- 0.04). Based on yearly forest dynamics, we detected an increasing trend in forest loss during 2000-2010 and 2010-2020 in our regions. We used the gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) method to generate species presence (basal area (BA) >= 1.0 m(2) ha(-1)) and growing stock volume (GSV) maps at the 30-m pixel level. Our nearest neighbor imputation models achieved better accuracies (Cohen's kappa > 0.4) for species that are prevalent within regions, occupy distinct geographical areas, and have higher plot BA abundance. To obtain estimates of species abundance with higher R-2, we used the GNN model with k = 3 nearest neighbors. Aggre-gating species based on similar environmental niche resulted in greater R-2 values of BA that varied within two regions from low (0.129 and 0.416) for a group of hardwood deciduous species to high (0.531 and 0.712) for coniferous species. The accuracy was systematically better at 5-km hexagonal level, thus we recommend using the maps at coarser aggregations. The study showed that forests accumulated more GSV in 1990-2000, albeit higher rates of GSV loss were observed during the two last decades. We attribute the spatial and temporal character of forest change to forestry activities in the past, the current age structure of forests, and afforestation of abandoned farmlands. We are aware that forecasting performance of the nearest neighbor imputation approach merits more detailed consideration as new forest inventory data are available.

TI  - Incidental findings on single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) lymphoscintigraphy in breast cancer: the proposed Westmead SPECT/CT incidental findings classification
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of incidental radiological findings detected on SPECT/CT performed as part of pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery and development of a modified classification to workup these lesions. Methods A retrospective audit was performed of all SPECT/CT performed in combination with lymphoscintigrams in breast cancer patients presenting with clinically node negative axillae and operated on by breast surgeons at the Westmead Breast Cancer Institute over a 12-month period. Results Four hundred and nineteen patients were included in the study. In 149 patients (35.6%), there was a total of 205 incidental findings. The most common findings were, pulmonary abnormalities (38.5%), abdominal findings (27.8%), thyroid nodules (14.6%), cardiac abnormalities (10.7%) and others (8.3%). Using our proposed Westmead SPECT/CT incidental findings (WSIF) classification, 7.8% were known, 17.6% were major findings, 48.3% were minor findings, 15.1% were minimal findings and 11.2% were equivocal findings. 17.6% (n = 36) underwent further workup and investigation and 3.4% of patients (n = 5) required therapeutic intervention, including chemotherapy for primary lung cancer(n = 1) and surgeries (thoracotomy, n = 1; thyroidectomy, n = 2; colonoscopy, n = 1). 93.8% (n = 393) had at least one SLN mapped, most commonly located in Level 1 of the axilla. Conclusion The incidental findings on SPECT/CT in combination with lymphoscintigraphy is within the range of previous studies (27.3-59.5%). A small proportion of patients required significant major interventions (3.4%). We propose that all incidental findings should be assessed according to our WSIF classification to aid in triaging need for further investigation and management.

TI  - Agricultural drought survey using MODIS-based image indices at the regional scale: case study of the Urmia Lake Basin, Iran
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural, global and recurring phenomenon caused by climatic anomalies and inevitable meteorological changes. Lake Urmia in northwestern Iran has been drying up in recent years mainly because of its management and operations. On the other hand, with decreasing rainfall, the process of the lake drying up has intensified and affected different aspects of people's lives, especially farmers. In this paper, regional drought was studied in the Urmia Lake Basin from an agricultural perspective in the period of 2001 to 2021 using different vegetation indices such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), the Temperature Condition Index (TCI) and the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) as well as by applying the temperature product and vegetation cover product of the MODIS sensor of the Terra satellite. The efficiency of the methods was evaluated. The results of the linear correlation between drought indices and cumulative precipitation values during 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 5 months and 7 months before the acquisition of the image showed that the correlation of indices, especially of the TVDINDVI index with the cumulative rainfall of 4 months, showed that the precipitation is more frequent than with other time scales due to the delayed response of vegetation to rainfall. From 2001 to 2020, it was observed that the severity of annual drought decreased according to TVDI values. The area with heavy drought decreased from 4.45 to 1.8% and medium drought decreased from 43.49 to 33%. Also, the correlation coefficient between other vegetation indices and temperature vegetation drought indices (TVDINDVI) showed that TCI and TVDI values were negatively (r = -0.73) correlated. Generally, by observing the calculated TVDI maps, it was seen that this basin has not encountered heavy drought so far. The results showed that the Urmia Lake Basin experienced long-term light and medium drought conditions. On the other hand, by calculating the NDWI index, changes in the area of Lake Urmia were monitored and it was found that the lake surface started to decrease beginning in 2005 and reached its lowest level in 2015, which corresponds to the other droughts that occurred. Finally, by conducting a trend analysis of TVDI, it was observed that there is no specific trend in the drought time series so it can be seen that drought may be one of the causes of a sharp decline in the lake's water level, but not the only factor.

TI  - Identifying the effect of monsoon floods on vegetation and land surface temperature by using Google Earth Engine
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is one of the most devastating climatic disasters around the world. The physical and infrastructural damage of floods is uncontrollable and challenging to recover. Though the mismanagement of the water system is one cause of flood, some countries face a seasonal natural flood, which is impossible to avoid. The history of flood affection in these countries are long, and people don't have any other choice but to adapt to this circumstance every year. The continuous flood event has several climatic impacts that are not broadly documented and remain in the shadows of severe infrastructural damage. This research aims to identify the effect of monsoon floods on vegetation and land surface temperature (LST). The study area is the northeast part of Bangladesh, a highly flood-prone area. The research incorporates Google Earth Engine (GEE) to manage the satellite image data related to this research which are Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and Landsat-8 imagery. Six years of data from 2015 to 2020 have been taken to continuously monitor the flooded area, vegetation, and LST dynamics. Primary results indicate a yearly increase and decrease of the flooded area with 57.3% highest increase rate in 2019. A continuous increase of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) value and decrease of LST has a changing pattern similarity with flooded area fluctuation over the year. Also, the flooded areas have around 50% less mean EVI value than the non-flooded areas, eventually rising average LST in flooded areas. 10,024 grids of 1 km x 1 km have been used to extensively analyze the relationship of flood and EVI through correlation and linear regression. The final result reveals a clear negative correlation value (less than 0.56 for all the years) of EVI with flooded areas, having the highest R-squared value of 0.4325 in 2017.

TI  - Efficacy of different sentinel lymph node biopsy protocols in oral squamous cell carcinoma: Systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Review
AB  - The sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is highly protocolized in other cancers, however, this is not the case for oral squamous cell carcinoma patients, hence our objective was to evaluate the different protocols published. A specific study protocol was designed and subsequently registered on PROSPERO (Ref. CRD42021279217). Twenty-three articles were included in the meta-analysis. The grouped sensitivity of the SNB was 82% (95% CI: 0.74-0.88), and the grouped specificity was 100% (95% CI: 0.99-1.00). The use of other radiotracers other than pre-operative lopamidol showed higher values of sensitivity of 82.80% (95% CI: 76.90%-87.50%; p < 0.001). The use of the blue dye stain showed higher sensitivity values of 85.60% (95% CI: 71.90%-93.20%), compared to sensitivity values of 77.50% when it was not used (95% CI: 69.10%-84.20%) (p < 0.001). Diagnostic rates are variable and they were significantly better when 99mTc was used in all its variations and accompanied by the blue dye staining.

TI  - Advances and Accuracy Assessment of Ocean Tide Models in the Antarctic Ocean
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean tides in polar regions play an important role in the study of sea ice dynamics and floating ice shelves. The accuracy of existing ocean tide models in shallow waters and polar seas is much lower than that in open deep oceans. This study summarized the advances of state-of-the-art global tide models in the Antarctic Ocean, the construction of tide models around Circum-Antarctica, and five typical regions: Antarctic Peninsula, Ross Sea, Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS), Weddell Sea, and Amery Ice Shelf (AIS). The accuracy of FES 2014, TPXO9, EOT20, CATS 2008, and regional tide models in the Antarctic Ocean and typical areas was evaluated using tidal records and satellite altimetry data. EOT20 and ANTPEN04.01 models have higher accuracy in the Antarctic Peninsula, and the root sum square (RSS) values are 8.29 and 7.46 cm, respectively. TPXO9 has the highest accuracy in the Weddell Sea and FRIS and AIS and RSS values are 18.33 and 12.77 cm, respectively. TPXO9 and RIS_Optimal models have higher accuracy in the Ross Sea and Ross Ice Shelf (RIS), RSS values are 5.62 and 6.21 cm, respectively. The accuracy of FES 2014, TPXO9, CATS 2008, and the regional tide model in the Drake Passage, Kerguelen Islands, and Adelie-Mertz was evaluated using satellite altimetry data. The RSS values are less than 4 cm. By using the altimetry data at Sentinel-3A single-satellite crossovers in terms of the STD of the SLA, the comparison of the STDs show that FES2014 is the best.

TI  - Automatic detection of geological lineaments in central Turkey based on test image analysis using satellite data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hamurcu and Bas = dere study areas, part of the Central Anatolian Volcanic Provence (CAVP), are associated with metalliferous ore deposits. The assumption that hydrothermal alterations might be related to faults and fractures makes mapping the lineaments around the study areas vital. Accordingly, geological lineaments in the vicinity of the studied areas in Central Anatolia (Turkey) were delineated using Landsat-8 and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data. We adopted a new methodology for determining the optimal values of six parameters used in a fully automated extraction of lineaments. The lineaments identified in the region including the study areas strike mainly the NW-SE direction in the PALSAR data. Moreover, hydrothermal alterations around the towns of Hamurcu and Bas = dere are directly related to the NW-SE oriented faults, indicating that the lineations in the region might be carefully scrutinized in the exploration of mineralization zones. As a result, it was demonstrated in this study that the most appropriate parameter values specified for automatic lineament extraction successfully map geological structures around both study areas and can confidently be employed in different geographical locations.

TI  - Optimized algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieval <i>via </i>remote sensing
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many algorithms for surface energy balance (SEB) based on remote sensing (RS) have been advanced to determine evapotranspiration (ET). These algorithms were developed for specific conditions (e.g., sensors, land use, and crop management) in which functions and empirical parameters within its algorithms concur with those conditions. Therefore, this study aims to develop a SEB-RS algorithm for retrieving ET adjusted to in situ observations. The study was conducted in two experimental fields in Brazil with the crops Jatropha curcas, maize, soybean, and sugarcane. We used multispectral images from the orbital sensors, Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) coupled in Landsat 8 satellite and from the terrestrial sensor, Altum, on board of an unmanned aerial vehicle. The proposed algorithm termed as Ground-truthed Surface Energy Balance (GT-SEB) is based on physical formulation of SEB-RS algorithms, where two extra computational processes using in situ ET observations were proposed for originating the new algorithm. The first additional process for optimizing the automatic "anchor " pixels selection and another for algorithm parameters optimization. Thus, both processes aim to reduce the difference between the observed ET and estimated by GT-SEB. Being assessed for both orbital (OLI/TIRS) and suborbital (Altum) sensors, the GT-SEB yielded excellent results (root-mean-square error, RMSE, <= 0.48 mm and modified Kling-Gupta efficiency, KGE, >= 0.92). In addition to GT-SEB being an optimized algorithm, it uses a classic parameterization of SEB-RS algorithms, providing efficiency and scalability for other remote sensors, climates, and surfaces.

TI  - A unified empirical modeling approach for particulate matter and NO<sub>2</sub> in a coastal city in China
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling air pollutants on a fine spatiotemporal scale is necessary for health studies that focus on critical short-term exposure windows. A unified empirical modeling approach is useful for health studies; however, it is unclear whether this approach can be used in a coastal city for air pollutants driven by local emissions and regional meteorological factors. An advanced empirical modeling approach was used to develop exposure models from October 2012 to December 2019, for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than or equal to 2.5 and 10 mu m (PM2.5 and PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the coastal city of Shanghai, China. Air pollutant concentrations were obtained from daily measurements at 55 administrative monitoring sites that were integrated into three-day average concentrations. Data on a large array of geographic variables were collected, and their dimensions were reduced using the partial least squares regression method. A geostatistical model using the land use regression approach in a universal kriging framework was developed to estimate short-term exposure concentrations. The prediction ability of the models were determined by leave-one (site)-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and external validation (EV). Compared to the LOOCV results, the EV results for PM2.5 and PM10 were consistently reliable, but the EV for NO2 had a larger root mean squared error. The temporal random effects involved in the model structure were interpreted using sensitivity analyses. This affected the short-term PM2.5 and PM10 model predictions. This unified empirical modeling approach was successfully used for particulate matter in Shanghai, where air pollution is affected by complex regional and meteorological conditions. These exposure models are going to be applied for making exposure predictions at residential locations for short-term exposure predictions in the Growth trajectories and air pollution (GAAP) study in Shanghai that focuses on maternal and early life exposure to air pollutants.

TI  - <i>In situ</i> fluorescence yield soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy of electrochemical nickel deposition processes with and without ethylene glycol
T2  - RSC ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The electrochemical Ni deposition at a platinum electrode was investigated in a plating nickel bath in the presence and absence of ethylene glycol (EG) using fluorescence yield soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (FY-XAS) in the Ni L-2,L-3-edge and O K-edge regions under potential control. At <=+0.35 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the electrochemical Ni deposition was detected by the Ni L-2,L-3-edge FY-XAS in the presence of EG whereas almost no such event was observed in the absence of EG. A drastic decrease of FY-XAS intensities in the O K-edge region was also observed in the presence of EG at >+0.35 V vs. RHE, suggesting that the nano-/micro-structured Ni deposition initiated by the removal of water molecules occurs on the Pt electrode. The complex formation of Ni2+ with EG and the adsorption of EG on the Ni surface could play an important role in the Ni deposition. This study demonstrates that the in situ FY-XAS is a powerful and surface-sensitive technique to understand (electro)chemical reactions including polyol synthesis and electrocatalysis at solid-liquid interfaces.

TI  - Improving the specificity of nucleic acid detection with endonuclease-actuated degradation
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nucleic acid detection is essential for numerous biomedical applications, but often requires complex protocols and/or suffers false-positive readouts. Here, we describe SENTINEL, an approach that combines isothermal amplification with a sequence-specific degradation method to detect nucleic acids with high sensitivity and sequence-specificity. Target single-stranded RNA or double-stranded DNA molecules are amplified by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and subsequently degraded by the combined action of lambda exonuclease and a sequence-specific DNA endonuclease (e.g., Cas9). By combining the sensitivity of LAMP with the precision of DNA endonucleases, the protocol achieves attomolar limits of detection while differentiating between sequences that differ by only one or two base pairs. The protocol requires less than an hour to complete using a 65 degrees C heat block and fluorometer, and detects SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in human saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs with high sensitivity.

TI  - Protective Effect of Calcium Fructoborate Against Carbon Tetrachloride-Induced Toxicity in Rats
T2  - BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) is a xenbiotic that can cause cellular damage with free radical production. Calcium fructoborate (CFB) is a boron-based nutritional supplement with antioxidant properties. Calcium fructoborate used in our study is marketed by Future Ceutical Corporation as FruiteX-B, which has a chemical structure similar to the natural form of boron found in edible plants. In this study, it was aimed to determine the antioxidant activity, DNA damage, and histopathological effects of CFB on the liver and kidney tissues of rats in the toxicity induced by CCL4. During 14 days of treatment, 42 wistar albino rats were divided into 7 in each group, control group, olive oil (0.25 ml twice a week), CFB (1 mg/day), CFB-CCL4 (1 mg/day, twice a week 0.5 ml), ZY-CFB (0.25 ml/twice a week, 1 mg/2 times day twice), and CCl4 (0.5 ml twice a week). AST, ALT, HDL, LDH, urea, creatinine, triglyceride, total protein and albumin levels were analyzed in the blood serum of rats. The antioxidant defense system enzymes CAT, GR, GPx, SOD activities and GSH, MDA and 8-OHdG levels in liver and kidney tissues were determined and evaluated. In addition, liver and kidney tissues were examined with only hispatological tests. As a result of the findings, it shows that CCl4 disrupts antioxidant defense mechanisms by disrupting some enzyme systems in the kidney and liver. CFB (Fruit-XB), a boronbased dietary supplement, regulates antioxidant metabolism by strengthening biochemical metabolic profiles against oxidation, and also has a protective effect against DNA damage caused by oxidation. Thus, it was concluded that CFB has antioxidant property against CCl4-induced liver and kidney toxicity.

TI  - Joint assessment of temporal segmentation, time unit and detection algorithms in syndromic surveillance
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The choice of the aggregation that defines the temporal unit of epidemiological surveillance is part of the more theoretical framework of the modifiable temporal unit problem (MTUP). It has been demonstrated that this choice influences temporal cluster detection and may lead to false-positive results and poor estimation of regression model parameters. In syndromic surveillance (SyS), despite the choice of which temporal aggregation to use being crucial, it has not yet been addressed in the literature. In most SyS systems, this choice is driven by the frequency of the data collection and/or human resources available, although neither the temporal unit's influence on the performance of anomaly detection algorithms nor on the efficiency of the SyS are known.The main objective of our study was to analyze the influence of the temporal aggregation unit on the performances of SyS detection algorithms used routinely, according to the characteristics of specific syndromes and outbreaks. Simulating daily time series of various syndromes, we tested three different time series aggregation methods. For each of four anomaly detection algorithms and their variants, we calculated seven performance indicators and multi-criteria scores to guide epidemiologists in their choice of which temporal aggregation of surveillance to use. From 19,200 analyzed time series, we observed an effect of temporal aggregation on the performance of the detection algorithms tested. Results also showed that the time aggregation unit was linked to the detection algorithm used, and that strong aggregation-algorithm interactions need to be taken into account when deciding on which aggregation-algorithm pair to use. Using theoretical data, our study also showed that no one ideal aggregation-algorithm pair exists for all contexts when deciding on which temporal unit of surveillance to use, and that the choice depends on several parameters.Our results can help public health practitioners choose the most appropriate time series aggregation and algorithm according to their specific needs. Finally, the present work enabled us to develop recommendations for a One Health project where the same time aggregation type and detection method could be used for both human and animal syndromic surveillance data.

TI  - Safety and immunogenicity of a synthetic multiantigen modified vaccinia virus Ankara-based COVID-19 vaccine (COH04S1): an open-label and randomised, phase 1trial
T2  - LANCET MICROBE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background COH04S1, a synthetic attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara vector co-expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antigens, was tested for safety and immunogenicity in healthy adults.Methods This combined open-label and randomised, phase 1 trial was done at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (Duarte, CA, USA). We included participants aged 18-54 years with a negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody and PCR test, normal haematology and chemistry panels, a normal electrocardiogram and troponin concentration, negative pregnancy test if female, body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or less, and no modified vaccinia virus Ankara or poxvirus vaccine in the past 12 months. In the open-label cohort, 1.0 x 10(7) plaque-forming units (PFU; low dose), 1.0 x 10(8) PFU (medium dose), and 2.5 x 10(8) PFU (high dose) of COH04S1 were administered by intramuscular injection on day 0 and 28 to sentinel participants using a queue-based statistical design to limit risk. In a randomised dose expansion cohort, additional participants were randomly assigned (3:3:1), using block size of seven, to receive two placebo vaccines (placebo group), one low-dose COH04S1 and one placebo vaccine (low-dose COH04S1 plus placebo group), or two low-dose COH04S1 vaccines (low-dose COH04S1 group). The primary outcome was safety and tolerability, with secondary objectives assessing vaccine-specific immunogenicity. The primary immunological outcome was a four times increase (seroconversion) from baseline in spike-specific or nucleocapsid-specific IgG titres within 28 days of the last injection, and seroconversion rates were compared with participants who received placebo using Fisher's exact test. Additional secondary outcomes included assessment of viral neutralisation and cellular responses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT046339466.Findings Between Dec 13, 2020, and May 24, 2021, 56 participants initiated vaccination. On day 0 and 28, 17 participants received low-dose COH04S1, eight received medium-dose COH04S1, nine received high-dose COH04S1, five received placebo, 13 received low-dose COH04S1 followed by placebo, and four discontinued early. Grade 3 fever was observed in one participant who received low-dose COH04S1 and placebo, and grade 2 anxiety or fatigue was seen in one participant who received medium-dose COH04S1. No severe adverse events were reported. Seroconversion was observed in all 34 participants for spike protein and 32 (94%) for nucleocapsid protein (p<0.0001 vs placebo for each comparison). Four times or more increase in SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies within 56 days was measured in nine of 17 participants in the low-dose COH04S1 group, all eight participants in the medium-dose COH04S1 group, and eight of nine participants in the high-dose COH04S1 group (p=0.0035 combined dose levels vs placebo). Post-prime and post-boost four times increase in spike-specific or nucleocapsid-specific T cells secreting interferon-gamma was measured in 48 (98%; 95% CI 89-100) of 49 participants who received at least one dose of COH04S1 and provided a sample for immunological analysis.Interpretation COH04S1 was well tolerated and induced spike-specific and nucleocapsid-specific antibody and T-cell responses. Future evaluation of this COVID-19 vaccine candidate as a primary or boost vaccination is warranted. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A life of research on circular RNAs and ribozymes: towards the origin of viroids, deltaviruses and life
T2  - VIRUS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The first examples of circular RNAs (circRNAs) were reported in the '70s as a family of minimal infectious agents of flowering plants; the viroids and viral satellites of circRNA. In some cases, these small circular genomes encode self-cleaving RNA motifs or ribozymes, including an exceptional circRNA infecting not plants but humans: the Hepatitis Delta Virus. Autocatalytic ribozymes not only allowed to propose a common rolling-circle replication mechanism for all these subviral agents, but also a tentative link with the origin of life as molecular fossils of the so-called RNA world. Despite the weak biologic connection between angiosperm plants and the human liver, diverse scientists, and most notably Ricardo Flores, firmly supported an evolutionary relationship between plant viroids and human deltavirus agents. The tireless and inspiring work done by Ricardo's lab in the field of infectious circRNAs fuelled multiple hypotheses for the origin of these entities, allowing advances in other fields, from eukaryotic circRNAs to small ribozymes in genomes from all life kingdoms. The recent discovery of a plethora of viral-like circRNAs with ribozymes in disparate biological samples may finally allow us to connect plant and animal subviral agents, confirming again that Ricardo's eye for science was always a keen eye.

TI  - Performance of manual and automatic detection of dry snow avalanches in Sentinel-1 SAR images
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar satellite-borne snow avalanche detection has rapidly grown into an important method for monitoring of avalanche activity over large spatial and long temporal scales. With increased application of Sentinel-1 data for avalanche detection, the need for improved performance evaluation arises. In this study, we make use of a unique dataset of field-based avalanche observations from eight adjacent avalanche paths at lake Tyin in central Norway. The dataset is a complete record of 318 dry slab avalanches that released during the winters 2016-2020, with information on release timing and extent. The dataset thus allows for detailed evaluation of the performance of automatic and manual avalanche detection in Sentinel-1 images, were both techniques make use of relative temporal backscatter intensity increase in case of an avalanche. Both automatic and manual detection underperform compared to previous studies with a probability of detection (POD) of 5.9% (false alarm rate (FAR) of 5.9%) and 11.3% (FAR of 19.27%) respectively. From the low relative backscatter intensity contrast of fieldobserved dry slab avalanches, it becomes evident that a higher backscatter contrast between avalanches and surrounding is needed for detectability in Sentinel-1 images. Neither the lag time between avalanche release and detection in a Sentinel-1 image, nor local incidence angle can explain the low POD's. Moreover, an analysis of meteorological conditions prior a during avalanche release and/or detection can explain the low POD's, given that differing snow conditions influence radar backscatter intensity. Finally, we cannot rule out that the small dataset of field-observed avalanches and the one-directional slope aspect of the study area influence our results, however, we believe that a physical limit of detectability of dry snow avalanches in C-band radar satellite data is reached.

TI  - Individual-based modeling of shelled pteropods
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shelled pteropods are cosmopolitan, free-swimming organisms of biogeochemical and commercial importance. They are widely used as sentinel species for the overall response of marine ecosystems to environmental stressors associated with climate change and changes in ocean chemistry. However, currently we are unable to project the effects of climate change on shelled pteropods at the population level, due to the missing spatio-temporal characterization of the response of pteropods to environmental stressors, and the limited information on the pteropod life history and life-cycle. In this study, we implement a shelled pteropod Individual-Based Model (IBM), i.e. we simulate a pteropod population as a set of discrete individuals over several generations, life-stages (eggs, larvae, juveniles and adults) and as a function of temperature, food availability, and aragonite saturation state. The model is able to provide an abundance signal that is consistent with the abundance signal measured in the temperate region. In addition, the modeled life-stage progression matches the reported size spectrum across the year, with two major spawning periods in spring and fall, and maturation in March and September. Furthermore, our IBM correctly predicts the abundance maxima of younger, smaller and potentially more susceptible life-stages in spring and winter. Thus, our model provides a tool for advancing our understanding of the response of pteropod populations to future environmental changes.

TI  - Monitoring Changes and Soil Characterization in Mangrove Forests of the United Arab Emirates Using the Canonical Correlation Forest Model by Multitemporal of Landsat Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are an important indicator of blue carbon storage and biodiversity and provide several benefits to the environment. This study showed the first attempt to apply the canonical correlation forest (CCF) model to classify mangroves and monitor changes in the mangrove forests of the entire region. The CCF model obtained a satisfactory accuracy with an F1 score of more than 0.90. Compared to Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 exhibited good temporal resolution with relatively little mangrove details. The resultant mangrove maps (1990-2020) were used to monitor changes in mangrove forests by applying a threshold value ranging from +1 to -1. The results showed a significant increase in the UAE mangroves over the period from 1990 to 2020. To characterize soil in mangrove forests, a set of interpolated maps for calcium carbonate, salinity concentration, nitrogen, and organic matter content was constructed. The results showed that there is a positive relationship between mangrove distribution and the calcium carbonate, nitrogen, salinity, and organic matter concentrations in the soil of the mangrove forests. Our results are of great importance to the ecological and research community. The new maps presented in this study will be a good reference and a useful source for the coastal management organization.

TI  - Dataset of daily near-surface air temperature in China from 1979 to 2018
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Near-surface air temperature (T-a) is an important physical parameter that reflects climate change. Many methods are used to obtain the daily maximum (T-max), minimum (T-min), and average (T-avg) temperature, but are affected by multiple factors. To obtain daily T-a data (T-max, T-min, and T-avg) with high spatio-temporal resolution in China, we fully analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of various existing data. Different T-a reconstruction models were constructed for different weather conditions, and the data accuracy was improved by building correction equations for different regions. Finally, a dataset of daily temperature (T-max, T-min, and T-avg) in China from 1979 to 2018 was obtained with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees. For T-max, validation using in situ data shows that the root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 0.86 to 1.78 degrees, the mean absolute error (MAE) varies from 0.63 to 1.40 degrees, and the Pearson coefficient (R-2) ranges from 0.96 to 0.99. For T-min, the RMSE ranges from 0.78 to 2.09 degrees, the MAE varies from 0.58 to 1.61 degrees, and the R-2 ranges from 0.95 to 0.99. For T-avg, the RMSE ranges from 0.35 to 1.00 degrees, the MAE varies from 0.27 to 0.68 degrees, and the R-2 ranges from 0.99 to 1.00. Furthermore, various evaluation indicators were used to analyze the temporal and spatial variation trends of Ta, and the Tavg increase was more than 0.03 degrees C yr(-1), which is consistent with the general global warming trend. In summary, this dataset has high spatial resolution and high accuracy, which compensates for the temperature values (T-max, T-min, and T-avg) previously missing at high spatial resolution and provides key parameters for the study of climate change, especially high-temperature drought and low-temperature chilling damage. The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5502275 (Fang et al., 2021a).

T2  - DERMATOLOGY AND THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Prognostic assessment of cutaneous melanoma relies on historical, clinicopathological, and phenotypic risk factors according to American Joint Committee on Cancer(AJCC) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines but may not account for a patient's individual additional genetic risk factors. Objective To review the available literature regarding commercially available gene expression profile (GEP) tests and their use in the management of cutaneous melanoma. Methods A literature search was conducted for original, English-language studies or meta-analyses published between 2010 and 2021 on commercially available GEP tests in cutaneous melanoma prognosis, clinical decision-making regarding sentinel lymph node biopsy, and real-world efficacy. After the literature review, the Skin Cancer Prevention Working Group, an expert panel of dermatologists with specialized training in melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer diagnosis and management, utilized a modified Delphi technique to develop consensus statements regarding prognostic gene expression profile tests. Statements were only adopted with a supermajority vote of > 80%. Results The initial search identified 1064 studies/meta-analyses that met the search criteria. Of these, we included 21 original articles and meta-analyses that studied the 31-GEP test (DecisionDx-Melanoma; Castle Biosciences, Inc.), five original articles that studied the 11-GEP test (Melagenix; NeraCare GmbH), and four original articles that studied the 8-GEP test with clinicopathological factors (Merlin; 8-GEP + CP; SkylineDx B.V.) in this review. Six statements received supermajority approval and were adopted by the panel. Conclusion GEP tests provide additional, reproducible information for dermatologists to consider within the larger framework of the eighth edition of the AJCC and NCCN cutaneous melanoma guidelines when counseling regarding prognosis and when considering a sentinel lymph node biopsy.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT-X
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased dust and air pollution in the Middle East over the past two decades has caused many problems, including human health risks and environmental hazards. Concentrations of surface Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10) have always been considered as important indicators in assessing air pollution. It is necessary to have models that accurately estimate and predict the concentration of particulate matter to measure and reduce air pollution. In order to estimate the surface PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, nine different linear and nonlinear multivariable regression models were provided in this study. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data along with several effective meteorological variables such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, horizontal visibility, and K-index were used to estimate PM2.5 and PM10 concentration. AOD data obtained from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectroscopy (MODIS) and the meteorological parameters were used to generate several statistical models, including linear and nonlinear multivariable regression models during ten years over Ahvaz. The highest correlation was observed between the observed and estimated PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in the nonlinear equation. The forecast accuracy of the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations using the nonlinear equation was 70% and 64%, respectively, which are the best predictions in the nine models obtained in this study.

TI  - Host preferences inhibit transmission from potential superspreader host species
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Host species that are particularly abundant, infectious and/or infected tend to contribute disproportionately to symbiont (parasite or mutualist) maintenance in multi-host systems. Therefore, in a facultative multi-host system where two host species had high densities, high symbiont infestation intensities and high infestation prevalence, we expected interspecific transmission rates to be high. Instead, we found that interspecific symbiont transmission rates to caged sentinel hosts were an order of magnitude lower than intraspecific transmission rates in the wild. Using laboratory experiments to decompose transmission rates, we found that opportunities for interspecific transmission were frequent, where interspecific and intraspecific contact rate functions were statistically indistinguishable. However, most interspecific contacts did not lead to transmission events owing to a previously unrecognized transmission barrier: strong host preferences. During laboratory choice experiments, the symbiont preferred staying on or dispersing to its current host species, even though the oligochaete symbiont is a globally distributed host generalist that can survive and reproduce on many snail host species. These surprising results suggest that when managing symbiont transmission, identifying key host species is still important, but it may be equally important to identify and manage transmission barriers that keep potential superspreader host species in check.

AB  - This study was designed to examine the trends of LULC transformation and driving forces over the last 35 years (1986 - 2020) in Bako Tibe District, Ethiopia. Results showed that cultivation and shrubland were dominant covering more than two-thirds of the total area. Trend analysis showed that cultivated land (33.26%) and built-up area (2.71%) increased over the years. In contrast, wetland, shrub and grassland had declined by 13.04%, 13.7% and 7.35%, respectively. The majority (96%) of respondents perceived expansion of cultivated land (81.1%) and wood extraction (73.6%) as principal proximate drivers while population growth (92.6) as the underlying factor.

TI  - TimeSpec4LULC: a global multispectral time series database for training LULC mapping models with machine learning
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) mapping are of paramount importance to monitor and understand the structure and dynamics of the Earth system. One of the most promising ways to create accurate global LULC maps is by building good quality state-of-the-art machine learning models. Building such models requires large and global datasets of annotated time series of satellite images, which are not available yet. This paper presents TimeSpec4LULC (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5913554; Khaldi et al., 2022), a smart opensource global dataset of multispectral time series for 29 LULC classes ready to train machine learning models. TimeSpec4LULC was built based on the seven spectral bands of the MODIS sensors at 500 m resolution, from 2000 to 2021, and was annotated using spatial-temporal agreement across the 15 global LULC products available in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The 22-year monthly time series of the seven bands were created globally by (1) applying different spatial-temporal quality assessment filters on MODIS Terra and Aqua satellites; (2) aggregating their original 8 d temporal granularity into monthly composites; (3) merging Terra + Aqua data into a combined time series; and (4) extracting, at the pixel level, 6 076 531 time series of size 262 for the seven bands along with a set of metadata: geographic coordinates, country and departmental divisions, spatial-temporal consistency across LULC products, temporal data availability, and the global human modification index. A balanced subset of the original dataset was also provided by selecting 1000 evenly distributed samples from each class such that they are representative of the entire globe. To assess the annotation quality of the dataset, a sample of pixels, evenly distributed around the world from each LULC class, was selected and validated by experts using very high resolution images from both Google Earth and Bing Maps imagery. This smartly, pre-processed, and annotated dataset is targeted towards scientific users interested in developing various machine learning models, including deep learning networks, to perform global LULC mapping.

TI  - Exploration and Petrogenesis of Corundum-Bearing Pegmatites: A Case Study in Migif-Hafafit Area, Egypt
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A net of pegmatite veins crosscut gneiss and dismembered ophiolitic ultramafic rocks are abundant in the Migif-Hafafit culmination area, South Eastern Desert, Egypt. Some of these pegmatites are corundum-bearing. Corundum-bearing pegmatites are studied in eight localities around the Migif-Hafafit complex. The present study aims to integrate field investigation, whole rock and corundum chemistry, remote sensing studies, and the conventional methods to detect the corundum-bearing pegmatites, which led to finding out the genesis of the corundum mineralization. In addition, the tectonic regime has been detected using bulk rock geochemistry. False-color composite (FCCs), band ratio (BR), principal component analysis (PCA), minimum noise fraction (MNF), decorrelation stretch (DS), and the constrained energy minimization (CEM) image processing algorithms were proposed and applied on Landsat-8 OLI, and Sentinel-2A data to discriminate the exposed lithological units and to detect the corundum-bearing pegmatites in the study area. These detected pegmatites are structurally controlled following the NW-SE direction. The ultramafic rocks are the host of six areas and the gneisses are the host rocks of the two others. Gneisses and pegmatites are characterized by a steep slope of LREEs relative to HREEs with week Eu negative anomaly. The studied pegmatites have both plumasite and marundite. On the other hand, the studied corundum has Al2O3 content up to 99.72 wt% in pegmatite-gneiss and up to 100 wt.% in pegmatite-ultramafics. Corundum is ascribed to metamorphic/metasomatic type according to its chromosphere. Desilication in pegmatites led to the excess of alumina content in the residual melt producing corundum mineralization.

TI  - Conservation Agriculture Benefits Indian Farmers, but Technology Targeting Needed for Greater Impacts
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice and wheat production in the intensive, irrigated farming systems of the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) is associated with significant negative environmental and health externalities. Conservation Agriculture (CA) has the potential to curb some of these externalities while enhancing farm income. However, farmer adoption of CA remains modest in the Indian IGP. The present study focuses on the constraints to adopting the major CA component, zero tillage (ZT). We examine whether ZT wheat is feasible for smallholders and the potential of technology targeting to realize faster and wider diffusion. Econometric models and machine learning algorithms were used to analyze remote sensing data and farm household data collected from the Indian states of Punjab and Bihar, two contrasting agrarian economies of the IGP. While farmer adoption was low among smallholders (owning <2 ha of land), the on-farm effects of ZT on variable cost reduction and yield and profit enhancement for smallholders are comparable to large farmers. We estimate the economic potential of technology targeting using an equilibrium displacement model. In the relatively developed state of Punjab, technology targeting based on landholding size does not appear to add substantive economic benefits. In Bihar, a less prosperous state with a dominance of smallholders in the population, technology targeting could markedly enhance economic surplus and reduce rural poverty.

TI  - Robot-assisted and conventional urology surgical procedures: comparison of average length of stay, economic status, operative time and patient's expenditure in a tertiary care hospital of North India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Robot-assisted surgeries allows the surgeons to operate using remote-controlled robotic arms that are more effective in comparison to conventional (open/laparoscopic) surgeries. However, there is substantial lack of evidence on the effectiveness of robot-assisted surgeries in low to middle income countries (LMICs) like India. A study was conducted with an aim to evaluate the average length of stay (ALOS), Operative time, economic status (patient's) and cost borne by the patient (patient's expenditure) for undergoing robot-assisted surgeries and conventional surgeries. Grouping of the surgical procedures was done wherein patients who were treated with robot-assisted surgical procedures were placed in Group-01 whereas those treated with conventional surgical procedures were placed under Group-02. Comparative evaluation of the two surgical groups revealed that in robot-assisted surgical procedure, the ALOS was less (18.43 vs. 23.14 days, p = 0.06) whereas operative time (316.7 vs. 252.63 min, p = 0.05) and patient's expenditure were more (INR 70,654.29 vs. INR 41,314.73, p = 0.00). However, there was no significant difference between the economic statuses of patients in both groups. The study concluded that in this era of rapidly expanding health care scenario; targeted, regular, rigorous and repeated training programmes in future may shorten the learning curve thereby paving a way to reduce the cost as well as the operative time of robot-assisted surgeries in LMICs.

TI  - Improving the Spatiotemporal Resolution of Soil Moisture through a Synergistic Combination of MODIS and LANDSAT8 Data
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate soil moisture (SM) data with continuous spatiotemporal distribution has greatly contributed to various analyses in the fields of agricultural dryness and irrigation, regional water cycle, soil erosion, and energy exchange. While, spatial and temporal resolutions are practically in conflict with each other, data fusion is considered to be efficient for accessing spatiotemporally high resolution data. In the present research to obtain daily surface SM at a spatial resolution of 100 m, an Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) was used by combining Landsat8 and Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of SM retrieval, a novel scheme land surface temperature (LST)-vegetation index (VI) universal triangle was introduced to increase the LST retrieval accuracy using the TOPSIS method. This algorithm was also examined within two regions in Fars province in Iran. Simultaneously with the satellite passing through the study areas, SM of several points was measured by time-domain reflectometry (TDR). To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the error metrics including the coefficient of determination (R-2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were calculated between the in-situ SM measurements and those estimated. The resulted fusion SM was compared with the Landsat-derived and in-situ SM which reported lower (R-2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 0.005cm(3)/cm(3)) and higher (R-2 = 0.38 and RMSE = 0.048cm(3)/cm(3)) error values, respectively. The outcomes of the study indicated the high ability of the proposed fusion approach for achieving accurate and consistent SM monitoring by using the specified ESTARFM model, especially when the LST was obtained using the weighted average of several LST determination methods with TOPSIS method.

TI  - Incidence of lower respiratory tract infection and associated viruses in a birth cohort in the Philippines
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and young children. However, the etiological role of viruses and the timing of developing LRTI are not well defined. Methods We analyzed the data of a prospective cohort study in the Philippines as a birth cohort. We detected LRTI among children who visited healthcare facilities with respiratory symptom, and collected nasopharyngeal swabs for virus detection. We analyzed the incidence rates (IRs) and cumulative proportion of LRTI and severe LRTI by age group and each virus detected. Results A total of 350 LRTI episodes were observed from 473 child-years yielded from 419 children. The IRs of LRTI were 70.8, 70.7, and 80.8 per 100 child-years for 0-5, 6-11, and 12-23 months of age, respectively. By 12 months of age, 45% of children developed LRTI at least once. Rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus were the most frequently detected viruses in all age groups. However, the IRs of influenza virus were low especially at 0-5 months of age. Conclusions We identified various patterns of age-specific IRs of LRTI and severe LRTI for different viruses, which should be considered to establish more effective interventions including vaccinations.

TI  - Effects of the association between <i>Mimus saturninus</i> and <i>Furnarius rufus</i> on their foraging and alert behaviors
T2  - ORNITHOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies on the social behavior of birds have shown two main benefits of social groups: optimization of foraging and decreasing the risk of predation. We tested whether the association between rufous hornero (Furnarius rufus) and the chalk-browed mockingbird (Mimus saturninus) affects the foraging and alert/sentinel behaviors of both species. We also evaluated the influence of group size on these behaviors. During 60 h of observations on each species, the association was studied in a periurban area in Brazil with scan samplings. The presence of F. rufus increased the frequency of foraging while reducing the time that M. saturninus dedicated to alert/sentinel behaviors. For F. rufus, however, the presence of M. saturninus did not affect the studied behaviors, although a different study pointed out that this species could also benefit from the association with M. saturninus, indicating that both species may occasionally be positively affected by the association with each other.

TI  - Evaluation of soil erosion in Northern Algeria watershed using SWAT and RUSLE models
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil water erosion is a major phenomenon that threatens almost all watersheds in the Mediterranean area, nowadays. The worsening of this phenomenon in Algeria affects soil capacity to ensure its ecological functions and socio-economic purposes which depend on it. Concurrently, the storage capacity of Algeria dams has considerably decreased as a result of excessive silting. The above issue motivated this study, which aims to establish mechanisms for prioritizing to improve the economic efficiency of agricultural land and the long-term viability of dams in the largest metropolitan basin of Algeria 'Coastal Algiers 2a basin'. This basin, which is urbanized over 50% of its area, contains six large dams with a total capacity of 540 Million m(3) and one of the most important agricultural zones in Algeria. Common decision support frameworks have been implemented to predict the areas that are potentially exposed to erosion and sediment deposition threatening the dam capacity using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). To achieve this, rainfall, climatic, hydrometric, land use, soil, digital elevation, and satellite data were used by the two spatially soil loss models. The results show a dependency between the two statistical models with respect to low, medium and high erosion risk areas and its evolution from the eastern to the western region of the watershed. Regarding the deposition of sediments at the dams, the two models only partially explain the rate of sediments observed at the level of the dams' basins whose relative errors exceed 4%, 8%, 60%, 30% and 40% respectively for the Meurad, Bouroumi, Keddara, Boukerdane and El Hamiz dams. The canonical analysis (CC) revealed that the average slope, vegetation cover and the available water capacity in the soil of the basin are the most important parameters influencing the soil loss provided by the two models.

TI  - Long-term topographic effect on remotely sensed vegetation index-based gross primary productivity (GPP) estimation at the watershed scale
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of gross primary productivity (GPP) is crucial to understanding the feedback to global climate change. Due to the availability of remotely sensed vegetation index (VI) since the 1970s, VI-based models have been an effective tool to obtain spatial-continuous GPP estimates at a large scale. However, most VI-based models neglect the topographic effect on the vegetation photosynthesis and are more suitable for GPP estimation in flat areas. Moreover, the limited existing studies only focused on validating the mountain VI-based model at the site and watershed scales, and the long-term topographic effect on VI-based GPP estimation at the watershed scale is not yet known. In this work, a flat VI-based model (Temperature and Greenness, TG) and a mountain VI -based model (Mountain TG, MTG) were adopted to obtain time-series GPP estimates over a mountainous watershed during 2001-2021. Then, the long-term topographic effect on VI-based GPP estimation was summarized by investigating the spatial and temporal differences between TG and MTG -simulated GPP, as well as their sensitivities to climatic factors. Results illustrated that the MTG-simulated GPP presented a higher spatial variation than those from TG, with the coefficient of variation values of 64% and 45%, respectively. The high similarity between MTG-simulated GPP and DSR and LST were observed in seasonal variation during the growing season. During the 21-year period, MTG-simulated GPP presented a higher sensitivity to the time-series radiation than the TG-simulated GPP (a higher correlation coefficient value of 0.10), whereas it showed a lower sensitivity to the time-series temperature than the TG-simulated GPP (a lower correlation coefficient value of 0.04). The sensitivities of MTG-simulated GPP to the time-series DSR and LST significantly changed with the variations of topographic attributes (i.e., elevation, slope, aspect). These results revealed that the long-term topographic effect could regulate radiation and temperature and then influence the seasonal variation of vegetation photosynthesis over a mountainous watershed. Our study suggests the necessity of coupling the info of surface topography in estimating time-series GPP and highlights that more attention should be given to the long-term topographic effect on remotely sensed VI-based GPP estimation over mountainous watershed.

TI  - Sentinel animals for monitoring the environmental lead exposure: combination of traditional review and visualization analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - In nature, certain animals share a common living environment with humans, thus these animals have become biomonitors of health effects related to various environmental exposures. As one of the most toxic environmental chemicals, lead (Pb) can cause detriment health effects to animals, plants, and even humans through different exposure pathways such as atmosphere, soil, food, water, and dust, etc. Sentinel animals played an "indicative" role in the researches of environmental pollution monitoring and human health. In order to comprehend the usage of sentinel animals in the indication of environmental Pb pollution and human Pb exposure completely, a combination of traditional review and visualization analysis based on CiteSpace literature was used to review earlier researches in this study. In the first instance, present researches on exposure sources and exposure pathways of Pb were summarized briefly, and then the studies using sentinel animals to monitor environmental heavy metal pollution and human health were combed. Finally, visualization software CiteSpace 5.8.R3 was used to explore and analyze the hotspots and frontiers of lead exposure and sentinel animals researches at home and abroad. The results showed that certain mammals were good indicators for human lead exposure. Sentinel animals had been widely used to monitor the ecological environment and human lead exposure. Among them, the blood lead levels of small mammals, particularly for domestic dogs and cats, had a significant correlation with the blood lead levels of human living in the same environment. It indicated that certain biological indicators in animals can be used as surrogates to monitor human body exposure to heavy metals. This study also explored the challenges and perspectives that may be faced in sentinel animal research, in order to provide a certain theoretical basis and train of thought guidance for future research.

TI  - Growth dynamics and nutrient uptake of panicum maximum under nitrogen fertilisation
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the effects of nitrogen (N) fertilisation levels on structural, productive and morphogenetic traits, chlorophyll content, tiller number (TN) and macronutrient uptake capacity of three Panicum maximum cultivars (BRS Zuri, BRS Quenia and BRS Tamani). The experiment was laid out in a completely randomised design with five N doses (0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg dm(-3)). The concentration of chlorophyll increase linearly with increasing N doses in BRS Zuri. There was a significant interaction effect between cultivars and N doses on forage mass (FM), forage yield (FY), TN and the uptakes of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and sulfur. The BRS Zuri had the highest FY and FM independent of the applied N dose. In the dose range of 200 and 400 mg dm(-3) of N, there was no increase in the productive performance of BRS Tamani and BRS Quenia, which were similar to each other. N fertilisation increased TN. Higher N doses in the soil translated into greater N uptake by the grasses. Nitrogen application to the soil can increase the production and structural indices of Panicum maximum cultivars and increases grass growth, but its concentration must consider the productive capacity of the plant for this nutrient.

TI  - Revealing the paleolandscape features around the archaeological sites in the northern Nile Delta of Egypt using radar satellite imagery and GEE platform
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Egyptian civilization has long flourished along the banks of the Nile, in the south (e.g. Luxor and Aswan), the Middle (e.g. Giza 'Great Pyramids') and North (e.g. San El-Hagar and Buto), as well as the less populated areas of the Sinai Peninsula, the Western Desert and the Red Sea coast. There are archaeological sites date back to the Palaeolithic period and cover the Pre-dynastic, Pharaonic, Hellenistic-Roman, Coptic and Muslim periods. Across the Nile Delta, many of these archaeological sites have disappeared beneath Nile alluvium from the annual inundation or through intensive agricultural use, climate changes and other anthropogenic activities. This study aims to detect the long-term changes in the landscape of the archaeological area of Burullus on the Mediterranean shoreline in the North Delta of Egypt. By combining data from historic topographic maps with Radar Sentinel-1 (High-resolution Level-1 GRD) and SRTM data, topographic signatures in satellite imagery can be compared with the historic record of archaeological sites, many of which are now lost. Image layering, enhancement and analysis using ENVI 5.1, ArcMap 10.4.1 and Snap 8.0 software as well as Google Earth Pro facilitated the imagery identification and acquisition. The results of this study provide a means of quantifying the significant loss of cultural heritage sites due to anthropogenic and natural changes in the landscape. This analysis has also identified two-previously unknown-potential archaeological sites. Finally, the reconstruction of the paleolandscape of the study area shows the changing relationships of ancient and historic settlements with natural and man-made waterways over time. Integrating remote sensing data and historic maps offers a method for evaluating paleolandscapes and locating disappeared archaeological sites that can be applied in other areas of Egypt and the world.

TI  - Occurrence of multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria and resistance genes in semi-aquatic wildlife-<i> Trachemys</i><i> scripta,</i><i> Neovison</i><i> vison</i> and<i> Lutra</i><i> lutra</i>- as sentinels of environmental health
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacterial pathogens has been recognized as a major public health con-cern worldwide. In the present study, antimicrobial resistant Gram-negative bacteria (AMRGNB) and AMR genes were assessed in semi-aquatic wild animals from a highly populated and intensive farming region of Spain, Catalonia. Clo-acal/rectal swab samples were collected from 241 animals coming from invasive species Trachemys scripta (n = 91) and Neovison vison (n = 131), and endangered-protected species Lutra lutra (n = 19). Accordingly, 133 (55.2%) iso-lates were identified as AMRGNB. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens were among the bacteria most fre-quently isolated in all animal species, but other nosocomial agents such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. or Citrobacter freundii, were also prevalent. The phenotypic susceptibility testing showed the highest resistance to beta-lactams (91%). Molecular analysis showed 25.3% of turtles (15.4% ESBL/Ampc genes), 21% of Eurasian otters (10.5% ESBL/Ampc genes) and 14.5% of American minks (8.4% ESBL/Ampc genes) were positive to AMR genes. The genotyping frequency was tetM (20.6%), blaCMY-2 (13%), ermB (6.1%), blaCMY-1 (4.6%), blaCTX-M-15 (3.1%) and mcr-4 (0.8%). Turtles had a larger prevalence of AMRGNB and AMR genes than mustelids, but American mink car-ried mcr-4 colistin-resistance gene. Moreover, cluster analysis of AMR gene distribution revealed that an ESBL/AmpC cluster in a highly populated area comprising big metropolitan regions, and another tetM/emrB cluster in an expended area with highly intensive livestock production. Although the mcr-4 positive case was not included in those clusters, that case was found in a county with a high pig farm density. In conclusion, semi-aquatic wild animals are a good sentinel for environmental contamination with AMRGNB and AMR genes. Therefore, One Health Approach is urgently needed in highly populated regions, and with intensive livestock production like Catalonia.

TI  - Impact Assessment of Aerosol Optical Depth on Rainfall in Indian Rural Areas
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol significantly influences the life cycle of clouds and their formation. Many studies reported worldwide on anthropogenic aerosols and their impact on clouds and their optical properties. Atmospheric remote sensing provides the best way to estimate indirectly air quality surveillance and management in megacities of developing countries like India where many cities have elevated concentration profiles of air pollutants with inadequate coverage of spatial and temporal monitoring. The results of the study highlighted the impact on rainfall patterns due to aerosol optical depth (AOD) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for a total of 7 years (2015-2021) over five different Indian rural sites by using MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The AOD (550 nm) and PM2.5 were retrieved from the MODIS sensor Terra satellites and the MEERA 2 model, respectively. Also, we have analyzed in this study the relationship of AOD (550 nm) with PM2.5 and meteorological variables (temperature relative humidity and precipitation) over Indian rural sites during 2015-2021. The maximum concentration of AOD (550 nm) has been measured for Gandhi college (2.94 +/- 0.44) and minimum for ARM college (0.01 +/- 0.28), while the maximum concentration of PM2.5 has been measured for ARM College 296.37 (mu g m(-3)) and minimum for Karunya University 0.02 (mu g m(-3)). Also, the relation between AOD (550 nm) with total precipitation is measured positively for all locations except Gandhi college whereby PM2.5 associated with total precipitation is measured negatively for all locations except ARM college. Finally, the relationship between PM2.5 and AOD (550 nm) is measured positively in all selected locations except Singhad Institute. The maximum rainfall has been observed for monsoon months (June-August) and post-monsoon months (October) for all locations during the study period. The maximum total precipitation has been measured for Singhad 11,674.7 (mm) and the minimum for Karunya University 4563.41 (mm). However, the results of the study indicated that there was no direct trend observed in AOD in five different selected rural Indian sites.

TI  - Satellite magnetic data reveal interannual waves in Earth's core
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth's magnetic field displays variations on a broad range of time scales, from years to hundreds of millions of years. The last two decades of global and continuous satellite geomagnetic field monitoring have considerably enriched the knowledge on the rapid physical processes taking place in the Earth's outer core. Identification of axisymmetric torsional Alfven waves with subdecadal periods from observatory and satellite data has given access to an averaged intensity of the magnetic field in the Earth's core interior. A significant part of the rapid signal, however, resides in nonaxisymmetric motions. Their origin has remained elusive, as previous studies of magnetohydrodynamic waves in the Earth's core mainly focused on their possible signature on centennial time scales. Here, we identify nonaxisymmetric wavelike patterns in the equatorial region of the core surface from the observed geomagnetic variations. These wavelike features have large spatial scales, interannual periods in the vicinity of 7 y, amplitudes reaching 3 km/y, and coherent westward drift at phase speeds of about 1,500 km/y. We interpret and model these flows as the signature of Magneto-Coriolis (MC) eigenmodes. Their identification offers a way to probe the cylindrical radial component of the magnetic field inside Earth's core. It follows from our work that there is no need for a stratified layer at the top of the core to account for the rapid geomagnetic field changes.

TI  - Widespread greening suggests increased dry-season plant water availability in the Rio Santa valley, Peruvian Andes
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the semi-arid Peruvian Andes, the growing season is mostly determined by the timing of the onset and retreat of the wet season, to which annual crop yields are highly sensitive. Recently, local farmers in the Rio Santa basin (RSB) reported more erratic rainy season onsets and further challenges related to changes in rainfall characteristics. Previous studies based on local rain gauges, however, did not find any significant long-term rainfall changes, potentially linked to the scarce data basis and inherent difficulties in capturing the highly variable rainfall distribution typical for complex mountain terrain. To date, there remains considerable uncertainty in the RSB regarding changes in plant-available water over the last decades. In this study, we exploit satellite-derived information of high-resolution vegetation greenness as an integrated proxy to derive variability and trends of plant water availability. By combining MODIS Aqua and Terra vegetation indices (VIs), datasets of precipitation (both for 2000-2020) and soil moisture (since 2015), we explore recent spatio-temporal changes in the vegetation growing season. We find the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to be coupled to soil moisture on a sub-seasonal basis, while NDVI and rainfall only coincide on interannual timescales. Over 20 years, we find significant greening in the RSB, particularly pronounced during the dry season (austral winter), indicating an overall increase in plant-available water over the past 2 decades. The start of the growing season (SOS) exhibits high interannual variability of up to 2 months compared to the end of the growing season (EOS), which varies by up to 1 month, therefore dominating the variability of the growing season length (LOS). The EOS becomes significantly delayed over the analysis period, matching the observed dry-season greening. While both in situ and gridded rainfall datasets show incoherent changes in annual rainfall for the region, Climate Hazards InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) rainfall suggests significant positive dry-season trends for 2 months coinciding with the most pronounced greening. As the greening signal is strongly seasonal and reaches high altitudes on unglaciated valley slopes, we cannot link this signal to water storage changes on timescales beyond one rainy season, making interannual rainfall variability the most likely driver. Exploring El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) control on greening, we find an overall increased LOS linked to an earlier SOS in El Nino years, which however cannot explain the observed greening and delayed EOS. While our study could not corroborate anecdotal evidence of recent changes, we confirm that the SOS is highly variable and conclude that rainfed farming in the RSB would profit from future efforts being directed towards improving medium-range forecasts of the rainy season onset.

TI  - Lymphedema After Axillary Lymph Node Dissection in Breast Cancer: Prevalence and Risk Factors-A Single-Center Retrospective Study
T2  - LYMPHATIC RESEARCH AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymphedema may develop when axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) injures and obstructs the lymph ducts in the upper limb. In patients with breast cancer, lymphedema is difficult to treat and can cause arm swelling, heaviness, and restricted movement. We aimed to identify the prevalence and risk factors for lymphedema after ALND in patients with breast cancer.Methods and Results: This retrospective study included 175 patients with breast cancer who underwent ALND in the Nagasaki University Hospital, Japan, between 2005 and 2018. Lymphedema was defined as symptomatic arm swelling with a >2-cm difference in the arm circumference between the affected and contralateral arms. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of lymphedema. Surgical and pathological findings were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, including the chi-square test, Student's t-test, and logistic regression analysis. Lymphedema was prevalent in 20% of the study participants, and the mean time interval from surgery to development of lymphedema was 479 days. In the univariate analysis, a body mass index of >26 kg/m(2), smoking, radiotherapy (RT), and dissection of >18 axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) significantly increased the risk of lymphedema. In the multivariate analysis, smoking, RT, and dissection of >18 ALNs significantly increased the risk of lymphedema.Conclusions: The prevalence of lymphedema in our study was 20%. Our findings suggest that smoking, RT, and dissection of >18 ALNs are risk factors for lymphedema. Aggressive and empiric ALND might be associated with axillary lymph duct damage.

TI  - How did the Chinese Loess Plateau turn green from 2001 to 2020? An explanation using satellite data
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation growth of the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) has improved since the launch of the Grain to Green Programme. This study examined the mechanism of spatial differentiation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the relative contributions of climate variations (CV) and human activities (HA) to variations in inter-annual NDVI in the CLP for 2001-2020. The response of NDVI to afforestation was examined and the trend of projected future NDVI was identified using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and other correlative data. The results showed that: (1) precipitation, sunshine duration, relative humidity, solar radiations, and vegetation type were the dominant factors affecting the spatial distribution of NDVI. All interactive explanatory powers of two factors exceeded those of any individual factor, and the interactions between natural and anthropogenic factors had significant effects on NDVI. (2) Variation in NDVI in 88.77% of the total area was influenced by the combined effect of HA and CV, and HA was the dominant factor with relative a contribution of 68.44%. (3) There was an increasing (2001-2005) followed by a decreasing (2006-2019) pattern of annual area of afforestation in each province. The seven provinces showed extremely significant correlations (p < 0.01) between the cumulative area of afforestation and NDVI. (4) The trend in the change in NDVI exhibited the unsustainability of development of the CLP, with 63.20% of regions at risk of vegetation degradation. Finally, the present study suggests that forests in arid and semi-arid areas following a row-belt distribution with low coverage composed of narrow forest belts (covering an area of 15-25%) and wide natural vegetation restoration (covering an area of 75-85%) may be more appropriate for restoration of the regional ecology.

TI  - Effects of population spatial redistribution on vegetation greenness: A case study of Chongqing, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous increase in urbanization and non-farm wages, many rural labor forces have transferred to urban areas, significantly changing the population distribution and affecting vegetation restoration and ecological environment improvement. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation in Chongqing from 2000 to 2018 based on the MODIS EVI dataset, and 862 samples were randomly selected to quantitatively analyze the contribution degree of population emigration to vegetation greenness by using the multivariate linear regression model under the conditions of controlling climate, topography, and policy factors. The results showed that the vegetation in Chongqing presented a significant improvement trend. Human ac-tivities played a dominant role in the vegetation restoration in Chongqing from 2000 to 2018. The contribution of population spatial redistribution to vegetation changes was 62.47%, and the contributions gradually decreased with increasing elevation, which were 73.90%, 45.02%, and 17.87% in the low, medium, and high altitude areas, respectively. Furthermore, the Grain-for-Green program significantly affected vegetation variation, and the project had the greatest ecological benefits in medium-altitude areas.

TI  - Salt-marsh retreat on different time scales: Issues and prospects from a 5-year monitoring campaign in the Venice Lagoon
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lateral edge erosion is one of the main mechanisms leading to loss volume of salt marshes. Given the relatively large number of field measurements of eroding salt marshes reported in the literature, and the different ways they were performed, some natural questions arise. (i) What is the relationship between wave climate and erosion rate at different time scales? (ii) How can the surveys based on a single meteorological event support large-scale monitoring campaigns? (iii) What are the main meteorological and morphological parameters correlated to the erosion process? (iv) Why do only some marshes show cantilever profiles? (v) What are the most common issues to deal with in monitoring campaigns? Most of the previous studies considered large spatial and temporal scales only, providing an estimation of the overall behaviour of the system without identifying the specific role of each event. In this study, we attempted to answer these questions by investigating the lateral evolution of salt marsh margins located in the Venice Lagoon at different time scales, combining marsh retreat measurements, remote sensing data and numerical modelling. Field data were collected monthly for 5 years (2014-2018), covering 26 storms. A linear relation linking erosion rate to wave power is confirmed at different time scales, with a decreasing slope at higher elevation of the marsh bank that explains the occurrence of cantilever profiles. Mass failures can occur over long-period cycles, related to the geomorphic characteristics of the area. Finally, the major issues affecting the in-situ monitoring campaigns have been highlighted.

TI  - Temporal analysis of desertification vulnerability in Northeast Brazil using Google Earth Engine
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive agricultural production has negative environmental impacts, increasing predisposition to desertification in areas with inadequate soil management. To evaluate the effects of agriculture, we aimed to perform a temporal analysis and analyze the development of desertification in Northeast Brazil. Initially, the region was separated into four climatic zones, grouping the locations with similar characteristics of air temperature and rainfall. In the analyses, images of the northeast region acquired from the Landsat 5 (1989, 1999, and 2009) and Landsat 8 (2019) satellites were processed using the Google Earth Engine platform. The periods were separated into dry and rainy periods, according to the climatic zones. The evaluation of vegetation index, characterization of the remaining vegetation cover, landscape pattern, and meteorological conditions were performed, respectively, through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index, and albedo of the terrestrial surface. The desertification index showed an increase in susceptible areas when comparing the interval from 1989 to 2019. In general, our results showed that there is less predisposition for desertification to occur during the rainy season. Also, when the results of our study were compared to official data released by the National Program of Action to Combat Desertification and Mitigate the Effects of Drought, there was disagreement regarding the classification of areas.

TI  - Diel activity patterns of two distinct populations of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> in Miami, FL and Brownsville, TX
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The diel biting activity of Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L) populations was extensively investigated in the early 1900s to gain more information on the biology of Ae. aegypti, and this information was used to devise effective approaches to controlling populations of this species and protect the human population from widespread arbovirus outbreaks. However, few contemporary studies are available regarding the diel activity patterns of Ae. aegypti. To assess the diel activity patterns of Ae. aegypti in southern Florida and Texas, we conducted 96-h uninterrupted mosquito collections once each month from May through November 2019 in Miami, Florida, and Brownsville, Texas, using BG-Sentinel 2 Traps. The overall diel activity pattern in both cities was bimodal with morning and evening peak activity between 7:00 and 8:00 and between 19:00 and 20:00. There were significant daily, monthly, seasonal, and site-specific differences in activity patterns, but these differences did not affect the overall peak activity times. These differences suggest daily, monthly, seasonal, and site-specific variations in human exposure to Ae. aegypti. Our observations can be used in planning and executing Ae. aegypti vector control activities in southern Florida and southern Texas, specifically those targeting the adult mosquito populations.

TI  - Non-contrast CT markers of intracerebral hematoma expansion: a reliability study
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives We evaluated whether clinicians agree in the detection of non-contrast CT markers of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) expansion. Methods From our local dataset, we randomly sampled 60 patients diagnosed with spontaneous ICH. Fifteen physicians and trainees (Stroke Neurology, Interventional and Diagnostic Neuroradiology) were trained to identify six density (Barras density, black hole, blend, hypodensity, fluid level, swirl) and three shape (Barras shape, island, satellite) expansion markers, using standardized definitions. Thirteen raters performed a second assessment. Inter- and intra-rater agreement were measured using Gwet's AC(1), with a coefficient > 0.60 indicating substantial to almost perfect agreement. Results Almost perfect inter-rater agreement was observed for the swirl (0.85, 95% CI: 0.78-0.90) and fluid level (0.84, 95% CI: 0.76-0.90) markers, while the hypodensity (0.67, 95% CI: 0.56-0.76) and blend (0.62, 95% CI: 0.51-0.71) markers showed substantial agreement. Inter-rater agreement was otherwise moderate, and comparable between density and shape markers. Inter-rater agreement was lower for the three markers that require the rater to identify one specific axial slice (Barras density, Barras shape, island: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.40-0.52 versus others: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.56-0.63). Inter-observer agreement did not differ when stratified for raters' experience, hematoma location, volume, or anticoagulation status. Intra-rater agreement was substantial to almost perfect for all but the black hole marker. Conclusion In a large sample of raters with different backgrounds and expertise levels, only four of nine non-contrast CT markers of ICH expansion showed substantial to almost perfect inter-rater agreement.

TI  - Do image resolution and classifier choice impact island biogeographical parameters of terrestrial islands?
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Island biogeography provides concepts for conservation management as fragmented habitats are comparable to ocean islands. Remote sensing can help to extract terrestrial habitat islands on the landscape scale. However, little is known about the effects of image resolution and classification algorithms on resulting island size and related parameters. We study the combined effect of three image resolutions (2, 10, and 30 m) and three classification algorithms (Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) by extracting quartz islands from WorldView-2 imagery using image segmentation. We compared four island parameters (i.e., area, distance, shape index, and perimeter-area ratio between resolutions and classifiers). We found that in all cases, image resolution and classification algorithms had a strong effect. However, image resolution was more important for area and shape. Artificial Neural Network always provided the best performance as a classifier (OA: 0.880, kappa: 0.801, F1: 0.912). Hence, conservation strategies could lead to different results when different pattern extraction strategies are applied. Future studies which aim at extracting terrestrial habitat islands from image datasets should aim for the highest possible resolution and compare the outcomes of different classifiers to ensure the best possible results.

TI  - Comparative analysis of driving forces of land use/cover change in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Selenga River Basin*
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Selenga River Basin is an important section of the Sino-Mongolian Economic Corridor. It is an important connecting part of the Eurasian Continental Bridge and an important part of Northeast Asia. Comparative analysis of land use changes and their driving forces in the middle and lower reaches of the watershed is an important tool to reveal regional ecosystem changes, which is of great scientific guidance to ensure regional ecological security. This paper takes Selenge County in the upper reaches of Selenga River Basin, Sukhbaatar City in the middle reaches and Ulan-Ude City in the lower reaches as the case areas to compare and analyse the land use change changes based on Landsat remote sensing image data. The partial least squares regression model is used to discuss the driving forces by combining natural and socio-economic factors. The results show the following: (1) Selenge County is overloaded with overgrazing; Sukhbaatar city, as a region with very suitable soil and water conditions in Mongolia, the area of cultivated land is expanding. Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in Ulan-Ude, the abandonment of farming has been severe due to the reduction of the agricultural population, resulting in a reduction in the area of cultivated land. (2) The upper reaches of the region should focus on preventing overgrazing, which leads to desertification. In the middle reaches, it is necessary to prevent the overcultivation of cultivated land. In the lower reaches, the damage to the Lake Baikal ecosystem, a natural heritage of mankind, should be prevented by the rapid expansion of urban space.

TI  - Parental education related to their children's health in late childhood and early adolescence for Pacific families within New Zealand
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pacific people continue to carry a disproportionately heavy social and health burden relative to their non-Pacific peers in New Zealand, and those with less formal education are experiencing social and health declines. Improving education and educational needs is seen as being central to decreasing these health inequities. While expansive, the empirical evidence-base supporting this stance is relatively weak and increasingly conflicting. Using a large birth cohort of 1,368 eligible Pacific children, together with their mothers and fathers, this study longitudinally investigates the relationship between paternal education levels and sentinel measures of their children's physical health, mental health and health risk taking behaviours during late childhood and early adolescence. In adjusted analyses, it was found that mothers and fathers who undertook further schooling over the 0-6 years postpartum period had children with significantly lower logarithmically transformed body mass index increases at 11-years and 14-years measurement waves compared to 9-years levels than those who did not study (p = 0.017 and p = 0.022, respectively). Furthermore, fathers who undertook further schooling over this 0-6 years postpartum period also had children with significantly lower odds of risk taking behaviours (p = 0.013). These results support policy aimed at increasing educational opportunities for Pacific people in New Zealand.

TI  - Comparison of plasma levobupivacaine concentrations with and without epinephrine following erector spinae plane block for breast cancer surgery: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The erector spinae plane (ESP) block requires a large volume of local anesthetic to provide effective analgesia, which has the potential to cause local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). Adjunctive epinephrine slows the entry of local anesthetic into the plasma and decreases its toxic effect on vulnerable tissues. We compared plasma levobupivacaine concentrations with and without epinephrine after ESP blocks for breast cancer surgery.Methods: In this prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, 35 patients who underwent elective unilateral partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy were enrolled. The patients were randomized to group L (ESP block with 2 mg/kg levobupivacaine) or LE (ESP block with 2 mg/kg levobupivacaine and 5 mu g/mL epinephrine). Blood samples were obtained at 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after the ESP block, and plasma concentrations of levobupivacaine were compared.Results: Twenty-nine patients were included in the analysis. The maximum plasma concentration (C-max) and the time to maximum concentration (T-max) were, respectively, 1.24 mu g/mL and 6.0 min in group L and 0.62 mu g/mL and 7.2 min in group LE. The two groups showed no significant differences in the numerical rating scale scores immediately after extubation and 5 and 9 h after the ESP block, or in the interval from the ESP block to the first rescue analgesia. No patient developed symptoms suggestive of LAST.Conclusions: A single bolus of 2 mg/kg levobupivacaine in the ESP block resulted in a short T-max with high C-max. Adding epinephrine to levobupivacaine decreased the C-max and delayed the T-max after ESP blocks but had no effect on postoperative analgesia.

TI  - Ethnoichthyology and Ethnotaxonomy of the Kichwa Indigenous People of <i>Arawanu</i> (Arajuno), in the Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon Basin is home to a great number of Indigenous nationalities that have coevolved with aquatic habitats and fish resulting in a precise traditional ecological knowledge. Nevertheless, this biocultural heritage is threatened by the degradation of rivers and fisheries, and cultural erosion. This research was designed and carried out in the community of Arawanu (Arajuno in Spanish), in the Ecuadorian Amazon, and was requested by the local Kichwa people looking for guidance to gather, systematize and disseminate their ethnoichthyological knowledge. Data collection was carried out through participatory workshops using the pile sorting technique in group dynamics, to identify, name and classify local fish and compile biocultural information about them. From the Linnaean taxonomic perspective, 86 taxa were identified, included in 26 families, and corresponded with 16 Kichwa ethnofamilies and 58 ethnospecies. Five classification levels were identified: (I) Aycha: unique beginner-Animalia kingdom; (II) Yaku Aycha: life form-Pisces superclass; (III) Ayllukuna: ethnofamilies-Linnaean families; (IV) Ethnogenera-Linnaean genus; and (V) Ethnospecies-Linnaean species. A one-to-one correspondence was registered between 35 Kichwa ethnospecies and Linnean species, along with one case of over-differentiation and 21 cases of subdifferentiation (Type A: 7; Type B: 14). The Kichwa ethnoichthyological classification is multidimensional and considers attributes like skin and scales, fishbones and spines, meat quality, body shape, diet, and salience. Of the 58 ethnospecies, 38 were valued for consumption, while medicinal and spiritual uses were mentioned for 40 of them. The participatory work created a forum to discuss the value and threats to ichthyofauna and freshwater systems, enabled the dissemination of their biocultural heritage, and highlighted the cultural relevance of hydro-social ecosystems in their livelihood. The collected information may be critical to adapt local education systems to the Kichwa worldview and to pass down traditional ecological knowledge to future generations, fostering a respectful, careful and conscious relationship between humans and nature. Our results offer a solid and novel information compilation and practical guidance for participatory ethnobiological surveys. Additionally, the ethnobiological and the ethnotaxonomical information establishes the basis to develop sustainable fishing strategies and promote conservation of the local ichthyofauna.

TI  - Developing a method for assessing environmental sustainability based on the Google Earth Engine platform
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental sustainability is the foundation and of great significance for the sustainable development of urban agglomerations. Taking the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration as an example, we developed a method to effectively assess long-term regional environmental sustainability based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We used the GEE to obtain 5206 Landsat remote sensing images in the region from 1983 to 2016 and developed the comprehensive environmental index (CEI) to assess regional environmental sustainability based on the theme-oriented framework proposed by the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development. We found that the environmental sustainability of the urban agglomeration showed a trend of first rising, then falling, and then rising again in the past 30 years. The average CEI increased from 0.621 to 0.631 from 1985 to 1990, dropped to the lowest value of 0.618 in 2000, and then rose to the highest value of 0.672 in 2015. In particular, the extent of areas in which environmental sustainability improved (56% of the region) was greater than the extent of areas in which environmental deterioration occurred. The environmental sustainability of Hengshui, Xingtai, and Cangzhou in the southeast of the region has been significantly improved. The method proposed in this study provides an automatic, rapid, and extensible way to assess regional environmental sustainability and provides a scientific reference for improving the sustainability of the regional environment.

TI  - MFFENet and ADANet: a robust deep transfer learning method and its application in high precision and fast cross-scene recognition of earthquake-induced landslides
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic recognition and segmentation methods have become an essential requirement in identifying large-scale earthquake-induced landslides. This used to be conducted through pixel-based or object-oriented methods. However, these methods fail to develop an accurate, rapid, and cross-scene solution for earthquake-induced landslide recognition because of the massive amount of remote sensing data and variations in different earthquake scenarios. To fill this research gap, this paper proposes a robust deep transfer learning scheme for high precision and fast recognition of regional landslides. First, a Multi-scale Feature Fusion regime with an Encoder-decoder Network (MFFENet) is proposed to extract and fuse the multi-scale features of objects in remote sensing images, in which a novel and practical Adaptive Triangle Fork (ATF) Module is designed to integrate the useful features across different scales effectively. Second, an Adversarial Domain Adaptation Network (ADANet) is developed to perform different seismic landslide recognition tasks, and a multi-level output space adaptation scheme is proposed to enhance the adaptability of the segmentation model. Experimental results on standard remote sensing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MFFENet and ADANet. Finally, a comprehensive and general scheme is proposed for earthquake-induced landslide recognition, which integrates image features extracted from MFFENet and ADANet with the side information including landslide geologic features, bi-temporal changing features, and spatial analysis. The proposed scheme is applied in two earthquake-induced landslides in Jiuzhaigou (China) and Hokkaido (Japan), using available pre- and post-earthquake remote sensing images. These experiments show that the proposed scheme presents a state-of-the-art performance in regional landslide identification and performs stably and robustly in different seismic landslide recognition tasks. Our proposed framework demonstrates a competitive performance for high-precision, high-efficiency, and cross-scene recognition of earthquake disasters, which may serve as a new starting point for the application of deep learning and transfer learning methods in earthquake-induced landslide recognition.

TI  - Determining the benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in reduction of axillary dissection rates in Z0011 trial cohort with high nodal burden
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In breast cancer patients fulfilling the Z0011 trial criteria, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is reserved for patients with a high nodal burden of >_3 metastatic nodes. In this group of patients, to avoid an ALND, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) could be given instead to achieve nodal pathological complete response (pCR). However, the benefit of NACT in achieving nodal pCR and avoiding ALND in this group of patients is unknown. We aimed to determine the nodal pCR rate in this group of patients who otherwise would have needed an ALND. Methods: cT1-2N0 breast cancer patients, with histologically proven nodal metastasis, who underwent NACT were identified from a prospectively maintained database. The sonographic criteria of >_3 abnormal nodes, which has been reported as highly predictive of high nodal burden, was then used to identify the high nodal burden group. Nodal pCR was determined based on the ALND following NACT. Results: Twenty-four patients with high nodal burden were identified. Mean age was 55.2 years. 91.6% had invasive ductal carcinoma and 29.1% had grade III cancer. 54.2% achieved nodal pCR which was associated with ypT (P=0.006). Nodal pCR was 75%, 70% and 30% in the triple negative, HER2 positive and ER/ PR+HER2-tumors, respectively. Conclusions: In the postulated T1-2 breast cancer patients with high nodal burden, needing an upfront ALND, NACT could result in nodal pCR of 54.2%, with higher pCR in certain subtypes. Hence, to minimize ALND risk, NACT should be offered in this high nodal burden group.

TI  - Inflammation in dementia with Lewy bodies
T2  - NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common neurodegenerative cause of dementia, behind Alzheimer's disease (AD). The profile of inflammation in AD has been extensively researched in recent years, with evidence that chronic peripheral inflammation in midlife increases the risk of late-onset AD, and data supporting inflammation being associated with disease progression. In contrast, our understanding of the role of inflammation in DLB is less developed. Most research to date has examined inflammation in related disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, but there is now a growing range of literature examining inflammation in DLB itself. We present a review of the literature in this field, exploring a range of research methodologies including those quantifying markers of inflammation in cerebrospinal fluid, peripheral blood, post-mortem brain tissue, and using neuroimaging and preclinical data. Our review reveals evidence from PET imaging and peripheral blood analysis to support an increase in cerebral and peripheral inflammation in mild or prodromal DLB, that dissipates with disease progression. We present evidence from post-mortem brain tissue and pre-clinical studies that indicate alpha-synuclein directly promotes inflammation, but that also support the presence of AD co-pathology as an important factor in the profile of neuroinflammation in DLB. We propose that specific markers of inflammation may play a sentinel role in the mild stage of the disease, particularly when combined with AD pathology. We advocate further examination of the profile of inflammation in DLB through robust longitudinal studies, to enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. The goal should be to utilise future results to develop a composite biomarker to aid diagnosis of DLB, and to potentially identify novel therapeutic targets.

TI  - Communicable Diseases Intelligence Surveillance for severe influenza and COVID-19 in patients admitted to sentinel Australian hospitals in 2020: the Influenza Complications Alert Network (FluCAN)
T2  - COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionInfluenza is a common cause of acute respiratory infection, and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infection that emerged as a pandemic worldwide before the start of the 2020 Australian influenza season. This report summarises the epidemiology of hospitalisations with laboratory-confirmed influenza and COVID-19 during the 2020 influenza season in a sentinel surveillance system.MethodsThe Influenza Complications Alert Network (FluCAN) is a sentinel hospital-based surveillance program that operates at sites in all jurisdictions in Australia. Influenza and COVID-19 cases were defined as patients hospitalised at sentinel hospitals and confirmed by nucleic acid detection.ResultsThere were 448 patients with COVID-19 admitted between 16 March and 31 December 2020, and only 20 patients with influenza admitted between 1 April and 30 November 2020, to one of 22 FluCAN hospitals. Of the COVID-19 cases, 173 (39%) were > 65 years of age, 36 (8%) were children (< 16 years), 6 (1%) were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, 4 (1%) were pregnant and 289 (65%) had chronic comorbidities. COVID-19 hospital admissions peaked between weeks 13 and 15 (first wave) nationally, and again between weeks 31 and 35 (Victoria), with most admissions represented by those above 40 years of age.DiscussionThere was an unusually low number of hospital admissions with laboratory-confirmed influenza in this season, compared to recent seasons. This is likely to be due to effective public health interventions and international border closures as a result of a rise in COVID-19 respiratory infections and associated hospitalisations.

TI  - Influence of Hamoun Lakes' dry conditions on dust emission and radiative forcing over Sistan plain, Iran
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Proximity to large desert areas, 120-day winds in Sistan, runs of severe drought periods, and control of the inflowing upstream waters have led to the drying up of Hamoun Lakes. These factors have transformed the Sistan plain into one of the most active sources of dust emission in southwestern Asia. Accordingly, the present study relied on a framework of spatio-temporal modeling to evaluate the effects of water body changes on dust emission and its climatic feedback across the Sistan plain. The research used remote sensing indices based on the long-term archive of Landsat 5, 7, and 8 data in the 1990-2021 period. The WRF-Chem model was applied under three scenarios including unchanged, 50%, and 100% drying of water bodies in two modes of with and without dust aerosol simulation and their atmospheric radiative feedbacks. The results show that with the drying of water bodies, dust emission increases by an average of about 40% (up to 80%). These conditions affect the radiative forcing of dust aerosol, including intensification of cooling/heating due to the reduction/increasing of shortwave (SW) radiation perturbation on average from-14 to-34 W/m(2) at the bottom of the atmosphere (BOA) and from 0.9 to 2.1 W/m(2) at top of the atmosphere (TOA). Additionally, these condition leads to the intensification of heating due to the increase in longwave (LW) radiation at BOA and TOA from 8.9 to 15 W/m(2) and from 4.3 to 7.7 W/m(2), respectively. Therefore, it can be acknowledged that in the 1990-2021 period, the drying of Hamoun Lakes has intensified the surface cooling by reducing net radiation (SW + LW) at the surface.

TI  - Worldview complexity: The challenge of intersecting diversities for conceptualising diversity
T2  - SOCIAL COMPASS
M3  - Article
AB  - Social science analysis of diversity, and religious diversity in particular, has long struggled to move beyond simple binaries of religious-secular, religious-spiritual, traditional-modern, global north-global south, and so on. Twenty-first century realities test existing terms and find them wanting. While concepts such as the postsecular, multiple modernities, multiple secularities, and non-religion point to new lines of analysis, each still refers to binary and thereby limiting terms. This article reviews research on religious diversity, delineating some of the major challenges posed. Building on useful frameworks of superdiversity, multiple pluralities, and religious complexity, we argue that the more widely encompassing concept of worldview complexity might represent a better way forward. It has the advantage of acknowledging the intersecting diversity of diversities in multiple, differing contexts, and abiding similarities in what is occurring 'beneath religion'.

With the introduction of targeted and immune therapies for advanced melanoma, including at the adjuvant setting, early detection of recurrent melanoma and/or second primary lesions is crucial to improve clinical outcomes. However, there is a lack of universal guidelines regarding both frequency of surveillance visits and diagnostic imaging and/or laboratory evaluations. In this article, a multidisciplinary expert panel recommends, after careful review of relevant data in the field, a consensus- and experience-based follow-up strategy for melanoma patients, taking into account prognostic factors and biomarkers and the high-risk periods and patterns of recurrence in each (sub) stage of the disease. Apart from the surveillance intensity, healthcare professionals should focus on patients' education to perform regular self-examinations of the skin and palpation of lymph nodes.

TI  - Implications of systemic adjuvant melanoma treatments for UK melanoma services: Results of the UK Melanoma Adjuvant Pathway Survey
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To understand current U.K. management pathways for patients with resected stage III melanoma and changes expected with the routine availability of systemic adjuvant melanoma treatments. Methods In April-May 2018 (pre-National Institute for Health and Care Excellence approval of adjuvant therapy), 49 structured interviews were conducted with U.K. health professionals involved in melanoma management (28 oncology, 12 dermatology and 9 surgery) from 34 geographically dispersed National Health Service Trusts (1-6 respondents/Trust). Results Respondents expect to see a median of 5 (range 1-35) patients/month eligible for adjuvant therapy. Currently, 31 (63%) respondents include standardised BRAFV600 mutation testing for primary melanoma in their local guidelines; 30 (61%) respondents are from centres offering sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) on-site after excision of melanoma from the trunk/limbs; 21 (43%) after excision of head/neck melanoma. Referral for SLNB (if not performed on site) is not always offered. With systemic adjuvant treatments becoming routinely available, respondents expect oncology involvement in patient care to increase considerably. Significant impacts are predicted on staffing, training, commissioning, service structure, local guidelines and patient psychological support requirements. Conclusion The routine availability of systemic adjuvant melanoma treatments is expected to have wide-ranging implications for the commissioning, organisation and delivery of melanoma services.

T2  - COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This report describes influenza surveillance activities in Australia for the period 2011 to 2018. Data were extracted from several sources constituting the National Influenza Surveillance Scheme (NISS). Laboratory-confirmed influenza notification rates (per 100,000 population) increased from 122 in 2011 to 1,021 in 2017, before declining to 235 in 2018. The highest laboratory-confirmed notification rates during the eight-year period were from the smaller jurisdictions (South Australia and the Northern Territory), except in 2016 when Queensland reported the highest rate. Similar trends were observed in community reports of influenza-like illness (ILI), presentations of ILI to sentinel general practice (GP) sites, and influenza hospitalisations.Children aged 14 years or younger, and adults 65 years of age or older, had the highest notification rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza. Adults aged 65 years or older and patients with comorbidities had higher rates of influenza-associated hospitalisations and mortality. Over half of eligible patients admitted to sentinel hospitals (57%) received oseltamivir treatment, with 17% receiving the treatment within 48 hours of symptom onset.Influenza type A predominated over the eight years, except in 2015 when type B predominated. This trend was consistent with Australian World Health Organization Collaborating Centre (WHOCC) data for influenza isolates tested. Of influenza viruses circulating during the reporting period, A(H1N1) viruses were mostly antigenically similar to the vaccine strain A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), except in 2017 and 2018 when they were mostly similar to A/Michigan/45/2015. The A(H3N2) strains varied over the years but included the vaccine strains A/Perth/16/2009, A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, and A/Singapore/INFIMH/2016. The B/Victoria/2/87 lineage (represented by the 2016 vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008) and the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage (represented by the southern hemisphere 2015 vaccine strain B/Phuket/3073/2013) were the circulating influenza B viruses during the reporting period. Influenza B accounted for just under a third of notifications (32%) from 2011 to 2018. Fifty-four per cent of influenza B viruses characterised by the Australian WHOCC site during the eight-year period were from the Yamagata lineage, although the proportion was higher (67%) when analysing the most recent four years (2015 to 2018). In contrast, during the 2010 season, 99% of all influenza B viruses characterised by the Australian WHOCC site were in the B-Victoria lineage.During the 2018 season the Australian WHOCC site detected, for the first time, swine A(H3N2)v virus from a human patient in Australia, highlighting the need to maintain vigilance for zoonotic infections.

TI  - Large-scale land restoration improved drought resilience in Ethiopia's degraded watersheds
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic land degradation, exacerbated by more frequent and intense weather shocks due to climate change, threatens the livelihoods of rural populations in developing economies. Development agencies have invested heavily in sustainable land management projects to overturn land productivity losses, but efforts to assess project impacts have been hampered by operational issues and by the high costs of gathering on-ground data. This study combines satellite observations (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer-based Enhanced Vegetation Index and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2-derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence-based gross primary production) with quasi-experimental impact evaluation methods to examine the impacts of the Sustainable Land Management Project in Ethiopia, one of the world's most ambitious restoration efforts to date. We find that over a five-year effective implementation period, gross primary production in treated locations grew by 13.5% on average in areas affected by severe droughts (those with a standard precipitation index lower than -2) and by 3.1% in areas that did not experience droughts, suggesting important drought-buffering effects. We provide empirical evidence about the effectiveness of sustainable land management projects in restoring land productivity and resilience to weather shocks, and show that remote-sensing technologies can be incorporated into impact evaluation models to assess ecosystem restoration programmes.Assessing the effectiveness of restoration projects faces challenges due to operational issues and the high costs of gathering on-ground data. This study combines satellite observations with quasi-experimental methods to examine the impacts of the Sustainable Land Management Project in Ethiopia.

TI  - Temporal Land-Use/Land-Cover Change Analysis in Kotla Sub-Watershed of Rupnagar District (Punjab) Using Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use and land-cover (LU/LC) change is becoming a crucial component for managing the natural resources. Identification, delineation and mapping of LU/LC are very important for activities such as planning, study of earth's features and natural resource management. Remote sensing technology has proven to be an effective tool to analyze LU/LC changes at watershed level. In this study, an attempt was made to detect LU/LC changes from the year 2009 to 2018 in Kotla sub-watershed which is situated in Anandpur Sahib block, Rupnagar district of Punjab. High-resolution satellite data of IRS-P6 LISS-IV for the years 2009 and 2018 were analyzed for LU/LC mapping using visual image interpretation technique. There were total ten LU/LC classes: agriculture, built-up, canal, degraded forest, dense forest, drainage, moderate dense forest, transport, wasteland and waterbody demarcated in the study area. The overlay analysis of 2009 over 2018 was done to analyze changes in the study area over the period of 10 years. Results of study show that area under agriculture, moderate dense forest and wasteland decreased by 2.80%, 60.06% and 4.25%, respectively, and area under other LU/LC classes, i.e., built-up, degraded forest, dense forest, drainage and waterbody, was increased by 115.47%, 93.39%, 3.62%, 15.81% and 3.70%, respectively, while areas of canal and transport remain unchanged from the year 2009 to 2018. The overall accuracy and kappa statistics for classified images of 2009 and 2018 were 70.27% and 89.19% with kappa coefficient values 0.66 and 0.87, respectively. Change analysis at village level and sub-watershed level was also carried out to identify the most affected regions of the study area. Total 13 sub-watersheds are categorized as sub-watershed number 1-13. The most affected sub-watershed number is 11 which consists of villages: Kotla, Balauli, Raipur sani, Ganj pur, Mahndali khurd and Pahar pur as per LU/LC change analysis, and management practices need to be look for these villages. In this study, we also use land surface temperature algorithms and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values to estimate changes in LU/LC from 2009 to 2018, where decreasing trend in the values of NDVI is estimated which is the evident of overall decrease in vegetation in the region.

TI  - Managing and preventing acts of violence against health workers: results of a review evaluating hospital control procedures
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGGRESSION CONFLICT AND PEACE RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose Violence against health-care workers represents a public health issue that affects individuals, organizations and may have legal consequences. In Italy, workplace violence (WPV) constitutes a "sentinel event", defined as a particularly serious, potentially avoidable adverse event, which may result in death or serious harm to health-care workers, and which leads to a loss of public confidence in the health-care system. In 2007, the Italian Ministry of Health issued Recommendation No. 8, "Preventing acts of violence against health workers", inviting each Italian Hospital to develop procedures and guidelines for dealing with and preventing acts of aggression. This study aimed at investigating the appropriateness of the procedures and guidelines developed by the Italian hospitals. Design/methodology/approach Procedures on preventing violence against health-care workers published by 29 Italian Hospitals between 2007 and 2020 were collected retrospectively via Web searches and further evaluated according to their compliance with the 2007 Italian ministerial recommendations. Findings A total of 9 documents out of 29 were fully compliant with the 2007 Ministerial Recommendation, 18 were partially compliant, while 2 were totally non-compliant. A total of 24 documents explicitly addressed the management of verbal and physical aggression, whereas 20 set appropriate training on de-escalation techniques for nurses and medical staff. Psychological support was fully considered in 11 procedures, partially considered in 14, while not included at all in 4. Originality/value Public procedures on preventing violence against health-care workers in Italian hospitals are scarcely compliant with the Ministerial Recommendations. The absence of specific instructions to address the needs at territorial level and the lack of support provided to health-care workers is a weak point in the effective management of WPV.

TI  - In-Season Potato Crop Nitrogen Status Assessment from Satellite and Meteorological Data
T2  - POTATO RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - For a conventional potato crop, splitting nitrogen (N) application is recognised as an efficient strategy to improve tuber yield and quality and to mitigate N losses to the environment. This approach requires the assessment of in-season crop N status for decisions on supplemental mineral N fertiliser application. This study focuses on the assessment of potato crop biophysical variables useful to establish crop N status. Field, satellite and meteorological data were collected in farmer's fields during 3 years (2017-2019) with contrasted meteorological conditions. Degree days (DD) and water balance from planting date were computed from meteo data, and a selection of relevant vegetation indices (VIs) was derived from Sentinel-2 reflectance. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest regression (RFR) models predicting shoots biomass, shoots N content and shoots N uptake from a combination of meteo and/or satellite-based variables were defined and evaluated. The best combinations integrate DD and two to four VIs and perform with cross-validation RMSE of about 0.38 DM t ha(-1), 0.41%, 21 kg ha(-1) for MLR and 0.32 DM t ha(-1), 0.31%, 19 kg ha(-1) for RFR. Despite these performances, MLR was shown to be more robust. From these estimated variables, two methods are proposed to derive total N uptake and nitrogen nutrition index. The most relevant method uses shoots N uptake and biomass. It allows future estimation of in-season supplemental N fertiliser to be applied to reach a targeted tuber yield.

TI  - Climate change impact on fungi in the atmospheric microbiome☆
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric microbiome is one of the least studied microbiomes of our planet. One of the most abundant, diverse and impactful parts of this microbiome is arguably fungal spores. They can be very potent outdoor aeroallergens and pathogens, causing an enormous socio-economic burden on health services and annual damages to crops costing billions of Euros. We find through hypothesis testing that an expected warmer and drier climate has a dramatic impact on the atmospheric microbiome, conceivably through alteration of the hydrological cycle impacting agricultural systems, with significant differences in leaf wetness between years (p-value <0.05). The data were measured via high throughput sequencing analysis using the DNA barcode marker, ITS2. This was complemented by remote sensing analysis of land cover and dry matter productivity based on the Sentinel satellites, on-site detection of atmospheric and vegetation variables, GIS analysis, harvesting analysis and footprint modelling on trajectory clusters using the atmospheric transport model HYSPLIT. We find the seasonal spore composition varies between rural and urban zones reflecting both human activities (e.g. harvest), type and status of the vegetation and the prevailing climate rather than mesoscale atmospheric transport. We find that crop harvesting governs the composition of the atmospheric microbiome through a clear distinction between harvest and post-harvest beta-diversity by PERMANOVA on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (p value <0.05). Land cover impacted significantly by two-way ANOVA (p-value <0.05), while there was minimal impact from air mass transport over the 3 years. The hypothesis suggests that the fungal spore composition will change dramatically due to climate change, an until now unforeseen effect affecting both food security, human health and the atmospheric hydrological cycle. Consequently the management of crop diseases and impact on human health through aeroallergen exposure need to consider the timing of crop treatments and land management, including post harvest, to minimize exposure of aeroallergens and pathogens.

TI  - Sentinel-1A for monitoring land subsidence of coastal city of Pakistan using Persistent Scatterers In-SAR technique
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Karachi is located in the southern part of Pakistan along the Arabian Sea coast. Relevant institutions are concerned about the possibility of ground subsidence in the city, contributing to the comparative sea-level rise. So yet, no direct measurement of the subsidence rate and its relation to city submergence danger has been made. SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) interferometry is a powerful method for obtaining millimeter-accurate surface displacement measurements. The Sentinel-1 satellite data provide extensive geographical coverage, regular acquisitions, and open access. This research used the persistent scatterer interferometry synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) technology with Sentinel-1 SAR images to monitor ground subsidence in Karachi, Pakistan. The SARPROZ software was used to analyze a series of Sentinel-1A images taken from November 2019 to December 2020 along ascending and descending orbit paths to assess land subsidence in Karachi. The cumulative deformation in Line of Sight (LOS) ranged from - 68.91 to 76.06 mm/year, whereas the vertical deformation in LOS ranged from - 67.66 to 74.68 mm/year. The data reveal a considerable rise in subsidence from 2019 to 2020. The general pattern of subsidence indicated very high values in the city center, whereas locations outside the city center saw minimal subsidence. Overall, the proposed technique effectively maps, identifies, and monitors land areas susceptible to subsidence. This will allow for more efficient planning, construction of surface infrastructure, and control of subsidence-induced risks.

TI  - Insight into the 2017-2019 Lurestan arc seismic sequence (Zagros, Iran); complex earthquake interaction in the basement and sediments
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite its high-seismogenic potential, the details of the seismogenic processes of Zagros Simply Folded Belt (SFB) remains debated. Three large earthquakes (M-w 7.3, 5.9 and 6.3) struck in the Lurestan arc of the Zagros SFB in 2017 and 2018. The sequence was recorded by seismic stations at regional, and teleseismic distances. Coseismic surface displacements, measured by Sentinel-1A/B satellites, provide additional data and a unique opportunity to study these earthquakes in detail. Here, we complement previous studies of the coseismic slip distribution of the 12 November 2017 M-w 7.3 Ezgeleh earthquake by a detailed analysis of its aftershocks, and we analysed the rupture process of the two interrelated earthquakes (25 August 2018 M-w 5.9 Tazehabad and the 25 November 2018 M-w 6.3 Sarpol-e Zahab earthquakes). We model the surface displacements obtained from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements and seismic records. We conduct non-linear probabilistic optimizations based on joint InSAR and seismic data to obtain finite-fault rupture of these earthquakes. The Lurestan arc earthquakes were followed by a sustained aftershock activity, with 133 aftershocks exceeding M-n 4.0 until 30 December 2019. We rely on the permanent seismic networks of Iran and Iraq to relocate similar to 700 M-n 3 + events and estimate moment tensor solutions for 85 aftershocks down to M-w 4.0. The 2017 Ezgeleh earthquake has been considered to activate a low-angle (similar to 17 degrees) dextral-thrust fault at the depth of 10-20 km. However, most of its aftershocks have shallow centroid depths (8-12 km). The joint interpretation of finite source models, moment tensor and hypocentral location indicate that the 2018 Tazehabad and Sarpol-e Zahab earthquakes ruptured different strike-slip structures, providing evidence for the activation of the sinistral and dextral strike-slip faults, respectively. The deformation in the Lurestan arc is seismically accommodated by a complex fault system involving both thrust and strike-slip faults. Knowledge about the deformation characteristics is important for the understanding of crustal shortening, faulting and hazard and risk assessment in this region.

TI  - Establishment of aerosol optical depth dataset in the Sichuan Basin by the random forest approach
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sichuan Basin has become one of the four city clusters and heavy polluted regions in China. In this study, the random forest (RF) machine learning method and multiple datasets are used to establish aerosol optical depth (AOD) dataset in the cloudy Sichuan Basin. Multiple datasets include ground-based PM10 and PM2.5, the AOD from the Sun-sky radiometer Observation Network (SONET) and the Second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) aerosol reanalysis, and several meteorological variables. The correlation analysis, variance inflation factor method, covariance test, and important scores are used to select variables for the model. Eight independent variables, including MERRA-2 AOD, PM10, PM2.5/PM10, low cloud cover, 2 m air temperature, relative humidity, wind direction and boundary layer height, and one dependent variable SONET AOD are selected for the model in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, and then extended to the Sichuan Basin. The 10-fold cross validation and statistical comparison of the Multi-Angle implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) and the MERRA-2 AOD are conducted. Results show that the values of PM10 and PM2.5, and MERRA-2 AOD are highest at the bottom of the basin, followed by that at the edge of the basin, and the lowest at the plateau areas. Comparing with the SONET AOD, the MERRA-2 and MAIAC underestimate the AOD in the Sichuan Basin, with the linear regression slope of 0.57 and 0.74, respectively. The RF AOD shows the best accuracy with the 10-fold cross-validation correlation coefficient of 0.79, the smallest RMSE of 0.17 and MAE of 0.14.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Mapped With Carbon Nanoparticle Suspensions in Patients With Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundThe mapping method represents a crucial factor affecting the rate of sentinel lymph node detection in breast cancer. We carried out this meta-analysis to assess the clinical utility of carbon nanoparticle suspensions (CNSs) in guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for breast cancer patients. MethodsElectronic databases, which comprised the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Wanfang electronic database, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed, were explored to identify relevant studies from database inception to July 2021 that studied the detection rate of CNSs-guided SLNB. A meta-analysis was performed to generate pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), a summary receiver operator characteristic curve (SROC), and a diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). ResultsA total of 33 publications that enrolled 2,171 patients were analyzed. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, and NLR were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91-0.95, I-2 = 0.0%), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-0.99, I-2 = 56.5%), 42.85 (95% CI: 29.73-61.77, I-2 = 47.0%), and 0.09 (95% CI: 0.07-0.11, I-2 = 0.0%), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of the SROC curve was 0.98. There were no significant differences when analyzed based on the dose and site of CNS injection. There was significant publication bias among the included publications based on Deeks' funnel plot [Slope (Bias) = -7.35, P = 0.00]. Nonetheless, the sensitivity analysis identified the results to be reliable and stable.

TI  - CubeSat constellations provide enhanced crop phenology and digital agricultural insights using daily leaf area index retrievals
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has great potential to deliver on the promise of a data-driven agricultural revolution, with emerging space-based platforms providing spatiotemporal insights into precision-level attributes such as crop water use, vegetation health and condition and crop response to management practices. Using a harmonized collection of high-resolution Planet CubeSat, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8 and additional coarser resolution imagery from MODIS and VIIRS, we exploit a multi-satellite data fusion and machine learning approach to deliver a radiometrically calibrated and gap-filled time-series of daily leaf area index (LAI) at an unprecedented spatial resolution of 3 m. The insights available from such high-resolution CubeSat-based LAI data are demonstrated through tracking the growth cycle of a maize crop and identifying observable within-field spatial and temporal variations across key phenological stages. Daily LAI retrievals peaked at the tasseling stage, demonstrating their value for fertilizer and irrigation scheduling. An evaluation of satellite-based retrievals against field-measured LAI data collected from both rain-fed and irrigated fields shows high correlation and captures the spatiotemporal development of intra- and inter-field variations. Novel agricultural insights related to individual vegetative and reproductive growth stages were obtained, showcasing the capacity for new high-resolution CubeSat platforms to deliver actionable intelligence for precision agricultural and related applications.

TI  - Effect of data assimilation in the Polar WRF with 3DVAR on the prediction of radiation, heat flux, cloud, and near surface atmospheric variables over Svalbard
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the Polar Weather Research and Forecasting (PWRF) model has been developed for polar environments, simulations of atmospheric states in the polar region still have large uncertainties. Therefore, the effects of data assimilation (DA) to improve forecasts in the polar region were investigated for September 2017 using PWRF and the three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) DA method. The experiments without DA and those with DA assimilating only conventional observations and both conventional observations and satellite radiance data were performed. The forecasts from all experiments both without and with DA underestimated (overestimated) the downward longwave (shortwave) radiation flux due to the underestimation of the amount of Arctic clouds. When satellite radiance data (i.e., the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) and Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS)) were assimilated in addition to conventional observations in the PWRF, the distribution and amount of water vapor became closer to observations, which improves cloud liquid water forecasts. Therefore, when both conventional observations and radiance data were assimilated, the 25-30 h forecast errors of the downward longwave and shortwave radiation fluxes and sensible and latent heat fluxes decreased by 12.7%, 8.1%, 3.2%, and 7.8% with the WSM5 scheme and by 17.1%, 4.7%, 2.5%, and 3.1% with the 2-moment Morrison scheme, respectively, compared to those in the experiments without DA. The forecast errors of the 10 m wind and 2 m temperature with DA were smaller than those without DA at most observation stations. Therefore, the uncertainties of the Arctic forecasts in the PWRF decreased when using DA. To further improve Arctic forecasts, the assimilation of various additional satellite data is necessary.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to describe the feasibility of treating early-stage endometrial cancer with hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy by vaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (vNOTES).& nbsp;Materials and methods: A longitudinal study of prospectively registered patients was conducted at an academic tertiary care center. 15 patients who underwent vNOTES surgical staging of early endometrial carcinoma between January 2014 and December 2020 were included in the study.& nbsp;Results: 15 patients between 20 and 80yrs of age with histologically proven Stage1 Gr1-2 endometrial cancer underwent vNOTES surgical staging. The mean age of the study population was 52.8 years (Standard Deviation [SD] 6.8) and the mean BMI was 27.8 kg/m2 (SD 6.4). The average operative time was 231.4 min (SD 41.0) with the mean estimated blood loss of 122.0 mL (SD 104.4). A total of 12 (80%) patients underwent SNL biopsy with ICG guided system, whereas 3 (20%) had pelvic lymph node dissection. There was one case with the surgical complication of bladder injury requiring conversion to conventional laparoscopy.& nbsp;Conclusion: With this study, we studied the feasibility of vNOTES surgery for early-stage endometrial cancer with minimal complications and the best long-term surgical outcome. The surgeries were performed by a single skilled endoscopist surgeon with previous experience with vNOTES surgery for adnexal tumors and hysterectomy. Our results showed the practicality of vNOTES in staging surgery for early-stage endometrial cancer. However, application to a larger cohort is required for more extensive surgical outcome studies.& nbsp;& nbsp;(C) 2022 Taiwan Association of Obstetrics & Gynecology.

TI  - Regional Assessment of Stocking Rate Effects on Uruguayan Rangelands: A Ranch-Level Study
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the variation of plant composition, forage production, and livestock diet across a broad stocking rate gradient on Eastern Hills rangelands of Uruguay. Our approach encompassed five ranches subjected to mixed sheep-cattle grazing and combined field surveys, microhistological fecal analysis, and remote sensing techniques. We hypothesized that selectivity would decrease as stocking rate increased. Vegetation data and fecal samples were obtained in 17 paddocks in 2008. To investigate the role of stocking rate on vegetation, we focused on dominant species and forage type cover. Diet composition was analyzed at forage type level. Annual net primary productivity was estimated for each paddock using the normalized difference vegetation index derived from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor. We found a clear relationship between the variation in stocking rate and floristic and forage type composition, both suggesting a deterioration of grassland conservation status. Cool season grass cover varied from 25% to 5%, from low to high stocking rates. Dicot cover showed an opposite trend, with values around 15% in the low and moderate stocking levels and reaching 35% on high-stocked paddocks. Diet composition and diet overlap between herbivores also showed clear patterns of response to stocking rate. On the other hand, livestock selectivity interacted with herbivore type. While cattle showed the expected pattern, sheep did not decrease selectivity in winter as stocking rate increased. Contrary to expectations, annual net primary productivity was similar across the different stocking rate levels and the month of maximum productivity was generally March. Our study provides strong evidence of marked rangeland degradation; however, the lack of response in terms of ANPP and the ability of sheep to maintain selectivity under high stocking rates could help to explain the lack of responsiveness in the adoption of generalized stocking adjustments by the ranchers.

TI  - Value of Quantitative SPECT/CT Lymphoscintigraphy in Improving Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been widely accepted as the standard procedure to assess the axillary lymph node status in breast cancer. However, more than 70% of excised sentinel lymph nodes have been found to be healthy. It may lead to unnecessary excisions and increase the incidence of postoperative complications. The aim of this study was to investigate the value of quantitative Tc-99m sulfur colloid SPECT/CT in avoiding excessive removal of unnecessary sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients. Methods. We retrospectively enrolled breast cancer patients who underwent SPECT/CT prior to sentinel lymph node biopsy. Quantification of radiotracer uptake from SPECT/CT data was performed. A radioactivity count threshold (R-SPECT) using SPECT/CT was calculated for detecting metastatic sentinel lymph nodes. To localize sentinel lymph nodes exactly, we compared the positions of sentinel lymph nodes localized using SPECT/CT with positions localized surgically using an intraoperative gamma -probe. Results. 491 patients were included, with a median of 3 sentinel lymph nodes/patient detected by the gamma -probe and 2 sentinel lymph nodes/patient detected by SPECT/CT. As the number of sentinel lymph nodes visualized on SPECT/CT images, the metastasis incidence of lymph nodes in the <= 2 SLNs group was significantly higher than that in the >2 SLNs group (35% vs. 15%, P<0.001). No metastasis was found in lymph nodes with R-SPECT<less than or equal to>30% in the >2 SLNs group, and thus, 30% (157/526) of SPECT/CT-identified nodes would avoid unnecessary removal. The positions of sentinel lymph nodes localized by SPECT/CT and gamma -probe were identical in 42% (39/93) of patients. Conclusions. Quantitative Tc-99m SC SPECT/CT imaging has the potential to preoperatively locate sentinel lymph nodes and intraoperatively avoid unnecessary sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Estimation of the lake trophic state index (TSI) using hyperspectral remote sensing in Northeast China
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Trophic state index (TSI) is a vital parameter for aquatic ecosystem assessment. Estimating TSI by remote sensing is still a challenge due to the multivariate complexity of the eutrophication process. A comprehensive in situ spectral-biogeochemical dataset for 7 lakes in Northeast China was collected in October 2020. The dataset covers trophic states from oligotrophic to eutrophic, with a wide range of total phosphorus (TP, 0.07-0.2 mg L-1), Secchi disk depth (SDD, 0.1-0.78 m), and chlorophyll a (Chla, 0.11-20.41 mu g L-1). Here, we propose an empirical method to estimate TSI from remote sensing data. First, TP, SDD, and Chla were estimated by band ratio/band combination models. Then TSI was estimated using the Carlson model with a high R-2 (0.88), a low RMSE (3.87), and a low MRE (6.83%). Synergistic effects between TP, SDD, and Chla dominated the trophic state, changed the distribution of light in the water column, affected the spectral characteristics. Furthermore, the contribution of each parameter for eutrophication were different among the studied lakes from ternary plot. High Chla concentration was the main reason for eutrophication in HMT Lake with 45.4% of contribution more than the other two parameters, However, in XXK Lake, high TP concentrations were the main reason for eutrophication with 66.8% of contribution rather than Chla and SDD. Overall, the trophic state was dominated by TP, and SDD accounted for 85.6% of contribution in all sampled lakes. Additionally, we found using one-parameter index to evaluate the lake trophic state will lead to a great deviation, even with two levels of difference. Therefore, multi-parameter TSI is strongly recommended for the lake trophic state assessment. Summarily, our findings provide a theoretical and methodological basis for future large-scale estimations of lake TSI using satellite image data, help with water quality monitoring and management.

TI  - Monitoring permafrost changes in central Yakutia using optical and polarimetric SAR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The changes in the permafrost environment have been of interest as a sensitive indicator of changes in global climate conditions. Since changes in the soil and ecosystem of the permafrost active layer are spatially and temporally complex depending on many environmental factors, it is not easy to grasp climate-induced changes occurring in coupled atmospheric-ecological-geocryological systems. To understand the changes in the permafrost active layer, spatially detailed monitoring methods such as multi-spectral optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing technologies have been extensively applied to the permafrost observation. Optical and SAR systems observe different permafrost features due to significant differences in electromagnetic wave frequencies and imaging mechanisms. Therefore, most studies used optical and SAR data separately according to the purpose and characteristics of each study. The objective of this study is to explore the possibility of combined interpretation of optical and SAR data for identifying and understanding spatiotemporal details of the short- and long-term changes occurring in the permafrost active layer. Multi-spectral optical images acquired during the thawing period and L-band polarimetric SAR images acquired during the freezing period are used in this study in order to examine ecological characteristics and cryogenic processes, respectively. The result of analyzing the relationship between information obtained from optical and SAR sensors revealed that there was a significant correlation between winter changes in scattering properties observed in SAR data and summer land cover changes observed in optical data. The scattering characteristics of winter soil were found to be particularly related to the ecosystem changes in areas that can be explained by the thermokarst development process. Additional data from independent sources, such as elevation data, meteorological data, and long-term optical data, consistently supported the relationship between the winter SAR observations and the thermokarst-related ecosystem changes. The experimental results also elucidated that polarimetric scattering mechanism indicators representing the signal depolarization and surface roughness properties played an important role in deriving information related to the permafrost process from the winter SAR data.

TI  - Optimized Umkehr profile algorithm for ozone trend analyses
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term record of Umkehr measurements from four NOAA Dobson spectrophotometers was reprocessed after updates to the instrument calibration procedures. In addition, a new data quality-control tool was developed for the Dobson automation software (WinDobson). This paper presents a comparison of Dobson Umkehr ozone profiles from NOAA ozone network stations - Boulder, the Haute-Provence Observatory (OHP), the Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO), Lauder - against several satellite records, including Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS; ver. 4.2), and combined solar backscatter ultraviolet (SBUV) and Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) records (NASA aggregated and NOAA cohesive datasets). A subset of satellite data is selected to match Dobson Umkehr observations at each station spatially (distance less than 200 km) and temporally (within 24 h). Umkehr Averaging kernels (AKs) are applied to vertically smooth all overpass satellite profiles prior to comparisons. The station Umkehr record consists of several instrumental records, which have different optical characterizations, and thus instrument-specific stray light contributes to the data processing errors and creates step changes in the record. This work evaluates the overall quality of Umkehr long-term measurements at NOAA ground-based stations and assesses the impact of the instrumental changes on the stability of the Umkehr ozone profile record. This paper describes a method designed to correct biases and discontinuities in the retrieved Umkehr profile that originate from the Dobson calibration process, repair, or optical realignment of the instrument. The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) Global Modeling Initiative (M2GMI) and NASA Global Modeling Initiative chemistry transport model (GMI CTM) ozone profile model output matched to station location and date of observation is used to evaluate instrumental step changes in the Umkehr record. Homogenization of the Umkehr record and discussion of the apparent stray light error in retrieved ozone profiles are the focus of this paper. Homogenization of ground-based records is of great importance for studies of long-term ozone trends and climate change.

T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Indocyanine green (ICG) for pelvic sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is well established in endometrial cancer (Persson et al., 2019 Jul). However, the application for para-aortic SLNs is less reported; and the detection rate of para-aortic SLNs, mainly after cervical injection of ICG, varies between 14% and 71% (Rossi et al., 2013 Nov; Kim et al., 2020 Mar; Gallotta et al., 2019 Mar). One recent report differentiates between lower and upper para-aortic SLNs in endometrial cancer (Kim et al., 2020 Mar). Here we describe a technique using ICG for identifying pelvic SLNs, lower and upper para-aortic SLNs in cervical cancer.Video: A 46-year old female presented with high grade cervical dysplasia/carcinoma in situ on cervical smear. Cervical cone biopsy revealed a grade two squamous cell carcinoma (depth of invasion 6.8mm, width 20.8mm). Clinically she was staged as an early FIGO-stage IB2 cervical cancer. NMR revealed bilaterally enlarged iliac lymph nodes. Additional PET-CT revealed FDG-uptake in the enlarged pelvic lymph nodes. In view of the imaging findings a staging Robotic pelvic and para-aortic SLN procedure was planned, prior to select the primary treatment (radical hysterectomy or chemo-radiation). ICG was injected into the cervical stroma, and a robotic pelvic and para-aortic SLN dissection (using Firefly System (R), Intuitive Surgical Inc.) was initiated 15 minutes and 35 minutes, respectively, after cervical injection.Results: This video demonstrates the application of ICG for mapping bilateral primary pelvic SLNs, secondary and tertiary para-aortic SLNs in the lower and upper para-aortic region respectively, in cervical cancer. Pathology revealed one metastatic pelvic SLN on the left side, other four pelvic SLNs were negative; both the secondary/ lower (n = 3) and tertiary/upper (n = 5) para-aortic SLNs were negative, as well as the non-SLNs (n = 8).Conclusion: The application of ICG for para-aortic SLN mapping should further be investigated and validated in staging surgically locally advanced cervical cancer and those with suspicious lymph nodes on imaging.

T2  - KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Iranian agriculture has not made significant progress in recent decades, and crops are grown using methods such as flood irrigation. Consumption of more than 90% of Iran's water is related to the agricultural sector, most of which is extracted from groundwater, which causes land subsidence (LS). In this study, Isfahan LS has been measured with 30 Sentinel-1 radar images by the Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method from 2020 to 2021. Convolutional neural network (CNN), whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) are used for phase unwrapping. 3 leveling points in two months of 2020 have been measured to determine and validate the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the proposed methods. As a result of applying the three phase unwrapping algorithms in the InSAR technique, it showed CNN has best accuracy, RMSE and worst time and GWO has best time. The maximum subsidence reaches more than 170 mm/year. The average of the whole study area of Isfahan has subsidence of 110.9 mm/year. Correlation of 3 piezometric well with subsidence of Isfahan city has more than 0.9.

TI  - Impact of Tropical Cyclones on Pelagic <i>Sargassum</i>
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The strong proliferation of holopelagic Sargassum in the Tropical Atlantic from 2011, raises many questions on the environmental factors controlling their growth and decay at interannual, seasonal, and intraseasonal scales. In this work, we specifically investigate the response of the Sargassum aggregations to high wind events such as those found in Tropical Cyclones (TCs). The evolution of Sargassum coverage obtained from MODIS observations in the north tropical Atlantic Ocean (from 0 to 30 degrees N and from 0 to 100 degrees W) was analyzed under 86 historical paths of TCs and tropical storms from 2011 to 2020 that crossed Sargassum aggregations. Our results show on average a 40% drop in Sargassum coverage under TC trajectories, which can exceed 60% for the most intense TCs. We associate this drop with a sinking of Sargassum toward the deep ocean. Our estimates suggest that TCs contribute to the seasonal decay of Sargassum biomass from August to November.

TI  - Estimation of Vertisols Soil Nutrients by Hyperion Satellite Data: Case Study in Deccan Plateau of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil nutrients are essential for agricultural purpose. There are efforts for estimation of topsoil properties using visible and near infrared reflectance (VIS-NIR) of Hyperion satellite. Notwithstanding this, there should be more research on variety of soils and fields of practicable size especially in the Indian context, necessary for using this on a practical basis. To bridge this gap, estimation of selected soil nutrients (nitrogen (N), potassium (K), copper (Cu) and iron (Fe)) from small sized and randomly scattered vertisols fields taken up in Deccan plateau of India using Hyperion satellite data. The nutrient index (NI) for Fe was estimated to be higher (NI = 2.76) than other nutrients in the study area, which influences the spectral behavior. The pretreatment of Hyperion reflectance data by Savitzky-Golay filter (window size 15, second-order derivative) and partial least square regression (PLSR) analysis resulted in low to moderate estimations of soil nutrients. The variable importance projection (VIP) for each soil nutrient has been estimated. The important wavelengths were identified in the mid infrared region for nitrogen. For Potassium, the wavelengths were identified in the visible, near infrared and the mid infrared regions. The near infrared and midinfrared region for iron. Lastly for Cu, in the green region and mid infrared region were identified. The prediction accuracy for N, K, Fe, and Cu were estimated to be medium, with coefficients of determination values as 54%, 45%, 40%, and 41%, respectively. The vertisols in the study region demonstrated low reflectance that is deficient in humus, due to low permeability and moisture stress throughout the drought. Hence the presence of soluble nutrients concentration is low compared to other soils. In this study considering the results of R-2, the iron has good prediction, then other soil properties. Thus, the present research implied that, Hyperion satellite data provides moderate potential to estimate the Indian vertisols soil nutrients.

TI  - The effect of port development on coastal water quality: Evidence of eutrophication states in Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing transport infrastructure must involve a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis, and accounting for environmental quality changes associated with such an infrastructure is one important aspect that can help complete this problem. In this study, we used difference-in-difference to estimate coastal water quality changes, measured by the Chlorophyll-a concentration, related to port development in Indonesia over the last decade. Using unique MODIS-derived monthly water quality data, we found that the presence of a local small port causes a 1.7% increase in Chlorophyll-a in coastal areas within 6 km of the port. The effects are concentrated in the first two months of operation, and there is also evidence for anticipation effects associated with the construction period. We found a greater effect in Indonesia's eastern regions, which rely on small ports for their local ac-tivities. Furthermore, we argue that the effect can be substantial in a larger port, despite posing a limited risk on marine pollution.

TI  - Analysis of land cover and SUHII pattern using local climate zone framework-A case study of Chang-Zhu-Tan main urban area
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study examines the changes in the local climate zone (LCZ) and the surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) of Chang-zhu-tan main urban area from 2000 to 2017. Firstly, it analyzed the land cover changes in Chang-zhu-tan from 2000 to 2017 by exploring the distribution of LCZ types. Secondly, mean LST of LCZs were obtained to evaluate the SUHII layout. Thirdly, it deals with critical LCZs in SUHII and seeks to understand how to approach mitigation strategies for Chang-zhu-tan. The results showed that, firstly, the land cover LCZs of the suburban areas adjacent to the three cities were most likely to be replaced with built-up LCZs from 2000 to 2017. Secondly, SUHII varies among different LCZs. LCZ-10 contributed to the strongest SUHII (around 5-6 degrees C) in 2000 and 2005, while LCZ-5 had the highest SUHII (around 6-7 degrees C) from 2011 to 2017, which tended to occur around the urban centers. By contrast, LCZ-A-D and LCZ-G contribute to cool areas (around 0-2 degrees C) throughout the study period.The findings help better understand the relationship between SUHII and LCZs and provide a more scientific basis for urban environmental planning.

TI  - Transforming remote sensing images to textual descriptions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data is growing enormously by virtue of the advancements in satellite and drone technology. Generating description of these remote sensing images have gained much attention in recent past owing to its applications in remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) and image analysis. Remote sensing images capture huge diversity in different perspectives and levels. Due to overhead perspective and significantly larger scale of the scene, extraction of visual features from the remote sensing images to generate descriptions has become a challenging task. In this work, a model is proposed to generate novel captions by considering multi-scale features processed through adaptive attention based decoder using topic sensitive word embedding. The proposed model has been quantitatively evaluated using the benchmark remote sensing image captioning datasets and ablation study has been conducted to investigate the reason behind its effectiveness. Experimental evaluation depicts that the proposed model shows promising results compared to the existing state of the art remote sensing image description models.

TI  - <i>Yersinia enterocolitica</i> in wild and peridomestic rodents within Great Britain, a prevalence study
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Yersinia enterocolitica is a human pathogen transmitted via the faecal-oral route among animals and humans and is a major foodborne public health hazard. This study explores the role of Y. enterocolitica transmission at the livestock-wildlife interface and investigates the potential role wild and peridomestic rodents play as a source of this zoonotic pathogen. The total of 342 faecal samples collected from the seven rodent species and one insectivore was examined using an optimized protocol to culture and identify Y. enterocolitica. Positive samples were also bioserotyped for grouping and determination of sample pathogenicity. Wildlife species sampled in this study were separated into two sample groups: randomly sampled (brown rats, house mice, wood mice, bank voles, field voles and the common shrew), as well as targeted sampling (red and grey squirrels). The overall prevalence of Y. enterocolitica in the randomly sampled population was 3.73%. Brown rats were chosen as sentinel species and tested to determine if location (pig farm vs non-pig farm) was a significant factor affecting Y. enterocolitica prevalence. In this study, location was not significant. All positive samples were found to be of biotype 1A, deemed non-pathogenic. Three of the samples were serotype 09, six were serotype 27 and five had an unidentifiable serotype. This study represents the first time Y. enterocolitica has been identified in these species of wildlife within mainland Britain. In addition, this study's findings are entirely novel and overall with regard to field voles and common shrews. However, the role of wild and peridomestic rodents in the transmission of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica remains unknown, as this study was unable to detect the presence of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains in these species.

TI  - Topographic Influences on Diurnally Driven MJO Rainfall Over the Maritime Continent
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work investigates impacts of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) on the daily and diurnal rainfall over the Maritime Continent, with emphasis on the influences of topography over Sumatra, Borneo and New Guinea. Eighty-nine MJO events were identified during 2001-2019 using IMERG satellite data. Daily and diurnal rainfall maxima on the east side of topography lag the west side as the MJO passes. In addition, the island vanguard (pre-MJO) rain is more convective, while the island rearguard (behind the main MJO body) rain is more stratiform. The timing and magnitude of diurnal rainfall is defined using the maximum hourly rain rate instead of the first diurnal harmonic to avoid smoothing. While a single sharp peak is observed over the mountains around 19 LT, a much broader delayed peak occurs over land to the west of topography and two peaks are observed over land to the east of topography at 15 and 2 LT. Rain peaks offshore from 3 to 7 LT. Cluster analysis shows that the afternoon and nighttime rainfall peaks are highest before the MJO arrives, then gradually decrease and become earlier on the west side of the topography, whereas the afternoon (nighttime) peak east of the topography is enhanced before (after) the MJO arrives. The contrasting east-west features can be attributed to topographic influences on the moisture flux convergence of the mean column moisture by MJO-induced winds. The MJO wind modulation of diurnal rainfall over most of the open ocean areas is insignificant.

TI  - Prediction of topsoil organic carbon content with Sentinel-2 imagery and spectroscopic measurements under different conditions using an ensemble model approach with multiple pre-treatment combinations
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) using visible near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy has proven to be a rapid and reliable approach. However, when working across large geographical scales, remote sensing may be more suitable. Acquiring these spectra data normally under different measurement conditions could introduce artefacts that reduce SOC prediction accuracy. A common procedure has been using calibration or multivariate techniques in conjunction with one or more pre-treatment algorithms. The results of several comparative studies based on these predictive calibration techniques used alone were inconsistent. Moreover, protocols to select the most appropriate pre-treatment algorithms rarely exist. This study combines predictions from different techniques into a single model based on an ensemble learning approach. The main objective is to improve the accuracy of SOC prediction by assessing the effectiveness of using different calibration techniques individually against an ensemble model consisting of one statistical method, which includes partial least squares regression (PLSR), and three machine learning (ML) algorithms, including random forest (RF), support vector machine regression (SVMR), and Cubist. Several pre-treatment algorithms were also employed to improve the spectral data before prediction. Spectra data were collected from three different agricultural fields (with different soil types), under different spectral measurement conditions (field, wet and dry). Additionally, Sentinel-2 (S2) data was collected from one of these fields. Furthermore, to ascertain the effectiveness of the developed model on regional scale dataset, two options were employed: (1) merged data from all fields, and (2) merged data from fields measured under the same spectral measurement conditions. The models were evaluated using root mean square error of prediction (RMSEPCV), the coefficient of determination (R2CV), the ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ), the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) and BIAS. The results show that, across the three agricultural fields, the ensemble model predicted SOC more accurately than each of the individual calibration techniques (R2CV = 0.92, RMSEPCV (g/kg) = 1.00, RPD = 3.06, RPIQ = 3.74, BIAS (g/kg) = 0.067). The models derived from merged data (regional dataset) show that the ensemble approach predicted SOC more accurately with option 2 than option 1. Finally, while the ensemble model improves SOC accuracy with S2 data, the final output was poor. Further research to determine the underlying problem is strongly recommended. Nonetheless, these results indicate that the ensemble model is advantageous because it improved the prediction accuracy of SOC and reduced the error margin.

TI  - Aerosol distribution during spring and summer and its relationship with Inter-Annual variability of summer monsoon rainfall over Indian region
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The inter-annual variability of aerosol over Indian region and its possible implications on the Indian summer monsoon is investigated using Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) during the period 2001 to 2016. An attempt has been made to link the seasonal aerosol distribution over South Asia during spring and summer season to Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) distribution. AOD derived from MODIS Terra observations shows large spatial inhomogeneity and characteristic variability with distinct temporal distributions. The pre-monsoon (spring) seasons (March-April-May; MAM) is characterized by high aerosol concentration over north-west part of India along with IGP region. During the south-west monsoon (summer) seasons (June-July-August-September; JJAS), wide area of high aerosol loading along Indo Gangetic plains extending from North Arabian sea through north-west India and up to Himalayan foothills. The regional rainfall distribution and its relationship with spatial and temporal aerosol distribution are then evaluated. Further, distinct variability in the aerosol distribution with respect to excess, deficit and normal monsoon years are analysed to understand the role of aerosols on the inter-annual variability of ISMR. Monthly aerosol distribution over Central India [CI;15 degrees-25 degrees N;75 degrees-88 degrees E] and Indo Gangetic plain [IGP;25 degrees- 35 degrees N;70 degrees- 90 degrees E] shows increased aerosol loading during deficit rainfall years and corresponding delay in the monthly rainfall peak. This study emphasises the active role of regional aerosol loading on regulating the inter-annual variability of regional Indian summer monsoon rainfall.

TI  - Spatially explicit estimation of soil organic carbon stock of an estuarine mangrove wetland of eastern India using elemental analysis and very-fine resolution satellite data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study estimated the total soil organic C (SOC) stock of the wetland influence zone of Bichitrapur mangroves in eastern India in a spatially explicit manner. Both spatial and vertical distribution of SOC densities with respect to land use/land cover (LULC) pattern were assessed. Subsequently, some site-specific management strategies were forwarded towards enhancement of C sequestration potential.Methods: The changing patterns of LULC within the wetland influence zone of the site were analyzed using Landsat TM (30 m) and Pleiades-1A (2 m) imageries from 1988 to 2018. Point-specific SOC measurement was done using samples taken from four core-depth intervals (viz. D1: 0-20 cm, D2: 20-40 cm, D3: 40-70 cm, D4: 70-100 cm) at 89 locations belonging to different LULC categories. Spatial interpolation was applied on this point-based data to produce SOC density and stock models as a whole and at all core-depths. Relationships between SOC density, core-depth and present LULC were evaluated through multivariate statistical analyses.Results: The LULC transformations during last three decades suggested the gradual growth of mangrove plantations as well as agricultural and aquacultural activities. Most amount of SOC was concentrated in D1 (37.17%) followed by D3 (26.51%), while D4 had the lowest (10.87%). The highest mean SOC density was observed in the dense mangrove patches (248.92 Mg ha(-1)) and the lowest mean was in the Casuarina plantations (2.78 Mg ha(-1)). Here, Spline method emerged as the best-fit interpolation technique to model SOC data (R-2 = 0.74) and estimated total SOC stock of the entire wetland influence zone as 169,569.40 Mg and the grand mean as 125.56 Mg ha(-1). Overall, LULC was inferred as a major determinant of SOC dynamics with a statistically significant effect (p < 0.001), whereas no such inference could be drawn for soil core-depth.Conclusions: The C sequestration potential of sites such as the present one could be increased with appropriate zone-wise plantation strategies, restriction on the land conversion to aquaculture and promotion of ecotourism. Periodic monitoring through integration of geospatial techniques and elemental analyses would be immensely beneficial in this regard.

TI  - Relative contributions of photophysiology and chlorophyll-<i>a</i> abundance to phytoplankton group-specific primary production in the Kuroshio region as inferred by satellite ocean color remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary production by diatoms, haptophytes and cyanobacteria in the Kuroshio region was evaluated using satellite ocean color remote sensing. We developed a method that estimates bio-optical properties such as the photosynthetic quantum yield index and chlorophyll-a-specific optical absorption coefficient of phytoplankton to derive the group-specific production. In contrast with the previous efforts that assume bio-optical properties to derive the production, our method relaxes the assumption by integrating an image processing of bulk satellite data into bio-optical modeling. Especially, our bio-optical model uses a universal bio-optical principle that we found: i.e., the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton at the wavelength of 510 nm can represent their spectral average. Climatological average of the group-specific primary production in the Kuroshio region showed 134, 72 and 40 mg C m(-2) day(-1) for diatoms, haptophytes and cyanobacteria, respectively. The quantum yield index of each phytoplankton group varied spatially, resulting in a latitudinal gradient, and diatoms had a higher quantum yield than those of cyanobacteria and haptophytes. Analysis of seasonal variability in the group-specific primary production in the Kuroshio region suggested that the primary production due to diatoms was mainly driven by variability in their chlorophyll-a abundance, whereas that due to cyanobacteria by variability in their quantum yield index or photophysiology. The production due to haptophytes was shown seasonally regulated by variability in both chlorophyll-a abundance and photophysiology.

TI  - Changing Trends of Aerosol Loadings Over Three Major Zones of Indian Region During the Last Seventeen Years (2005-2021)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal variation of satellite derived pre-monsoonal Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over the Indian region has been studied using long-term (2005-2021) satellite data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). In particular, three zones were selected, based on the dominance of natural, anthropogenic and mixture of both types of aerosols. The seasonal average of AOD (MODIS, OMI) was found to be (similar to 0.40, similar to 0.35) for the entire Indian landmass. We found that the trends are increasing (and are statistically significant) over the Indian region and the increase is at a faster rate in the last 8 years compared to the previous ones. Trend from MODIS (OMI) was found to be 0.011 (0.002) year(-1) and 0.014 (0.006) year(-1) for the periods 2005-2012 and 2013-2021, respectively, over the Indian region. Increasing trends of AOD for zones selected in Indo-Gangetic Plains and South-India were found during 2005-2021, whereas for the desert zone, AOD trend has contrastingly became negative (2005-2012) to positive (2013-2021) in the recent years.

TI  - Wet Scavenging in Removing Chemical Compositions and Aerosols: A Case Study Over the Lake Urmia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Urmia, NW Iran, and S Caucasus region, has lost approximately three-fourth of its water volume resulting in increased exposure of lacustrine deposits. Therefore, the role of Lake Urmia desiccated saline lands on local aerosols and rainwater compositions is still vague. This study investigates the temporal and seasonal patterns of rainwater chemistry from January 2018 to June 2018 (six months) in 13 stations throughout the Lake Urmia basin. The samples collected were analyzed using triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-QQQ) and ion chromatography (IC) to measure elemental and ionic concentrations. Then, the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT) was applied to identify the pathway and contribution of emissions. The results depict that the concentration of elemental and ionic components over different parts of the Lake Urmia basin are significantly different. West and north directions have the highest concentrations of marine ions associated with fewer toxic elements. In contrast, the east and south directions show a high concentration of heavy metal elements and ions. The high level of heavy and toxic elements at the east and south directions indicates that local anthropogenic sources are more influential. The seasonal and monthly variabilities of chemical compositions depict that the highest concentration of Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, Cl-, Br-, NO3-, Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co were in the spring season and SO42-, NH4+ and NO2- were highest in winter. Seasonal variation for MSA, organic acids (i.e., Pyruvate, Adipate, and Oxalate), Ni, Cu, Zn, V, and Ti were not apparent. Cluster-mean HYSPLIT backward trajectories results show the most dominant air mass sectors are from W (a: Iraq, Syria, and Arabian deserts; b: Mediterranean Sea; and c: KSA) and NE (the Caspian Sea and its vicinity), contributed to almost 65% and 22%, respectively. These air masses bring a significant quantity of crustal and marine aerosols, respectively. It is inferred that the Lake Urmia dried-up lakebeds have less impact on the contribution of emissions across the region.

TI  - Shrub willow canopy chlorophyll content estimation from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) data: Estimation and uncertainty analysis across time, space, and scales
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an important technology to map land-surface parameters, with many studies demonstrating land-surface parameter estimation, but fewer testing model transferability and quantifying model parameter uncertainty. In this study, we evaluated the uncertainty across time, space, and spatial scales of shrub willow health characterization based on canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) derived from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) data. Shrub willow is a short-rotation woody crop used to produce biomass for bioproducts and CCC is a popular biophysical parameter used to indicate shrub willow health status. We analyzed time-series UAS data at three spatial scales (5 m, 10 m, and 20 m) and stratified field-observed CCC levels. Since scale effects are often related to spatial heterogeneity, we implemented a nested analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate the spatial heterogeneity within different pixel sizes and found that 5 m pixels were the most homogeneous, followed by 10 m and 20 m. Results from regression modeling of shrub willow CCC as a function of red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIre) at 5 m, 10 m, and 20 m scales showed that the models built at 5 m, 10 m, and 20 m could be applied across time, space, and scales. We also quantified the uncertainty for model parameters using two different inferential frameworks, confidence interval (CI) widths from the frequentist framework and credible interval (CrI) widths from the Bayesian framework. Unlike predictive root mean square error (RMSE), which showed model output uncertainty decreased as pixel size increased, CI and CrI widths indicated that the related model parameter uncertainty increased as pixel size increased. We calculated CI and CrI widths based on time-series model building and different stratified model building to analyze model parameter uncertainty and quantified predictive RMSE for all sampling date combinations. The results showed that, in terms of model complexity and the range of ground observations, both frequentist and Bayesian regression have advantages and disadvantages and demonstrated that the uncertainty quantified by CrI widths is able to guide future experimental design to save resources.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of crop parameters, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI) and biomass over large areas using remote sensing techniques, is crucial for monitoring crop growth and yield prediction. In this study, a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method was developed to estimate LAI and biomass values of sugarcane during growth season using optical and synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data fusion. Predicting LAI on an independent test data set using the GPR and the combined optical and SAR indices provided better prediction accuracies of LAI; with the GPR based on radial basis function (Root Mean Square Error [RMSE] = 0.34, Mean Absolute Error [MAE] = 0.28 and Mean Absolute Percentage Error [MAPE] = 10.5%) and polynomial function (RMSE = 0.42, MAE = 0.31 and MAPE = 12.58%), respectively. The test results of sugarcane biomass also showed that the GPR (poly) produced the highest statistical results (RMSE = 2.45 kg/m(2), MAE = 1.72 kg/m(2), MAPE = 8.1%) using the combined indices. The results suggest that the crop biophysical retrieval based on optical and SAR data fusion and GPR proposed in this study could improve LAI and biomass estimation that could help for effective crop growth monitoring and mapping applications.

TI  - Improving leaf area index estimation accuracy of wheat by involving leaf chlorophyll content information
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Red-edge band is widely used for LAI estimation as it is highly correlated to vegetation growth conditions. Canopy reflectance is affected by both vegetation biophysical and biochemical characteristics. However, estimating LAI using satellite reflectance data as input rarely considers the influence of leaf chlorophyll content (LCC). This study tested the hypothesis whether LAI estimation accuracy can be improved by involving LCC information. Firstly, the sensitivities of seven PROSAIL simulated Sentinel-2 bands to LAI and LCC were investigated, and related vegetation indices (VIs) were constructed using these sensitive bands (including LAI-sensitive VIs and LCC-sensitive VIs). Then, the LAI estimation model taking sensitive VIs as input and LCC estimation model taking sensitive VIs as input were generated by random forest regression algorithm. Finally, the improved LAI estimation model involving LCC information was proposed using three different methods: (1) PROSAIL simulated LCC, (2) simulated LCC with noise, and (3) functional equation of LCC. The results indicated that the three LCC information introducing methods all improved the LAI estimation accuracy, while using the functional equation of LCC (growth equation) performed best with RMSE of 0.736, which is 11.54% higher when compared to the basic LAI estimation model.

TI  - The historical emergence of a geometric and sinuous ridge network at the Horbyebreen polythermal glacier snout, Svalbard and its use in the interpretation of ancient glacial landforms
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The post Little Ice Age recession and downwasting of Horbyebreen, a Svalbard polythermal glacier, has revealed a sub-polar glacial landsystem within which a geometric and sinuous ridge network (GSRN) has evolved by ice melt-out. Spatio-temporal evolution of these features is evaluated using time series of remote sensing data, aerial photography, DEMs and field observations. The GSRN is interpreted as an assemblage of crevasse and hydrofracture infills branching out from parent eskers, a signature of the rapid release of pressurised subglacial and englacial meltwater, likely related to surge-induced jo center dot kulhlaups. This gives rise to a range of component materials including till, gravel and interdigitated till and gravel. Ancient examples of such jo center dot kulhlaup-diagnostic GSRN in ice sheet settings are recognised as elongate zones of conjugate, reticulate and honeycomb patterned ridges in close association with eskers that often also display reticulate ridge patterns. We present a conceptual model of a process-form continuum for the production of different styles of GSRN that identifies: a) surge crevassing, indicated by glacier wide GRN and zig-zag eskers; b) ice stream surging plug flow, indicated by linear assemblages of GRN; c) sub-marginal till emplacement in radially crevassed active temperate snouts, indicated by narrow concentric arcs of GRN linked to push moraines; and d) jo center dot kulhlaup-induced hydrofracture, indicated by linear assemblages of GSRN.

TI  - Predicting potential wildfire severity across Southern Europe with global data sources
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The large environmental and socioeconomic impacts of wildfires in Southern Europe require the development of efficient generalizable tools for fire danger analysis and proactive environmental management. With this premise, we aimed to study the influence of different environmental variables on burn severity, as well as to develop accurate and generalizable models to predict burn severity. To address these objectives, we selected 23 wildfires (131,490 ha) across Southern Europe. Using satellite imagery and geospatial data available at the planetary scale, we spatialized burn severity as well as 20 pre-burn environmental variables, which were grouped into climatic, topographic, fuel load-type, fuel load-moisture and fuel continuity predictors. We sampled all variables and divided the data into three independent datasets: a training dataset, used to perform univariant regression models, random forest (RF) models by groups of variables, and RF models including all predictors (full and parsimonious models); a second dataset to analyze interpolation capacity within the training wildfires; and a third dataset to study extrapolation capacity to independent wildfires. Results showed that all environmental variables determined burn severity, which increased towards the mildest climatic conditions, sloping terrain, high fuel loads, and coniferous vegetation. In general, the highest predictive and generalization capacities were found for fuel load proxies obtained though multispectral imagery, both in the individual analysis and by groups of variables. The full and parsimonious models outperformed all, the individual models, models by groups, and formerly developed predictive models of burn severity, as they were able to explain up to 95%, 59% and 25% of variance when applied to the training, interpolation and extrapolation datasets respectively. Our study is a benchmark for progress in the prediction of fire danger, provides operational tools for the identification of areas at risk, and sets the basis for the design of pre-burn management actions.

TI  - Quantifying mangrove leaf area index from Sentinel-2 imagery using hybrid models and active learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests provide vital ecosystem services. The increasing threats to mangrove forest extent and fragmentation can be monitored from space. Accurate spatially explicit quantification of key vegetation characteristics of mangroves, such as leaf area index (LAI), would further advance our monitoring efforts to assess ecosystem health and functioning. Here, we investigated the potential of radiative transfer models (RTM), combined with active learning (AL), to estimate LAI from Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance in the mangrove-dominated region of Ngoc Hien, Vietnam. We validated the retrieval of LAI estimates against in-situ measurements based on hemispherical photography and compared against red-edge NDVI and the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) biophysical processor. Our results highlight the performance of physics-based machine learning using Gaussian processes regression (GPR) in combination with AL for the estimation of mangrove LAI. Our AL-driven hybrid GPR model substantially outperformed SNAP (R-2 = 0.77 and 0.44 respectively) as well as the red-edge NDVI approach. Comparing two canopy RTMs, the highest accuracy was achieved by PROSAIL (RMSE = 0.13 m(2).m(-2), NRMSE = 9.57%, MAE = 0.1 m(2).m(-2)). The successful retrieval of mangrove LAI from Sentinel-2 can overcome extensive reliance on scarce in-situ measurements for training seen in other approaches and present a more scalable applicability by relying on the universal principles of physics in combination with uncertainty estimates. AL-based GPR models using RTM simulations allow us to adapt the genericity of RTMs to the peculiarities of distinct ecosystems such as mangrove forests with limited ancillary data. These findings bode potential for retrieving a wider range of vegetation variables to quantify large-scale mangrove ecosystem dynamics in space and time.

TI  - Stability Analysis Model of Expressway Passing through Goaf Based on SBAS-InSAR Technology
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the lack of historical subsidence data on goaf sites alongside expressways, it is difficult to comprehensively evaluate the stability of goaf sites and accurately identify potential risk points. An investigation to study the stability of goaf sites in the Huaibei section of the Xu Huaifu Expressway is conducted through SBAS-InSAR technology and field investigation. Initially, the stability of the goaf site around the route is anticipated through field investigation. Afterwards, based on the extraction of Sentinel-1 satellite images, subsidence data of the goaf sites from 2017 to 2021 were extracted. Finally, the stability of risk points is analysed. Results demonstrate that although mining in the area stopped more than five years ago, the goaf site has continued to slowly sink. According to four years of goaf site subsidence data extracted by SBAS-InSAR technology, two subsidence risk areas, namely, Y1-05 and Y1-09, were discovered, and the subsidence areas displayed an obvious inverted "convex" shape. Of these two areas, Y1-05 is a potential risk point that was not found during the field investigation. The subsidence basin in the Y1-05 area has developed gradually, and the residual subsidence is expected to be close to 475 millimetres within the next 15 years. Although it can be considered a stable area, the subsidence value is quite large and may pose risks to route safety. Therefore, a flexible reinforced mesh can be adopted for the route. The subsidence basin of Y1-09 is the largest, but the expected residual subsidence is only 50 millimetres and will have insignificant influence on the route. Engineering practice shows that SBAS-InSAR technology can effectively analyse the surface deformation of goaf sites and has important practical significance in optimising the selection of special geological routes in expressways.

TI  - Annual and Inter-annual Variability Coupled with Comparison of MODIS-AERONET Retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth over a Rural Site in the Central Indo-Gangetic Basin
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term (2000-2015) MODIS EOS-Terra/Aqua multi-algorithm (DT, DB and combined DTB) retrieved AOD(550 nm) and AERONET measured AOD(550 nm) data at Gandhi College (24.87 degrees N, 84.19 degrees E; 60 m amsl), a rural site in the central IGB, have been employed to assess the performance of MODIS AOD products against AERONET AOD and to examine their annual and inter-annual variability. For both MODIS Terra/Aqua sensors, the linear regression data statistics reveals that the values of slopes for MODIS Terra-EOS sensor lie in the range 1.04 +/- 0.03 [DB (QA = 2,3)] to 1.11 +/- 0.02 [DT (QA = (2,3)] which are slightly higher than 1. Also, similar observation is noticed for MODIS Aqua-EOS sensor for which slopes of linear regression fit span over 0.99 +/- 0.03 [DB (QA = 2,3)] - 1.16 +/- 0.03 [DT (QA = 3)]. The intercept, however, approach zero values for both MODIS Terra/AQUA-EOS sensor at DT (QA = 3), DT (QA = 2,3), DB (QA = 2,3) and DTB combined retrieval algorithms. The evaluation/performance analysis, therefore, exhibits the observed near-perfect match of MODIS Terra/Aqua-EOS sensors derived AOD(550nm) from all algorithms with AERONET measured AOD(550 nm) as a result of magnitudes of the slope and intercept of the linear regression fit to the scatter diagrams of MODIS AOD(550) nm against AERONET AOD(550 nm). Results, thus indicate that at Gandhi College, the DT, and DTB combined retrieval algorithms satisfactorily estimate AOD products which can then be used to build aerosol climatology over Gandhi College. The MODIS and AERONET derived AOD(550 nm) values over the Gandhi College indicate a distinct annual pattern with maximum AOD(550 nm) during the winter season and minimum AOD(550 nm) during monsoon season and winter-summer transition period. Analysis revealed that the aerosol loading starts building up over the study region from March to June of the pre-monsoon season mainly due to the high convective activity and long-range mineral dust transport from western arid regions. An increase in AOD values during the post-monsoon and winter season is primarily due to the influx of aerosols from biomass burning processes and stable atmospheric conditions, the MODIS Terra retrieved AOD(550 nm) using DT and combined DTB algorithm showed higher values in the month of July of monsoon season as compared to MODIS Aqua retrieved AOD(550 nm). The inter-annual AOD trend analysis reveals that for MODIS Terra satellite there exits an increasing AOD trend during post-monsoon and winter seasons for DT (0.0233 year(-1)), DB (0.0239 year(-1)) and DTB (0.0246 year(-1)), retrieval algorithms. For MODIS Aqua satellite also, there exists an increasing AOD(550 nm) trend with differing but higher AOD year(-1) trend value. On the contrary, for monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons, for MODIS Terra and Aqua satellite, the AOD trends are found to be statistically insignificant.

TI  - DART-Lux: An unbiased and rapid Monte Carlo radiative transfer method for simulating remote sensing images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and efficient simulation of remote sensing images is increasingly needed in order to better exploit remote sensing observations and to better design remote sensing missions. DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer), developed since 1992 based on the discrete ordinates method (i.e., standard mode DART-FT), is one of the most accurate and comprehensive 3D radiative transfer models to simulate the radiative budget and remote sensing observations of urban and natural landscapes. Recently, a new method, called DART-Lux, was integrated into DART model to address the requirements of massive remote sensing data simulation for large-scale and complex landscapes. It is developed based on efficient Monte Carlo light transport algorithms (i.e., bidirectional path tracing) and on DART model framework. DART-Lux can accurately and rapidly simulate the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) and spectral images of arbitrary landscapes. This paper presents its theory, implementation, and evaluation. Its accuracy, efficiency and advantages are also discussed. The comparison with standard DART-FT in a variety of scenarios shows that DART-Lux is consistent with DART-FT (relative differences <1%) with simulation time and memory reduced by a hundredfold. DART-Lux is already part of the DART version freely available for scientists (https://dart.omp.eu).

TI  - Prevention and control of COVID-19 by primary health care facilities in China: a field-survey-based qualitative study in three typical cities
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) containment, primary health care (PHC) facilities inChina played an important role in providing both healthcare and public care services to community populations. The tasks of COVID-19 containment facilitated by PHC facilities were different among different regions and during different periods of COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to investigate the gaps on task participation, explore existing problems and provide corresponding solutions. Methods Semi-structured face-to-face interviews with COVID-19 prevention and control management teams of PHC facilities were conducted. Purposive stratified sampling was used and 32 team members of 22 PHC facilities were selected from Wuhan (as high-risk city), Shanghai (as medium-risk city) and Zunyi (as low-risk city). Framework analysis was employed to analyze the transcribed recordings. Results The main tasks of PHC facilities during the early period of the pandemic included assisting in contact tracing and epidemiological investigation, screening of populations at high-risk at travel centers/internals, house-by-house, or pre-examination/triage within PHC facilities; at-home/ centralized quarantine management; the work of fever sentinel clinics. Further analyses revealed the existing problems and suggestions for improvement or resolutions. Regular medical supply reserves were recommended because of the medical supply shortage during the pre-outbreak period. Temporarily converted quarantine wards and centralized quarantine centers could be used to deal with pressures on patients' treatment and management of the febrile patients. Only after strict evaluation of nucleic acid testing (NAT) results and housing conditions, decision on quarantine at-home or centralized quarantine centers could be made. Settings of fever sentinel clinics at PHC facilities allowed fever patients with no COVID-19 infection risks for treatment without being transferred to fever clinics of the designed secondary hospitals. Psychological intervention was sometimes in need and really helped in addressing individuals' mental pressures. Conclusions During the COVID-19 containment, PHC facilities in China were responsible for different tasks and several problems were encountered in the working process. Accordingly, specific and feasible suggestions were put forward for different problems. Our findings are highly beneficial for healthcare teams and governments in handling similar situations.

TI  - Cultivation and the dual process of dangerous and competitive worldviews - A theoretical synthesis
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cultivation research suggests that media use, particularly TV, is associated with a wide range of politically relevant views and attitudes, including perceptions of the world as a mean and dangerous place, authoritarianism, and perceived meritocracy. However, little attempt has been made to understand how these effects relate to one another and to broader models of political psychology. We present a new Cultivation-Political Psychology Interface Model, which uses Duckitt's Dual Process Model (2001) of political psychology as a lens to understand cultivation research. Many seemingly distinct cultivation effects related to political attitudes can thus be reduced to two overall dimensions: dangerous and competitive worldviews. We identify evidence gaps, particularly in terms of competitive-worldview effects and related political attitudes. Our model generates a landscape of attitudes and beliefs, whereby some attitudes are hypothesized to be more upstream than others, leading to testable hypotheses for future research.

TI  - Sex-disaggregated agricultural extension and weather variability in Africa south of the Sahara
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and extreme weather shocks pose serious threats to a number of agricultural outcomes, including agricultural production, productivity, and income, especially when households depend heavily on this activity. Agricultural extension and rural advisory services are key instruments in promoting tech-nical change, advancing agricultural productivity growth and, ultimately, improving farm livelihoods, and are expected to mitigate the negative effects of climate change and extreme weather shocks. Their mit-igation effects, however, may vary depending on the sex of the recipient. This paper investigates the role of sex-disaggregated agricultural extension recipients in contexts where agricultural performance of farm households is affected by weather variability. To this aim, we match multiple rounds of panel microdata from the nationally representative, consumption-based Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA), collected in four sub-Saharan African countries, with remote sensing data on biophysical dimensions over a long-term horizon as well as year-specific weather shocks. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a micro-level dataset with individual-level information on agricul-tural extension services' recipients has been assembled and examined to investigate the effects of extreme weather shocks and climate change. Applying panel data econometric estimators, the study finds that agricultural extension and advisory services translate into higher agricultural performance of farm households where women are also among the beneficiaries, as compared to non-beneficiaries and house-holds where beneficiaries are men only. Moreover, these services can mitigate the negative effects of weather variability and climate change, controlling for country and time fixed effects as well as holding all other variables constant. These results call for national and international policies and interventions strengthening rural advisory services, especially targeted to women in settings where household liveli-hoods are predominantly agriculture-based and weather variability and shocks are expected to nega-tively affect farming activities.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Influences of atmospheric reanalysis on the accuracy of clear-sky irradiance estimates: Comparing MERRA-2 and CAMS
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This contribution compares the influences of atmospheric reanalysis, in particular, the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) produced by NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office and the global reanalysis of atmospheric composition produced by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), on the accuracy of clear-sky irradiance estimates. In terms of reanalysis output, comparison shows there exist great differences in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE) between the two reanalysis models. Based on 58 sunphotometer stations, it is found that daily MERRA-2 AOD is negatively biased with prominent underestimation in western China. CAMS AOD has considerable improvements in eastern China against MERRA-2, which may be associated with the high-quality assimilation of MODIS AOD and gas emissions, in a timely and consistent fashion. Both reanalyses tend to underestimate the fine-dominated aerosols (AE > 1.6) while overestimating the coarse-dominated ones (AE < 0.8). In terms of irradiance, a high-performance physical clear-sky model called the Reference Evaluation of Solar Transmittance, 2 bands (REST2) is used as the basis of evaluation. The performance of REST2-modeled global horizontal irradiance (GHI) based on the two reanalysis products is subsequently examined using data from 10 ground-based radiometry sites. It is concluded that the clearness index of clear-sky GHI (ktc) computed based on MERRA-2 and that based on CAMS show comparative performance over most parts of China, though there are exceptions. For instance, CAMS-based ktc outperforms MERRA-2 in eastern China, with slopes closer to unity, intercepts and root mean square errors closer to 0, which can be attributed to the improvements in CAMS AOD. The daily accumulated delta GHI (i.e., GHI(MERRA-2) -GHI(CAMS)) changes linearly with delta AOD (i.e., AOD(MERRA-2) -AOD(CAMS)), implying better AOD quality has advantages in accumulated GHI estimation. Therefore, CAMS reanalysis data is recommended for solar resource assessment applications in eastern China, albeit that MERRA-2 has a higher temporal resolution (1 h) and coverage (from 1980 to present).

TI  - Downscaled solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence has great potential for monitoring the response of vegetation to drought in the Yellow River Basin, China: Insights from an extreme event
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a good probe for diagnosing the photosynthetic characteristics and stress response of vegetation dynamics to drought. However, most studies used the SIF products with coarse resolution from global to regional scales. In this study, based on a new global 'OCO-2' SIF data set (i. e., SIF obtained from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, GOSIF) with a 0.05 spatial resolution from 2000 to 2018, using multi-scale standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), we analyzed the drought in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) and its correlation with vegetation dynamics, identified a typical drought event in 2004, and investigated the response process and discrepancies of different vegetation types to drought. The results showed that the YRB was overall in dry condition but showed a wetting trend during this period, mean SIF in the vegetation growing season presented a spatial pattern of high in the south and low in the north. The multi scale SPEI was mainly positively related to SIF in the YRB, and the areas of significant positive correlation between SPEI-3 and SIF were the largest, accounting for 37.06%, which were primarily located in the largest sub basin of the YRB, the Wei River Basin (WRB). Furthermore, an extreme drought from February to July 2004 in the WRB was selected as a typical drought event, and SIF showed varying standardized negative anomalies during this period. For different vegetation types, the promptest response to drought was observed in the case of the SIF of cropland followed by those of grassland and forest. SIF of cropland declined the most in July (18.44%), while SIF of forest and grassland declined the most in June and July (15.02% and 18.69%), respectively, indicating that the drought seriously affected vegetation growth and photosynthesis. In general, GOSIF has great potential for monitoring the response of vegetation to drought.

TI  - X-ray hot spots in the eastern ear of the supernova remnant W 50 and the microquasar SS 433 system
T2  - PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the X-ray and radio spatial structure at the eastern ear of the W 50/SS 433 system to clarify a characteristic feature of the termination region of the SS 433 jet, and found that a hot spot ahead of the filament structure, which is considered to be a terminal shock of the SS 433 eastern jet, is clearly different from a single point source. The detailed spatial structure of the X-ray emission is finely resolved by Chandra observations, showing that there are two sources. By comparing the point-spread function of Chandra with the radial profiles of the two sources, the northern one is clearly more extended than a point source while the other seems marginally extended. Since there are no point sources nearby, the northern hot spot is likely a localized diffuse source. The northern hot spot spatially corresponds to the peak of the radio emission. Its spatial correlation is confirmed by an X-ray image using XMM-Newton. The X-ray spectra of the two sources are reproduced by a single absorbed power-law but the column density of the northern part is larger by a factor of similar to 3. When a radiation model comprising synchrotron emission and inverse Compton emission is applied to the spectral energy distribution of the northern hot spot, the emission from this spot can be explained by the radiation from an electron population accelerated up to 30 TeV in a magnetic field strength of B less than or similar to 50 mu G. This model also agrees with the radio and X-ray data, as well as the upper limit of gamma-ray emission obtained by the Fermi satellite.

TI  - Site-specific seeding for maize production using management zone maps delineated with multi-sensors data fusion scheme
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Uniform rate seeding (URS) density may result in under-or over-optimal plant population that negatively affects crop growth and yield. Site-specific seeding (SSS) is one of the solutions to manage in-field soil variation by optimizing the input seed rate to match soil fertility. This study has evaluated the agronomic and economic response of maize to SSS compared to the URS using a data fusion scheme. Two fields of 5.5 ha and 10 ha in Belgium and France, respectively, were scanned using an on-line visible and near-infrared spectroscopy sensor to measure soil pH, organic carbon (OC), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), moisture content (MC), and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Crop normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) were retrieved from several Sentinel-2 images. Measured crop yield, retrieved NDVI and on-line measured soil attributes were then fussed using k-means clustering algorithm to delineate management zone (MZ) maps, whose classes were ranked based on their fertility level and crop yield. A parallel strips experiment was overlaid upon the MZ map, to allow comparing the performance of SSS against URS. Two SSS treatments were implemented in the strip experiment, e.g., the "Kings " approach that recommended the highest seeding density for the highest fertile MZ class and vice versa, and the "Robin Hood " approach followed the opposite principle. Results revealed that SSS treatments increased maize grain yield by 0.25-0.70 Mg ha(-1) and thus improved gross margin by 26.7-92.67 euro ha(-1), compared to the URS. Besides, the SSS-Kings treatment outperformed the URS and SSS-Robin Hood in both fields, whereas the SSS-Robin Hood outperformed the URS treatment only in one field. Soil OC, MC, Mg, and pH revealed a positive correlation each with grain yield in the SSS-Kings treatment. The SSS-Kings treatment is therefore recommended to manage in-field soil variation, which can result in optimizing input seed rates for increasing maize productivity and profitability.

TI  - A multi-method approach to analyse changes in gully characteristics between 2009 and 2018 in southeast Nigeria
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully erosion is the dominant environmental problem in southeast Nigeria and has led to loss of human and material resources. In this study, we evaluated changes in gully characteristics in southeast Nigeria and their potential drivers between 2009 and 2018 using a multi-method approach: analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery (2-5 m) and focus group discussions. Gully numbers increased from 26 to 39 and mean gully length increased from 0.39 to 0.43 km. We found that land adjacent to rivers had the highest concentration of gullies which is associated with an increase in slope angle from 10 to 58% up to 500 m from rivers. Regarding potential gully-drivers, land-use changes were observed. Non-vegetated lands increased from 58.6 to 144.7 km(2) between 2009 and 2018, while reductions in fallow lands from 281.2 to 57.8 km(2) were observed. Results from focus group meetings indicate there was no gullying in the area before the Nigerian civil war (1967-1970). War-time activities such as digging trenches and increased population density were said to have led to the formation of the oldest gullies in the area. Although war-time activities have ceased, meeting attendees believed that present land-use changes have increased the volume of surface runoff and thus enhancing gully erosion. Incorporating local knowledge in this study has therefore provided a valuable understanding on the key drivers of gullying that pre-dates the availability of freely available high-resolution satellite data.

TI  - High temporal variability of surface solar irradiance due to cloud enhancement effect over the Western Ghat mountains in peninsular India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Western Ghat (WG) mountains along the west coast of peninsular India play an important role in the distribution of monsoon rainfall on its windward and leeward sides. The study unravels the increase in cloudiness and also increase in the Cloud Enhancement of Solar irradiance (CES) during the dry and wet seasons in the windward (high altitude) and the leeward (low altitude) sides of WG. From May 2018 to May 2021, the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) reveals wide temporal and spatial variability with a high frequency of CES events, even exceeding the extraterrestrial value around the noontime during the wet season (May to October). The observed excess irradiance due to partial/transparent clouds compared to clear sky maxima is more than 400 W/m(2) on the windward and 350 W/m(2) on the leeward. With the increase in cloudy days, diffused irradiance also increased with greater values during CES events. CES induced positive shortwave cloud radiative forcing (CRF) varied up to +400 W/m(2) (warming effect), while negative CRF varied up to-1000 W/m(2) (cooling effect). During monsoon, the warming due to frequent CES events could locally offset a large cooling to some extent. Clouds resulting in huge irradiance variability in a day could also induce large fluctuations in renewable solar energy. Such short-term sporadic local events are averaged out in satellite data.

TI  - Dualisms in Jihad The role of metaphor in creating ideological dichotomies
T2  - JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AGGRESSION AND CONFLICT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores how metaphors are employed in jihadist magazines to promote a dichotomist worldview of 'us' versus 'them', 'good' versus 'bad', 'east' versus 'west' and 'right' versus 'wrong'. It argues that juxtapositions in both language and thought help writers to reaffirm and/or challenge certain paradigms. The approach uses critical metaphor analysis (Charteris-Black 2004) to investigate qualitative evidence of conceptual metaphors, focusing on the domains life is a seed, conflict is a relationship between predator and prey, and faith is light/lack of faith is darkness. Dichotomous language in these domains (e.g., 'seed' versus 'weed'; 'sheep' versus 'wolves'; the 'spark of Jihad' versus the 'shadow' of Western governments) helps to position extremist groups on the right side of a number of paradigms. The use of binary metaphors also permits simultaneously conflicting conceptualisations; for instance, jihadists are both innocent victims and merciless defenders of their faith, depending on with whom or what they are juxtaposed. The research concludes that the use of binary metaphors serves to underscore entrenched paradigms of 'good' versus 'bad', thus allowing the writers to frame their discourse in a way that justifies and promotes their extremist agenda.

TI  - Trusted quantum remote sensing based on self-testing of entangled states
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW A
M3  - Article
AB  - In a typical scenario of quantum remote sensing, a server at the remote site sends the sensing information to the local site, so that the client there can make a diagnosis about the sensed field. In practice, the reliability of the sensing information may be undermined by kinds of errors, e.g., the imperfections of measurement devices or the attacks from a malicious eavesdropper. An alternative way to circumvent this problem is to encode the sensing information into entangled states, of which the form can be inferred in a device-independent manner, namely, self-testing. In this paper, we propose a protocol to make secure sensing of a parameter at the remote side. Upon receiving the remote sensing data, the local client can figure out the parameter range by inspecting the joint probabilities. In stark contrast, a malicious eavesdropper who is allowed to access all the remote data cannot either acquire the information of the parameter or cheat the client by replacing returned data with fake ones. We apply this protocol to a magnetic sensing scenario, and we show that the client can reliably estimate the strength range of the magnetic field, which could be intimately related to various mineral resources. Consequently, the client should not overslip any mineral resources by identifying the upper bound of magnetic strength. We also show that our protocol is valid even if the entangled states are mildly noisy.

TI  - Multi-technique geodetic detection of onshore and offshore subsidence along the Upper Adriatic Sea coasts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We assess about 20 years of onshore and offshore subsidence along a sector of the Upper Adriatic Sea (Italy) coastal areas affected by natural soil compaction and intense anthropogenic activities such as aquifers exploi-tation and hydrocarbons extraction. Our approach is based on the synergistic use of independent remote sensing and in-situ geodetic data to detect and spatially characterise the deformation pattern by cross-validating the different available measurements. We collect extensive datasets from i) SAR images provided by Envisat, Cosmo-SkyMed and Sentinel-1 missions, ii) GNSS measurements from continuous stations managed by public in-stitutions, local authorities and private companies and iii) Leveling surveys. The cross-validation analysis shows good agreement among all the independent datasets, thus providing a reliable assessment of the ongoing deformation. We detect an onshore and offshore subsidence peak of about -1/-1.5 cm/yr in the proximity of the coastline, close to Lido di Dante and Fiumi Uniti villages, and at the present offshore platform. The outcomes highlight how the integration of different remote sensing and in situ geodetic techniques is successful to retrieve deformation history in time and space in complex areas, where different natural and anthropogenic sources concur to the overall deformation pattern. Moreover, such approach provides a robust support to modelling studies for hazard assessment in both inland and shoreline areas.

TI  - Trace element and lipidomic analysis of bottlenose dolphin blubber from the Yucatan coast: Lipid composition relationships
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are found in coastal and estuarine ecosystems where they are in continuous contact with multiple abiotic and biotic stressors in the environment. Due to their role as predators, they can bioaccumulate contaminants and are considered sentinel organisms for monitoring the health of coastal marine ecosystems. The northern zonal coast of the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico has a high incidence of anthropogenic activities. The principal objectives of this study were two-fold: 1) to determine the presence of trace metals and their correlation with lipids in bottlenose dolphin blubber, and 2) to use a lipidomics approach to characterize their biological responses. Levels of trace elements (Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, Pb) were analyzed using ICP-MS and lipids were measured using a targeted lipidomics approach with LC-MS/MS. Spearman correlation analysis was used to identify associations between lipids and trace elements. The in-fluences of gender, stranding codes, presence of stomach content, growth stages and body length were also analyzed. Blubber lipid composition was dominated by triacylglycerols (TAG). Our results demonstrated the presence of heavy-metal elements such as Cd and As, which were correlated with different lipid species, mainly the ceramides and glycerophospholipids, respectively. Organisms with Cd showed lower concentrations of ceramides (CER, HCER and DCER), TAG and cholesteryl esters (CE). Trace elements Cr, Co, As and Cd increased proportionately with body length. This study provides a novel insight of lipidomic characterization and corre-lations with trace elements in the bottlenose dolphin which might contribute to having a better understanding of the physiological functions and the risks that anthropogenic activities can bring to sentinel organisms from coastal regions.

TI  - Assessing post-fire forest structure recovery by combining LiDAR data and Landsat time series in Mediterranean pine forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding post-fire recovery dynamics is critical for effective management that enhance forest resilience to fire. Mediterranean pine forests have been largely affected by wildfires, but the impacts of both changes in land use and climate endanger their capacity to naturally recover. Multispectral imagery is commonly used to estimate post-fire recovery, yet changes in forest structure must be considered for a comprehensive evaluation of forest recovery. In this research, we combine Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) with Landsat imagery to extrapolate forest structure variables over a 30-year period (1990-2020) to provide insights on how forest structure has recovered after fire in Mediterranean pine forests. Forest recovery was evaluated attending to vegetation cover (VC), tree cover (TC), mean height (MH) and heterogeneity (CVH). Structure variables were derived from two LiDAR acquisitions from 2016 and 2009, for calibration and independent spatial and temporal validation. A Support Vector Regression model (SVR) was calibrated to extrapolate LiDAR-derived variables using a series of Landsat imagery, achieving an R-2 of 0.78, 0.64, 0.70 and 0.63, and a relative RMSE of 24.4%, 30.2%, 36.5% and 27.4% for VC, TC, MH and CVH, respectively. Models showed to be consistent in the temporal validation, although a wider variability was observed, with R-2 ranging from 0.51 to 0.74. A different response to fire was revealed attending to forest cover and height since vegetation cover recovered to a pre-fire state but mean height did not 26-years after fire. Less than 50% of the area completely recovered to the pre-fire structure within 26 years, and the area subjected to fire recurrence showed signs of greater difficulty in initiating the recovery. Our results provide valuable information on forest structure recovery, which can support the implementation of mitigation and adaptation strategies that enhance fire resilience.

TI  - Urbanization-induced impacts on heat-energy fluxes in tropical South America from 1984 to 2020: The Metropolitan Area of Rio de Janeiro/Brazil
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study aims to better understand the energy balance in tropical and wet climate urban areas by developing a 37-year (1984-2020) energy balance climatology based on SEBAL algorithm and Landsat data for Metropolitan Area of Rio de Janeiro (MARJ). Particularly, our results show that MARJ lost 13% of its vegetation cover and its urban area almost doubled since the 1980s decade. We show a positive (negative) urban-vegetation albedo (net radiation) difference in MARJ contributing to reduce the UHI intensity, but not capable to compensate for the warming effects related to the partitioning of latent and sensible heat fluxes. Our results revealed that the UHI intensity along the year in MARJ is maximum (minimum) during summer (winter) when the urban-vegetation temperature, sensible and latent heat fluxes absolute differences reach maximum values around 9.9 degrees C (3.8 degrees C), 150 Wm-2 (71 Wm-2), and 330 Wm-2 (145 Wm-2). We observe a great reduction of latent heat flux in urban areas in agreement with the pronounced effect of urbanization on wet climate regions. Thus, alternative/original strategies, not only based on increasing green areas, may be needed to reduce the urban warming in MARJ.

TI  - Long-term follow up after sentinel node biopsy alone for early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Sentinel node biopsy alone (SNB) reduces the postoperative complications of pelvic lymphadenec-tomy, such as lymphedema and lymphangitis; however, the long-term prognosis after SNB is unclear. The objec-tive of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome and complications of patients with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent SNB for hysterectomy or trachelectomy.Methods. We performed SNB for cervical cancer using a radioisotope method in 181 patients between 2009 and 2017. If the intraoperative sentinel lymph node evaluation was negative for metastasis, no further lymph nodes were removed.Results. The median age of the patients was 34 years (range, 21-73 years). The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2008 stage was IA1 in 6 patients, IA2 in 18, IB1 in 154, and IIA1 in 3. Of the 181 patients (44 with hysterectomy, 137 with trachelectomy), 8 did not undergo pelvic lymphadenectomy because of a false-negative intraoperative diagnosis, 20 received adjuvant therapy after surgery, and 4 (2.2%) experienced recur-rence over a median follow-up period of 83.5 months (range, 25-145 months). In the four recurrent cases, recurrence occurred in the pelvis, lung, and bone in one patient each, while the remaining patient developed pel-vic and para-aortic lymph node metastases. Of these four patients, one died, and the remaining three are alive without disease after multidisciplinary therapy. The 5-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 98.8% and 99.4%, respectively. Postoperative complications, such as lymphedema, were very low rate.Conclusions. SNB for early-stage cervical cancer might be safe and effective, with no increase in the recurrence and postoperative complications rate. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Monitoring the change of Turkey's tourism city Antalya's Konyaalti shoreline with multi-source satellite and meteorological data
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncontrolled tourism activities cause the destruction of nature and deterioration of the ecological balance. Since coastal areas are both economically and socially important, monitoring shoreline changes has become one of the important research areas. Monitoring short-term and long-term changes in coastal areas is important to prevent damages that may occur due to natural and human factors and protect the shorelines. In this study, which is an important tourist city of Antalya, Turkey, and the world, coastal changes using historical and recent satellite data have been analyzed. The focus of the study is to analyze long-term coastal change with Landsat data and the data obtained every 5 years between 1985 and 2020 and to analyze short-term change with annual Sentinel-2 data between 2015 and 2020. In the study, water areas on the coastline were determined by object-based classification and multiresolution segmentation method with the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). The obtained shorelines were analyzed with the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) tool and the changes in the coastal areas were determined statistically. Five-year and 35-year changes were compared with Linear Regression Rate (LRR) and End Point Rate (EPR) analyses. As a result of the study, when the Pearson's r value between EPR and LRR was examined, r was found 0.916 and 0.944 for 5-year and 35-year data, respectively. Spatial resolution in satellite images is vital for shoreline detection. However, the most optimal way to detect long-term changes in the shoreline is to use Landsat data. Although the spatial resolution of Landsat data, it has been observed that the power to analyze annual variation differences is lower than Sentinel-2.

TI  - The capabilities of Sentinel-MSI (2A/2B) and Landsat-OLI (8/9) in seagrass and algae species differentiation using spectral reflectance
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper assesses the reflectance difference values between the respective spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) of Sentinel 2A/2B Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8/9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors for seagrass, algae, and mixed species discrimination and monitoring in a shallow marine environment southeast of Bahrain Island in the Arabian Gulf. To achieve these, a field survey was conducted to collect samples of seawater, underwater sediments, seagrass (Halodule uninervis and Halophila stipulacea), and algae (green and brown). In addition, an experimental mode was established in a goniometric laboratory to simulate the marine environment, and spectral measurements were performed using an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) spectroradiometer. Measured spectra and their transformation using the continuum-removed reflectance spectral (CRRS) approach were analyzed to assess spectral separability among separate or mixed species at varying coverage rates. Afterward, the spectra were resampled and convolved in the solar-reflective spectral bands of MSI and OLI sensors and converted into water vegetation indices (WVIs) to investigate the potential of red, green, and blue bands for seagrass and algae species discrimination. The results of spectral and CRRS analyses highlighted the importance of the blue, green, and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths for seagrass and algae detection and likely discrimination based on hyperspectral measurements. However, when resampled and convolved in MSI and OLI bands, spectral information loses the specific and unique absorption features and becomes more generalized and less precise. There- fore, relying on the multispectral bandwidth of MSI and OLI sensors, it is difficult or even impossible to differentiate or to map seagrass and algae individually at the species level. Instead of the red band, the integration of the blue or the green band in WVI increases their power to discriminate submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), particularly the water adjusted vegetation index (WAVI), water enhanced vegetation index (WEVI), and water transformed difference vegetation index (WTDVI). These results corroborate the spectral and the CRRS analyses. However, despite the power of blue wavelength to penetrate deeper into the water, it also leads to a relative overestimation of dense SAV coverage due to more scattering in this part of the spectrum. Furthermore, statistical fits (p <0.05) between the reflectance in the respective VNIR bands of MSI and OLI revealed excellent linear relationships (R-2 of 0.999) with insignificant root mean square difference (RMSD) (<= 0.0015). Important agreement (0.63 <= R-2 <= 0.96) was also obtained between respective WVI regardless of the integrated spectral bands (i.e., red, green, and blue), yielding insignificant RMSD (<= 0.01). Accordingly, these results pointed out that MSI and OLI sensors are spectrally similar, and their data can be used jointly to monitor accurately the spatial distribution of SAV and its dynamic in time and space in shallow marine environments, provided that rigorous data pre-processing issues are addressed.

TI  - Evaluation and comparison of MERRA-2 AOD and DAOD with MODIS DeepBlue and AERONET data in Australia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Validated dust and aerosol datasets provide valuable information for dust and other atmospheric research. A reanalysis product called 'MERRA-2' developed by NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) in recent years provides long-term, high frequency, global coverage aerosol simulations, in terms of AOD (aerosol optical depth) and dust AOD (DAOD). The AOD assimilation system including AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) as constraints has led to difficulties with independent validation of MERRA-2 AOD and DAOD. The existing validation and evaluation of MERRA-2 tend to focus on central inland Australia, and comparison of DAOD with MACC (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate) is insufficient to indicate which one is more appropriate for dust research in Australia. In this study, MERRA-2 output was compared with MODIS DeepBlue (MODIS-DB) (2002-2020) and AERONET (1998-2020) AOD and DAOD in Australia. The expected error (EE) for MERRA-2 AOD was estimated to be +/-(0.03 +0.15 tau(A)) containing 66% of data points. MERRA-2 is less well correlated with AERONET in terms of DAOD, but with a tighter distribution of data points (78%) within the EE. The EE for MODIS-DB AOD was found to be the same and the correlation between MODIS-DB DAOD and AERONET DAOD is stronger than that between MERRA-2 DAOD and AERONET DAOD. Comparison of MERRA-2 and MODIS-DB AOD showed that MERRA-2 AOD was 22.5% higher than MODIS-DB AOD at AERONET sites on average. MERRA-2 AOD was generally lower than MODIS-DB AOD away from AERONET sites when AOD > 0.1, and the spatial distribution of the difference between the two is consistent with the spatial variation in AOD. Large differences between MODIS-DB AOD and MERRA-2 occurred in areas where AOD is greater than 0.3. AOD and DAOD based on MODIS-DB could be used for areas away from AERONET sites in Australia, as they are less dependent on AERONET data compared to MERRA-2. When compared to MODIS brightness temperature difference (BTD) for two known severe storm events in Australia, MODIS-DB product is better than MERRA-2 in terms of detecting the spatial extent of dust storms and estimating the storm intensity. MERRA-2 would underestimate the magnitude and spatial extent of AOD, especially for thick dust plumes, and AERONET was likely to have misclassified dust as cloud.

TI  - Establishing distribution maps and structural analysis of seagrass communities based on high-resolution remote sensing images and field surveys: a case study at Nam Yet Island, Truong Sa Archipelago, Vietnam
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrasses are among the most important ecosystems of continental and island coastal waters globally. Analyses of the species diversity, structure, and distribution mapping of seagrass communities provide a scientific basis for seagrass conservation and development and protection of the marine environment. The application of remote sensing, especially using very high-resolution remote sensing data, in mapping seagrass distribution confers high accuracy and detailed results. The distribution of seagrass communities and benthic biomes typical of Nam Yet Island, Truong Sa Archipelago, Vietnam was mapped using object-based classification of Pleiades satellite imagery with four spectral bands (red, blue, green, and near-infrared) and the Green-Blue Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, combined with handheld positioning devices (total field samples 100, overall accuracy 91%, kappa coefficient = 0.88). Besides, by sampling and measurement in the field, two seagrass species, Thalassia hemprichii and Halophila ovalis were identified with the same structure, density, and biomass in the northern and southern parts of the island. The application of high-resolution remote sensing images combined with field surveys contributes to improving the accuracy of seagrass distribution maps as well as benthic biome ones for shallow sea areas. Establishing a seagrass distribution map and assessing the diversity of seagrass is the basis for the conservation and development of the current seagrass community at Nam Yet Island.

TI  - Gestalt closure strategies for rendering personified images of Moon, Sun, Love, and Death in poetry translation into Ukrainian
T2  - PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work highlights the translation strategies motivated by the matrices of the national poetic mappings of the world in the original and recipient cultures. Its purpose lies in displaying the immediate connection between the patterns of translators' reframing the poetic source images and the conceptual structure of prototype gestalts that have taken root in the source and target poetic traditions. The methodological instrument of revealing and describing this link has been found in the conceptual analysis of images within the framework of the English and Ukrainian poetic models of the world and in the application of the gestaltist laws of Pragnanz and Closure that appear to be efficient in elucidating the motivation of translatorial decisions in case a complex source image presents a considerable translation problem due to its inviolable links with specific conceptual schemas ingrained in the target poetic worldview. The paper delineates the cognitive underpinnings of translators' decisions in the situations of limited translatability of the source-personified images conditioned by their culture-bound gender characteristics. Although the research is performed on the basis of two concrete poetic worldview systems, it investigates universal cognitive regularities of literary translation as gestalt principles state the general rules of human perception.

TI  - Multi-modal temporal attention models for crop mapping from satellite time series
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical and radar satellite time series are synergetic: optical images contain rich spectral information, while C band radar captures useful geometrical information and is immune to cloud cover. Motivated by the recent success of temporal attention-based methods across multiple crop mapping tasks, we propose to investigate how these models can be adapted to operate on several modalities. We implement and evaluate multiple fusion schemes, including a novel approach and simple adjustments to the training procedure, significantly improving performance and efficiency with little added complexity. We show that most fusion schemes have advantages and drawbacks, making them relevant for specific settings. We then evaluate the benefit of multimodality across several tasks: parcel classification, pixel-based segmentation, and panoptic parcel segmentation. We show that by leveraging both optical and radar time series, multimodal temporal attention-based models can outmatch single modality models in terms of performance and resilience to cloud cover. To conduct these experiments, we augment the PASTIS dataset (Garnot and Landrieu, 2021a) with spatially aligned radar image time series. The resulting dataset, PASTIS-R, constitutes the first large-scale, multimodal, and open-access satellite time series dataset with semantic and instance annotations.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node tumour burden using digital cell count estimation predicts outcomes in melanoma
T2  - HISTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims: Cutaneous melanoma often metastasises in primis to sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Currently, there is no standardized method of characterizing the micrometastatic tumour burden in SLN biopsies for melanoma. Different criteria have been developed to evaluate SLN biopsies, yet none consider the number of cells identified. Here, we used software analysis to digitally quantify metastatic tumour burden within SLNs and correlated these data with clinicopathological and prognostic information.Methods and results: We identified 246 cases of SLN biopsies, including 63 positive (26%) and183 (74%) negative for metastatic melanoma. Digital cell counting was performed within the greatest metastatic focus and the entire metastatic tumour burden within the same SLN. Increasing cell count in the largest metastatic deposit correlated with the previously described Rotterdam [Spearman's r = 0.91; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.84, 0.94], Starz (Spearman's r = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.68, 0.87) and Dewar criteria (P < 0.01), validating our method of using cell count to define SLN tumour burden. Additionally, increasing cell count was associated with decreased metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.22, 4.31).Conclusion: These data support the use of computerized cell count analysis for prognostication of outcomes in patients undergoing SLN biopsy.

TI  - Distribution of Harmful Algae (<i>Karenia</i> spp.) in October 2021 Off Southeast Hokkaido, Japan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - An unprecedented large-scale outbreak of harmful algae, including Karenia selliformis and Karenia mikimotoi, was reported in mid-September 2021 in the northwest Pacific Ocean off southeastern Hokkaido, Japan. It inflicted catastrophic damage on coastal fisheries in the ensuing months. To understand the spatiotemporal distribution of Karenia spp. abundance, we conducted extensive ship-based surveys across several water masses during 4-14 October, 2021 and analyzed in-situ data in combination with Sentinel-3-derived ocean color imagery with a horizontal resolution of 300 m. High chlorophyll-a concentrations (exceeding 10 mg m(-3)) were identified mainly in coastal shelf-slope waters of <1,000-m water depth occupied by Surface Coastal Oyashio Water or Modified Soya Warm Current Water. Karenia spp. abundance was strongly correlated with chlorophyll-a concentration, which typically had a shallow vertical maximum within the surface mixed layer. Large- and small-scale distributions of Karenia spp. abundance at the ocean surface were estimated from two satellite-imagery products: maximum line height and red-band difference. Maps generated of Karenia spp. abundance revealed snapshots of dynamic Karenia bloom distributions. Specifically, the cores of Karenia blooms were located on continental shelves, sometimes locally exceeded 10(4) cells mL(-1), and seemed to be connected intermittently to very nearshore waters. Relatively high-abundance areas (>10(3) cells mL(-1)) of Karenia spp. on the shelf were characterized by submesoscale (i.e., 1-10 km) patch- or streak-like distributions, or both. Within a roughly 24-h period from 12 to 13 October, Karenia-spp. abundances averaged over the shelf abruptly increased more than doubled; these abundance spikes were associated with the combined effects of physical advection and algal growth. The obtained maps and features of Karenia spp. abundance will provide basic estimates needed to understand the processes and mechanisms by which algal blooms can inflict damage on regional fisheries.

TI  - Modeling the impacts of land use/land cover change on meteorology and air quality during 2000-2018 in the Yangtze River Delta region, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The land use/land cover (LULC) change in the fast-developing city clusters of China exhibits impacts on both the meteorology and air quality. However, this effect, especially in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), has not been well quantified. In this study, the LULC data are extracted from Landsat satellite imageries for year 2000 and 2018 for the YRD region. The Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) model is applied to investigate the impact of historical LULC change on regional meteorology and air pollution over the YRD region during the past two decades. Two simulation scenarios are performed with two sets of LULC data to represent the pre-urbanization (LULC of year 2000) and the most recent urban pattern (LULC of year 2018). Results indicate that rapid urbanization leads to an increase of monthly mean 2-m temperature by 0.4-2.1 degrees C but decrease of the 10-m wind speed by 0.5-1.3 m/s in urban areas; the maximum increase of daytime planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) in July and November is 289 and 132 m, respectively. Affected by favorable changes in the meteorological conditions due to LULC change, the PM2.5 concentrations in most urban areas show a decreasing trend, especially during the nighttime in summer. On the contrary, surface ozone (O3) concentration in urban areas has increased by 7.2-9.8 ppb in summer and 1.9-2.1 ppb in winter. Changes in O3 concentration are inversely proportional to changes in NOx and the spatial distribution of PM2.5. Areas with higher O3 concentration are consistent with areas of higher temperature and lower wind speed. Our findings reveal that LULC changes during the past years bring observable changes in air pollutant concentrations, which should not be neglected in the YRD region regarding air quality trends as well as policy evaluations under the warming threat.

TI  - Spatial estimation of the optimum PV tilt angles in China by incorporating ground with satellite data
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tilt angle is a key parameter that affects solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation. Traditional empirical model based on latitude may fail to estimate the optimum tilt angle in regions with large climatic dif-ferences. In this study, we propose a framework that incorporates ground with satellite data to determine the optimum tilt angle at any location. We collect global solar radiation measurements of 133 stations in China and estimate the diffuse fraction through Boland-Ridley-Lauret model. Hourly PV power gen-eration is modelled by considering photoelectric conversion process and PV system losses. The results show that the optimum tilt angles are highly correlated with latitude and diffuse fraction with an R of 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. Empirical models reconciled by diffuse fraction allow for spatial estimates of the optimum tilt angle from satellite data to reflect the climatic influence. Furthermore, we explore the benefit from periodically adjusting the tilt angle in China. PV panels fixed at the optimum tilt angle increase the annual power yield by 13.7% compared with horizontally fixed panels. Seasonal adjustment largely increases power yield in winter; additional yield gain of monthly adjustment is very limited; while tracking systems provide the option of achieving double or even triple gains.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Analysis of Spatiotemporal Land Subsidence Patterns of Suzhou City, China, over the Past 15 years Based on Multisource SAR Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of land subsidence causes geo-hazards to the natural environment and the infrastructure in Suzhou city, the most economically developed city in Jiangsu Province, China. In this work, multisource synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets acquired during 2003-2017 by ENVISAT ASAR (C-band), ALOS PALSAR (L-band), COSMO-SkyMED (X-band) and Sentinel-1A (C-band) are used to record and describe spatiotemporal variations in land subsidence in Suzhou after the prohibition of groundwater exploitation in 2005 with the Small Baseline Subset Interferometric SAR (SBAS-InSAR) method. Correlation analysis between the ENVISAT ASAR and ALOS PALSAR results demonstrated that the SBAS-InSAR method is feasible for land subsidence monitoring in Suzhou city. The multisource InSAR results were validated by levelling survey data of 24 points, and the precision of the InSAR results is less than 5 mm/year. The InSAR results show that the land subsidence rate ranges from - 90 to 40 mm/year in Suzhou city. The maximum annual subsidence rate along the Metro line, over the residential areas and industrial areas reached - 37 mm, - 77 mm and - 90 mm, respectively. However, there is land rebound in some old urban areas. The land subsidence results are compared with the groundwater level at nine wells distributed in Xiangcheng and Wuzhong districts, and the comparison results show that the rise in groundwater level leads to land rebound after the prohibition of groundwater exploitation by the local government in 2005. Our study indicated that land subsidence in Suzhou city has been mitigated with the implementation of groundwater prohibition measures.

AB  - Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is a volatile biogenic gas with the potential to influence regional climate as a source of atmospheric aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The complexity of the oceanic DMS cycle presents a challenge in accurately predicting sea surface concentrations and sea-air fluxes of this gas. In this study, we applied machinelearning methods to model the distribution of DMS in the northeast subarctic Pacific (NESAP), a global DMS hot spot. Using nearly two decades of ship-based DMS observations, combined with satellite-derived oceanographic data, we constructed ensembles of 1000 machine-learning models using two techniques: random forest regression (RFR) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Our models dramatically improve upon existing statistical DMS models, capturing up to 62 % of observed DMS variability in the NESAP and demonstrating notable regional patterns that are associated with mesoscale oceanographic variability. In particular, our results indicate a strong coherence between DMS concentrations, sea surface nitrate (SSN) concentrations, photo-synthetically active radiation (PAR), and sea surface height anomalies (SSHA), suggesting that NESAP DMS cycling is primarily influenced by heterogenous nutrient availability, light-dependent processes and physical mixing. Based on our model output, we derive summertime, sea-air flux estimates of 1.16 +/- 1.22 Tg S in the NESAP. Our work demonstrates a new approach to capturing spatial and temporal patterns in DMS variability, which is likely applicable to other oceanic regions.

M3  - Review
AB  - The severe harmful impact of atmospheric aerosols over the environment leads to create the diverse human interests and concerns. Various progressive steps were taken by researchers and scientists to understand the fundamentals, such as nucleation and growth mechanisms, formalization of particle dynamics, characterization of the mechanisms for the particle-size dispensation, detection of chemical processes for atmospheric particle sources. The increase in population growth and different manmade activities have led to change in the environmental conditions causes to pollute the distinct vicinities. Different changes in the environment such as land use pattern, increased concentration of various greenhouse gases, and Industrial pollutants change the energy balance in our climatic conditions and affect the radiation budget of earth' atmosphere. Such changes in climate and polluted environment leads to many health-related ailments to mankind. The present study outlines the recent research perspectives of atmospheric aerosols, their estimation through different modes, effects, and an overview of the current situations that need to be addressed before they become completely incorporated.

TI  - The <i>spectralrao</i>-<i>monitoring </i>Python package: A RAO's Q diversity index-based application for land-cover/land-use change detection in multifunctional agricultural areas
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring multifunctional agricultural areas is paramount to ensure their cost-effective management. The remote sensing-based detection of land-cover/land-use (LCLU) changes and analysis of vegetation dynamics constitute a relevant indicator to support robust monitoring schemes, allowing the control of agri-environmental conditions and enforcing related measures and policies. The Rao's Q diversity index (RaoQ) is frequently used to measure functional diversity in ecology, thanks to the textural analysis of the environment. This paper aims to develop and provide an open-source Python application whose workflow may constitute a RaoQ-based LCLU change monitoring tool for multifunctional agricultural areas. Here, a use case is presented for detecting and mapping LCLU changes leveraging the free and open access Landsat 8 (L8) satellite data. The workflow is organized in four main stages: (1) data processing; (2) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculation; (3) RaoQ calculation; and (4) detection and mapping of LCLU changes through thresholding of RaoQ. Three methodological approaches were developed (RaoC - "classic " RaoQ; RaoMD - "multidimensional " RaoQ, and "classic + multidimensional " RaoQ) with overall accuracies ranging from 0.88 to 0.92. An example of an agri-environmental monitoring decision-support framework based on spectralrao-monitoring is presented. The application is easily reproducible, and the code is fully available and utilizable with other sensors at different resolutions to support monitoring other types of agricultural areas.

TI  - Towards accurate mapping of forest in tropical landscapes: A comparison of datasets on how forest transition matters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests represent half of the Earth's remaining forest area, but they are shrinking at high rates, which poses a threat to their multiple ecosystem services. As a response, international environmental agreements and related programs require information about tropical forested landscapes. Despite the increasing quantity and quality of remote sensing-based data, the effective monitoring of forests in the tropics still faces operational challenges: (a) applicability at local levels, with lack of reference or cloud-free information; (b) overcoming geographical, ecological, or biophysical variability; (c): stratification, distinguishing forest categories related to functionality and disturbance history. We conducted an extensive ground verification campaign through 36 landscapes in 9 regions of Zambia, Ecuador and Philippines, which constitute a gradient of pantropical deforestation contexts or forest transitions. We collected over 16,000 ground control points and digitized over 18,000 ha with details on land use and forest disturbance history. We trained a random forest algorithm and generated high-resolution (30 m) binary forest maps covering ~15 Mha, building on 39 optical (Landsat-8), radar (Sentinel-1) and elevation bands, indices and textures. We validated the quality of the outputs across the studied deforestation gradient and compared them to (a): 3 national land cover maps used for international reporting, (b): 4 global forest datasets (Global Forest Change, Copernicus Land Cover, JAXA and TanDEM-X Forest/Non-Forest). Our method generated highly accurate (92%) forest maps for the studied regions when compared to the global datasets, which generally overestimated forest cover. We achieved accuracies similar to the national maps, following a standardized method for all countries. The difficulties in delineating forest increased in more advanced stages of deforestation, with recurring struggles to distinguish non-forest tree-based systems (e.g. perennials, palms, or agroforestry), shrublands and grasslands. Regrowth forests were repeatedly misclassified across contexts, countries and datasets, in contrast to reference or degraded forests. Our results highlight the importance of in situ verification as accompanying method to establish efficient forest monitoring systems, especially in areas with higher rates of forest cover change and in tropical regions of advanced deforestation or early reforestation stages. These are precisely the areas where current REDD+ or Forest Landscape Restoration initiatives take place.

TI  - Multifrequency Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Data for Backscatter-Based Characterization of Land Use and Land Cover
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar remote sensing extracts the information about the target using decomposition models to separate the polarimetric information into single-bounce (contributed by smooth surfaces), double-bounce (contributed by urban structure), and volume (mainly due to vegetation cover) scattering components. The penetration capacity of the electromagnetic wave into the surface increases with the decrease in its frequency. This study explores and compares the polarimetric decomposition models for scattering-based characterization of land use and cover using multifrequency spaceborne synthetic aperture radar sensor datasets that were acquired over San Francisco, CA, USA. The present work compares the scattering parameters of coherent (Pauli), roll-invariant (Barnes), eigenvalue-eigenvector (Cloude), and compact-polarimetric (Raney) decomposition modeling approaches for scattering-based characterization of urban structures, waterbody, and vegetation cover. The land use/cover classification was performed based on the scattering response of the scatterers using a support vector machine classifier. The outputs of the classification approach on multisensor, multifrequency, and multi-polarization polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data have shown reasonable accuracy in classifying the land use and land cover. The decomposition models fail to characterize the oriented urban structures that cause misclassification of urban structures as vegetation. The higher-order roll-invariant decomposition modeling approaches could improve the interpretation of different targets and accuracy in land use and land cover classification.

TI  - Mapping the rapid development of photovoltaic power stations in northwestern China using remote sensing
T2  - ENERGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many leading countries are boosting renewables, especially solar energy, as a major way to mitigate future energy crises and climate change. Particularly, in China, the number and scale of photovoltaic (PV) power stations have grown unprecedentedly in the last decade. There is an urgent need to monitor the PV power development in order to accurately estimate national renewable potentials and understand the ecological impacts. However, there are few efforts towards providing spatially explicit and time-series datasets of PV development at the regional and national scales. To fill the gap, this study proposes an integrated remote sensing approach for PV power stations mapping by combining image segmentation and object-based classification (ISOC) techniques. We took five northwestern provinces of China as an illustration and produced 30-m medium-resolution PV power station distribution maps from 2007 to 2019. Our analysis shows that the total area of PV power stations in the five provinces increased to 722 km(2) in 2019, with producer, user and overall accuracies of 86%, 100% and 93%. Of the 309 PV station clusters (hereafter, PV parks), the top 7% largest ones account for 61% of the total area of PV power stations, indicating that PV power stations in the Northwest tend to be developed in the form of large-scale centralized PV parks. The land used for PV power stations was mainly converted from four land cover types: Gobi Desert, sandy land, sparse grassland, and moderate grassland. The central government policy on facilitating clean energy played a major role in driving the rapid expansion of PV parks across the country. The methodology and results of this study will help policymakers, researchers, and practitioners to develop corresponding industrial standards and environmental regulations to mitigate the potential environmental impacts, and promote more sustainable development of solar energy in China and beyond.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Oligo-Miocene basaltic exposures at Wadi Abu Qada - Wadi Wata area, west-central Sinai Peninsula occur as intra-continental fissure-fed eruptions in the form of km-scale sill attaining thickness of about 30 m and dyke of about 70 m thick, intruding/extruding the Early Cretaceous to Early Eocene sedimentary sequences. Stratigraphy of the study area was dealt with in the context of the geologic setting of these Oligo-Miocene basalts, which are genetically related to the Gulf of Suez rifting in the late Oligocene. These basaltic exposures were discriminated from their surrounding sedimentary rocks using ASTER, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets. Spectral characteristics of these basalts were determined by remotely-sensed satellite data as well as by using a handled ASD mineral identifier. Advanced image processing techniques were applied and many images processing algorithms were used in image enhancement including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Band ratios, Decorrelation Stretch (DS), Mixture Tuned Match Filter (MTMF), and ASTER mineral's indices. All these techniques in conjunction with petrographical investigations were applied in lithological discrimination of the studied Oligo-Miocene basalts and new geological mapping were accomplished and verified by field data. The considered Oligo-Miocene basaltic rocks are mainly olivine dolerite with minor olivine porphyritic basalts. The main mineralogical components are plagioclase, augite and olivine with subordinate Fe-Ti oxides (ferriilmente and titanomagnetite).(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Inverted urethral flap reconstruction after partial penectomy: Long-term oncological and functional outcomes
T2  - UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Penile aesthetics after partial penectomy (PP) for penile cancer (PC), significantly affect a patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL), self-esteem, and sexual function. Satisfactory reconstruction has become a major milestone in the treatment of these patients.Methods: Clinical charts of all patients that underwent PP and reconstruction with an inverted urethral flap (IUF) were reviewed. The primary endpoints were recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) which were graphically represented by Kaplan-Meier estimates. The key secondary endpoints were Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), erectile function, and lower urinary tract symptoms.Results: Between May 2007 and December 2019, 74 patients with PC underwent PP and IUF reconstruction. The median age was 62 years (IQR 52-76), median follow-up was 72 months (IQR 38-121). Twenty-nine patients (39.2%) underwent inguinal lymph node dissection, 62 (83.8%) underwent dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy. Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS, RFS, and PFS showed a 6-year OS of 86.5%, 6-year RFS of 90.5%, and a 6-year PFS of 85.1%. Regarding functional outcomes, we found a mean global health score of 84.6% +/- 10.4 at the EQ-5D-3L-VAS. The mean Voiding score of the ICIQ-MLUTS was 1.7 +/- 3.2 and a mean IIEF-5 score of 17.3 +/- 7.Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, we report the largest cohort in the literature of PP with IUF reconstruction. These results are important since early-stage PC is the most common stage at diagnosis. In carefully selected patients' preservation of a longer urethral stump to allow for the inverted flap is safe and does not compromise oncological outcomes while preserving HRQoL.

TI  - Climatic determinants of photosynthetic activity in humid subtropical forests under different forestry activities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are key ecosystems providing a variety of contributions to societies that are based on the ecological processes occurring in them. Understanding the relationship between ecological processes and the climate system is essential to predict how they will respond to possible future climatic conditions and trajectories. In this study, the relationship between climate variables and vegetation dynamics was studied in different plots of preserved native forest, selectively logged forests, and pine plantations in an area of humid subtropical forest in Misiones, Argentina. Time series analysis via gaussian processes and multiple regressions with the moving average of explanatory variables combined with Bayesian model selection using the lowest Bayesian Information Index as selection criteria were used to determine the relationship between the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and meteorological variables including temperature, rainfall, global radiation, and potential evapotranspiration. Our results showed that EVI's variability is best explained by a combination of the moving average of temperature, global radiation, and the logarithm of potential evapotranspiration. The estimated EVI value is the minimum predicted value of each linear function of these variables, indicating that these ecosystems are conditioned by the most limiting meteorological variable for vegetation growth at each time among potential evapotranspiration, global radiation, and temperature, but not by a linear combination of these. The different ecosystems, in turn, responded differently to climatic variables. Both logged forests and pine plantations exhibited near-zero slopes with both global radiation and temperature, indicating they are close to temperature and radiation saturation points. Moreover, they presented a higher sensitivity to these variables than preserved forests that were more sensitive to atmospheric water demand. The proposed methodology allowed us to separate the external climatic influence in the forest photosynthetic activity from the internal vegetation processes. Moreover, the final model was capable to capture the multi-scale temporal patterns of forest vegetation.

TI  - High precision structural mapping using edge filters of potential field and remote sensing data: A case study from Wadi Umm Ghalqa area, South Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, detecting the edges and geologic structures (deep and shallow) from potential field sources provides a fundamental tool for interpreting geological structures. Therefore, the high precision computation of the edges of potential sources is becoming an essential requirement for studying subsurface structures. In this study, nine common detectors like tilte angle (TA), Theta-map (TM), Horizontal tilt angle (TDX), hyperbolic tilt angle (HTA), Improved tilt angle (ITA), Tilt angle of the total horizontal gradient (TTHG), Tilt angle of the total gradient (TTG), improved Theta-map (ITM), and improved logistic (IL) were applied. These filters have been tested on theoretical models and real data (aeromagnetic) from the Wadi Umm Ghalqa area, South Eastern Desert of Egypt. The obtained results have shown that the improved logistic (IL) filter could detect edges more successfully than the other eight filters. The results of the IL method were used to generate new accurate structural maps for local and deep components of the investigated area. Moreover, surface structures obtained from remote sensing data were considered to control the interpretation of the mapped subsurface lineaments. Hence, the IL method can be utilized as a sharp tool for the high precision structural imaging of the potential data.

TI  - Comparison of characteristics, management and outcomes in hospital-onset and community-onset stroke: a multi-centre registry-based cohort study of acute stroke
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Hospital-onset stroke (HOS) is associated with poorer outcomes than community-onset stroke (COS). Previous studies have variably documented patient characteristics and outcome measures; here, we compare in detail characteristics, management and outcomes of HOS and COS.Methods A total of 1656 men (mean age +/- SD = 73.1 years +/- 13.2) and 1653 women (79.3 years +/- 13.0), with data prospectively collected (2014-2016) from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme, were admitted with acute stroke in four UK hyperacute stroke units (HASU). Associations between variables were examined by chi-squared tests and multivariable logistic regression (COS as reference).Results There were 272 HOS and 3037 COS patients with mean ages of 80.2 years +/- 12.5 and 76.4 years +/- SD13.5 and equal sex distribution. Compared to COS, HOS had higher proportions >= 80 years (64.0% vs 46.4%), congestive heart failure (16.9% vs 4.9%), atrial fibrillation (25.0% vs 19.7%) and pre-stroke disability (9.6% vs 5.1%), and similar history of stroke, hypertension, diabetes, stroke type and severity of stroke. After age, sex and co-morbidities adjustments, HOS had greater risk of pneumonia: OR (95%CI) = 1.9 (1.3-2.6); malnutrition: OR = 2.2 (1.7-2.9); immediate thrombolysis complications: OR = 5.3 (1.5-18.2); length of stay on HASU > 3 weeks: OR = 2.5 (1.8-3.4); post-stroke disability: OR = 1.8 (1.4-2.4); and in-hospital mortality: OR = 1.8 (1.2-2.4), as well as greater support at discharge including palliative care: OR = 1.9 (1.3-2.8); nursing care: OR = 2.0 (1.3-4.0), help for daily living activities: OR = 1.6 (1.1-2.2); and joint-care planning: OR = 1.5 (1.1-1.9).Conclusions This detailed analysis of underlying differences in subject characteristics between patients with HOS or COS and adverse consequences provides further insights into understanding poorer outcomes associated with HOS.

TI  - Detecting and mapping karst landforms using object-based image analysis: Case study: Takht-Soleiman and Parava Mountains, Iran q
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a novel, semi-automated approach for integrating decision rules and object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods for identifying and mapping karst zones and landforms. We developed a multi-resolution segmentation approach using an Approximate Gaussian function to compute the degree of fuzzy memberships of object-based features and applied it to Sentinel-2 satellite images and a digital elevation model. The object based features and decision rules were applied to identify and detect karst landforms in the semi-automated approach. The efficiency of each technique was examined based on two case studies in Takht-Soleiman and Parava-Biston in Iran using a fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) approach and ground control points. The validation of the karst landform detection and delineation yielded high accuracies for the six prominent landforms, namely Dolin (96.8%), Ouvala (99.2%), Lapiez (95.1%), Canyon (98.3%), Polje (96.1%) and Karren (97.4%), respectively. Based on the research outcome, we conclude that the combined use of spatial (e.g. shape index, compactness, asymmetry), spectral (e.g. brightness, mean and standard deviation) and textural (grey-level co-occurrence matrix, GLCM) fea-tures allows us to detect and map karst landforms efficiently. This fuzzy rule object-based approach can enhance the accuracy of geomorphological and geological maps and allows for a regular update of the usually labor-intensive geological mapping campaigns.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Clinicians' perceptions of the health status of formerly detained immigrants
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In the past decade, the U.S. immigration detention system regularly detained more than 30,000 people per day; in 2019 prior to the pandemic, the daily detention population exceeded 52,000 people. Inhumane detention conditions have been documented by internal government watchdogs, and news media and human rights groups who have observed over-crowding, poor hygiene and sanitation and poor and delayed medical care, as well as verbal, physical and sexual abuse. Methods This study surveyed health professionals across the United States who had provided care for immigrants who were recently released from immigration detention to assess clinician perceptions about the adverse health impact of immigration detention on migrant populations based on real-life clinical encounters. There were 150 survey responses, of which 85 clinicians observed medical conditions attributed to detention. Results These 85 clinicians reported seeing a combined estimate of 1300 patients with a medical issue related to their time in detention, including patients with delayed access to medical care or medicine in detention, patients with new or acute health conditions such as infection and injury attributed to detention, and patients with worsened chronic or special needs conditions. Clinicians also provided details regarding sentinel cases, categorized into the following themes: Pregnant women, Children, Mentally Ill, COVID-19, and Other serious health issue. Conclusions This is the first survey, to our knowledge, of health care professionals treating individuals upon release from detention. Due to the lack of transparency by federal entities and limited access to detainees, this survey serves as a source of credible information about conditions experienced within immigration detention facilities and is a means of corroborating immigrant testimonials and media reports. These findings can help inform policy discussions regarding systematic changes to the delivery of healthcare in detention, quality assurance and transparent reporting.

TI  - Lake ice deformation on Khovsgol Lake from Sentinel data before, during and after the 2021 Mw 6.7 earthquake in Turt, Mongolia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Khovsgol Lake, a seasonal ice-covered lake located in boreal Siberia, plays important economic, transportation and agricultural roles for local residents. On 11 January 2021, an Mw 6.7 earthquake struck the center of this lake, providing a unique opportunity to better understand lake ice movement, ridge distribution, and hydraulic and hydrodynamic processes, as a result of the mainshock. We use a pixel-tracking method on both Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar and Sentinel-2 optical remote-sensing data covering this lake before, during and after the mainshock to obtain lake-ice displacement. Combining these measurements with different viewing geometries, we determine the locations of pressure ridges in each period and derive their relative 3D displacement maps with a precision of <2.2 m. Our results indicate a large E-W displacement of up to 10.3 m and a vertical displacement of up to 4.6 m during the coseismic period, which has a distinctly different magnitude and pattern of displacement compared to the pre- and post-event periods. Given the ice motion pattern and magnitude, we speculate that the unique ice displacement of Khovsgol Lake may have been caused by a rare seismic seiche after the mainshock.

TI  - A global 30-m ET model (HSEB) using harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2, MODIS and VIIRS: Comparison to ECOSTRESS ET and LST
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in earth observation science in recent years have contributed to improving the quantification of evapotranspiration (ET) at field, regional and global scales. Many studies have stressed the need for a high temporal and spatial resolution ET product that minimizes the bias between modeled and actual water use for proper water accounting. We present a hybrid single-source energy balance (HSEB) model that calculates evapotranspiration at the field-scale based on the synergistic use of Sentinel-2, Landsat, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) MODIS land surface temperature products. The model operates in Google Earth Engine as a time series using global atmospheric variables and 100-m Copernicus Land cover data. Evaluation of HSEB for calculating evaporation over 29 flux tower sites within an extensive range of climatic conditions and biomes over the US, Europe and Australia for 2018-2020 shows that the model significantly improves the temporal and spatial components of ET mapping. Overall, HSEB performed well in all considered biome types and climatic conditions (r = 0.81, 0.74, and 0.8, a Nash-Sutcliff efficiency of 0.6, 0.74, 0.8, and a bias of 4%, 1%, and - 0.9% at the daily, weekly, and monthly scales, respectively). Root Mean Square Error averaged at 1.31 mm/day. Comparison of instantaneous latent heat fluxes of the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) against tower data shows that HSEB produces acceptable results, although ECOSTRESS had a slightly lower bias (3.8% for HSEB vs. -0.8% for ECOSTRESS). HSEB performed better over croplands. We also discuss comparisons of sharpened LST from VIIRS VNP02, VNP21, MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-3, and LST from ECOSTRESS versus ground LST measurements, and briefly discuss the sensitivity of HSEB to the thermal data used. Both ECOSTRESS and Landsat showed better performance at different LST ranges and time of day when compared to LST observation collected over a small potato field in Lebanon. The analysis of impact of LST product used in HSEB on ET results at US-ARM site showed that HSEB with MODIS LST outperforms HSEB ET from VNP02 (an overestimate) and VNP21 (an underestimate). We conclude that HSEB can be used as an operational global model for monitoring evaporative stress and evaporation at the small-agriculture field level with higher temporal and spatial resolution utilizing the wide suite of available satellite data.

TI  - Application of transfer learning of deep CNN model for classification of time-series satellite images to assess the long-term impacts of coal mining activities on land-use patterns
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to analyse the long-term impacts of mining activities in Jharia coalfield (JCF) on land-use (LU) patterns using transfer learning of the deep convolutional neural network (Deep CNN) model. A new database was prepared by extracting 10,000 image samples of 6 x 6 size for five LU types (barren land, built-up area, coal mining region, vegetation and waterbody) from Landsat data to train and validate the model. The satellite data from 1987 to 2021 at an interval of two years was used for change analysis. The study results revealed that the model offers 95 and 88% accuracy on the training and the validation dataset. The results indicate that barren land, coal mining region, and waterbody have been decreased from 237.30 sq. km. (=39.88%) to 171.25 sq. km (=28.78%), 118.77 sq. km. (=19.96%) to 68.73 sq. km (=11.55%), and 35.58 sq. km (=5.98%) to 18.68 sq. km (=3.14%) during 1987-2021, respectively. On the other hand, the built-up area and vegetation have been increased from 120.14 sq. km (=20.19%) to 233.02 sq. km (=39.16%) and 83.19 sq. km (=13.98%) to 103.36 sq. km (=17.37%) during 1987-2021. The time-series correlation results indicate that coal mining is the most sensitive LU type from 1987 to 2021, whereas barren land is least sensitive up to 2011, and thereafter vegetation is the least sensitive.

TI  - Surgical Management of Gastric Cancer A Review
T2  - JAMA SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Importance Surgery plays a critical role in the management of all stages of gastric cancer.Observations For patients with early gastric cancer and low risk of lymph node metastasis, endoscopic therapy or surgery alone is potentially curative. Novel techniques, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy, may allow for greater use of stomach-sparing procedures that could improve quality of life without compromising oncologic outcomes; however, experience with these techniques is rare outside of East Asia, and studies of long-term outcomes are still ongoing. Patients with later-stage localized gastric cancer benefit from more extensive lymphadenectomy and multimodality therapy, as they are at risk for nodal and distant metastases. There have been recent advances in chemotherapy that have led to improved survival, but the optimal sequencing of multimodality therapy is still being investigated. Better systemic therapy may also increase the role of surgery for patients with oligometastatic disease. There are ongoing studies examining the efficacy of peritoneal-directed therapies in both patients with low-volume peritoneal disease and patients at high risk of peritoneal recurrence.Conclusions and Relevance The management of gastric cancer continues to evolve. Surgeons should be aware of novel surgical approaches currently under investigation as well as how surgery fits into the contemporary multidisciplinary approach to this disease.

TI  - Clinical Study of Sentinel Lymph Node Detection to Evaluate Pelvic Lymph Node Metastasis to Determine the Prognosis of Patients with Early Cervical Cancer
T2  - APPLIED BIONICS AND BIOMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Lymph node status is one of the most important prognostic factors for uterine cervical cancer. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has emerged as a potential alternative to systematic lymphadenectomy for the lymph node mapping in such patients. However, the SLN metastasis detection via SLN biopsy in early-stage cervical cancer remains controversial. The current study is aimed at investigating the feasibility and accuracy of combined tracer method for localization of SLN in initial stages of cervical cancer and to evaluate the clinical value of SLN biopsy in replacing pelvic lymph node resection. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed 348 cases who were admitted to the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Shandong Provincial Cancer Hospital, China, between February 2003 and June 2018 with FIGO stage IA2 to IIA2 cervical cancer and undergone through SLN biopsy. Methylthioninium chloride was injected in combination with (99m)-technetium-labeled sulfur colloid prior to surgery to these patients. SLNs were identified intraoperatively, excised, and subsequently submitted to fast frozen section. The detection rates, accuracy, sensitivity, coincidence rate, false negative rate, and negative predictive values of these cases were estimated, and the follow-up outcomes were carefully observed. Chi squared test or Fisher's exact test was employed for a comparison of the categorical variables. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used for estimation of relationships between overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) and prognostic factors. Results. The total detection rate of SLN was 97.1% (338/348), and identification of bilateral SLN was successful in 237 patients (70.1%). The patient's tumor size, FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis, and depth of invasion had statistically significant differences in SLN detection rates. The detection rate had inverse relation with tumors size (>4 cm), invasive depth > 2/3, lymph node positive, late staging, and preoperative radiotherapy. 117 positive SLNs were detected in 73 patients. The negative predictive value, sensitivity, false negative rate, and coincidence rate and were 97.7%, 92.4%, 7.6%, and 95.4%, respectively. In patients whose tumor size were <= 4 cm, the false negative rate was 4.55% (2/44), whereas it was 0 in patients with tumor size <= 2 cm. The respective 1, 3, and 5-year OS was 100%, 94.8%, and 91.8%, respectively, whereas DFS rate for 1, 3, and 5 years was 96.7%, 92%, and 89.6%, respectively. The lymph node was positive, tumor size, the depth of invasion, and staging were statistically different from the recurrence rate and survival rate of patients (p < 0.05). When tumor metastasis exceeded SLN, the recurrence rate was significantly increased, and survival rate is significantly reduced (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.05, respectively). Conclusions. The identification of SLN combined with (99m)-technetium-labeled sulfur colloid and methylthioninium chloride has a good accuracy and is safe for the assessment of the status of pelvic nodes in patients with initial stage cervical cancer. Nuclide as a tracer has low dependence on objective conditions and doctors' technology and has a good detection rate. In our study, we believe that SLN biopsy is feasible when the tumor is <= 4 cm. Large scale clinical trials are required in China expand the sample size and validate the results of this study.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Variation in Response to Land-Use and Land-Cover Dynamics: A Case of Didessa River Sub-basin in Western Ethiopia
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) estimation at the River sub-basin level is crucial for developing land-use planning at basin scale and beyond. The present study aims to analyze the LST variations in response to land-use and land-cover (LULC) dynamics in the case of Didessa River Sub-basin, Western Ethiopia using geospatial techniques. We used Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (1991), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (2003), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS, 2020). Moreover, meteorological data (1991-2020) of seven stations, namely, Sire, Nekemte, Arjo, Limu Genet, Atnago, Agaro, and Yayu, were obtained from National Meteorological Agency to validate the LST with air temperature. Our results reveal that the cultivated land in the study area increased by 1180 km(2) (22.5%), while grassland and forest cover were declined by 828.7 km(2) (15.8%) and 444.1 km(2) (8.5%), respectively over the past 29 years. These land-cover dynamics contributes for the increasing trend of LST in the study area. The study also analyzed relationship of LST with normalized differences in vegetation index and air temperature. Maximum-likelihood classification methods were used for LULC classification, while the LST data were retrieved from Landsat image. The results indicate that the LST has been increasing since 1991 in reaction to LULC dynamics. Within the sub-basin, high LST values were recorded on bare land and settlement land use followed by cultivated land cover, while forest and water body experienced the lowest LST. This study will contribute in understanding of impact of LULC dynamics on the local climate and would further provide assistance to the policy makers in regard to land-use planning and climate change mitigation strategies.

TI  - Changes and distribution of gas-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and organochlorine compounds in a high-mountain gradient over a three-year period (Pyrenees, 2017-2020)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric gas-phase concentrations of several polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and pentachlorobenzene (PeCB) were measured in six high-mountain sites in the Pyrenees (1619-2453 m). Polyurethane foam passive air samplers were used for this purpose, providing continuous records spanning over three years (2017-2020). The mean concentrations of n-ary sumation PCBs, HCB, and PeCB, 13 +/- 4 pg m-3, 44 +/- 18 pg m-3, and 23 +/- 20 pg m-3, respectively, were of the order of those reported in other mountain sites and similar to those measured 20 years ago in the same area, evidencing the persistence of these compounds despite the international regulatory actions. The mean concentration of n-ary sumation PAHs was 631 +/- 238 pg m-3, representing between two- and three-times lower values than 20 years ago in the same area, but still in the range of other mountain regions. Statistically significant increases in gas-phase concentrations at higher temperatures were observed for most compounds. The experimental phase-change pseudo-enthalpies calculated from the slopes of the regressions between the natural logarithm of the concentrations and the reciprocal of temperature were lower than the reference values for nearly all compounds. This difference suggested a main contribution of long-range atmospheric transport of the gasphase PAH and organochlorine concentrations in this mountain area. However, the less volatile compounds such as benz[a]anthracene, PCB138, and PCB180 showed a closer similarity between experimental and laboratory enthalpies, indicating that a significant portion of the variations in concentration of these compounds originated from temperature-dependent diffusive exchange by re-volatilization from local surfaces. The concentrations found in these sentinel ecosystems demonstrate that long-range transport of organic pollutants remains a risk in remote continental environments.

TI  - An observational analysis of two companion supercell storms over complex terrain
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyses two long-lived supercell thunderstorms formed on 11th May 2017 afternoon in a complex topographic area in northern Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula). The objectives of this paper are (i) to document a case study that affected a mountainous region in the southern side of the Pyrenees, (ii) to describe thermodynamic and dynamic environmental conditions, (iii) to study how the topography affects the life cycle of both storm cells and (iv) to demonstrate the high correlation between Lightning Jump and radar parameters in complex terrain. ERA5 reanalysis was used to assess the synoptic framework and environmental storm conditions, whereas remote-sensing data (Doppler radar, satellite and lightning observations) and terrain characteristics were considered to study the evolution of both cells. Reanalysis data revealed some differences between preconvective environments for both thunderstorms, showing more favourable conditions for supporting supercells (i.e. stronger deep-layer shear) for the first thunderstorm than for the second one. The analysis suggests substantial interaction between topography and storm cells, influencing their internal dynamics and the development of mesocyclones. The results of this study contribute to enhance our understanding of supercell storms evolution on mountain areas and may be useful to increase the situational awareness of weather forecasters in future similar convective storm events over complex terrain regions.

TI  - Digital surface model generation from high-resolution satellite stereo imagery based on structural similarity
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we proposed an automatic approach to extract DSMs from VHR satellite imagery. This study aims to apply the histogram of orientated phase congruency (HOPC) descriptor and SIFT-Flow algorithm to match multi-view VHR satellite images densely and extract detailed DSMs competitive with ones generated from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The HOPC descriptor relies on detecting features by calculating the phase congruency model, which allows the image features to be highly robust against illumination changes. Moreover, we developed an automatic algorithm to extract precise and homogenously distributed tie-points and subsequently conduct bias correction of the Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPC). We tested our proposed algorithm on four WorldViw-3 datasets captured from different viewpoints, and compared the results with the DSMs obtained by the Semi-Global Matching (SGM) algorithm. The experimental results indicated the proficiency of our proposed method in generating accurate and reliable DSMs using VHR satellite data.

TI  - Chamoli flash-flood mapping and evaluation with a supervised classifier and NDWI thresholding using Sentinel-2 optical data in Google earth engine
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural disaster in the form of flash-flood struck Chamoli district on February 7 2021 through the Rishiganga and Dhauliganga river valley. The event was majorly caused due to the massive rockslide containing snow, ice and rock, that detached from Mrigu Dhani peak near Ronti glacier. This event substantially damaged the Hydropower project in the Rishiganga and Tapovan Vishnugad, resulting in the deaths of over 200 people. In this regard, rapid flood mapping becomes crucial in evaluating hazard. Integrating Google's cloud-based platform algorithm with high resolution satellite imageries could prove efficient in rapidly monitoring the event. In this paper, an attempt has been made to classify the Sentinel-2 imageries for both pre-flood and post-flood period to map the flood extent using random forest supervised classification in the google earth engine. About a 30 km river stretch, with a buffer of 200 m, from the origin at Ronti Gad to Vishnuprayag was taken for the analysis. The region was classified into six different classes, namely, forest, water, built-up, barren land, snow, and shadow. The pre-flood and post-flood change were analyzed to estimate the net flooded area. The results are validated with the very high-resolution Digital Globe imageries and compared with the flood extent estimated from manual histogram thresholding of Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) of Sentinel-2 datasets after masking out for slope more than 20 degrees. The overall flooded area is estimated as 0.66 sq. km. The method proved reliable and was validated with an overall accuracy of 88% and a F-score of 0.85 and could be used for flood mapping during similar incidents in the future.

TI  - An empirical approach for deriving specific inland water quality parameters from high spatio-spectral resolution image
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland lake of Vembanad has benefited from continuous monitoring to evaluate water quality which has declined due to increased anthropogenic activities and climate change. Remote sensing techniques can be used to estimate and monitor inland water quality both spatially and temporally. An empirical model is presented in Vemaband lake that retrieves the specific water quality parameters through correlations between various spectral wavelengths of Sentinel-2MSI (S2MSI) with field-measured water quality parameters. This approach includes the combinations of various bands, band ratios, and band arithmetic computation of satellite sensors of spectral datasets. The specific inland water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a (chl-a), total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, and secchi disc depth (SDD) were retrieved from the developed water quality model through Sentinel-2A remote sensing reflectance. The result illustrates that Specific Inland Water Quality Parameters (SIWQP) strongly correlated with S2MSI reflection spectral wavelengths. The SIWQP models are constructed for TSS (R-2 = 0.8008), Chl-a (R-2 = 0.8055), Turbidity (R-2 = 0.6329) and SDD (R-2 = 0.7174).The spatial distribution of SIWQPs in Vembanad lake for March 2018 is mapped and shows the lake's water quality distribution. The research from Sentinel-2, MSI has potential and is appropriate in high spectral and spatial characteristics for retrieving and continuous monitoring of water quality parameters in the regional scale of inland water bodies.

TI  - Mortality management and climate action: A review and reference for using Terror Management Theory methods in interdisciplinary environmental research
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Review
AB  - Global climate change awareness is increasing, but efforts to convey information can trigger undesirable behaviors, including denial, skepticism, and increased resource consumption. It is therefore essential to more fully investigate social-psychological responses to climate information and messaging if we are to prompt, support, and sustain pro-environmental behaviors. Yet consideration of these responses is typically absent from interdisciplinary environmental study designs. Of specific relevance is research using social psychology's Terror Management Theory (TMT) showing that people's efforts to repress mortality salience (MS) or awareness significantly influence their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Research on MS's influence on climate change beliefs is progressing but, to date, a systematic scoping review of the literature has been unavailable. Here, we provide such a review. We propose that TMT insights and methods should be better integrated into research designs to guide climate communications and to generate the comprehensive cultural and behavioral changes needed to address societies' climate problems. We introduce a methodological framework for interdisciplinary researchers to incorporate TMT into their research designs and to help practitioners anticipate how their mortality-laden messaging could trigger unintentional social-psychological responses that degrade climate communication strategies.

TI  - Temporal and spatial distribution mapping of particulate matter in southwest of Iran using remote sensing, GIS, and statistical techniques
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Major items concerning air and weather researches include the amount of aerosols and particulate matter (PM) present in the air. Satellite-retrieved, aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a widely used method for the mapping of particulate matter (PM10) concentrations. Precise estimate and mapping of PM10 depend on the resolution of AOD data and the mathematical model, which considers the spatially non-stationary relationship between PM10 and AOD. Khuzestan province of Iran is deficient in a powerful and validated resolved model of PM10 with high spatial temporal resolution. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate and monitor the concentration of PM10 in 26 air quality monitoring stations along with meteorological data obtained from 21 synoptic stations, aerosol optical depth (AOD) extracted MODIS Terra/Aqua, and their relationship which were analyzed using GIS services, statistical models, and remote sensing throughout Khuzestan province of Iran from January 2008 to December 2018. This research verified the MCD19A2 AOD product and then proved that MCD19A2 could accurately indicate the aerosol distribution in the Khuzestan province of Iran. Analysis of average annual MCD19A2 AOD data revealed 2008 and 2009 as the most polluted years in Khuzestan province during 11 years (2008-2018) of study. The study of dust trends showed a significant increase in spring and summer in the study area. The results of this study indicated that PM10 is influenced by AOD and meteorological parameters. Meteorological data together with simplified aerosol retrieval algorithm-retrieved AOD at 1-km resolution were applied as the predictors for the linear regression (LR), multiple linear regression (MLR), the ordinary least squares (OLS), and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models to predict the spatial distribution of PM10 concentrations. Among all the statistical models, the GWR performed better and had higher accuracy. Also, the investigation of indicators such as root mean squared errors (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Akaike's information criterion (AICc), adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2), normal (Z) scores, and Moran's I of the model residuals, to evaluate the accuracy of the studied models, showed high accuracy and excellent performance of the GWR model in predicting the amount of particulate matter in the study area. These results suggested that the GWR model could provide a reliable way to predict the spatial distribution of PM10 concentrations over Khuzestan province. Assessment of short- and long-term human exposures and then investigation of the effects of particulate matter will be possible through our model.

TI  - Analysis and experimental investigation of Apollo sample 12032,366-18, a chemically evolved basalt from the Moon
T2  - METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sample 12032,366-18 is a 41.2 mg basaltic rock fragment collected during the Apollo 12 mission to the Moon. It is enriched in incompatible trace elements (e.g., 7 ppm Th), but does not have a bulk composition that would be considered a KREEP (enriched in potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorous) basalt. The sample is of particular interest because it may be representative of some of the mare basalts within Oceanus Procellarum that are inferred to be Th-rich, based on remote sensing data. The major mineral assemblage of 12032,366-18 is pyroxene, plagioclase, olivine, and ilmenite, and the bulk composition has 4.2 wt% TiO2, 11.7 wt% Al2O3, and 0.25 wt% K2O. The sample contains regions of late-stage crystallized minerals and glass (collectively termed mesostasis), including K-feldspar, apatite, rare earth (RE) merrillite, ilmenite, troilite, silica, and relatively sodic plagioclase adjacent to ferroan pyroxene. The mesostasis also occurs in several areas that are highly enriched in silica and intergrown with K-feldspar and very fine-grained, high-mean-atomic-number phases. We explore the petrology of this sample, including the origin of the Si-K-rich mesostasis to assess whether the mesostasis had formed by silicate liquid immiscibility (SLI). We used experiments to determine if the bulk composition of 12032,366-18 is representative of a bulk liquid composition, how the residual liquid evolves, and to investigate the partitioning of elements between phases as the melt evolves. Experiments support that the mesostasis formed by SLI after crystallization of minerals closely matches the major-mineral assemblage of 12032,366-18. Experiments bracket the onset of SLI and merrillite saturation between 1024 and 1002 degrees C. Some high field strength elements, such as Zr and P, partition preferentially into the Fe-rich liquid. From the experiments, we infer that the bulk composition of 12032,366-18 represents the magma from which it crystallized. Based on the Th-rich and KREEP-bearing chemistry of this sample, along with experimental evidence showing that the sample is representative of a bulk liquid composition and not a cumulate, we conclude that basalt fragment 12032,366-18 was delivered to the Apollo 12 landing site as ejecta from a distant impact and could represent an Oceanus Procellarum basalt. Missions to Oceanus Procellarum, such as Chang'E 5, have the potential to confirm whether some of those basalts are indeed enriched in Th and other incompatible trace elements as indicated by remote sensing.

TI  - An object-based sparse representation model for spatiotemporal image fusion
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many algorithms have been proposed for spatiotemporal image fusion on simulated data, yet only a few deal with spectral changes in real satellite images. An innovative spatiotemporal sparse representation (STSR) image fusion approach is introduced in this study to generate global dense high spatial and temporal resolution images from real satellite images. It aimed to minimize the data gap, especially when fine spatial resolution images are unavailable for a specific period. The proposed approach uses a set of real coarse- and fine-spatial resolution satellite images acquired simultaneously and another coarse image acquired at a different time to predict the corresponding unknown fine image. During the fusion process, pixels located between object classes with different spectral responses are more vulnerable to spectral distortion. Therefore, firstly, a rule-based fuzzy classification algorithm is used in STSR to classify input data and extract accurate edge candidates. Then, an object-based estimation of physical constraints and brightness shift between input data is utilized to construct the proposed sparse representation (SR) model that can deal with real input satellite images. Initial rules to adjust spatial covariance and equalize spectral response of object classes between input images are introduced as prior information to the model, followed by an optimization step to improve the STSR approach. The proposed method is applied to real fine Sentinel-2 and coarse Landsat-8 satellite data. The results showed that introducing objects in the fusion process improved spatial detail, especially over the edge candidates, and eliminated spectral distortion by preserving the spectral continuity of extracted objects. Experiments revealed the promising performance of the proposed object-based STSR image fusion approach based on its quantitative results, where it preserved almost 96.9% and 93.8% of the spectral detail over the smooth and urban areas, respectively.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Early detection of melanoma is instrumental as the 5-year survival decreases from 93.3% to 1-3 Distinguishing which patients require closer follow-up can be difficult for melanoma patients. Developments by Castle Biosciences' (Friendswood, TX) DecisionDx-Melanoma (DDx-M) use 31 melanoma associated genes to stratify melanomas into 4 classes with 1A having lowest risk of morbidity and mortality and 2B the highest. (5) We assessed the benefit of providing additional (18)FDG-PET-CT and brain MRI to genetically high-risk patients who may have otherwise been overlooked.Methods 297 patients at our institution had biopsies sent for DDx-M between 2014 and 2021. Patients found to have Class 2 melanomas received additional screening with yearly (18)FDG-PET-CT scans and brain MRIs. Patients with Class 2 DDx-M scores and negative SLNB were included in the study. 66 met inclusion criteria and received imaging.Results Within 3 years of follow-up, 8/66 (12.1%) patients had metastases detected by (18)FDG-PET-CT scans. No patients with stage IA or IB went on to develop metastases.Discussion (18)FDG-PET-CT scans detect metastases in < 3% of the time when all stage I and II patients are scanned; however, by using DDx-M in our screening protocols, we achieved a detection rate of 12.1%.(6,7) These patients went on to receive treatment and would have otherwise progressed undetected, leading to higher morbidity and mortality.Conclusion We suggest all patients with initial stage II or above melanomas receive a DDx-M score and those with class 2 receive yearly (18)FDG-PET-CT/brain MRI imaging.

TI  - The dynamics of vegetation and implications for ecosystem services in the context of urbanisation: An example from Huangyan-Taizhou, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl and associated land use changes have been referred as primary drivers of environmental change. Yet it is unclear in detail how land use changes impact vegetative structures or ecosystem services and what the specific drivers of change are, especially in urban-rural interfaces in medium-sized Chinese cities. Our future contribution is intended to highlight the importance of urban-rural interfaces for sustainable land use and the development of ecosystem services. To this end, we mapped the dynamics of land cover and the condition of vegetation as well as ecosystem services based on remote sensing data for the period of 1992-2020, to quantify these changes in Huangyan district, Taizhou, China. The results show a dramatic increase in urban area over the 28-year timeframe, i.e. 265% growth in Huangyan district. This rise was particularly evident in the period of 2015-2020. The huge expansion in urban area came at the cost of arable land. To compensate the resulting loss of farmland, large-scale natural ecosystems such as forests, grasslands and wetlands were continuously transformed into arable (as well as urbanized) land. Despite the dramatic reduction in green space as a result of urbanisation, we found a slight increase in the overall mean NDVI value for Huangyan, mainly due to the improved condition and density of remaining forest area in the western countryside. Further, we evaluated the provision of ecosystem services (ESS) by adapting an existing assessment methodology elaborated by Burkhard et al. (2012). The results show that ESS supply continually fell in Huangyan since 1992, reflecting a reduction of green space. The highest ecosystem capacity is seen in recreation and biodiversity due to the large proportion of forested area. Our findings serve as an important basis for further investigations in the region of Huangyan by framing the general issue of green space dynamics and highlighting specific developments of ecosystem distribution and change as well as ESS supply.

TI  - Variations in lake water storage over Inner Mongolia during recent three decades based on multi-mission satellites
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake shrinkage is a frequent water resource problem in arid and semi-arid regions that can affect the hydrological cycle and damage the local aquatic environment. Since the 1990 s, many lakes in Inner Mongolia have shrunk significantly. However, the causes of the shrinkage and long-term storage trends of lakes in Inner Mongolia are still poorly understood. Using observations from multi-mission satellites, we analyzed water storage changes in six major lakes in Inner Mongolia over the past 30 years and explored the underlying causes. The results reveal divergent changes between the two lake categories. For each of the tectonic lakes (including Lake Hulun, Lake Dalinuoer, Lake Daihai, and Lake Hongjiannao), the water storage has continuously decreased with annual rates of 0.067 km(3)/yr, 0.012 km(3)/yr, 0.021 km(3)/yr, and 0.01 km(3)/yr, respectively. In contrast, for oxbow lakes (including Lake Hasuhai and Lake Wuliangsuhai), the storage trends were insignificant (0.001 km3/yr for both). Human activities were the most significant driving factors, especially coal mining, agricultural irrigation, and grazing, which explained more than 70% of the storage changes in Lake Hulun, Lake Dalinuoer, and Lake Hasuhai. Among the natural factors, evapotranspiration and runoff were secondary influences on these lake storage changes. This study provides a systematic analysis and attribution of water storage changes for major lakes in Inner Mongolia and provides scientific guidance for local water resource management and planning. Our method provides a useful example of using multi-mission satellite data for estimating water storage changes.

M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated automated application for Water Resources and Agriculture Spatial Indicators System (WRASIS) using remote sensing Data was developed to monitor and assess different developments projects in agriculture field. This system is based on the analysis of remotely sensed time series data of (Agriculture Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectra-radiometer MODIS NDVI - Rain-Fall Estimate RFE 2.0). Three agriculture projects located in Sudan; White Nile sub-basin "Assalaya Project (AAP)", Wadi Halfa (WHAP) at Atbara Basin, and Ginude agriculture project at Blue Nile sub-basin are taken for pilot study using this newly developed system which is includes GIS-based procedures for computing water and agriculture spatial indicators. The data used is derived from satellite images product at different spatial and temporal resolution. These products were extracted automatically and stored with their analyses and results in special database, which could be used with easily manner to obtain and compute indicators and perform statistical data analyses. WRASIS has specific tools to analyze and display data in a tabular form, classify maps and display statistical charts as well. WRASIS runs in three main phases; data-base preparation, model calculation (data analysis), and finally system tools and outputs. The outputs are either basic indicators (one indicator for one-time step) or advanced indicators. Many satellite images with diverse products and resolutions could be added to the system in data preparing phase for other applications at any area. In the present study and from monitoring and assessments of the three agriculture projects, the effect of supplementary irrigation is clear.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Arsenic speciation analysis in honey bees for environmental monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arsenic can be toxic to living organisms, depending not only on the concentration, but also its chemical form. The aim of this study was to determine arsenic concentrations and perform arsenic speciation analysis for the first time in honeybees, to evaluate their potential as biomonitors. Highest arsenic concentrations were determined in the vicinity of coal fired thermal power plants (367 mu g kg(-1)), followed by an urban region (213 mu g kg(-1)), with much lower concentrations in an industrial city (28.8 mu g kg(-1)) and rural areas (41 mu g kg(-1)). Until now, honey bees have never been used to study different arsenic species in the environment. For this reason, four extraction procedures were tested: water, hot water at 90 degrees C, 20% methanol, and 1% formic acid. Water at 90 degrees C was able to extract more than 90% of the total arsenic from honey bee samples. Inorganic arsenic (the sum of arsenite and arsenate) accounted for 95% of arsenic species in bees from three locations, except the industrial city, where it represented only 80% of arsenic species, while 15% was present as DMA.

TI  - A novel framework to assess all-round performances of spatiotemporal fusion models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal data fusion, as a feasible and low-cost solution for producing time-series satellite images with both high spatial and temporal resolution, has undergone rapid development over the past two decades with more than one hundred spatiotemporal fusion methods developed. Accuracy assessment of fused images is crucial for users to select appropriate methods for real-world applications. However, commonly used assessment metrics do not comprehensively cover multiple aspects of spatiotemporal fused image quality, contain redundant information, and are not comparable across different study areas. To address these problems, this study proposed a novel framework to assess all-round performances of spatiotemporal fusion methods. Four accuracy metrics, including RMSE, AD, Edge, and local binary patterns (LBP), were selected as the optimal set of assessment metrics according to the assessment criteria. These metrics not only quantify the spectral and spatial information in the fused images but also greatly alleviate information redundancy and feature computational simplicity. Furthermore, inspired by Taylor diagrams, we designed an all-round performance assessment (APA) diagram to provide a visual tool for a comprehensive assessment of the performance of spatiotemporal fusion methods, supporting cross-comparison of different spatiotemporal fusion methods by considering the effects of input data and land surface characteristics. The case study in three typical sites demonstrated that the proposed framework can better differentiate the performances of six spatiotemporal fusion methods. This new framework can promote the cross-comparison of different spatiotemporal fusion methods and guide users to select suitable methods for real-world applications, as well as facilitate the establishment of a standard accuracy assessment procedure for spatiotemporal fusion methods.

TI  - BACK-AND-FORTH NUDGING FOR THE QUASI-GEOSTROPHIC OCEAN DYNAMICS WITH ALTIMETRY: THEORETICAL CONVERGENCE STUDY AND NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS WITH THE FUTURE SWOT OBSERVATIONS
T2  - DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS-SERIES S
M3  - Article
AB  - In data assimilation for geophysical problems, the increasing amount of satellite data to analyze makes it more and more challenging to guarantee near real time forecasting. Thus, low time and memory consuming data assimilation methods become very attractive. The back-and-forth nudging (BFN) method is a non-classical data assimilation method that can be seen as a deterministic and smoothing version of the Kalman filter. From a practical point of view, the BFN method is very valuable for its simplicity of implementation (no optimization, no differentiation,...) and its rapidity of convergence. Under observability conditions, we prove the mathematical convergence of BFN at deep layers for a multi-layer quasi-geostrophic (MQG) ocean circulation model using an infinite dimensional variant of LaSalle's invariance principle. We also extend the BFN to the problem of joint state-parameter identification. The numerical experiments, performed on 120km large swath sea surface height (SSH) simulated data of the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite, show the high robustness of the algorithm to uncertainties and the few iterations needed to reach convergence, whereas some problems remain due to non-reversibility properties in time. We also give a strategy to improve geophysical model accuracy, considering the large number of uncertain parameters inherent to models and their impacts on state estimation performance. We propose here a joint state-parameter estimation, tested on the baroclinic wavenumber as an unobserved parameter.

TI  - Surrogate models of radiative transfer codes for atmospheric trace gas retrievals from satellite observations
T2  - MACHINE LEARNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inversion of radiative transfer models (RTMs) is key to interpreting satellite observations of air quality and greenhouse gases, but is computationally expensive. Surrogate models that emulate the full forward physical RTM can speed up the simulation, reducing computational and timing costs and allowing the use of more advanced physics for trace gas retrievals. In this study, we present the development of surrogate models for two RTMs: the RemoTeC algorithm using the LINTRAN RTM and the SCIATRAN RTM. We estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of the input and output spaces and embed them in lower dimensional subspaces to facilitate the learning task. Two methods are tested for dimensionality reduction, autoencoders and principle component analysis (PCA), with PCA consistently outperforming autoencoders. Different sampling methods are employed for generating the training datasets: sampling focused on expected atmospheric parameters and latin hypercube sampling. The results show that models trained on the smaller (n = 1000) uniformly sampled dataset can perform as well as those trained on the larger (n = 50000), more focused dataset. Surrogate models for both datasets are able to accurately emulate Sentinel 5P spectra within a millisecond or less, as compared to the minutes or hours needed to simulate the full physical model. The SCIATRAN-trained forward surrogate models are able to generalize the emulation to a broader set of parameters and can be used for less constrained applications, while achieving a normalized RMSE of 7.3%. On the other hand, models trained on the LINTRAN dataset can completely replace the RTM simulation in more focused expected ranges of atmospheric parameters, as they achieve a normalized RMSE of 0.3%.

TI  - Coastal erosion trend analysis using a combination of remote sensing and hydrodynamic models: Case study of Ca Mau Cape, Mekong Delta
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Coastal erosion and the loss of protective forest areas have recently become serious problems in the Ca Mau Cape (CMC) area of the Mekong Delta. Specifically, in 2016-2020, the rate of erosion in some subsections of the east coast reached 25-37 m/year and the forest area decreased significantly.& nbsp;Objectives: To analyse erosion and accretion trends in the period 2016-2020 and to determine the mechanism underlying erosion in the CMC using a hydrodynamic model focused on tides, currents, waves, and sediment transport.& nbsp;Methods: Satellite images (Google Earth), remote sensing images (Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS C1 Level-1), and a combination of hydrodynamic modules were used to evaluate the combined effects of tides, currents, waves, and sediment transport on erosion.& nbsp;Results: Remote sensing image analyses revealed that the east coast has a very high rate of erosion, with the highest erosion rates of 35 m/year in both 2016-2018 and 2019-2020, while the west coast showed an accretion trend in 2016-2018, followed by strong erosion in 2019-2020, with a rate of 10 m/year. Hydrodynamic models showed that hydrodynamic factors, such as tides, currents, waves, and a low suspended sediment concentration (SSC), directly contribute to the erosion trend in the area. The differences in water level between the high tide and low tide on the east coast, reaching 2 m (dry season) and 0.8 m (wet season), were consistently two times higher than those on the west coast, i.e. 0.9 m (dry season) and 0.4 m (wet season). The flow rates on the east coast (i.e. 0.4-0.6 m/s, on average) were significantly higher those on the west coast (0.2 m/s, on average). Wave heights on the east coast, reaching 1.5-2 m in the dry season and 0.6-1 m in the wet season, were consistently higher than those on the west coast, reaching 1-1.2 m (dry season) and 0.4-0.6 m (wet season). In addition, the SSC was lowest under strong erosion, with average concentrations of 0.04-0.06 kg/m(3) in the wet season and 0.02-0.04 kg/m(3) in the dry season. The SSC was highest in the sections showing accretion trends, with concentrations of > 0.3 kg/m(3) in the wet season and 0.08-0.1 kg/m(3) in the dry season.& nbsp;Conclusion: Evaluating shoreline changes using remote sensing technology and validating these results using hydrodynamic models provides a better understanding of the mechanism underlying & nbsp;coastal erosion and its development and provides a basis for the development of a coastal protection strategy.

TI  - Contribution of urban functional zones to the spatial distribution of urban thermal environment
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the accelerated rate of urbanization, reasonable identification of urban functional zones has been increasingly important to urban development. In this study, we used OpenStreetMap and point of interest data combined with the classification standard of urban construction land, to identify the urban functional zones. In addition, Landsat 8 remote sensing images were utilized to retrieve land surface temperature, and the random forest algorithm was used to evaluate the contribution of different types of urban functional zones to the urban thermal environment. The results showed that the land surface temperature along Hunhe River in the central area of Shenyang gradually decreased. The temperature was high in the center of the experimental area and low in the north and south. Furthermore, in the main city zone of Shenyang, single functional zones accounted for 65.71% of the total study area, whereas mixed functional zones accounted for 34.29%. Among the various types of urban land, public service facility land contributed the most to the urban thermal environment with an impact of 21.65%, followed by residential, industrial, and commercial service facility lands, with impacts of 19.89%, 18.44%, and 17.58%, respectively. Additionally, the impact of road traffic land was 14.92%, whereas that of green square land was the lowest at 7.51%, 14.14% lower than that of public service facility land.

TI  - Barrier-Based Adaptive Line-of-Sight 3-D Path-Following System for a Multijoint Robotic Fish With Sideslip Compensation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This article proposes a novel barrier-based adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) three-dimensional (3-D) path-following system for an underactuated multijoint robotic fish. The framework of the developed path-following system is established based on a detailed dynamic model, including a barrier-based ALOS guidance strategy, three integrated inner-loop controllers, and a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB)-based sideslip angle compensation, which is employed to preserve a reliable tracking under a frequently varying sideslip angle of the robotic fish. First, a barrier-based convergence strategy is proposed to deal with probable along-track error disruption and suppress the error within a manageable range. Meanwhile, an improved adaptive guidance scheme is adopted with an appropriate look-ahead distance. Afterward, a novel NDOB-based sideslip angle compensation is put forward to identify the varying sideslip angle independent of speed estimation. Subsequently, inner-loop controllers are intended for regulation about the controlled references, including a super-twisting sliding-mode control (STSMC)-based speed controller, a global fast terminal sliding-mode control (GFTSMC)-based heading controller, and a GFTSMC-based depth controller. Finally, simulations and experiments with quantitative comparison in 3-D linear and helical path following are presented to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system. This path-following system provides a solid foundation for future marine autonomous cruising of the underwater multijoint robot.

TI  - The complementary uses of Sentinel-1A SAR and ECOSTRESS datasets to identify vineyard growth and conditions: a case study in Sonoma County, California
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The launch of NASA's ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) and the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1A/B synthetic aperture radar ( SAR) satellites provides the opportunity to advance a multi-sensor remote sensing approach to crop monitoring. While ECOSTRESS and Sentinel-1A/B have been used separately to assess vegetation conditions, a study that quantifies the synergistic usefulness of both to monitor crops has not been performed. This study assesses the complementary uses of Sentinel-1A SAR and ECOSTRESS land surface temperature (LST) and evapotranspiration (ET) datasets to assess vine growth and conditions in blocks located in Sonoma County, California for 2018. Results indicate Sentinel-1A SAR dual-polarization backscatter measurements (sigma(0)(VV) and sigma(0)(VH)) have different sensitivities to vine leafiness and moisture content, based on measured vineyard field data and radiometric modeling. SAR and modeled sigma(0)(VV) backscatter suggest higher sensitivity to surface conditions and trunk and cane moisture, while SAR and modeled sigma(0)(VH) backscatter indicate higher sensitivity to vine leafiness and canopy moisture. ECOSTRESS LST measurements were sharpened to a 30 m resolution using a data mining sharpener and ET measurements were generated with a retrieval algorithm approach for select dates. Spearman's rank correlation and linear regressions analyses between SAR backscatter to ECOSTRESS datasets indicate stronger relationships between sigma(0)(VH) backscatter to LST and ET relative to sigma(0)(VV) backscatter. The results suggest Sentinel-1A SAR sigma(0)(VH) backscatter can provide indications of vine leaf volume and moisture state that can be related to LST and ET measurements, providing useful information for vineyard management.

TI  - Impact of executive compensation on corporate tax aggressiveness: evidence from India
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose There is growing empirical evidence in context of the developed countries that greater tax aggressiveness of companies is associated with higher incentives to their executives. However, the same cannot be extended to emerging economies like India due to their distinct compensation practices. The present study, therefore, aims to bridge this gap by exploring the relationship between executive compensation and corporate tax aggressiveness in context of the Indian economy. Design/methodology/approach The sample comprises a subset of the S&P BSE 500 Index companies for FY 2014-15 through 2018-19. A fixed effects panel model has been used to discern the impact of executive compensation on corporate tax aggressiveness with and without the moderating effect of a proxy for corporate governance strength. Findings The econometric analysis evinces a significant negative impact of the fixed executive compensation on tax aggressiveness, specifically with the moderation of corporate governance strength which was found to have a positive effect on the said relation. In addition, no significant relationship was observed between variable compensation and tax aggressiveness. These results were robust to an alternate specification of the corporate governance strength proxy as well as the system generalised method of moments estimation employed to deal with endogeneity. Originality/value The study provides insights on a poor interest alignment between shareholders and managers in India owing to an insignificant amount of variable pay in the total executive compensation.

TI  - Performance evaluation of coronavirus closure on air quality over central, southern and northern parts of Iraq
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - When the number of confirmed coronavirus disease cases rose in Iraq in the middle of February 2021, the Iraqi government performed a closure approach to constrain mobility and factory operations and enforce social distancing. In this research, the concentrations of air components (PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3)), which represent herein the degree of air quality index, were recorded, drawn and evaluated over central (Baghdad, the capital), northern (Kirkuk Province) and southern (Basra Province) Iraq before and during the closure. The experimental duration of this research was 6 months (from 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021), which included four periods: pre-closure, first closure (total and partial), second closure (total and partial) and third closure (partial). Moreover, the impact of total closure and partial closure on the quality of the atmospheric layer over Iraq was evaluated and assessed by using Sentinel-5P satellite/Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument and Giovanni-Earthdata images. The results revealed that air pollutant concentrations dropped during the closure periods except at the end of the third closure period due to the lack of people's commitment by breaking the closure strategy based on economic reasons. It was observed that the lockdown is one of the best solutions to defeat the coronavirus pandemic and that it significantly improved the air quality index, although it has several disadvantageous effects on the economic front of the country. Eventually, since people stay at their residences, the concentration of air pollutants becomes low and the air quality index becomes better.

TI  - The driving factors of grassland water use efficiency along degradation gradients on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) is an important parameter of carbon-water coupling, which connects the carbon cycle and water cycle. It is crucial to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of WUE in degraded grassland and its influencing factors for predicting land surf-atmosphere interactions and the dynamic changes of terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, combining the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET), this study investigated the spatial and temporal variation of grassland degradation and WUE from 2001 to 2020 on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau (QTP) by Theil-Sen trend method and Mann-Kendall test, and identified the sensitivity response of grassland WUE to degradation, temperature, wind speed and precipitation within different degradation gradients by ridge regression analysis and generalized linear model. The results showed that (1) the WUE gradually decreases from southeast to northwest, and the interannual variation showed an increasing trend. The grassland degradation on the QTP gradually increases from southeast to northwest, and the grievous severe degradation (GSD) and severely degradation (SD) grassland accounted for 61.59% of the total grassland area. (2) The sensitivity of grassland WUE to temperature (gamma(TEM)) and precipitation (gamma(PRE)) were generally negative in the whole region, the opposite results were found in wind speed and degradation. (3) Temperature was the main factor affecting WUE in degraded grassland, and the growth trend of WUE becomes faster with the increase of the degree of degradation.

TI  - The revised method for retrieving daytime distributions of atomic oxygen and odd-hydrogens in the mesopause region from satellite observations
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atomic oxygen (O) and atomic hydrogen (H) in the mesopause region are critical species, governing chemistry, airglow, and energy budget. However, they cannot be directly measured by satellite remote sensing techniques and so inference techniques, by airglow observations, are used. In this work, we retrieved daytime O and H distributions at similar to 77 km-100 km from the data of observations by the SABER (Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry) instrument at the TIMED (Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics) satellite in 2003-2015. The retrieval approach considered the reaction H + O-3 -> O-2 + OH in the ozone balance equation. Moreover, we revised all quenching and spontaneous emission coefficients according to latest published data. We then calculated daytime distributions of OH and HO2 at these altitudes with the use of their conditions of photo-chemical equilibrium.

TI  - Racial Matching in Foster Care Placements and Subsequent Placement Stability: A National Study
T2  - CHILD AND ADOLESCENT SOCIAL WORK JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Placement instability for children in foster care has an adverse effect on child safety, permanency, and well-being. Some studies have examined racial matching between caseworker-child to improve child outcomes, but fewer have explored racial matching in foster care placements and subsequent outcomes. This study examined the impact of same-race foster home placements on placement stability. This study used data from the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis System (AFCARS), an administrative database containing the children in care for each fiscal year (FY). The analytic sample included n = 36,191 children aged 0-17 years who entered foster care in FY 2015 and were placed with a non-relative foster family and remained in the same placement throughout FY 2015. We followed this sample through FY 2019 to compare racially-matched initial placements and subsequent placement changes. The authors conducted an inverse probability-weighted regression adjustment model using Stata version 16. Approximately three-quarters of children were in a racially matched foster home when they entered foster care, and two-thirds experienced placement stability. Non-Hispanic White children had the highest rates of racially matched placements. After adjusting for other factors, racial matching increased the likelihood of placement stability (b = .05, p < .001). The relationship between child race/ethnicity and placement stability varied among those in racially-matched and transracial placements. Initial findings highlight the importance of recruiting foster families of color and we identify areas for future research that could track child and foster parent characteristics with each placement move.

TI  - Megafire-induced interval squeeze threatens vegetation at landscape scales
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires in 2019-2020 broke global records for extent and severity, affirming the arrival of the megafire era. Frequent megafires reflect changes to fire regimes that can negatively impact species and ecosystems. Here, we offer what we believe to be the first comprehensive analysis of megafire impacts on southeastern Australian vegetation communities, combining remote-sensing data, fire-history records, and plant trait-derived fire interval thresholds. In our study area, fires burned over 5.5 million ha. We found that one-third of all native vegetation in this region has burned too frequently following the megafires, particularly impacting fire-sensitive vegetation (for example, rainforests). This represents a single-year increase of 36% in the vegetation at risk of interval squeeze (vegetation transitions driven by altered fire regimes) compared to the previous 59 years combined. We demonstrate that megafires can overrun recently burned vegetation and infiltrate refugia, reducing fire intervals beyond the persistence thresholds of plant species and increasing the risk of ecosystem collapse. Averting this will require innovative approaches to fire management. However, if climate change is not addressed, ecosystem collapse may be unavoidable especially for ecosystems adapted to infrequent, high-severity fire.

TI  - Do socio-demographic factors modify the effect of weather on malaria in Kanungu District, Uganda?
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There is concern in the international community regarding the influence of climate change on weather variables and seasonality that, in part, determine the rates of malaria. This study examined the role of sociodemographic variables in modifying the association between temperature and malaria in Kanungu District (Southwest Uganda). Methods Hospital admissions data from Bwindi Community Hospital were combined with meteorological satellite data from 2011 to 2014. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the distribution of malaria admissions by age, sex, and ethnicity (i.e. Bakiga and Indigenous Batwa). To examine how sociodemographic variables modified the association between temperature and malaria admissions, this study used negative binomial regression stratified by age, sex, and ethnicity, and negative binomial regression models that examined interactions between temperature and age, sex, and ethnicity. Results Malaria admission incidence was 1.99 times greater among Batwa than Bakiga in hot temperature quartiles compared to cooler temperature quartiles, and that 6-12 year old children had a higher magnitude of association of malaria admissions with temperature compared to the reference category of 0-5 years old (IRR = 2.07 (1.40, 3.07)). Discussion Results indicate that socio-demographic variables may modify the association between temperature and malaria. In some cases, such as age, the weather-malaria association in sub-populations with the highest incidence of malaria in standard models differed from those most sensitive to temperature as found in these stratified models. Conclusion The effect modification approach used herein can be used to improve understanding of how changes in weather resulting from climate change might shift social gradients in health.

TI  - Impact of climate on vegetation in Pindari watershed of Western Himalayas, Kumaun, India, using spatiotemporal analysis: 1972-2018
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation dynamics is an important aspect for determining climate change trends. The present study delineates to examine spatiotemporal changes of vegetation cover in Pindari valley (Kumaun Himalaya) from the 1972 to 2018 timeline. The study includes the calculation of vegetation spectral indices of normalized vegetation index (NDVI), extraction of different vegetation classes, and statistical analysis of the Mann-Kendall (MK) test on historical metrological data (especially precipitation and temperature) of the study site. For the statistical analysis of metrological data, the power data access viewer datasets have been used. The central feature classes of the study are grassland, scrubland, and forest cover. The results revealed that the region's forest cover significantly decreased by 24.74 sq. km from 1972 to 2018, increased in grassland cover by 17.84 sq. km, respectively, and a slight increase in scrubland class by 3.13 sq. km for the study period. The calculated NDVI shows significant changes over the study location; it has been noticed that the maximum values of the NDVI decreased by 0.24, and the minimum values show growth of about 0.047. The analysis indicates that climatic parameters such as precipitation and temperature are the main limiting factors affecting vegetation growth. The annual mean maximum temperature showed a decreasing trend. The estimated results show an increase in annual rainfall and annual minimum temperature, while the decreasing trend is observed in the case of maximum annual temperature. Objectives of the study are (1) spatiotemporal analysis of the vegetation cover, (2) identification of the main causes of change in the vegetation cover, and (3) statistical trend analysis of long-term metrological data. The outcome of the presented research work would be beneficial for the proper management and monitoring of the forest ecosystem.

TI  - Satellite-Observed Chlorophyll<i>-a</i> Concentration Variability in the East Sea (Japan Sea): Seasonal Cycle, Long-Term Trend, and Response to Climate Index
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, to determine the spatiotemporal variability of satellite-observed chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in the East Sea (Japan Sea, EJS), monthly composite images were generated via noise processing using Level-2 MODIS Chl-a data from 2003 to 2020. Harmonic analysis was performed on time-series Chl-a data to present the spatial distribution of seasonal and intraseasonal variability with 1-4 cycles per year. In the EJS, seasonal cycles contributed less than approximately 30% to the total variance in Chl-a variability, indicating the existence of dominant interannual variability. Analysis of the temporal trend in Chl-a concentrations showed that they increased (< 0.06 mg m(-3) yr(-1)) in most of the EJS over almost two decades (2003-2020). In recent years, in the areas showing positive trends in Chl-a, it tended to increase with time, especially in the northern part of the EJS. As a result of examining the trend associated with the physical environment that affects the long-term trend in Chl-a concentrations, sea surface temperature (SST) trends were mostly increased. The wind speeds showed a characteristic strengthening trend in the northeastern part of the EJS and the North Korean coast. Long-term changes in wind direction indicated strengthening of the northerly wind components on the Russian coast and the westerly components on the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula. These wind changes were closely related to the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index variability in relation to the recent warming of the Arctic Ocean. When the AO index was greater than 1, the wind speed tended to be weakened and the SSTs showed a tendency to increase. This led to general increasing responses in Chl-a concentrations during positive AO. The summer SST anomaly revealed an inverse relationship between higher positive values during the La Nina period and lower ones during the El Nino period. When the amplitude of MEI (Multi-variate ENSO Index) was high (| MEI| > 1), the SST anomaly indicated an inverse correlation with the Chl-a concentration anomaly in the EJS. This study demonstrated the regional effects of climate change on Chl-a variability in the EJS in response to tropical-subtropical and arctic-subarctic interactions between ocean and atmospheric variations.

TI  - Percutaneous Venous Cannulation for Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery: The Safest and Effective Technique Described Step-by-Step
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current cardiac surgical landscape, with the expansion of minimally invasive operations, ECMO, and some interventional therapies, requires a thorough knowledge of peripheral cannulation techniques. In particular, venous cannulation may appear trivial and complication-free, but this does not reflect the reality. A venous cannulation which is not perfectly performed can lead to serious life-threatening complications in several steps. The technique we describe step by step is the current gold standard in terms of safety and efficacy: from the use of ultrasound for ultrasound-guided puncture to safe advancement of super stiff guidewires by means of a sentinel catheter, and concluding with smooth insertion of the venous cannula over the stiff guidewire up to the SVC. Moreover, a list of bailout maneuvers to solve complications is presented along with a report of institutional clinical experience since the adoption of this technique.

TI  - Satellite observed vegetation dynamics and drivers in the Namib sand sea over the recent 20 years
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring dryland vegetation trends and examining the drivers are of great importance to understand the dryland vegetation response to future climate changes. Recent findings through satellite data indicate that vegetation greenness has increased in several regions worldwide. These greening patterns are driven by human activities or combined human activities and environmental factors. However, the analyses of greenness trend for regions without direct human activities and shrub expansion in drylands are still lacking. To this end, this study investigates the vegetation trend across the Namib sand sea over March 2000 to December 2018 using monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and examines several potential drivers including precipitation, temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration. For the NDVI time series across the whole study region, a significant greening trend was found over March 2000 to September 2012 based on Mann-Kendall test but not over the whole study period. Structural equation modelling results indicated that precipitation and CO2 were the dominant drivers of greening. Temperature showed negative effects on vegetation greenness, indicating warming would reduce plant growth in the study region. Spatially, 75% of the region showed statistically significant greening over March 2000 to September 2012 and 39.30% for March 2000 to December 2018. The different vegetation trend results between the entire region and the pixel scale implied that location-specific greening could be masked by an overall trend. Our study suggested that precipitation (especially the large episodic precipitation events) and CO2 are dominant drivers of the observed greening in the Namib. Our findings fill an important knowledge gap of vegetation dynamics in regions without direct human activities.

TI  - The spatial variability of NDVI within a wheat field: Information content and implications for yield and grain protein monitoring
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat is a staple crop that is critical for feeding a hungry and growing planet, but its nutritive value has declined as global temperatures have warmed. The price offered to producers depends not only on yield but also grain protein content (GPC), which are often negatively related at the field scale but can positively covary depending in part on management strategies, emphasizing the need to understand their variability within individual fields. We measured yield and GPC in a winter wheat field in Sun River, Montana, USA, and tested the ability of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements from an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) on spatial scales of similar to 10 cm and from Landsat on spatial scales of 30 m to predict them. Landsat observations were poorly related to yield and GPC measurements. A multiple linear model using information from four (three) UAV flyovers was selected as the most parsimonious and predicted 26% (40%) of the variability in wheat yield (GPC). We sought to understand the optimal spatial scale for interpreting UAV observations given that the similar to 10 cm pixels yielded more than 12 million measurements at far finer resolution than the 12 m scale of the harvester. The variance in NDVI observations was "averaged out" at larger pixel sizes but only similar to 20% of the total variance was averaged out at the spatial scale of the harvester on some measurement dates. Spatial averaging to the scale of the harvester also made little difference in the total information content of NDVI fit using Beta distributions as quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Radially-averaged power spectra of UAV-measured NDVI revealed relatively steep power-law relationships with exponentially less variance at finer spatial scales. Results suggest that larger pixels can reasonably capture the information content of within-field NDVI, but the 30 m Landsat scale is too coarse to describe some of the key features of the field, which are consistent with topography, historic management practices, and edaphic variability. Future research should seek to determine an `optimum' spatial scale for NDVI observations that minimizes effort (and therefore cost) while maintaining the ability of producers to make management decisions that positively impact wheat yield and GPC.

TI  - Analyzing the Spatiotemporal Distribution and Characteristics of Liver Cirrhosis in Hospitalized Patients in Wuwei, Gansu Province During 1995-2016: A Long-Term Retrospective Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: This was a long-term retrospective study, aiming to understand the temporal and spatial trend of cirrhosis in Wuwei from 1995 to 2016, explore its spatio-temporal aggregation, and find out the high incidence areas. To provide theoretical basis for the formulation of comprehensive prevention and treatment strategy of cirrhosis in Wuwei.Methods: Herein, we extracted data of cirrhosis patients who were treated in 12 sentinel hospitals in Wuwei from their medical records. We used SAS and Joinpoint Regression Program for data analysis, SaTScan 9.4 software for clustering area detection, and ArcGIS 10.2 software for geographical distribution mapping.Results: Among 3308 patients with liver cirrhosis (average age, 55.34 years) included in this study, 15.9% were aged 50-54 years. The majority were men (2716, 65.8%), with a sex ratio of 1.92:1 and peasants by occupation (1369, 60.3%). The basic social medical insurance system covered the healthcare costs of 1271 patients (63%). A Joinpoint regression analysis done for 1995-2016 revealed an increase in the standardized cirrhosis rate [average annual percent change (AAPC) = 16.7% (95% CI, 10.2-23.5%)] with three joinpoints in 2010, 2013, and 2016. The annual percent change (APC) from 1995 to 2010 was 11.13% (95% CI: 6.5-16.0), and APC from 2010 to 2013 was 66.48% (95% CI:16.0-138.9); conversely, from 2013 to 2016, APC was 4.4% (95% CI, -7.5-17.8%). Hongshagang Town showed the highest average incidence. Each township showed a gradual increase in the incidence after 2010. The results revealed that in each township, liver cirrhosis incidence had some spatial aggregation and was nonrandom. Four liver cirrhosis clusters were noted in 75 townships in Wuwei. Data were gathered from 2011 to 2016.Conclusions: From 1995 to 2016, the incidence of cirrhosis in Wuwei still showed an increasing trend, but the growth rate slowed down since 2013. In Wuwei, the rate of standardization of cirrhosis in female patients increased steadily and faster than in male patients. It is necessary to strengthen the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control measures of cirrhosis-related diseases. The results of spatial scanning, basic spatial distribution, aggregation time, and time trend analysis were consistent.

TI  - Spectral characteristics and petrology of Sinai Mesozoic basaltic rocks: Gebel Farsh El Azraq-Gebel Himayir area, Um Bogma, southwestern Sinai, Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sinai Mesozoic basalts are restricted in its southwestern portion at Um Bogma area, where they occur as intra-continental fissure-fed sills, dykes, plugs and lava flows, following mainly the older structural and crustal weaknesses planes. During Late Paleozoic -Middle to Late Triassic, Egypt had witnessed sporadic tectonic disturbances and faulting activities accompanied by volcanisms. Faulting activity continued during Early to Middle Jurassic and was associated with crustal stretching and basaltic volcanism. At Um Bogma area, southwestern Sinai Peninsula, Middle Triassic, and Early Jurassic basaltic exposures intruded/extruded the Carboniferous sandstones. The main Mesozoic basalts outcrop at Gebel Farsh El Azraq -Gebel Himayir area, where they were successfully discriminated from their surrounding country rocks using Landsat-8 dataset. The Mesozoic basaltic rocks are the least reflective rocks and exhibit a characteristic spectral curve, compared to their country rocks. Landsat-8 bands 7, 5, 3 in RGB and Principal Component Analyses (PCA) technique were used in lithological discrimination of the Mesozoic basalts and their surrounding Late Neoproterozoic basement rocks and Phanerozoic sedimentary succession. Accordingly, a new geological map was produced for the study area. Petrography and geochemistry of these basalts were addressed. Characteristically they contain substantial MgO contents (22.24 to 7.09 wt%) and exhibit low TiO2 (1.56-0.77 wt%) and P2O5 (0.30-0.15 wt%) contents. Geochemically, they pertain to the low P2O5-TiO2 continental tholeiitic to transitional basalts and point out to enriched MORB magma sources. They suggest derivation from spinel-garnet lherzolite source by moderate non-modal partial melting (ca 20-30%). Their petrogenesis was discussed and fractional crystallization modeling was performed as a plausible mechanism to be accounted for their evolutions.

TI  - Estimation of area and volume change in the glaciers of the Columbia Icefield, Canada using machine learning algorithms and Landsat images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning image classification algorithms offer a potential for effective and efficient classification of remotely sensed images covering glaciated areas. The Columbia Icefield in Canada is one such place where glaciers are retreating and losing mass over the years. The Columbia Icefield plays an important role in the region's water budget. In this study, the accuracy of three machine learning algorithms, namely, SVM, RF and MLC, were assessed for the classification of snow/ice area on 2020 Landsat 8 OLI image. All three algorithms classified the image with over 99 percent accuracies, but the SVM classifier showed a higher accuracy in debris covered areas on glaciers. Further, we used SVM algorithm to classify Landsat 5 TM - Sept 10, 1985, Landsat 5 TM - Sept 27, 1991, Landsat 8 OLI - Aug 22, 2013, and Landsat 8 OLI - Sept 10, 2020 images in the Columbia Icefield. Among nine glaciers, Saskatchewan (- 4.57 km2), Dome (-2.03 km2), Columbia (-2.06 km2), Stutfield (-2.17 km2), G242655E52112N (-1.39 km2), Athabasca (-1.39 km2), Castleguard (-1.3 km2), and G242614E52109N (-0.54 km2) measured less ice and snow-covered areas between 1985 and 2020. For these nine glaciers, there was a total decrease of 2.01 +/- 0.24 km3 volume between 1985 and 2020, which is about 1.81 +/- 0.22 km3 water equivalent or 0.12 +/- 0.015 km3 water equivalent per year. On average, Saskatchewan (-0.699 km3) and Columbia (-0.307 km3) Glaciers lost the highest volume of snow and ice between 1985 and 2020. This study also concluded that all SVM, RF and MLC produce highly accurate satellite image classification in the glaciated areas.

TI  - Two-dimensional deformation monitoring of karst landslides in Zongling, China, with multi-platform distributed scatterer InSAR technique
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Zongling landslides are the typical karst landslides located in the southwest of China, which have severely threatened the lives of local people. It is of great significance to monitor the real surface deformation of the unstable slopes for the hazard prevention by using the InSAR technology owing to its high precision and frequent revisit. However, the decorrelation effect and atmospheric delay caused by dense vegetation and alpine terrain result in less effective targets to monitor the full deformation of karst landslides. Besides, the derived deformation along one line-of-sight (LOS) direction can result in the misunderstanding of the real kinematics landslide process. In this study, we combine the multi-temporal distributed scatterer InSAR technology (DS-InSAR) and the multi-platform SAR measurements to derive the multi-dimension deformation time series of Zongling landslides. First, both ALOS/PALSAR-2 datasets and Sentinel-1A images from ascending and descending orbits are employed to acquire the deformation along the LOS direction using the DS-InSAR method, where dense effective targets can be achieved, and the deformation patterns can be revealed. Then, the multi-dimensional small baseline subset (MSBAS) method is used to retrieve the horizontal and vertical deformation of Zongling landslides, which further improve the temporal sampling of the deformation time series. Finally, the comprehensive analyses of driving factors and failure mode are conducted according to the spatial-temporal deformation characteristics, and field investigation. The results indicate that this technical route can not only retrieve the landslide deformation with high spatial-temporal sampling density, but also provide new insight into the driven effect of natural factors and mining activities on karst landslides.

TI  - Assessing the impacts of land use-land cover changes on direct surface runoff: a remote sensing approach in Khulna City
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increased risks of storm flood occurrence in large cities are the resultants of land use changes due to rapid urbanization. This study examines the influence of land-use changes in Khulna City Corporation (KCC) area on surface runoff over a period of 14 years, from 2005 to 2020. Land use-land cover maps for 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were created employing Support Vector Machine (SVM) based supervised image classification using time-series satellite data, and the surface runoff was determined using SCS-CN model. The major land-use change drivers of surface runoff were determined through a correlation analysis. Surface runoff was observed to follow a similar trend in impervious urban areas, which rose by 5.44% from 2005 to 2020 (17.00 mm average runoff depth increment) and the opposite trend was found in vegetation land cover, which declined by 13.34% in areal extent throughout the study period. In comparison with other types of land use, surface runoff changes were most significantly associated with the changes in urban impervious areas and vegetation LULC class. In fast-growing cities across the world, and especially in developing nations, the results of this study may serve as a guide for urban storm flood management and urban planning efforts.

TI  - A new East African satellite data validation station: Performance of the LSA-SAF all-weather land surface temperature product over a savannah biome
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe a new satellite data validation facility located in a savannah biome at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) Kapiti Research Station (Kenya). The facility is focused on satellite land surface temperature (LST) and is equipped with multiple ground-viewing infrared radiometers across four sites. The in-situ LST observations are upscaled to match satellite LST products using a geometric illumination model. The in-situ sensor network represents a step-forward in LST validation in East Africa and savannah biomes. To our knowledge this is the first time that such an extensive network of LST radiometers and supporting measurements has been installed in sub-Saharan Africa, or a savannah. With this network we capture surface heterogeneity in a manner that has not previously been possible. The LST ground data from this station collected between October 2018 and March 2019 is used to evaluate the new Land Surface Analysis Satellite Application Facility (LSA-SAF) all-sky LST product (MLST-AS) that blends clear-sky infrared-retrieved LSTs with LSTs derived from a land surface energy balance model to fill gaps due to cloudy conditions. Comparison against the in-situ LSTs indicates overall accuracy, precision, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of MLST-AS to be 2.02 K, 1.38 K and 3.64 K respectively. The infrared-retrieved LST component of MLST-AS under clear skies has an accuracy, precision and RMSE of 1.16 K, 0.8 K and 3.16 K respectively. The energy balance model-based component of MLST-AS has performance statistics of 3.02 K, 1.38 K and 4.16 K. The MLST-AS energy balance model component is observed to perform worse when surface moisture is present, underestimating night-time and daily maximum temperatures by between 2 and 4 K in the 24 h following surface water deposition as precipitation or dew.

TI  - Sentinel Riparian Spiders Predict Mercury Contamination of Riverine Fish
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a widespread and toxic environmental contaminant. It is challenging to determine the level of Hg contamination of food chains and fish within the millions of water bodies in the United States. Mercury contamination can vary 10-fold between ecosystems, even those in the same region. Therefore, aquatic ecosystems need to be individually monitored for Hg contamination to determine which ecosystems are most contaminated and pose the greatest risk to human and wildlife health. One approach to monitoring Hg is to use sentinel species, defined as biological monitors that accumulate a contaminant in their tissues without significant adverse effects. Riparian spiders such as long-jawed orb weavers (Tetragnathidae) have been proposed as sentinels of persistent bioavailable contaminants, like Hg, in aquatic systems. Long-jawed orb weavers feed on emergent aquatic insects and have concentrations of Hg that reflect levels of Hg contamination in the aquatic food web. Previous studies have documented elevated contaminant concentrations in long-jawed orb weavers from shorelines of aquatic ecosystems, suggesting that they could be used as sentinels of chemical contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. We demonstrate for the first time that long-jawed orb weavers can be used as sentinels to identify aquatic systems that contain fish with elevated concentrations of Hg.

TI  - New systematically measured sand mining budget for the Mekong Delta reveals rising trends and significant volume underestimations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The river beds of the Mekong Delta are some of the most intensively sand mined places in the world. However, sand mining budgets remain limited to rough and indirect estimates. Here, we provide a first systematic, field-based estimation of the Mekong Delta's sand mining budget. This budget overcomes the limitations of relying on officially declared statistics and bathymetric surveys of short channel reaches. We applied Sentinel-1 radar imagery to monitor the distribution of sand mining activities using boat metrics-driven mining intensity maps correlated with a field-based bathymetry difference map which were derived from two extensive bathymetric surveys conducted in 2014 and 2017. The two surveys cover ~ 100 km in the Tien River, reaching approximately 15% of the Mekong Delta. We then extrapolated the Tien River findings to the broader Vietnamese Mekong Delta from 2015 to 2020 and measured a continuous increase of the extraction budget by ~ 25% between 2015 (38 Mm(3)/yr) and 2020 (47 Mm(3)/yr). We estimated a total sand mining budget of 254 Mm3 during the 6-year study period with an average annual rate of ~ 42 Mm(3). Ou r field-based annual rates ar e higher than both official declarations provided and estimates from previous studies which implies that a substantial portion of the sand mining budget remains unaccounted for. Riverbed sand mining remains a key threat to the Mekong Delta as it contributes to a multitude of other environmental threats including dam construction effects on sedimentation, ongoing subsidence, sea level rise and recurring saltwater intrusion. This study offers a new approach that can be implemented elsewhere to allow for systematic monitoring and quantification of sand mining activities that are vital for assessing f uture projections on environmental impacts.

TI  - Groundwater discharge tracing for a large Ice-Covered lake in the Tibetan Plateau: Integrated satellite remote sensing data, chemical components and isotopes (D, <SUP>18</SUP>O, and <SUP>222</SUP>Rn)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been known that groundwater-lake water interaction plays an important role in mass exchange between land and lakes. However, most of the lakes in the world freeze during the winter, and few studies of groundwater and surface water interaction (groundwater discharge tracing) focus on ice-covered lakes. This study investigated groundwater discharge into a large ice-covered lake, Xiao Qaidam Lake in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), using sat-ellite remote sensing and chemical and isotopic tracing. Analysis of chemical components, stable isotopes (D, O-18) and Rn-222 revealed that groundwater discharge occurred in the western and southern portions of Xiao Qaidam Lake. Remote sensing data (the distribution of and variation in lake surface temperature, LST) revealed these locations of groundwater discharge and indicated additional groundwater discharge in areas of springs. Based on the regression model between LST and Rn-222 activity in lake water and 222Rn mass balance model, the groundwater discharge into Xiao Qaidam Lake was estimated to be (2.77 +/- 0.26) x 10(5) m(3)/d, which is slightly higher than river water input at summer. In addition, this study also suggests that ice melting process should be considered when tracing groundwater discharge into an ice-covered lake, and that the LST distribution during the icing period is better than the LST variation for tracing groundwater discharge because the ice eliminated noise from wind and surface water. The study provides insight into the tracing of groundwater discharge into large ice-covered lakes in the TP and elsewhere.

TI  - Shelf Water Export at the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence Evidenced From Combined <i>in situ</i> and Satellite Observations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazil-Malvinas Confluence (BMC) is the region where opposing and intense western boundary currents meet along the Southwestern Atlantic slope at about 38 degrees S, generating one of the most energetic mesoscale regions of the global ocean. Based on shipborne observations acquired within the Uruguayan Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ), combined with satellite data and an eddy tracking algorithm, we analyze the cross-shelf exchanges during May 2016, when the BMC was in an anomalous northern position. Two types of shelf water export were observed triggered by mesoscale dynamics: one was the export of shallow Rio de la Plata Plume waters driven off-shelf by the retroflection of the Brazil Current. This export formed a 70 km wide, 20 m deep filament that propagated offshore at 0.3 m s(-1), with a transport of 0.42 Sv. It lasted about 10 days before being mixed with ambient Confluence waters by strong winds. An additional type of off-shelf transport consisted of a subsurface layer of Subantarctic Shelf Waters (SASW) about 60 m thick that subducted at the BMC reaching 130 m deep and transporting 0.91 +/- 0.91 Sv. We show that geostrophic currents derived from satellite altimetry over the slope can be useful to track this subsurface off-shelf export as they are significantly correlated with absolute velocity measurements at this depth. Argo temperature and salinity profiles show evidence of these two types of shelf water export occurring between the BMC front and the separation of the Brazil Current from the shelf-break, suggesting this is a relatively frequent phenomenon, in agreement with previous observations.

TI  - Seagrass Stable Isotope Composition Provides Seascape-Scale Tracking of Anthropogenic Nitrogen Inputs in a Tropical Marine Lagoon
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic nutrient loading has led to declines in the function and productivity of some tropical coastal ecosystems. We use the seagrass Thalassia testudinum as a sentinel for tracing nutrient inputs and movements in Ambergris Caye Lagoon, Belize, a region heavily dependent on ecotourism and in the process of expanding its network of marine protected areas. Seagrass samples were collected at stations distributed along a 24-km section of the lagoon, with stations bracketing the urban center of San Pedro. Leaf tissue carbon/nitrogen (C:N) stoichiometry, stable isotope composition (delta C-13, delta N-15), and epiphyte load (mg cm(-2)) were analyzed relative to spatial location and proximate land use conditions. Seagrass tissues showed a modal pattern in delta N-15 composition along the north-south axis of the lagoon, with maximum average values (1.5 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand [SD]), occurring adjacent to or slightly down-current of the most urbanized areas of San Pedro (range = -3.0-3.7 parts per thousand). Offshore seagrasses were enriched in delta C-13 relative to inshore areas, but there was no consistent relationship with adjacent land use. Tissue C:N and epiphyte load (mg cm(-2)) decreased monotonically from south to north, declining from average values of 25.3 to 19.2 (C:N) and from 4.2 to 0.8 mg cm(-2) (epiphyte load). Impervious surface cover adjacent to lagoon sites was positively related to delta N-15 values (parameter estimate +/- SE = 0.80 +/- 0.36) but negatively related to tissue C:N (-2.78 +/- 0.65) and epiphyte load (-1.04 +/- 0.33). Isoscapes of spatially interpolated isotope values highlighted the location and potential sources of nutrient input to the lagoon, some of which occurred within marine protected areas. These results support the application of seagrass tissue stable isotope composition analysis as a low-cost and time-integrated means of tracing nutrient inputs in some naturally oligotrophic ecosystems. Spatially explicit information on nutrient inputs is vital for natural resource managers and land-use planners to identify, mitigate, and control sources of anthropogenic eutrophication in tropical coastal ecosystems such as Ambergris Caye Lagoon.

TI  - Understanding the influence of COVID-19 induced lockdown on urban thermal environment of Ranchi city, India
T2  - GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the study is to understand the pattern of land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) developed in Ranchi city during Covid-19-induced lockdown (2020) and its comparison with previous years. The study incorporated Landsat 8 (Operational land imager) data from United States Geological Survey and air temperature and relative humidity data from power.larc.nasa.gov for the years 2017, 2019 and 2020. The results exposed a drastic change in the LST and NDVI pattern of the city. The mean LST of the city during April has declined from 39.80 degrees C in 2017 to 32.38 degrees C in 2020. Similarly, the mean LST of May also declined from 38.41 degrees C in 2017 to 34.84 degrees C in 2020. On the contrary, the city experienced an ascending growth of NDVI from 0.24 to 0.26 in April and May 2017 to 0.349 and 0.37 in 2020, respectively. Additionally, the city portrays declining air temperature with enhanced relative humidity. Ranchi city also exhibited relatively maximum area under ecologically excellent category in the year 2020 and reduced area under ecologically the worst category based on urban thermal field variance index. Thus, reduced temperature with augmented humidity and NDVI developed a healthy urban environment.

TI  - Forest structure and solar-induced fluorescence across intact and degraded forests in the Amazon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest degradation (e.g., anthropogenic disturbances such as selective logging and fires) alters forest structure and function and influences the forest's carbon sink. In this study, we explored structure-function relationships across a variety of degradation levels in the southern Brazilian Amazon by 1) investigating how forest structural properties vary as a function of degradation history using airborne lidar data; 2) assessing the effects of degradation on solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) seasonality using TROPOMI data; and 3) quantifying the contribution of structural variables to SIF using multiple regression models with stepwise se-lection of lidar metrics. Forest degradation history was obtained through Landsat time-series classification. We found that fire, logging, and time since disturbance were major determinants of forest structure, and that forests affected by fires experienced larger variability in leaf area index (LAI), canopy height and vertical structure relative to logged and intact forests. Moreover, only recently burned forests showed significantly depressed SIF during the dry season compared to intact forests. Canopy height and the vertical distribution of foliage were the best predictors of SIF. Unexpectedly, we found that wet-season SIF was higher in active regenerating forests (~ 4 years after fires or logging) compared with intact forests, despite lower LAI. Our findings help to elucidate the mechanisms of carbon accumulation in anthropogenically disturbed tropical forests and indicate that they can capture large amounts of carbon while recovering.

TI  - Mapping methane plumes at very high spatial resolution with the WorldView-3 satellite
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of methane emissions from industrialactivities can help enable effective climate change mitigation strategies.These industrial emissions, such as from oil and gas (O&G) extraction and coal mining, typically occur as large plumes of highly concentrated gas. Different satellite missions have recently shown the potential to map such methane plumes from space. In this work, we report on the promisingpotential of the WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite mission for methane mapping.This relies on its unique very high spatial resolution (up to 3.7 m) data in the shortwave infrared part of the spectrum,which is complemented by a goodspectral sampling of the methane absorption feature at 2300 nm and a highsignal to noise ratio. The proposed retrieval methodology is based on thecalculation of methane concentration enhancements from pixel-wise estimatesof methane transmittance at WV-3 SWIR band 7 (2235-2285 nm), which ispositioned at a highly-sensitive methane absorption region. A sensitivityanalysis based on end-to-end simulations has helped to understand retrievalerrors and detection limits. The results have shown the good performance ofWV-3 for methane mapping, especially over bright and homogeneous areas. Thepotential of WV-3 for methane mapping has been further tested with realdata, which has led to the detection of 26 independent point emissions overdifferent methane hotspot regions, such as O&G extraction fields inAlgeria and Turkmenistan, and the Shanxi coal mining region in China. Inparticular, the detection of very small leaks (< 100 kg h(-1)) from oil pipelines in Turkmenistan shows the unique capability of WV-3 for mapping industrial methane emissions from space. The mission includes pointing capabilities that allow for a daily revisit over these oil pipelines or other critical infrastructure.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical deforestation is one of the widely recognised human-induced factors responsible for climate change. A clear understanding of the trends in forest cover loss hotspots provide baseline information for sustainable forest management. This study has utilised Landsat data and a novel spatial pattern mining tool to identify trends in forest cover loss from 2009 to 2020 in the Araku range of Eastern Ghats, India. This study focuses on identifying the annual rate of deforestation and significant trends in forest cover loss through statistical techniques. Analysis indicates no significant trend in forest loss (P = 0.7 and the trend statistic was Z = 0.27; S = 5) during the study period. Disturbances in the forest cover are mainly attributed to shifting cultivation in the study area. The Emerging hotspot model has found new and sporadic hotspots in the Araku range. However, there are no intensifying hotspots, historical hotspots and persistent hotspots indicate effective management in the majority of the study area. This study helps to identify and prioritise deforested areas for monitoring and preparing appropriate conservation plans and management strategies.

TI  - Development of a Competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Based on Purified Recombinant Viral Protein 7 for Serological Diagnosis of Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease in Camels
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) is a member of the Orbivirus genus in the Reoviridae family, and it is the etiological agent of an arthropod-transmitted disease that affects domestic and wild ruminants. Due to its significant economic impact, many attempts have been done in order to develop diagnostic immunoassays mainly based on the use of the viral protein 7 (VP7), that is, the immunodominant serogroup-specific antigen. In this work, a recombinant VP7 (recVP7) of EHDV serotype 2 was produced in a baculovirus system, and after purification using ion metal affinity chromatography, we obtained a high yield of recombinant protein characterized by a high degree of purity. We used the purified recVP7 as reagent to develop a competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay (c-ELISA), and we tested the presence of EHDV antibodies in 185 dromedary camel serum samples. The c-ELISA showed good performance parameters in recognising positive sera of naturally EHDV-infected dromedary camels; in particular, our developed test reached 85.7% of sensitivity, 98.1% of specificity, 93% of accuracy, and a high agreement value with results obtained by the commercial ELISA kit (Cohen's kappa value of 0.85) that we adopted as the reference method. This c-ELISA could be a useful screening test to monitor the virus spread in camels that are sentinel animals for endemic areas of disease.

TI  - Forest phenoclusters for Argentina based on vegetation phenology and climate
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biodiversity conservation and species distribution modeling greatly benefit from broad-scale forest maps depicting tree species or forest types rather than just presence and absence of forest, or coarse classifications. Ideally, such maps would stem from satellite image classification based on abundant field data for both model training and accuracy assessments, but such field data do not exist in many parts of the globe. However, different forest types and tree species differ in their vegetation phenology, offering an opportunity to map and characterize forests based on the seasonal dynamic of vegetation indices and auxiliary data. Our goal was to map and characterize forests based on both land surface phenology and climate patterns, defined here as forest phenoclusters. We applied our methodology in Argentina (2.8 million km(2)), which has a wide variety of forests, from rainforests to cold-temperate forests. We calculated phenology measures after fitting a harmonic curve of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series derived from 30-m Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 data from 2018-2019. For climate, we calculated land surface temperature (LST) from Band 10 of the thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) of Landsat 8, and precipitation from Worldclim (BIO12). We performed stratified X-means cluster classifications followed by hierarchical clustering. The resulting clusters separated well into 54 forest phenoclusters with unique combinations of vegetation phenology and climate characteristics. The EVI 90th percentile was more important than our climate and other phenology measures in providing separability among different forest phenoclusters. Our results highlight the potential of combining remotely sensed phenology measures and climate data to improve broad-scale forest mapping for different management and conservation goals, capturing functional rather than structural or compositional characteristics between and within tree species. Our approach results in classifications that go beyond simple forest-nonforest in areas where the lack of detailed ecological field data precludes tree species-level classifications, yet conservation needs are high. Our map of forest phenoclusters is a valuable tool for the assessment of natural resources, and the management of the environment at scales relevant for conservation actions.

TI  - Cloud Mask Intercomparison eXercise (CMIX): An evaluation of cloud masking algorithms for Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud cover is a major limiting factor in exploiting time-series data acquired by optical spaceborne remote sensing sensors. Multiple methods have been developed to address the problem of cloud detection in satellite imagery and a number of cloud masking algorithms have been developed for optical sensors but very few studies have carried out quantitative intercomparison of state-of-the-art methods in this domain. This paper summarizes results of the first Cloud Masking Intercomparison eXercise (CMIX) conducted within the Committee Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration & Validation (WGCV). CEOS is the forum for space agency coordination and cooperation on Earth observations, with activities organized under working groups. CMIX, as one such activity, is an international collaborative effort aimed at intercomparing cloud detection algorithms for moderate-spatial resolution (10-30 m) spaceborne optical sensors. The focus of CMIX is on open and free imagery acquired by the Landsat 8 (NASA/USGS) and Sentinel-2 (ESA) missions. Ten algorithms developed by nine teams from fourteen different organizations representing universities, research centers and industry, as well as space agencies (CNES, ESA, DLR, and NASA), are evaluated within the CMIX. Those algo-rithms vary in their approach and concepts utilized which were based on various spectral properties, spatial and temporal features, as well as machine learning methods. Algorithm outputs are evaluated against existing reference cloud mask datasets. Those datasets vary in sampling methods, geographical distribution, sample unit (points, polygons, full image labels), and generation approaches (experts, machine learning, sky images). Overall, the performance of algorithms varied depending on the reference dataset, which can be attributed to differences in how the reference datasets were produced. The algorithms were in good agreement for thick cloud detection, which were opaque and had lower uncertainties in their identification, in contrast to thin/semi-transparent clouds detection. Not only did CMIX allow identification of strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms and potential areas of improvements, but also the problems associated with the existing reference datasets. The paper concludes with recommendations on generating new reference datasets, metrics, and an analysis framework to be further exploited and additional input datasets to be considered by future CMIX activities.

AB  - Scientific analyses were carried out to determine the effect of long-range transport of particulate matters based on chemical speciation of fine particulate matters (PM2.5) collected from the central area of Seoul, Republic of Korea. Based on chemical analysis of PM2.5, sources of emission of PM2.5 were determined by employing the sequence source apportionment methods such as chemical mass balance and positive matrix factorization. In addition, the path of migration of PM2.5 was traced employing models of residence time weighted concentration, and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for the period of emission increase of PM2.5. Source apportionment results revealed that (1) biomass burning can be originated from wildfire in Russia based on fire spot monitored with a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer from Terra & Aqua satellites. (2) Longrange transported PM2.5 contained secondary products of sulfate and nitrate from East of China. Data of the present study could be exploited for further studies delving into the long-range transport of particulate matters in the air.

TI  - Quantifying Woody Plant Encroachment in Grasslands: A Review on Remote Sensing Approaches
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Grasslands are an important global ecosystem, providing essential ecological and economic ecosystem services. Over the last couple decades, as a result of climate change and human activities, nearly 50% of global grasslands have degraded. Woody plant encroachment (WPE), one of the outcomes of climate change and human-related activities, negatively affects grasslands' ecology, as well as their ability to produce food for livestock, habitats for wildlife, and economic returns for rangeland managers. Long-term monitoring of grassland status can facilitate grassland restoration. Additionally, the study of factors that influence grassland dynamics (e.g., grazing, fire, land use, or climate) can help in the restoration of grasslands. Remote sensing (RS) has been used to map the spatiotemporal distribution of WPE by using a wide variety of sensors and methods, necessitating a review on the effectiveness of RS data for WPE monitoring. Based on the importance of RS data and the rate at which grassland ecosystems are changing, this paper provides a literature review on a theoretical basis for quantifying WPE using RS and on existing RS approaches for WPE monitoring. Lastly, it identifies the current challenges associated with quantifying spatio-temporal variability in WPE that future research will need to overcome.

TI  - A Dual Process Social Psychological Model of Corrupt Intention and Attitudes Toward Corrupt People
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Preliminary studies indicate that ideologies and worldviews are key in understanding the motivation behind corruption. Yet, there is no model seeking to explain corrupt intention that incorporates ideology and worldviews as predictors. Our objective was to propose a model integrating ideological factors (social dominance orientation [SDO] and right-wing authoritarianism [RWA]) and their underlying worldviews (competitive worldview beliefs [CWB] and dangerous worldview beliefs [DWB]) as predictors of corrupt intention and attitudes toward corrupt people and examine the model in the high corruption context of Brazil. For that purpose, preregistered hypotheses were tested across six studies. Results confirmed that corrupt intention is predicted by SDO but not RWA, while attitudes toward corrupt people are predicted by RWA but not SDO (Studies 1, 2, and 4). Replicating these findings cross-culturally, World Values Survey data (Study 3) indicated that corrupt intention is predicted by a proxy SDO index but not by a proxy RWA index. Experimentally increasing DWB amplified corrupt intention, but attitudes toward corrupt people remained unaffected (Study 5). Study 6 further confirmed the independence of corrupt intention and attitudes toward corrupt people, with corrupt intention primarily predicted by CWB and attitudes toward corrupt people primarily predicted by RWA. Hence, the first social psychological model that seeks to explain corruption integrating ideologies and worldviews was successfully proposed with implications for future research.

TI  - Estimating global downward shortwave radiation from VIIRS data using a transfer-learning neural network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been successfully used in estimating downward shortwave radiation (DSR). To achieve global estimations, traditional ML models need sufficient ground measurements covering various atmospheric and surface conditions globally, which is difficult to accomplish. Training on the simulated data of a radiative transfer model (RTM) is a possible solution, but widely used RTMs ignore some complex cloud conditions which brings bias to simulations. In this study, a neural network applied with the transfer-learning (TL) concept is introduced to utilize both radiative transfer simulations and ground measurement data, achieving global DSR estimation with only top-of-atmosphere and surface albedo at local solar noon as inputs. The proposed method estimates both instantaneous and daily DSR from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data at 750-m resolution, and both the estimates are validated by 40 independent stations globally. The root mean-square error and relative root mean square error of instantaneous DSR validation over 25 Baseline Surface Radiation Network, seven Surface Radiation Network, and eight Greenland Climate Network stations in 2013 were 91.2 (16.1%), 106.3 (18.3%), 75.0 (24.2%) W/m2, respectively, and the daily validation achieved 30.8 (15.5%), 33.5 (17.6%), and 31.3 (14.4) W/m2, respectively. The proposed method presents significant high accuracy over polar regions and similar performances over other areas compared with traditional ML models, physics models (e.g., look-up tables and direct estimations), and existing DSR products. The algorithm is also applied to VIIRS swath data to test its global efficacy. Instantaneous mapping captures the spatial pattern of the cloud-mask product, and daily mapping shows spatial patterns similar to the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Synoptic TOA and surface fluxes and clouds product, but with more detail. Further analysis indicates that model performance is less sensitive to the quantity of training data after TL has been incorporated. This study demonstrates the advantages of TL on boosting both the generality and accuracy of DSR estimation, which can potentially be applied to other variable retrievals.

TI  - The futility of the pandemic treaty: caught between globalism and statism
T2  - INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article critically examines proposals for a pandemic treaty. It highlights the misalignment between the treaty proposal and the actual problems of global health governance by showing that the treaty can't solve the multiple problems of global health cooperation.In November 2021, the World Health Assembly (WHA) is hosting a special session to discuss the proposed plans for a pandemic treaty. Despite the fact that there are scant details concerning the treaty, the proposal has gained considerable support in both the academic community, and at the international level. While we agree that in the wake of the numerous governance failures during COVID-19, we need to develop appropriate global solutions to be able to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from future global health crises-and that such mechanisms should be rooted in global equity-we disagree, however, that this pandemic treaty, currently, is the most appropriate way in which to achieve this. Indeed, notions of global community, solidarity, fairness are far removed from the reality that we have seen unfolding in the actions of states responding to the pandemic. This is the crux of the tension with the proposed treaty: the balance between the ideal cosmopolitan worldview held by those in power in global health, and the practice of national security decision-making witnessed in the last 18 months. Indeed, we do not believe that a pandemic treaty will deliver what is being extolled by its proponents, and it will not solve the multiple problems of global cooperation in global health that supporters believe it will.

TI  - Downscaling land surface temperature: A framework based on geographically and temporally neural network weighted autoregressive model with spatio-temporal fused scaling factors
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Downscaling land surface temperatures (LST) from satellite imagery is essential for many fine-scale applications. However, the accuracy of the downscaling is often limited by different environmental and geographical conditions. In this work, a novel LST downscaling framework is proposed to improve the accuracy, especially for heterogeneous areas with varying land covers and complex terrains. The framework focuses on downscaling the MODIS LST from 1 km to 100 m, using the proposed geographically and temporally neural network weighted autoregression (GTNNWAR) model with spatio-temporal fused scaling factors derived from Landsat 8 imagery and digital surface models (DSM). To tackle the issues of the non-stationarity of the scaling factors in heterogenous areas, a region-adaptive parameterization approach is first applied. Then, the GTNNWAR invokes a two stage deep neural network to estimate the regression coefficients, resulting in the adaption of varying weights for the scaling factors to raise the prediction performance. Moreover, the GTNNWAR is incorporated with a spatial autoregressive model which intakes the neighbor effects so that the overall accuracy can be further improved. Prior to the actual downscaling with the GTNNWAR, a filter-based fusion method is applied to ensure the spatiotemporal consistency of scaling factors is high enough for the neural networks to converge. The results suggest that the proposed framework exhibits high accuracy at the boundaries of different land covers and complex terrains. Compared with several other downscaling algorithms in three case study areas (Beijing and Zhangye in China, Netherlands-Germany in Europe), the proposed framework outperforms with a 28% improved R-squared (R-2) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.02 K. In addition, the downscaled LST has R-2 over 0.63 for the UAV observations (Guangdong). It is concluded that the proposed framework has high reliability and robustness to provide LST datasets with high spatio-temporal resolutions in a wide range of land types.

TI  - Quantitative analysis and prediction of urban heat island intensity on urban-rural gradient: A case study of Shanghai
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization causes enormous land use/land cover (LULC) changes, which have become significant drivers of land surface temperature (LST) change in rapidly urbanizing city, and the changes in LULC subsequently increase the LST to form urban heat island (UHI). This paper first identified the spatial distribution pattern of the LULC changes and surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) in the study area in recent 20 years based on Landsat TM/OLI data. And later, the relationship between the distribution of impervious surface (IS) and vegetable coverage (VC) and SUHII was analyzed quantitatively. Then, the land cover and land surface temperature (LST) in Shanghai in 2027 under three development modes were simulated and predicted based on FLUS model and geospatial analysis. The results showed that (1) Regional land cover and LST had obvious differences in gradient distribution from urban to rural areas, and the outer ring road (Ring3) was an obvious dividing line; (2) the proportion of IS and VC were significantly positively (|R| > 0.695) and negatively (|R| > 0.328) correlated with LST; (3) under the three different scenario development models, the ecological space protection model effectively regulated the SUHII, which was 15.91% less than the SUHII in 2017 (34% inside Ring3 and 14% outside Ring3). The results could provide a reference for the rational allocation of urban land and landscape optimization in reducing SUHII` in typical urbanized areas.

TI  - Summer dynamics drive the microbial response to carbon and nutrient additions in a high-altitude lake
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The predicted increase in allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in high-altitude lakes is expected to alter the phytoplankton-bacterioplankton relationship. However, few studies address the influence of summer phytoplankton dynamics on microbial responses to DOC additions. We sampled natural plankton assemblages during two contrasting periods of summer in a high-altitude lake in the French Alps and subjected them to glucose and nutrient enrichments under two light conditions (dark or light) and two temperature conditions (10 degrees C or 18 degrees C). Our results indicate that glucose use by bacteria differs over the summer, depending on the availability of autochthonous DOC and the nutrient limitation. Glucose was consumed by bacteria more in early summer; however, biomass increased with glucose addition more in late summer than in early summer. This pattern arose from the greater availability of phytoplankton-derived DOC in late summer, reducing the need for alternative carbon sources in late summer, when phytoplankton biomass was high. Mixotrophic taxa were stimulated after glucose additions both in early summer and in late summer. We found greater competition between bacteria and phytoplankton in late summer after glucose addition, linked to the summer nutrient limitation pattern. Our study thus highlights a differential response depending on the timing of summer DOC inputs. The global changes forecast for the French Alps should increase heterotrophic and mixotrophic processes in planktonic communities of shallow high-altitude lakes with vegetated catchments. This experimental study provides insights that will be useful in predicting ecological trajectories and in refining predictions of sentinel lakes' responses to global changes.

TI  - Quiet-time seasonal behaviour of the ionosphere measured by the Ionosphere PhotoMeter (IPM) on the Chinese meteorological satellite FY-3D compared with the IRI2016 model predictions
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we examine the climatology structure of the mid-night ionosphere at approximately two o'clock local time of a low solar-activity year and discrepancies between Ionosphere PhotoMeter (IPM) observations and IRI (International Reference Ionosphere) model-2016 predictions using (1) a global structure for the F2 layer peak electron density (NmF2) for four seasons, (2) the mean NmF2 values at different latitudes by month, and (3) the monthly distribution of the global average of NmF2. The data is collected by the IPM, a far-ultraviolet nadir-viewing photometer that has been aboard the second-generation, polar-orbiting Chinese meteorological satellite Feng-Yun 3D (FY-3D) since its launch on November 25th, 2017 and has provided excellent opportunities for many scientific investigations of the ionosphere. We collected night glow data under low geomagnetic activity (KP <= 4) during 2018, and the data obtained five days before and after a full-moon night were removed to prevent the influence of stray light. Before analysing the climatology of the ionosphere and comparing the results with those obtained from IRI2016, the accuracy of NmF2 measured by IPM was evaluated by comparison with data from ground-based ionosondes. A statistical comparative analysis of NmF2 measured by IPM and ionosonde indicated a difference of 20% at middle latitudes and 28% at low latitudes. The global behaviour of NmF2 measured by IPM and IRI for four seasons shows that the IRI model generally captures the morphology of the latitudinal structure and hemispheric asymmetry in NmF2 observed by IPM. A comparison between IPM-measured N(m)F(2)and IRI-predicted NmF2 indicates that the former is systematically lower than the latter. The difference in the measurements and predictions can be as large as 300%. (c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Changes in physicochemical, heavy metals and air quality linked to spot <i>Aplocheilus panchax</i> along Mahanadi industrial belt of India under COVID-19-induced lockdowns
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Positive effects of COVID-19-induced lockdowns on environment are well documented although pre-planned experiments for such analyses and appearance of fish species are lacking. We hypothesize that spotting the fish Aplocheilus panchax along the industrial belt of Mahanadi River near Cuttack in a never seen manner could be due to the regenerated environment. Heavy metals, water and air qualities along with spotting A. panchax in up, mid and downstream of Mahanadi River near Jagatpur industrial basins were analysed during pre-(end of March 2020) and after 60 days of lockdowns (last week of May 2020). An overall 45, 61, 79, 100, 97 and 90% reduction of Fe, Cu, Ni, Cd, Pb and Zn was recorded in the studied area after lockdowns, respectively. Similarly, dissolved oxygen and pH were elevated by 26 and 7%, respectively. Water temperature, conductivity and total dissolved solute levels were reduced by 7, 46 and 15%, respectively, which were again elevated during post-lockdowns during 2021 as observed from the Landsat-8 OLI satellite data. Air NO2, SO2, NH3, PM2.5, PM10 and CO levels were alleviated by 58.75, 80.33, 72.22, 76.28, 77.33 and 80.15%, respectively. Finally, for the first time, about 12 A. panchax fish per 100 m shore line in the area were spotted. The observed lockdown-induced environmental healing at the studied area could contribute to the appearance of A. panchax in the study site and therefore a stringent environmental audit is suggested during post-COVID-19 periods to make the regenerated environmental status long lasting in such habitats.

TI  - Super-resolution for mapping the debris-covered glaciers, central Himalaya, India
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - New techniques are being implemented to precisely monitor the changes in debris-covered glaciers for ascertaining their response to climate change. The super-resolution mapping (SRM) technique is implemented here to provide the low-cost and fine-resolution facies maps of debris-covered glaciers in the Indian Himalayan region using coarse-resolution satellite data. The implemented SRM algorithm is capable of preserving the spatial pattern of facies on the debris-covered glacier surface. Scale factor (s(f)) and surface heterogeneity are two possible determinants of SRM accuracy. Larger s(fs) decrease the SRM accuracy and its computing efficiency, and hence optimal s(fs) must be selected. Higher SRM accuracies are obtained for less heterogenic glacier surfaces and vice-versa. Uncertainty in the resultant maps arises due to the underlying natural factors (shadow/clouds) and seasonal differences in the image acquisition. Temporal implementation of SRM is feasible to assess the facies variations on a debris-covered glacier surface, facilitating time-and cost-effective monitoring of its response to climate change over large areas.

TI  - Research on deformation characteristics of the 2021 Qinghai Maduo <i>M</i><sub>S</sub>7.4 earthquake through coseismic dislocation inversion
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past 70 years, the Qinghai Maduo Ms7.4 earthquake (May 22, 2021) has been the only earthquake with a magnitude of > 7 that has occurred within the Bayan Har Block. To investigate the deformation process of this earthquake, we acquired the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coseismic deformation field based on Sentinel-1 SAR images, which showed that the maximum line of sight (LOS) displacement was similar to 1 m. By combining this information with the results of our field investigation, the fault slip distributions were obtained by inversion using the single-and double-fault models, wherein the latter model showed better inversion results than that of the former. According to the inversion results, the overall rupture pattern was predominantly left-lateral strike-slip, with a released seismic moment of similar to Mw7.5. Specifically, the principal seismogenic fault had a strike of 283 degrees, dip of 91 degrees, and maximum slip of 4.87 m; the branch fault along the eastern segment of the rupture had a strike of 110 degrees, dip of 94 degrees, and maximum slip of 2 m. Conversely, the results derived from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) strain rate field before the earthquake indicated that the Maduo earthquake occurred in East Kunlun,which is characterized by the largest maximum shear strain rate. The strain accumulation rate (similar to 2. 5 x 10(-8)/yr) was significantly lower than that of the Xianshuihe fault zone on the southern boundary of the Bayan Har block and the East Kunlun fault zone on its northern boundary. Furthermore, pre-seismic deformation near the seismogenic fault was relatively gentle, showing partial late seismogenic characteristics. (c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> malaria in Papua and Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) has been adopted as first-line therapy for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Indonesia since 2010. The efficacy of DHA-PPQ was evaluated in 2 sentinel sites in Keerom District, Papua and Merangin District, Jambi, Sumatra from April 2017 to April 2018. Methods Clinical and parasitological parameters were monitored over a 42-day period following the World Health Organization standard in vivo protocol and subjects meeting the inclusion criteria were treated with DHA-PPQ once daily for 3 days, administered orally. Results In Papua, 6339 subjects were screened through active and passive cases detection. Of the 114 falciparum and 81 vivax cases enrolled, 102 falciparum and 80 vivax cases completed the 42 day follow up, and 12 falciparum and 1 vivax cases were either lost to follow up or withdrawn. Kaplan-Meier analysis of microscopy readings of 102 falciparum cases revealed 93.1% (95% CI 86.4-97.2) as Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response (ACPR). No delay in parasite clearance nor severe adverse reaction was observed. Recurrent parasites of Plasmodium falciparum were detected in 7 cases and categorized as late treatment failures (LTF) at days 21, 35, and 42 and one of which was reinfected by Plasmodium vivax at day 42. Two cases were confirmed as recrudescent infection and 4 were re-infection. The PCR-corrected DHA-PPQ efficacy for P. falciparum was 97.9% (95% CI 92.7-99.7). Of the 80 cases of P. vivax that were followed up, 71 cases were completely cured and classified as ACPR (88.8%, 95% CI 79.7-94.7) and 9 cases showed recurrent infection at days 35 and 42, and classified as LTF. In Sumatra, of the 751 subjects screened, 35 vivax subjects enrolled, 34 completed the 42 day follow up. Thirty-three cases were completely cured and classified as ACPR (97.1%, 95% CI 84.7-99.9) and 1 recurrent infection was observed and classified as LTF. No delay in parasite clearance nor severe adverse reaction was observed. Analysis of the Pfk13 gene in P. falciparum cases from Papua revealed no mutations associated with artemisinin resistance in the 20 SNPs previously reported. Analysis of the Pfpm2 gene at day 0 and day of recurrence in recrudescent cases revealed the same single copy number, whereas 3 of the 4 re-infection cases carried 2-3 Pfpm2 gene copy numbers. Conclusion Treatment of falciparum and vivax malaria cases with DHA-PPQ showed a high efficacy and safety.

TI  - Towards consistent assessments of in situ radiometric measurements for the validation of fluorescence satellite missions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The upcoming Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) satellite mission aims to provide high quality radiometric measurements for subsequent retrieval of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). The combination of SIF with other observations stemming from the FLEX/Sentinel-3 tandem mission holds the potential to assess complex ecosystem processes. The calibration and validation (cal/val) of these radiometric measurements and derived products are central but challenging components of the mission. This contribution outlines strategies for the assessment of in situ radiometric measurements and retrieved SIF. We demonstrate how in situ spectrometer measurements can be analysed in terms of radiometric, spectral and spatial uncertainties. The analysis of more than 200 k spectra yields an average bias between two radiometric measurements by two individual spectrometers of 8%, with a larger variability in measurements of downwelling radiance (25%) compared to upwelling radiance (6%). Spectral shifts in the spectrometer relevant for SIF retrievals are consistently below 1 spectral pixel (up to 0.75). Found spectral shifts appear to be mostly dependent on temperature (as measured by a temperature probe in the instrument). Retrieved SIF shows a low variability of 1.8% compared with a noise reduced SIF estimate based on APAR. A combination of airborne imaging and in situ non-imaging fluorescence spectroscopy highlights the importance of a homogenous sampling surface and holds the potential to further uncover SIF retrieval issues as here shown for early evening acquisitions. Our experiments clearly indicate the need for careful site selection, measurement protocols, as well as the need for harmonized processing. This work thus contributes to guiding cal/val activities for the upcoming FLEX mission.

TI  - Spatio-temporal changes in radar zones and ELA estimation of glaciers in NyAlesund using Sentinel-1 SAR
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A total of 15 glaciers in the Ny-Alesund region were studied for their glacier radar zones vis-a-vis ELA over the period 2016-2020, using the multi-seasonal SAR data. All the glaciers were comprised of three zones, namely middle percolation/wet snow, lower percolation/wet snow, and clean ice. Using the anomalies of temperature and precipitation derived from Ny Alesund meteorological station, it is observed that the ELA for most of the glaciers shifted to a higher altitude during 2016-2018 when the temperature was slightly high as compared to the long term mean, while it shifted down the glacier due to heavy accumulation and low temperature during 2019-20. The maximum shift of +/- 25 (with an uncertainty of +/- 6.85 m arising out of remote sensing data) in ELA, was detected during 2016-2020. These results obtained using geospatial technology-based analysis are provided for assessing the impact of climate change on the behaviour of the glaciers.

TI  - Revisiting Antarctic sea-ice decadal variability since 1980
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-ice extent (SIE) satellite data has been stored and studied over the past four decades. Antarctica's SIE has recently attained both its maximum (2014) and its minimum (2017) values, which raised questions regarding how SIE variability is evolving. Here we discuss a new approach to improve our understanding of SIE variability for the 1982-1993 and 2006-2017 periods. Using a probability density function and examining the mean and standard deviation of SIE distributions as a function of seasonality. Results show that the whole Southern Ocean presented both mean and standard deviation growth in all seasons. The largest SIE distribution difference for Southern Ocean between 1982-1993 and 2006-2017 periods was observed in July, August and September (JAS), during which all individual Sea sectors presented growth of the SIE mean. Not only different Sea sectors showed different variations, but the SIE data distributions from the same Sea sector yielded different changes with differing seasons. January, February and March (JFM) together with April, May and June were the seasons with the largest SIE decadal variability for Weddell, Indian, Amundsen and West Pacific Sea Sectors, while the Ross Sea showed greater SIE variability during JAS and October November, December. This methodology showed consistent results with the traditional SIE trend calculation and introduced a new quantification index for evaluating the differences between two distributions not necessarily connected in time.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF THE VELOCITY CHANGES OF THE JAKOBSHAVN GLACIER BASED ON SAR IMAGERY
T2  - QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study analyzes the changes in dynamics of the Jakobshavn Glacier in summer and winter in 2017 and 2021. Satellite radar observations and the available database were used for this. Moreover, the influence of the time baseline between SAR images on the quality of the results was also investigated. The velocities computed from Sentinel-1 images and the offset-tracking technique were compared with the MEaSUREs database information. The results showed that jakobshavn Glacier accelerated in 2021 up to 39.0 m d(-1). However, this value may be underestimated due to the resolution of Sentinel-1 data. The results therefore confirm the acceleration of the glacier melting process, which may be a result of the observed climate changes on our planet.

TI  - Data-driven automatic labelling of land cover classes from remotely sensed images
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the developing technology and automation, automatic labelling of images is of great importance for automatic mapping. However, the most significant disadvantage of this method is that the classes' labels cannot be generated automatically. In the current remote sensing literature, understanding and automatically labelling clusters obtained from the clustering process without a training phase is a problem that requires effective solutions. In this study, in order to solve this problem, we present a methodology that creates labels without any training phase. We use the bands in the image and Corine data in this process. The methodology uses a database created by examining the spectral characteristics of land classes from sample images collected from various geographies and time periods. The spectral index values of the unlabelled classes obtained are evaluated using this database, and the relevant label is assigned to each class. This database was created by analyzing Sentinel-2 Level-1 images of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea regions in Turkey. Then, these labels compare with the Corine classes corresponds to each pixel according to the ruleset. This developed approach aims to automatically label land, a green agricultural area, forest, urban area, and uncultivated agricultural area. The reason for choosing these areas is that they are the areas that generally make up the environment and a large part of the ecosystem, which are important areas that many researchers frequently use in their studies. The methodology developed was tested with Sentinel 2 images of Gemlik, Hatay regions from Turkey, and Agioi Apostoli region from Greece. The results of the accuracy analysis are 80%, 83%, and %82 for Gemlik, Hatay, and Agioi Apostoli areas.

TI  - Spectral indices for estimating total dissolved solids in freshwater wetlands using semi-empirical models. A case study of Guartinaja and Momil wetlands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is one of the most important and abundant resources on earth; therefore, determining easier and more accurate methods of measuring water quality has become challenging in recent years. Images of the Sentinel-2 multispectral (MSI) sensor and field measurements for three seasons and 39 spectral indices were evaluated to identify those that can be used as patterns for the generation of semi-empirical bio-optical models to predict the total dissolved solids (TDS) in surface water of freshwater wetlands. The Guartinaja and Momil wetlands, located in the Wetland Complex of Bajo Sinu, Northern Colombia, were used as references in the field. The individual bands of the Sentinel 2 MSI sensor and the spectral indices derived from these bands were tested (and will be referred to in this paper as spectral indices). They were classified as follows: 10 individual spectral bands of the MSI sensor of the Sentinel 2 satellite; 11 indices reported by the literature to determine water, vegetation, or soils; 11 indices reported to estimate salinity; and 7 to estimate total dissolved solids and proposed in this research. The indices were evaluated based on three exclusive conditions: 1) the correlation between the TDS values measured in the field and indices spectral values >0.7 for at least two sampling seasons; 2) for the three seasons, the regression models derived from the indices have a determination coefficient >0.7; and 3) the spatial correlation matrix between the images derived from the models is >0.8 for at least two out of the three analysis seasons. We achieved important results: 1) seven indices (B3, Brightness-3, SI-3, SI-5, Ferdous-2020, TDS-1, and TDS5) met the three conditions proposed above and therefore, they were preliminarily defined as patterns for estimating TDS in the selected wetlands; 2) Additionally, this research provided two new efficient indices for calculating TDS through bio-optical models: TDS-1 and TDS-5. The validation of the regression models derived from these indices indicated a high accuracy of the prediction surfaces, expressed in values <10% of the normalized root-mean-square deviation. The results of this study contribute to the determination of semi-empirical bio-optical models for predicting optically inactive water quality parameters, which are generally predicted with empirical models whose use is spatiotemporally limited. Additionally, the research contributions that are carried out to improve the methods of evaluating water quality from remote sensing products become investigations that positively impact the evaluation of water resources, especially in geographical locations in which there is no with sufficient financial resources for on-site sampling.

TI  - Remote sensing wattle rust induced defoliation across black wattle timber plantations in Southern Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection and monitoring of lethal pathogenic funguses are important for effectively deploying suppressive measures to sudden and severe outbreaks in plantation forestry. This study successfully investigated the utility of Landsat 8 multispectral satellite imagery to map Uromycladium acacia (wattle rust) induced canopy defoliation across black wattle plantations. The framework developed for the provincial assessment of rust damage proved to be effective by using data collected from field monitoring plots over the year 2015 and 2016. Using a powerful Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) approach, rust occurrences were mapped at accuracies of 69% for March and 72% for November when using the 2015 dataset and 77% for March and 81% for November using the 2016 dataset. Individual class accuracies for varying levels of defoliation were also evaluated. When aggregating the field and image datasets, a two-year probability map revealed the likelihood of rust defoliation across the black wattle plantation region. Overall, the study showcased the robustness and cost-effectiveness of using multispectral remote sensing methodologies for repeatable forest health monitoring in key commercial forest plantations.

TI  - Initial experience with targeted axillary dissection after neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) combines sentinel node biopsy (SNB) with the removal of the previously marked metastatic node. TAD is a promising concept for axillary restaging in node-positive breast cancer patients with pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). We aimed to evaluate TAD feasibility in this context. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in biopsy-confirmed cN1 patients. The removal of the clipped node (CN) was guided by intraoperative ultrasound. SNB used indocyanine green and patent blue V dye. If the CN or sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) had any metastatic foci, or the TAD procedure was unsuccessful, the patient underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Results Thirty-seven patients were included. TAD and SNB identification rates were 97.3%. Every retrieved CN was also a SLN. At the individual level, SNB identification rate was 89.2% with indocyanine green and 85.5% with patent blue V dye. The CN identification rate was 81.1%, being higher when the CN was localized on the intraoperative ultrasound (84.4% vs 60.0%). Nodal pCR was achieved by 54.1% of our patients and was more frequent in HER2-positive and triple-negative tumors (p = 0.039). Nineteen patients were spared from ALND. Conclusion TAD with intraoperative ultrasound-guided excision of the CN and SNB with indocyanine green and patent blue V dye is a feasible concept to identify patients without axillary residual disease after NAT, that can be spared from ALND, although the need for marking the biopsied node should be further investigated.

TI  - Change detection-based co-seismic landslide mapping through extended morphological profiles and ensemble strategy
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Co-seismic landslide mapping after earthquake event is essential for emergency rescue, geohazard prevention, and post-disaster reconstruction. Most co-seismic landslide mapping is primarily achieved via field surveys or visual interpretation of remote sensing images. However, such methods are highly labor-intensive and timeconsuming, particularly over large areas. This paper proposed an automated co-seismic landslide mapping approach, which has three main advantages compared to state-of-the-art methods. First, it removes the dependence on the manual labeling for training samples through an unsupervised change detection process. Second, the approach takes the lead in introducing multi-scale extended morphological profiles to comprehensively describe the characteristics of various landslides induced by earthquake. Third, it is also the first attempt to employ ensemble strategy in landslide identification, which integrates the advantages of different machine learning-based classifiers, further improving the accuracy of recognition. Three experiments were carried out through multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope images acquired in China and Haiti. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach compared to other methods, providing an effective solution for complicated co-seismic landslide mapping task in the future.

TI  - Estimation of maize plant height in North China by means of backscattering coefficient and depolarization parameters using Sentinel-1 dual-pol SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR parameters have been used many times to characterize crops. However, it was found that the scattering mechanisms derived from quad-pol SAR were different from that of the dual-pol SAR data. The objective of this study is to better understand the scattering mechanism of the maize field to dual-pol (VV, VH) SAR data and propose a new radar vegetation index to improve the inversion accuracy of the crop height. We first analyzed the temporal variation of SAR parameters before the maize height stopped increasing. It showed that the sensitivity of SAR parameters to the plant height was strong in the early stage, but the correlation became weak later. Then, according to the scattering mechanism of the maize field to the dual pol (VV, VH) SAR data, we combined use of the backscattering coefficient of sigma 0VH and the depolarization parameter proposed the mPRVI index. In this paper, the simple linear regression model was used to fit the six parameters separately to estimation the plant height, including sigma 0VH (R = 0.84), VIRatio (R = 0.82), RVI (R = 0.83), DOD+RVI (R = 0.85), PRVI (R = 0.86) and mPRVI (R = 0.88), which showed a relatively high Pearson correlation coefficient (R) with the plant height. According to adjusted coefficient of determination R2 (0.70, 0.70, 0.71, 0.74, 0.76, 0.80) and RMSE (62.8 cm, 62.7 cm, 61.8 cm, 57.5 cm, 56.3 cm, 51.2 cm) for sigma 0VH, VIRatio, RVI, DOD+RVI, PRVI, mPRVI, respectively, the mPRVI index outperforms other parameters throughout the maize growing season. And this outperformance is not only manifested in the early growth stage of the maize, but also in the later stage before the plant height stopped increasing.

TI  - U-Net feature fusion for multi-class semantic segmentation of urban fabrics from Sentinel-2 imagery: an application on Grand Est Region, France
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas are increasing since several years as a result of development of built-up areas, network infrastructure, industrial areas or other built-up areas. This urban sprawl has a considerable impact on natural areas by changing the functioning of ecosystems. Mapping and monitoring Urban Fabrics (UF) is therefore relevant for urban planning and management, risk analysis, human health or biodiversity. For this research, Sentinel-2 (level 2A) single-date images of the East of France, with a high spatial resolution (10 m), are used to assess two semantic segmentation networks (U-Net) that we combined using feature fusion between a from scratch network and a pre-trained network on ImageNet. Moreover three spectral or textural indices have been added to the both networks in order to improve the classification results. The results showed a performance gain for the fusion methods in classifying several UF. However, there is a difference in performance depending on the urbanization gradient; highly urbanized areas provide a better distinction of some UF's classes than rural areas.

TI  - Evaluating the different responses to climatic factors between snow water equivalent and snow cover area in the Central Tianshan Mountains
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine snow is an important part of the water cycle in arid/semiarid regions and has a great influence on runoff and ecosystems. In this study, both optical and passive microwave remote sensing data were used to characterize the vertical distribution of snow cover area (SCA) and snow water equivalent (SWE) on the north slope of Central Tianshan Mountain, northwest China, focusing on exploring the different spatial-temporal characteristics between SCA and SWE, as well as their different responses to climatic factors at different altitudes. The results show that (1) the SCA and SWE have similar vertical distribution characteristics but show different changing rates and changing directions over time at different altitudes. (2) In the snow accumulation period and snowmelt period, the correlation relationships between precipitation/temperature and SCA are the same (positive or negative) as those between precipitation/temperature and SWE at low-middle altitudes but opposite at high altitudes. (3) The influence of precipitation/temperature on SWE has a linear relationship with altitude but not with SCA. (4) The relative importance of precipitation/temperature for SCA is the same as that for SWE at different altitudes. The results illustrated the different vertical responses to climatic factors between SCA and SWE, which could be beneficial to predicting the changes in mountain snow under the climate change scenario.

TI  - Performance of spectral indices for soil properties: a case study from Redland farm, south Florida
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Proximate interpretation of soil properties is essential for sustainable agriculture, demonstrating this for a possum trot farm located in South Florida, Miami Dade County (MDC), known for diverse agronomic regions over the decade. In this work, we explore the capabilities of multispectral images (Sentinel 2A and Landsat 8) for accessing the dynamic soil properties of the study site. The predefined combinations of spectral band values (spectral indices) of Sentinel 2A and Landsat 8 image on the study area were used for evaluation. The correlation coefficient and linear regression models were demonstrated to assess the relationship between the derived spectral indices and five topsoil properties (Bulk Density (BD), Soil Organic Matter (SOM), Electric Conductivity (EC), pH, and Water Content). The results illustrated that specific soil properties (SOM, EC, pH, and BD) correlated well with different spectral indices with both images. Eight spectral bands combinations were found good with three soil properties with maximum correlation coefficient (R = 0.623) for Sentinel 2A, and Landsat 8 has maximum correlation coefficient (R = 0.463) of three spectral indices for two soil properties. The influence of distinct spectral bands of multispectral satellite images in soil surface properties involved in the best-suited indices algorithms was discussed in this article. Overall, we found that the spectral indices demonstrated promising results for this study, and hence they can be accounted for in soil investigation in agriculture.

TI  - Estimating the winter wheat harvest index with canopy hyperspectral remote sensing data based on the dynamic fraction of post-anthesis phase biomass accumulation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based crop harvest index (HI) information is of great significance for crop yield estimation, crop variety breeding and evaluation of crop cultivation effectiveness. The method for estimating HI using f ( G ) (fraction of post-anthesis phase biomass accumulation) has been widely used and shows good performance at the field scale, but the upscaled regional application of this method had not been achieved using remote sensing information. In this paper, a remote sensing method for estimating the dynamic harvest index (D-HI) based on the remote sensing-based dynamic f ( G ) (D-f ( G )) was proposed to solve this problem and was verified based on D-f ( G ) and D-HI measurements. This approach was based on accurate D-f ( G ) parameters estimated by using the NDSI constructed from hyperspectral sensitive band centres. The results showed that the D-f ( G ) estimation, the overall verification accuracy of the D-HI estimation at different growth stages and the accuracy of the D-HI estimation in a single growth stage were highly accurate. In the overall D-HI estimation verification, the normalized root square mean error (NRMSE) was between 10.83% and 14.45%, and the mean relative error (MRE) was between 9.62% and 13.99%. At maturity, the D-HI estimation accuracy based on band centre lambda (732 nm, 834 nm) was the highest, and the NRMSE and MRE were 9.62% and 9.27%, respectively. Based on these results, the proposed method is feasible and effective at accurately estimating the D-HI, thus providing a technical reference for the use of satellite remote sensing data to obtain regional crop HI information based on f ( G ).

TI  - Identification of construction and demolition waste based on change detection and deep learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the gradual adjustment of urban expansion and discontinuation of non-essential functions in Beijing, many decades-old buildings have been demolished. Thus, construction and demolition waste (CDW) has become the focus of urban and dust pollution management. However, CDW piles are volatile and present irregular boundaries. Therefore, it is essential to map CDW regions in a timely and accurate manner to achieve urban development while protecting the environment. To address this issue, we proposed a method of CDW identification based on change detection and deep learning. First, ZY-3 multispectral images from 2016 and 2019 and their difference images were used for initial sample preparation. We expanded the samples using the post-classification comparison method of change detection, resulting in a 25.4% increase in the valid sample set. The expanded samples were then used as an input to the DeepLabV3+ for training. Thereafter, combined with the change information from the digital elevation model, specific forms, such as demolition remains, landfill CDW, and large-scale dump, were extracted using spatial analysis methods. The overall accuracy of CDW recognition was 91.67%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.8642. In addition, we calculated the accuracy indices using only the initial samples, obtaining a mean Intersection-over-Union value that was 0.086 lower than that obtained using the expanded sample set. Similar results were obtained in PSPNet and UNet. This suggests that change detection is useful in improving the accuracy of the deep learning models. This study is the first to identify three existing forms of CDW and can effectively address the misclassification between CDW and bare land to identify CDW efficiently.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of landscape pattern and structure in the Greater Bay Area, China
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape fragmentation and structural changes are associated with spatial ecological and social processes. Landscape fragmentation modeling and land use distribution analysis provide a framework within which landscape pattern and structure can be studied and quantified. The Greater Bay Area (GBA) is one of the fastest growing urban agglomeration in China and due to the speedy socioeconomic development and urban expansion, the landscape became more diverse, fragmented, and complex in land use, structure, and shape. This study analyses the spatiotemporal variations in landscape pattern and structure in the Greater Bay Area based on the 40 years' time-series remote sensing data (19802020), fragmentation modeling, and structure change analysis. We used the fragmentation analysis at category and patch level and analyzed the fragmentation over forest, cropland, and grassland. We further employed the economic model of spatial Lorenz Curve and Gini Index for estimating the distribution of land use land cover (LULC) categories and structure changes. The results indicated that the landscape pattern indices of Greater Bay Area as whole, and its eleven cities had an obvious variations and diversity during 1980 to 2020. However, the diffusion and coalescence processes in each city follow distinct patterns. Due to the anthropogenic modifications, the landscape pattern and structural complexity increased gradually during the study period.

TI  - Parametric building forms rationalizing the incident direct solar irradiation
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents an innovative procedure that allows for an analysis of the influence of the shape and mutual arrangement of external building partitions on the amount of the direct solar irradiation incident on these partitions during a heating season. The conducted analysis related interdisciplinary issues in the field of solar radiation, unconventional forms of buildings and artificial neural networks. The developed algorithm made it possible to obtain a relationship between the general building form and the amount of their radiation falling on the facade walls and roof of the examined building type. The developed artificial network allows the above irradiation to be calculated during the changes in the geometrical characteristics of the utilized type of buildings and design of effective building forms and rational arrangements of their external solar partitions. The satellite data and online tools published on the website of the European Commission are used. The practicable ranges of the relative changes in the amount of the incident direct irradiation and the corresponding values of the independent variables defining the considered building forms are given, which is an important hint for the application of the obtained results in the design and further research works on more complex relationships.

TI  - Impact of soil types on sugarcane development monitored over time by remote sensing
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil is one of the most important factors for agricultural production. In tropical regions, soil variability is considerable, with the most diverse combinations of physical and chemical characteristics, an influence factor in crop growth and productivity. In this research, the main objective was to identify how soil characteristics and parent material can influence sugarcane development over time using remote sensing. An area located in Sao Paulo, Brazil, of 182 ha (one point per ha with soil analysis), with high variability in the parent material and soil types, was selected. Images from the Sentinel2-MSI satellite were used to describe the spectral behavior of sugarcane over a period of one year. The NDRE (normalized difference red-edge index) was calculated for each image and then the leaf area index (LAI) was obtained from it. Maps of soil classes, soil properties at two depths (0-0.20 and 0.80-1.0 m), and parent material classes were related to sugarcane LAI variability over time. Production environment zones, which is a classification based on soil characteristics to support sugarcane development, were also obtained and related to LAI variability. Spectral signatures of the crop presented different behaviors through the season, soil types and soil attributes provided useful responses for this variability. At the beginning of the season, the surface and subsurface soil properties (texture and fertility) impacted differently on crop development. On the other hand, soil classes and parent material influenced LAI in all production environments studied. The results indicated that the soil types and their properties at different depths have a significant impact on sugarcane development. Furthermore, RS was able to monitor the plant evolution and be related to soil types which may assist in plant management. The results can bring light on how better sugarcane management can be conducted using remote sensing data and soils variability.

TI  - Progressive spatiotemporal image fusion with deep neural networks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal image fusion (STIF) provides a feasible and effective solution for generating satellite images with high spatial and temporal resolution. As deep learning-based fusion algorithms show great potential in generating high-quality images, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely a deep progressive spatiotemporal fusion network (DPSTFN), which is coupled with pansharpening and super-resolution learning processes to satisfy requirements of STIF based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat data. First, a pansharpening process is adopted to make full use of two MODIS bands with 250 m spatial resolution. Second, a super-resolution process enhances the spatial information that existed in coarse-resolution images to alleviate the enormous spatial resolution gap between MODIS and Landsat images. Third, combining the aforementioned two auxiliary processes, a progressive spatiotemporal fusion framework is proposed to generate deliberate and robust fusion results. Experiments are conducted using two MODIS-Landsat datasets of distinctive landforms to evaluate the performance of DPSTFN. The results of the subjective and objective evaluation show that our proposed network performs better than the state-of-the-art traditional STIF algorithms Fit-FC and RASTFM, and the deep learning-based algorithms EDCSTFN and StfNet.

T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural sector, the largest and least efficient water user, is facing important challenges in sustaining food production and careful water use. The objective of this study is to improve farm and irrigation district water use efficiency by developing an operational procedure for smart irrigation and optimizing the exact water use and relative water productivity. The SIM (smart irrigation monitoring and forecasting) optimization irrigation strategy, based on soil moisture (SM) and crop stress thresholds, was implemented in the Chiese (North Italy) and Capitanata (South Italy) Irrigation Consortia. The system is based on the energy-water balance model FEST-EWB (Flashflood Event-based Spatially distributed rainfall runoff Transformation Energy-Water Balance model), which was pixelwise calibrated with remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST), with mean areal absolute errors of approximately 3 degrees C, and then validated against local measured SM and latent heat flux (LE) with RMSE values of approximately 0.07 and 40 Wm(-2), respectively. The effect of the optimization strategy was evaluated on the reductions in irrigation volume and on the different timing, from approximately 500 mm over the crop season in the Capitanata area to approximately 1000 mm in the Chiese district, as well as on cumulated drainage and ET fluxes. The irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) indicator appears to be higher when applying the SIM strategy than when applying the traditional irrigation strategy: greater than 35% for the tomato fields in southern Italy and 80% for maize fields in northern Italy.

TI  - MFGAN: multi feature guided aggregation network for remote sensing image
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image change detection is an important technology in remote sensing data analysis. Existing mainstream solutions are divided into supervised and unsupervised solutions. Among supervised methods, most remote sensing image change methods based on deep learning are related to semantic segmentation. However, these methods only use deep learning model to extract and process single-level information of the image, and do not separately train the changed and unchanged areas according to the task characteristics of change detection. Also this model do not aggregate the deep and shallow-level feature information, so many local change details cannot be detected. This paper proposes a multilateral feature-guided aggregation network. The network firstly extracts the whole information, the changed area information and the unchanged area information of remote sensing image through the main network and two auxiliary networks: difference network and assimilation network. Then, the whole information of the image is aggregated with the changed and unchanged region information by feature aggregation network (all subnetworks are composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)). The proposed method is end-to-end trainable, and each component in the network does not need to be trained separately.

TI  - Damage detection on a historic iron bridge using satellite DInSAR data
T2  - STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) allows tracking the structural behavior in time and support decisions regarding, for instance, the need for maintenance and repair activities. Most traditional SHM systems require sensors that are directly applied to the structure to get insights into the structural performance. Satellite technologies can provide an appealing alternative to traditional SHM. They allow to measure displacements at a large scale and to follow their evolution without the need of directly accessing the structure. Further to this, the possibility to monitor large areas opens new avenues for the development of automatic alert systems able to issue an alarm and early-flag damaged structures. However, displacements of civil structures might also be induced by sources other than damage such as thermal or periodic hydrogeological variations. These can hinder the onset and development of damage or lead to false alarms if such displacements are erroneously interpreted as damages. This paper aims to present a new method for damage detection based on DInSAR measurements, that tackles both aspects providing reliable information about the onset of damage under environmentally changing conditions in a period corresponding to about twice the revisit time of the satellite. A case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, namely the Palatino bridge in Rome, Italy. The satellite data are acquired by COSMO-SkyMed of the Italian Space Agency and consist of displacements of the observed structure recorded during a period spanning between 2011 and 2019.

TI  - Beyond pixels: Learning from multimodal hyperspectral superpixels for land cover classification
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite tons of advanced classification models that have recently been developed for the land cover mapping task, the monotonicity of a single remote sensing data source, such as only using hyperspectral data or multispectral data, hinders the classification accuracy from being further improved and tends to meet the performance bottleneck. For this reason, we develop a novel superpixel-based subspace learning model, called Supace, by jointly learning multimodal feature representations from HS and MS superpixels for more accurate LCC results. Supace can learn a common subspace across multimodal RS data, where the diverse and complementary information from different modalities can be better combined, being capable of enhancing the discriminative ability of to-be-learned features in a more effective way. To better capture semantic information of objects in the feature learning process, superpixels that beyond pixels are regarded as the study object in our Supace for LCC. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two popular hyperspectral and multispectral datasets, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed Supace in the land cover classification task compared with several well-known baselines related to multimodal remote sensing image feature learning.

TI  - Morphodynamics of a meandering channel over decadal timescales in response to hydrological variations
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article addresses a major theme in fluvial geomorphology on which Professor Ken Gregory contributed much pioneering research, that of quantitative relations of morphological change to discharge variations. It examines the morphodynamics and processes of adjustment of river channels to flow characteristics on event to decadal timescales, using field and remote sensing data collected over a 40-year period for a very active meandering reach of the River Bollin, northwest England. The free meandering and rapid rates of changes provide insight into response timescales and processes. Morphological variations and rates of change are analysed in relation to peak flow parameters. The results show that the sinuosity has continuously increased since a resetting of the planform by multiple cutoffs in 2001, this autogenic trend underlying the effects of flow events. Width of the channel has varied by 50% between map dates, corresponding to discharge characteristics of each 6-year period and integrating the impacts of individual events. A trend of decrease in intensity of erosion and deposition and of narrowing for the period 2001-2019 is apparent and may be an indication of the recovery and adjustment time to the major morphological changes in 2001. Other possible influences include decline in sediment supply but no obvious external cause is identified. A feedback effect of lower process rates producing less sediment from banks which decreases rates of channel movement may be occurring. A major contributor to the process rate decline and narrowing could be an increase in riparian vegetation cover. Complex sequences of change between peak flow events emerge, unrelated to discharge magnitude or numbers of peak events, and a process of basal bank sedimentation followed by upper bank deposition is evident. Channel capacity varies by up to 30% year to year, which has major implications for variability of flood risk and floodplain inundation.

TI  - Calibration of an evapotranspiration algorithm in a semiarid sagebrush steppe using a 3-ha lysimeter and Landsat normalized difference vegetation index data
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semiarid environments, evapotranspiration (ET) is the primary discharge component in the water balance, with potential ET exceeding precipitation. For this reason, reliable estimates of ET are needed to construct accurate water budgets in these environments. Remote sensing affords the ability to provide fast, accurate, field-scale ET estimates, but these methods have largely been restricted to deep rooted (phreatophytic) plant communities underlain by shallow groundwater. We used 13 years of data from a 3-ha drainage lysimeter in a semiarid sagebrush steppe and Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to calibrate a generalized least squares model capable of predicting vadose zone ET in a high elevation upland ecosystem. Annual precipitation was the best predictor of annual ET, as they were nearly balanced every year analysed (mean difference = 3 mm). We incorporated reference crop ET and a linear combination of NDVI and precipitation to capably predict ET on a subannual, lag-determined interval of 48 days, with a mean error of only 9.92% across all observations. To our knowledge, this is the first vegetation index-ET algorithm calibrated in a semiarid upland plant community using field-scale lysimetry. Vadose zone ET is particularly important at waste disposal sites in the Desert Southwest, where accurate and spatially explicit ET estimates are needed for monitoring potential mobilization and transport of contaminants past the root zone into local aquifers and for monitoring and modelling effects of recharge on flow and transport of contaminants in underlying aquifers.

TI  - What lies beneath: Vertical temperature heterogeneity in a Mediterranean woodland savanna
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the availability of satellite and airborne thermal infrared remote sensing (TIR-RS) data increases and their spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions improve, researchers are finding diverse applications for TIR-RS measurements. TIR-RS is now commonly applied in regional- and continental-scale analyses, such as those focused on fire and surface energy balance. However, its application lags in plant physiology and ecology, for which a finer-scale understanding of plant canopy temperatures would be useful to elucidate plant water dynamics, for example. In particular, while methods to disaggregate TIR-RS pixels in horizontal space have advanced, possible vertical stratification of plant canopy temperature and its implications for understanding the correspondence between TIR-RS and finer-scale, field-based thermal measurements (e.g. made with a thermal camera) remain unexplored. Here, we use data from a thermal camera deployed concurrently with the recent ECOSTRESS mission to quantify vertical temperature gradients within tree canopies and temperatures of overvs. under-story plants in a Mediterranean woodland savanna. We then leverage diverse ancillary data to maximize the geometric comparability of ECOSTRESS and thermal camera measurements, in order to assess the extent to which the two forms of thermal measurements correspond. Specifically, we ask: (1) What are the patterns of intra-canopy and over- vs. under-story vertical temperature in a Mediterranean woodland savanna?, and (2) How can vertically-resolved, but spatially-limited field-based temperature measurements be reconciled with spatiallyextensive, but surface-only, temperature measurements of a space-borne remote sensor? We found consistent patterns of vertical thermal heterogeneity both within tree canopies and between ecosystem over- and understories. The daytime difference between the top and bottom thirds of blue oak canopies was, on average, 0.48 degrees C - and sometimes several times larger. Notably, canopy tops are cooler, likely associated with the understory grass reaching daytime temperatures often exceeding over-story temperatures by 10 degrees C. Given the consistency of the intra-canopy temperature gradients, we expected the ECOSTRESS sensor would be in better agreement with camera measurements of canopy tops than bulk canopies or canopy bottoms. However, withincanopy gradients were overwhelmed by other sources of disagreement between the measurements, in part associated with upscaling camera measurements across space. Overall, thermal camera and ECOSTRESS measurements were largely in agreement at night (pixel RMSE = 1.1 degrees C), but they were more divergent during times of low (but >0 W/m2) and high incoming solar radiation (daytime pixel RMSE = 3.5 degrees C).

AB  - Understanding global perspectives and international cultures is important because of increasing global mobility, digital connections, and national chauvinism. As students engage with diverse others in schools and online, they need global, critical, and ethical understandings of language, literacy, and culture. From a critical cosmopolitan lens, language and literacy educators guide students to develop a cosmopolitan worldview; dismantle hierarchies through reading, writing, and thinking; and take action for justice worldwide. The purpose of this article is to converge cosmopolitanism, critical pedagogy, and teacher perceptions to construct a framework for teaching critical cosmopolitan literacies. The findings suggest five dimensions of critical cosmopolitan literacies: proximal stance, reflexive stance, reciprocal stance, responsive stance, and praxis. Overall, participants held positive views of infusing cosmopolitan dispositions and global perspectives in their classrooms and reported success with integrating global literature, structuring discussions to promote empathy, and implementing inquiry to connect local and global issues.

TI  - Early- and in-season crop type mapping without current-year ground truth: Generating labels from historical information via a topology-based approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification in remote sensing is often faced with the challenge of limited ground truth labels. Incorporating historical ground information has the potential to significantly lower the expensive cost associated with collecting ground truth and, more importantly, enable early-and in-season mapping that is helpful to many pre-harvest decisions. In this study, we propose a new approach that can effectively transfer knowledge about the topology (i.e. relative position) of different crop types in the spectral feature space (e.g. the histogram of SWIR1 vs RDEG1 bands) to generate labels, thereby supporting crop classification in a different year. Importantly, our approach does not attempt to transfer classification decision boundaries that are susceptible to inter-annual variations of weather and management, but relies on the more robust and shift-invariant topology information. We tested this approach for mapping corn/soybeans in the US Midwest, paddy rice/corn/soybeans in Northeast China and multiple crops in Northern France using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data. Results show that our approach automatically generates high-quality labels for crops in the target year immediately after each image becomes available. Based on these generated labels from our approach, the subsequent crop type mapping using a random forest classifier can reach the F1 score as high as 0.887 for corn as early as the silking stage and 0.851 for soybean as early as the flowering stage and the overall accuracy of 0.873 in the test state of Iowa. In Northeast China, F1 scores of paddy rice, corn and soybeans and the overall accuracy can exceed 0.85 two and half months ahead of harvest. In the Hauts-de-France region, the OA of multiple crop mapping could reach 0.837 based on labels generated from our approach. Overall, these results highlight the unique advantages of our approach in transferring historical knowledge and maximizing the timeliness of crop maps. Our approach supports a general paradigm shift towards learning transferrable and generalizable knowledge to facilitate land cover classification.

TI  - Class-guided coupled dictionary learning for multispectral-hyperspectral remote sensing image collaborative classification
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The fine classification of large-scale scenes is becoming more and more important in optical remote sensing applications. As two kinds of typical optical remote sensing data, multispectral images (MSIs) and hyperspectral images (HSIs) have complementary characteristics. The MSI has a large swath and short revisit period, but the number of bands is limited with low spectral resolution, leading to weak separability of between class spectra. Compared with MSI, HSI has hundreds of bands and each of them is narrow in bandwidth, which enable it to have the ability of fine classification, but too long in aspects of revisit period. To make efficient use of their combined advantages, multispectral-hyperspectral remote sensing image collaborative classification has become one of hot topics in remote sensing. To deal with the collaborative classification, most of current methods are unsupervised and only consider the HSI reconstruction as the objective. In this paper, a class-guided coupled dictionary learning method is proposed, which is obviously distinguished from the current methods. Specifically, the proposed method utilizes the labels of training samples to construct discriminative sparse representation coefficient error and classification error as regularization terms, so as to enforce the learned coupled dictionaries to be both representational and discriminative. The learned coupled dictionaries facilitate pixels from the same category have similar sparse represent coefficients, while pixels from different categories have different sparse represent coefficients. The experiments on three pairs of HSI and MSI have shown better classification performance.

TI  - Diagnostic of the massive flood event and flood hazard mapping in Tons River basin
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study diagnoses the Satna flood event in the Tons River basin. The occurrence of this intense flood is attributed to the rainfall associated with the movement of the monsoon depression during the peak monsoon season. The study uses Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model to examine the origin, movement, and dissipation of the monsoon depression over India. The study also incorporates remote sensing techniques and field campaigns to better understand the impact on the areas. The model captures the origin of the monsoon depression and the highest precipitating days fairly well. However, it underestimates the rainfall magnitude with respect to different observations due to the limited ability of the model to capture the rainfall maxima spatially. Moreover, the conditional instability of the second kind (CISK) mechanism seems to drive the monsoon depression. A positive feedback mechanism is observed along the track of the depression between rainfall and convective activity leading to excess rainfall over the Tons basin. The remote-sensing-based analysis using Landsat 8 products shows that around 1309 km(2) area of the Tons basin was inundated during the event. Based on the computed Flood Hazard Index values, the entire basin has been divided into the low, medium, high, and very high flood hazard zones with several affected hamlets 19, 178, 155, and 91, respectively. The flood hazard values are important for the planners to adopt appropriate adaptation and mitigation to minimize the impact of future flooding in the basin.

TI  - Field-level crop yield estimation with PRISMA and Sentinel-2
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite image data deliver consistent and frequent information for crop yield estimation over large areas. Hyperspectral narrowbands are more sensitive spectrally to changes in crop growth than multispectral broad bands but few studies quantified the gains in the former over the later. The PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) mission offers narrow (<= 10 nm) band capability across the full optical range. The multispectral broadband Sentinel-2 mission carries four experimental red-edge and near infrared (NIR) hyper spectral narrow (<= 20 nm) bands. We compared the performance of PRISMA and Sentinel-2 spectral bands at important phases of crop development (vegetative, reproductive, maturity) in estimating field-level biomass and yield for corn, rice, soybean, and wheat. We selected three data-driven methods: two-band vegetation indices (TBVIs), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and random forest (RF). The PRISMA and Sentinel-2 models on average explained approximately 20% more variability in biomass and yield with RF than TBVIs and PLSR. The mean RMSE of the PRISMA RF models was 0.42 and 0.17 kg m(-2), which was lower than the Sentinel-2 RF models (0.48 and 0.18 kg m(-2)). Multidate image (seasonal) model performance was generally higher than single-date image model performance. PRISMA shortwave infrared narrowbands and Sentinel-2 red-edge and near infrared bands were among the top-performing spectral regions. The results highlight potential complementarity between the PRISMA and Sentinel-2 missions for predicting crop biomass and yield. The results also show the benefits, limitations, and pitfalls of hyperspectral imaging in agricultural monitoring, which is important for upcoming operational hyperspectral missions, such as ESA CHIME and NASA Surface Biology and Geology (formerly HysPIRI).

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma using the Brigham and Women's staging system: a cost analysis
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DERMATOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective is to determine the cost-effectiveness of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) according to the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) Tumor Staging system. A decision analysis was utilized to examine costs and outcomes associated with the use of SLNB in patients with high-risk head and neck CSCC. Decision tree outcome probabilities were obtained from published literature. Costs were derived from Medicare reimbursement rates (US$) and effectiveness was represented by quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with a willingness-to-pay set at $100,000 per QALY gained. SLNB was found to be a cost-effective tool for patients with T3 tumors, with an ICER of $18,110.57. Withholding SLNB was the dominant strategy for both T2a and T2b lesions, with ICERs of - $2468.99 and - $16,694.00, respectively. Withholding SLNB remained the dominant strategy when examining immunosuppressed patients with T2a or T2b lesions. In patients with head and neck CSCC, those with T3 or T2b lesions with additional risk factors not accounted for in the staging system alone, may be considered for SLNB, while in other tumor stages it may be impractical. SLNB should only be offered on an individual patient basis.

TI  - Fusing Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data for 10-m dense time-series imagery using a degradation-term constrained deep network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense medium-resolution imagery is essential for fine-scale time-series applications. The combined use of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 can derive 10-m time-series imagery at a nominal temporal resolution of similar to 2.9 days. Specifically, Landsat images can be downscaled to a 10-m resolution by fusing them with temporally adjacent Sentinel-2 images. Current approaches simply use a linear model or a shallow network that is insufficient to obtain the complex mapping between inputs and outputs, and they rarely consider the temporal variation issue, especially for scenes experiencing land cover changes. Facing these limitations, we proposed a degradation-term constrained spatiotemporal fusion network (DSTFN). Technically, a deep network architecture incorporating residual dense blocks and attention mechanism modules is adopted to enhance the feature representation and extraction. A degradation constraint term is embedded into the loss function to maximize the use of the input coarse-resolution image and improve the capability of predicting change. A series of experiments based on two new datasets indicate that DSTFN achieves the best quantitative scores in every test and is thus effective and robust. In 20 resolution-degraded tests, on average, DSTFN decreases the mean relative error by 0.85%-5.35% and increases the peak signal-to-noise ratio 0.97-6.23 relative to baseline approaches. The tests featuring diverse temporal dynamics also confirm the strong generalization ability of DSTFN to deal with land cover change. The proposed network can be used to produce 10-m dense time-series imagery and shows great promise for a variety of time-series analyses and applications. The test materials are expected to be employed as standard datasets for future model assessment.

TI  - Application of meteorological, hydrological and remote sensing data to develop a hybrid index for drought assessment
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a hybrid index called the aggregated drought index (ADI) is developed for drought assessment integrating various meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural features of the region. To this end, precipitation, reservoir storage, discharge, temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and the degree of vegetation based on remote sensing images are utilized to quantify ADI. Then, the performance of two models, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), is investigated in predicting the developed drought index. The proposed framework is applied to the Aharchay watershed located in East Azarbaijan Province, Iran. The results demonstrate that the region has experienced normal and mild drought conditions during the investigated time period. ADI is also applied in another watershed (Ajichay) to show ADI's capability in different climatic settings. Regarding the predictive capability, the ANFIS model outperforms ARIMA in drought prediction, particularly in severe weather conditions. The ADI benefits planning for drought mitigation and preparedness by incorporating several different aspects of the region.

TI  - Single-Port Robotic Inguinal Lymph Node Dissection for Penile Cancer
T2  - UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE Inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) is an essential component in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of penile cancer. Recent advances in minimally invasive surgery may play an important role in decreasing the adverse effects and complications of lymph node dissections. We present our technique utilizing a single-port (SP) robot assisted laparoscopic bilateral ILND in a patient with pT3N2Mx penile cancer s/p partial penectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy.METHODS We present a case of a 64-year-old man who underwent a radical penectomy for previously diagnosed penile cancer. Pathology report showed invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. In accordance with NCCN guidelines, we performed a bilateral inguinal and pelvic lymph node dissection using robotic assisted SP laparoscopy with the DaVinci Single-Site platform. Our methods are detailed in this technical report.RESULTS Total operative time was 3 hours and 38 minutes in duration with minimal blood loss (<20 mL). A 3 cm inguinal lymph node was excised and positive for malignancy without involvement of other nodes. The patient was discharged 90 minutes after recovery in PACU without narcotics and returned to normal bowel function within 6 hours.CONCLUSION We present a successful surgical outcome of a SP robotic ILND in treating a patient with T3N2M0 penile cancer. At the time of publication, the patient is cancer-free with no palpable lymphadenopathy on exam. Utilization of the SP DaVinci system may soon become the standard of care in select cases as it is currently the least invasive approach and is associated with lower morbidity and mortality.

T2  - SCIENTIFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the terrestrial ecosystem, vegetation is the important component of exchanging of water and energy in biogeochemical and climate cycle. A study was conducted to detect the vegetation cover change at Az Zakhnuniyah island by using remote sensing techniques. It includes vegetation analysis using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) while comparing with climatological data including temperature, humidity, and precipitation. A clear trend was seen in climatological parameters where temperature and humidity were rising decade by decade although NDVI did not show. In addition, increasing soil salinization over the years was observed when soil salinity index was used. NDVI-based long-term decadal analysis on vegetation cover based on Landsat surface reflectance data showed increase of vegetation cover which was also linked to precipitation trends. Also, the short-term demi-decadal comparison using PROBA-V showed the vegetation cover reduction between 2015 and 2019. Nevertheless, the sea level surrounding the island also showed an increasing trend of 0.34 cm/y, which could be the cause of inundation in some parts of the island in future. Furthermore, all these trends need to be observed in entirety as many of those trends can be interlinked.

TI  - An Expanded Three Band Model to Monitor Inland Optically Complex Water Using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to strict spectral band requirements, the three-band (TB) chlorophyll-a concentration (C (chla)) estimation algorithm cannot be applied to GOCI image, which has great potential in frequently monitoring inland complex waters. In this study, the TB algorithm was expanded and applied to GOCI data. The GOCI TB algorithm was subsequently calibrated using an in-situ dataset which contains 281 samples collected from 17 inland lakes in China between 2013 and 2020. MERIS TB and GOCI band ratio (BR) models were selected as comparisons to assess the proposed model. The results showed that the proposed GOCI TB model has similar accuracy with MERIS TB model and overperformed GOCI BR model. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the GOCI TB, MERIS TB, and GOCI BR algorithms are 14.212 mu g/L, 12.096 mu g/L, and 20.504 mu g/L, respectively. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) (when C-chla is larger than 10 mu g/L) of the three models were 0.377, 0.250, and 0.453, respectively. Similar conclusion could be drawn from a match-up dataset containing 40 samples. Finally, a simulation experiment was carried out to analyze the robustness of the models under various total suspended matter concentration (C-TSM) conditions. Both the in-situ validation and simulation experiment indicated that the GOCI TB factor could effectively eliminate the optical influence of C TSM. Furthermore, the broader spectral range requirement of GOCI TB model made it proper for many other multispectral sensors such as Sentinel two Multispectral Instrument (S2 MSI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (onboard the Terra/Aqua satellite), and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) (onboard the National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite). Compared with the GOCI BR algorithm, the GOCI TB algorithm has stronger stability, better accuracy, and greater potential in practice.

TI  - Fusion of optical, radar and waveform LiDAR observations for land cover classification
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover is an integral component for characterizing anthropogenic activity and promoting sustainable land use. Mapping distribution and coverage of land cover at broad spatiotemporal scales largely relies on classification of remotely sensed data. Although recently multi-source data fusion has been playing an increasingly active role in land cover classification, our intensive review of current studies shows that the integration of optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) observations has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this research, we bridged this gap by i) summarizing related fusion studies and assessing their reported accuracy improvements, and ii) conducting our own case study where for the first time fusion of optical, radar and waveform LiDAR observations and the associated improvements in classification accuracy are assessed using data collected by spaceborne or appropriately simulated platforms in the LiDAR case. Multitemporal Landsat-5/Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1/ Phased Array type L-band SAR (ALOS-1/PALSAR) imagery acquired in the Central New York (CNY) region close to the collection of airborne waveform LVIS (Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor) data were examined. Classification was conducted using a random forest algorithm and different feature sets in terms of sensor and seasonality as input variables. Results indicate that the combined spectral, scattering and vertical structural information provided the maximum discriminative capability among different land cover types, giving rise to the highest overall accuracy of 83% (2-19% and 9-35% superior to the two-sensor and single-sensor scenarios with overall accuracies of 64-81% and 48-74%, respectively). Greater improvement was achieved when combining multitemporal Landsat images with LVIS-derived canopy height metrics as opposed to PALSAR features, suggesting that LVIS contributed more useful thematic information complementary to spectral data and beneficial to the classification task, especially for vegetation classes. With the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), a recently launched LiDAR instrument of similar properties to the LVIS sensor now operating onboard the International Space Station (ISS), it is our hope that this research will act as a literature summary and offer guidelines for further applications of multi-date and multi-type remotely sensed data fusion for improved land cover classification.

TI  - A review and meta-analysis of generative adversarial networks and their applications in remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the most creative advances in Deep Learning (DL) in recent years. The Remote Sensing (RS) community has adopted GANs quickly, and reported successful use in a wide variety of applications. Given a sharp increase in research on GANs in the field of RS, there is a need for an indepth review of the major technological/methodological advances and new applications. In this regard, we conducted a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of GAN-related RS papers, with the goals of familiarizing the RS community with the potential of GANs and helping researchers further explore RS applications of GANs by untangling challenges common in this field. Our review is based on 231 journal papers that were retrieved and selected through the Web of Science (WoS) database. We reviewed the theories, applications, and challenges of GANs, and highlighted the gaps to explore in future studies. Through the meta-analysis conducted in this study, we observed that image classification (especially urban mapping) has been the most popular application of GANs, potentially due to the wide availability of benchmark datasets. One the other hand, we found that relatively few studies have explored the potential of GANs for analyzing medium spatial-resolution multi-spectral images (e.g., Landsat or Sentinel-2), even though such images are often freely available and useful for a wide range of applications (e.g., urban expansion analysis, vegetation mapping, etc.). In spite of the applications of GANs for different RS processing tasks, there are still several gaps/questions in this field such as: 1) which GAN models/configurations are more suitable for different applications?) 2) to what degree can GANs replace real RS data in different applications? Such gaps/questions can be appropriately addressed by, for example, conducting experimental studies on evaluating different GAN models for various RS applications to provide better insights into how/which GAN models can be best deployed. The meta-analysis results presented in this study could be helpful for RS researchers to know the opportunities of using GANs and understand how GANs contribute to the current challenges in different RS applications.

TI  - Microplastic occurrence in the gastrointestinal tract and gill of bioindicator fish species in the northeastern Mediterranean
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Microplastic pollution is an extremely emerging problem and its potential threats to the aquatic organisms were investigated worldwide. In this study, four different commercial fish species (Mullus barbatus (Linnaeus, 1758), Mullus surmuletus (Linnaeus, 1758), Mugil cephalus (Linnaeus, 1758), Saurida undosquamis (Richardson, 1848)) were used as a bioindicator to assess the microplastic pollution in the northeastern Mediterranean. The frequency of occurrence in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and gill was varied between 66-100% and 68-90%, respectively. The highest microplastic abundance was detected at the GIT of M. cephalus sampled from Asi River estuary. The majority of extracted microplastics were fiber, black in color and less than 1 mm in size. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated the most common polymer type as polyethylene. This study is the first study examining the microplastic existence in gill and results obtained in this study improve the knowledge about the relationship of microplastic ingestion in fish and environmental conditions in the Northeastern Mediterranean Sea.

TI  - Coseismic fault model of the 2017 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.5 Jiuzhaigou earthquake and implications for the regional fault slip pattern
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On August 8, 2017, an M-w 6.5 earthquake occurred in Jiuzhaigou County, Sichuan Province, China, on the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This study investigates the coseismic deformation field and fault model with ascending and descending Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, aftershock distribution, and elastic half-space dislocation model. The regional fault slip pattern is then quantitatively examined using the boundary element method. The results show that the ascending and descending interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coseismic deformation fields display an overall NNW-SSE trend, with more significant deformation on the southwest side of the fault. The coseismic fault geometry is divided into NW and SE sub-faults with strikes of 162.1 degrees and 149.3 degrees, respectively. The coseismic fault slip is dominated by a left-lateral strike-slip movement with an average rake of -2.31 degrees, mainly occurring at a depth of 0-13.04 km with a shape of an approximately inverted triangle. The fault slip features two peak slip zones, with a maximum of 1.39 m. The total seismic moment is 6.34 x 10(18) N.m (M-w 6.47). The boundary element calculation quantitatively indicates that the regional fault slip pattern may be mainly attributable to the changing strike and dip. The strike changes from NNW-SSE to nearly NS direction, and the dip gradually decreases from the Jiuzhaigou earthquake fault in the north to the Huya fault in the south. With these characteristics, the Huya and the Jiuzhaigou earthquake faults form the eastern boundary of the Minshan uplift zone and accommodate the accumulated deformation.

TI  - Co- and post-seismic slip analysis of the 2017 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub>7.3 Sarpol Zahab earthquake using Sentinel-1 data
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The M(w)7.3 Sarpol Zahab earthquake that occurred in the Zagros Fold-Thrust Belt (ZFTB) of Iran on November 12, 2017 is the largest earthquake instrumentally recorded in the region. This earthquake provides an opportunity to investigate the slip behaviour and frictional properties of the fault, which is significant for assessing future seismic potential. In this study, we use Sentinel-1 images to map the coand post-seismic deformation to invert for the fault slip. The result indicates that most of the coseismic slip is buried in the depth range of 11-17 km, and the maximum slip is about 3.8 mat a depth of 15 km. The coseismic slip induces an increase of Coulomb stress in the unruptured area of the seismogenic fault plane, driving the afterslip. Based on the stress-driven afterslip, we obtain a frictional parameter of (a - b) = (0.001 - 0.002) for the updip afterslip zone and (a - b) = 0.0002 for the downdip afterslip zone in the framework of rate-and-state friction. The constitutive parameter (a - b) of the fault is very small, suggesting that the fault segments are close to velocity-neutral and may experience coseismic rupture.

TI  - Transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement with cerebral embolic protection
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIAC SURGERY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - There remains concern about the risk of stroke with transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We describe the use of the Sentinel cerebral protection device with transcarotid TAVR in a patient at high risk for embolic complications. Deployment of the Sentinel filter in the innominate artery accommodated the insertion of the TAVR device through the bovine aortic arch via the contralateral carotid artery. By adapting the "flip-n-flex" technique from our previous transaxillary TAVR experience, we performed left transcarotid TAVR with the Sentinel device in an ergonomic manner and achieved coaxial placement of the transcatheter valve. Inspection of the Sentinel filter after the case revealed captured embolic debris.

TI  - TROPOMI-Retrieved Underwater Light Attenuation in Three Spectral Regions in the Ultraviolet and Blue
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ultraviolet (UV) radiation plays an important role in the ocean for the biogeochemical cycling through photooxidation of colored dissolved organic matter and metals. It also influences the release of trace gases into the atmosphere. Understanding interaction and climate feedback mechanisms of these processes requires global long-term monitoring of UV radiation in the ocean. Ocean color sensors provide the diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling solar irradiance (K-d) as an estimate for the mean light penetration depth in the surface ocean. However, K-d products for the UV spectral range are currently only indirectly inferred from measurements in the visible spectral region. We exploit the UV and visible wavelengths of the TROPOMI sensor onboard Sentinel-5P to directly infer diffuse attenuation coefficients in the UV and blue spectral range. Our approach is based on Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy in combination with radiative transfer modeling which has been used in earlier studies to successfully derive K-d in the blue from the vibrational Raman scattering (VRS) signal. VRS was detected in the backscattered radiances of TROPOMI-like sensors at a spectral resolution around 0.5 nm. We adapt this method for the TROPOMI sensor and more spectral regions to obtain two novel K-d products in the UV range (312.5-338.5 nm and 356.5-390 nm), additionally to the blue K-d (390-423 nm). One month of TROPOMI data show high sensitivity to retrieve VRS (fit errors <15%). The resulting K-d values in the UV and blue agree reasonably (RMSD <0.31 m(-1)) with in-situ data measured during a transatlantic cruise. K-d-blue compared to wavelength-converted K-d(490) products from OLCI and OC-CCI shows that the differences between the three data sets are within uncertainties given for the OC-CCI product. TROPOMI K-d-blue results have higher quality and much higher spatial coverage and resolution than previous ones from SCIAMACHY, GOME-2, and OMI. Perspectively, global TROPOMI K-d products, once thoroughly validated, can be used as input for modeling, e.g., photochemical reaction rates of climatically important compounds and inhibition of primary productivity.

TI  - Design and realization of catadioptric long wave infrared multiscale optical system
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To realize the global super large field of view (FOV) and medium resolution imaging in satellite ocean remote sensing, we propose a catadioptric multiscale optical system based on the concentric double spherical mirrors with non optical axis. In this paper, according to the non optical axis characteristics of the multiscale optical system objective, the concentric double spherical mirrors with non optical axis characteristics is proposed as the objective to construct the catadioptric multiscale optical system, which can be used in the long wave infrared band (LWIR). Taking the system parameters of MODIS-N as example, the catadioptric multiscale system for LWIR based on concentric double spherical mirror is designed. The system works in the band of 7.5-12.5 mu m, the resolution of the sub star point is 325 m, and the imaging FOV is 110 degrees x1.4 degrees (6-channel splicing FOV). The aberration analysis shows that the imaging quality of the system is good. According to the imaging experiment of the single channel prototype, the multiscale design idea based on concentric double spherical mirror is reasonable.

TI  - Critical Review of the Current Evidence on Sentinel Node Biopsy in Oral Cancer
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review With contemporary surgery of the cN0 neck in early oral cancer becoming more selective, sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is gaining popularity as a possible alternate option to elective neck dissection (END). This review attempts to critically appraise the current evidence and highlight pertinent arguments for the use of SNB in early oral cancers.Recent Findings Based on the recent randomized trials, it is imperative to perform an END at the time of primary resection in cN0 oral cancers. The much criticized false negative rate of SNB can be argued to be equal to the regional failure rate after END for pN0 necks, possibly making a case for SNB due to the reduction in number of neck dissections. There still lies ambiguity on the technique, protocols, and benefit of SNB over END. The role of extended histopathological techniques and the implications of micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells for treatment intensification remain questionable.Summary Currently, SNB is an intermediary between routine imaging and END that needs to evolve before it can become a practice changing alternative to END itself. More efforts are needed in standardizing the protocols for SNB.

TI  - Implementation evaluation of a stepped approach to home care assessment using interRAI systems in Ontario, Canada
T2  - HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Ontario, new home care clients are screened with the interRAI Contact Assessment and only those expected to require longer-term services receive the comprehensive RAI-Home Care assessment. Although Ontario adopted this two-step approach in 2010, it is unknown whether the assessment guidelines were implemented as intended. To evaluate implementation fidelity, the purpose of this study is to compare expected to actual client profiles and care co-ordinator practice patterns. We linked interRAI CA and RAI-HC assessments and home care referrals and services data for a retrospective cohort of adult home care clients admitted in FY 2016/17. All assessments were done by trained health professionals as part of routine practice. Descriptive analyses were used to evaluate congruency between recommended and actual practice. Adjusted cause-specific hazards and logistic approaches were used to examine time to RAI-HC assessment and being a high-priority client. Of 225,989 unique home care clients admitted to the publicly funded home care program, about three-quarters of clients were assessed with the interRAI CA only (27.9% completed the Preliminary Screener only and 46.6% completed both the Preliminary Screener and Clinical Evaluation). There was substantial agreement between the skip logic and completion of the Clinical Evaluation section (Cohen's kappa = 0.67 [95% CI: 0.66-0.67]). One-quarter of clients were assessed with both the interRAI CA and RAI-HC. As expected, RAI-HC assessed clients were older, reported more health needs, and often received home care services for >6 months. Clients in higher Assessment Urgency Algorithm (AUA) levels were significantly more likely to receive a RAI-HC assessment and be assigned to a higher home care priority level; however, 28.3% of clients in the highest AUA level did not receive a RAI-HC assessment. We conclude that the use of the interRAI CA and RAI-HC balances the investment of time and resources with the information and tools to deliver high-quality, holistic, and client-centred care. The interRAI CA guides the care co-ordinator to screen every client for a broad range of possible needs and tailor further assessment to each client's unique needs. We recommend integrating the AUA into provincial assessment guidelines as well as developing a new quality indicator focused on measuring access to the home care system.

TI  - Prognostic Significance of Primary Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in a Contemporary Melanoma Cohort
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The prognostic impact of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) on outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients with melanoma in the contemporary era remains poorly characterized. Methods Consecutive patients who underwent wide excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy for cutaneous melanoma 1 mm thick or thicker at a single institution were identified (2006-2019). The patients were stratified based on primary tumor TIL status as brisk (bTILs), non-brisk (nbTILs), or absent (aTILs). Associations between patient factors and outcomes were analyzed using multivariable analysis. Results Of the 1017 patients evaluated, 846 (83.2 %) had primary TILs [nbTILs (n = 759, 89.7 %) and bTILs (n = 87, 10.3 %)]. In the multivariable analysis, the patients with any type of TILs had higher rates of regression [odds ratio (OR), 1.86; p = 0.016], lower rates of acral lentiginous histology (OR, 0.22; p < 0.001), and lower rates of SLN positivity (OR, 0.64; p = 0.042) than those without TILs. The multivariable analysis found no association between disease-specific survival and bTILs [hazard ratio (HR), 1.04; p = 0.927] or nbTILs (HR, 0.89; p = 0.683). An association was found between bTILs and recurrence-free survival (RFS) advantage [bTILs (HR 0.46; p = 0.047), nbTILs (HR 0.71; p = 0.088)], with 5-year RFS rates of 84 % for bTILs, 71.8 % for nbTILs, and 68.4 % for aTILs (p = 0.044). For the 114 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-naive patients who experienced a recurrence treated with ICB therapy, no association was observed between progression-free survival and bTILs (HR, 0.64; p = 0.482) or nbTILs (HR, 0.58; p = 0.176). Conclusions The prognostic significance of primary TILs in the contemporary melanoma era appears complex. Further studies characterizing the phenotype of TILs and their association with regional metastasis and responsiveness to ICB therapy are warranted.

TI  - Association between residential green cover and direct healthcare costs in Northern California: An individual level analysis of 5 million persons
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objective: Prior studies have shown higher green cover levels are associated with beneficial health outcomes. We sought to determine if residential green cover was also associated with direct healthcare costs.Methods: We linked residential Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) satellite data for 5,189,303 members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) to direct individual healthcare costs for 2003-2015. Using generalized linear regression to adjust for confounding, we examined the association between direct healthcare costs and green cover within 250, 500, and 1000 meters (m) of an individual's residence. Costs were determined from an internal cost accounting system that captures administrative and patient care costs for each clinical encounter. Sensitivity analyses included adjustments for comorbidity and an alternative measure of green cover, tree canopy.Results: We observed a significant inverse association between higher levels of residential green cover and lower direct healthcare costs. The relative rate of total cost for the highest compared to the lowest decile of NDVI was 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.93) for the 500 m buffer. The association was robust to adjustment from a broad array of confounders, found at each buffer size, and largely driven by hospitalization, and emergency department visits. Individuals in the top decile of residential green cover had adjusted healthcare costs of $374.04 (95% CI $307.31-$439.41) per person per year less than individuals living in the bottom or least green decile. Sensitivity analyses including tree canopy cover as the green space measure yielded similar findings. Analyses that included adjustment for comorbidity were consistent with the hypothesis that green cover reduces healthcare costs by improving health status.Conclusion: Green cover was associated with lower direct healthcare costs, raising the possibility that residential greening can have a significant healthcare cost impact across the population.

TI  - Heavy metals and metalloid levels in the tissues of yellow-legged gulls (<i>Larus michahellis</i>) from Spain: sex, age, and geographical location differences
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), selenium (Se), and arsenic (As) were measured in liver, kidney, and feathers of adult, juvenile, and chick seagulls (Larus michahellis) collected from the northwest of Spain. Age, sex, and the geographical location of samples were considered variables that can influence metal bioaccumulation, for which concentrations were determined by means of ICP-MS. The mean concentrations (dry weight) found in seagulls were 7.01 +/- 0.37 mg Hg/kg, 22.82 +/- 2.83 mg Cd/kg, 7.36 +/- 1.36 mg Pb/kg, 18.64 +/- 0.63 mg Se/kg, and 10.64 +/- 0.59 mg As/kg. Regarding the different factors analyzed, Hg was the only metal showing sex-related differences, being significantly higher (p < 0.05) the concentrations found in feathers of males (1.26 +/- 0.12 mg/kg) than those in females (0.99 +/- 0.11 mg/kg). A highly significant (p < 0.01) increase in levels of some metals was found in liver related to the increase of age: Hg (adults (A) 3.33 +/- 0.22 mg/kg vs chicks (C) 1.76 +/- 0.28 mg/kg), Cd (A 4.74 +/- 0.62 mg/kg vs C 1.79 +/- 0.2), Pb (A 0.65 +/- 0.12 mg/kg vs juveniles 0.4 +/- 0.11 mg/kg), and Se (A 7.56 +/- 0.43 mg/kg vs C 5.24 +/- 0.53 mg/kg). Positive correlations between Cd-Hg and Se-Hg were found in liver (p < 0.001), kidney (p < 0.001), and feathers (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). The associations found may reflect antagonistic interactions between Se and Cd on Hg toxicity. The results suggest that L. michahellis can reveal local contamination around the foraging and breeding sites and can be a very useful monitoring instrument for assessing heavy metal contamination and sentinel species of environmental health.

TI  - Incidence and risk factor analysis of complications after sentinel node biopsy for penile cancer
T2  - BJU INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To determine the incidence and types of complications after dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB) in patients with penile cancer (PeCa) and identify risk factors for the occurrence of postoperative complications. Patients and Methods We evaluated 644 patients with PeCa (1284 DSNB procedures) with at least one clinically node negative (cN0) groin who underwent DSNB between 2011 and 2020 at a single high-volume centre. The 30- and 30-90-day postoperative complications were collected according to the modified Clavien-Dindo classification and the standardised methodology proposed by the European Association of Urology panel. Uni- and multivariable generalised linear mixed models were used to identify risk factors for the occurrence of complications per groin. Results A 30-day postoperative complication occurred in 14% of groins (n = 186), of which 94% were mild to moderate. Wound infection and lymphocele formation were most common. A 30-90-day postoperative complication occurred in 3.4% of the groins, all of which were mild or moderate (Grade I-II). The number of removed lymph nodes (LNs) per groin was the main independent predictor for any 30-day complications and Grade >= II complications (odds ratio 1.40; P < 0.001). There was an increase in the probability of postoperative complications with the number of LNs removed after accounting for all confounders. Conclusions Despite being less morbid than (modified) inguinal LN dissection, DSNB is still associated with a considerable risk of postoperative mild-to-moderate complications. This risk increases with increasing number of LNs removed. Further procedural refinement aimed at removing the true sentinel node(s) only, may help further reduce the morbidity of surgical staging in PeCa.

TI  - Extraction and analysis of saline soil deformation in the Qarhan Salt Lake region (in Qinghai, China) by the sentinel SBAS-InSAR technique
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The instability of saline soil foundation affects the safety of artificial construction, and may cause ground collapse, building destruction and road damage. It is fundamental to reduce the potential engineering geological disasters by exploring the dynamic evolution of saline soil. Most of the previous researches of saline soil were conducted by simulated experiments and traditional geodetic surveying methods. Restricted to the limited sampling points, the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of saline soil were difficult to find out in a large scale. This paper exploited SBAS-InSAR method to extract the deformation of the Qarhan Salt Lake (in Qinghai, China) section along Qinghai-Tibet railway, based on 119 image data acquired by Sentinel-IA from 2015 to 2020. The results showed that the deformation trends varied frequently in this saline mud flat. Between the adjacent areas with different deformation trends along Qinghai-Tibet railway, discontinuities caused by uplift and subsidence were very obvious. Besides, among the areas with brine exploitation or artificial construction, the maximum subsidence rate reached50 mm/yr, and the maximum cumulative subsidence exceeded 320 mm in the latest 5 years. In the saline mud flat closed to the rivers and lakes, the deformation trend was continuous uplift. Nevertheless, there were obvious seasonal deformation characteristics in those areas far away from the water body. Further analysis found out a sharply subsidence caused by the salt collapsibility appeared in rainy seasons. While an uplift trend induced by the salt swelling or frost heave was remarkable in dry seasons. Subsequently, the relationships were analyzed between the time series deformation and external environmental factors. Furthermore, the deformation mechanism of saline soilin the Qarhan Salt Lake region was interpreted then. In general, this study provides complete spatiotemporal evolution information of saline soil, and demonstrates the deformation characteristics of saline soil in the Qarhan Salt Lake region successfully. Related results would contribute to the safety monitoring for large-scale infrastructure construction in the saline soil areas. (C) 2021 Editorial office of Geodesy and Geodynamics.

TI  - Predicting the location of larval habitats of <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes using remote sensing and soil type data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease transmitted by the bite of Anopheles mosquitoes. Accurate and timely identification of Anopheles larval habitats and analysis of environmental factors affecting the formation and stability of these locations are very effective in the prevention and spread of malaria. In the absence of sufficient field observations and environmental parameters required in a suitable spatial coverage, remote sensing data can be effective in predicting the habitats of Anopheles mosquitoes. In this article, high-risk depressions that have the potential for Anopheles larval habitats had been identified by fusing a Digital Surface Model (DSM) extracted from very high spatial resolution aerial stereo images with land-use and soil type maps. land-useFinally, the high-risk map of malaria based on the prone larval habitats of Anopheles was created. To evaluate the results, 22 important depressions were identified using field observations in the 1.5 km buffer around Qaleh-Ganj city, Kerman Province, Iran. Of these 22 samples, 14 of them were stable for more than one month at temperatures above 30 degrees C and the rest were able to store water for three to four weeks. 12 out of 14 samples were consistent with the identified 130 high-risk depressions in the buffer range. Also, 19 of these 22 samples were compatible with the optimal depressions in the buffer range. By comparing the proposed method with previous methods based on data with medium and low spatial resolution or meteorological data, it was concluded that the correct and accurate seasonal and temporary position of Anopheles larval habitats depend on higher spatial resolution of remote sensing data. In addition, this study demonstrated that the use of vegetation and water indices cannot predict the exact location of all habitats of Anopheles. Because many of these habitats were temporary and these indices could not estimate and predict their exact location. The proposed method can be applied to search for suitable larval habitats of Anopheles around local residential areas, where neither medium and low spatial resolution data nor limited field observations can be used.

TI  - Impacts of afforestation on land surface temperature in different regions of China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the impacts of afforestation on land surface temperature (LST) in China and provide a basis for future afforestation and warming mitigation policies, adjacent forest and open land are compared using ten years of satellite data. Most regions in China exhibit a diurnal asymmetry in the magnitude and sign of the effects of afforestation, with daytime cooling and nighttime warming. Afforestation has annual daily cooling effects in most regions of China because the magnitude of annual nighttime warming is generally weaker than that of the annual daytime cooling. We attributed the warming and cooling effects of afforestation to the changes of evapotranspiration (ET) and albedo. The annual average albedo of forest is smaller than that of open land, and the albedo differences between forest and open land vary spatially, with larger differences in places with snow cover. In the annual average, ET over forest is greater than that over open land, with the largest values in the southern of Yangtze River. The daytime differences in LST between forest and open land are driven by the cooling effects of ET and warming effects of albedo, and the cooling effects of ET dominate. The nighttime warming effects of afforestation is related with the release of the energy stored in the soil during daytime. Evergreen broadleaf forest and deciduous broadleaf forest are recommended as the choice of afforestation in south and in north of the Yangtze River respectively to decrease the LST if the afforestation program in China is to be expanded.

TI  - Conterminous United States Landsat-8 top of atmosphere and surface reflectance tasseled cap transformation coefficients
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The tasseled cap transformation (TCT) has been widely used to decompose satellite multi-spectral information into "brightness", "greenness", and "wetness" components. Published TCT coefficients for the Landsat sensor series have mainly been derived using top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and sparse data sets. Studies to derive TCT coefficients for Landsat surface reflectance (SR) are lacking. In this study, the TCT coefficients were derived independently for Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) SR and TOA reflectance using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) method. To ensure that the derived TCT coefficients are robust and broadly applicable, representative samples of soil, vegetation, and water were selected from summer and autumn Landsat-8 OLI Analysis Ready Data (ARD) sampled from 40.4 million 30 m pixel locations across the conterminous United States (CONUS). Given that the blue band is susceptible to atmospheric contamination due to its shorter wavelength, two groups of TCT coefficients were derived: one from 6 bands (Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2) and one from 5 bands without the blue band. As TCT results cannot be validated in a formal way, the TCT components for CONUS summer TOA and SR composites were generated and compared with National Land Cover Database (NLCD) land cover classes to provide a synoptic assessment and provide confidence in the results. In addition, three ARD tiles selected to encompass a mix of land cover types, predominantly, desert in Nevada, wetland and urban in Florida, and agriculture in North Dakota, were used to analyze the seasonal variation of the TCT components. The results demonstrate that the derived Landsat-8 TCT coefficients can effectively characterize brightness, greenness, and wetness components across the CONUS, and show good consistency for discrimination of land cover types and track seasonal surface variations. There was no significant difference between each TCT component derived using the 6-band and 5-band TCT coefficients considering a large sample of CONUS pixels. Therefore, the 5-band TCT coefficients provided in this study are recommended for use, as the blue band is atmospherically sensitive and difficult to atmospherically correct reliably.

TI  - Remote Sensing Data Processing of Urban Land Using Based on Artificial Neural Network
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization, the utilization rate of land has become the focus of attention. Remote sensing technology can provide a large amount of data for the prediction of urban land. It is also a thorny problem to find the correlation between the complex data of land change. The neural network technology has obvious advantages in finding the mapping relationship between high-dimensional and nonlinear data. This paper combines the dynamic changes of urban land and neural network methods to analyze the utilization rate and coverage of urban land in the future. In this paper, the data obtained by remote sensing technology is normalized and clustered to classify different types of urban land. Convolutional neural networks and long-short-term memory neural networks are used to extract the spatial and temporal dynamic characteristics of urban land use. The research results show that the clustering method used in this paper can reasonably classify different urban land types, especially the classification of buildings. The method of predicting the future trend of land use is also in line with the dynamic process of land use. The largest prediction error comes from the prediction of the building, and the largest error is only 2.56%, which is a reasonable error range. The smallest error does not exceed 1%, and the correlation coefficient between the real and predicted values of urban land use types reaches 0.9698.

TI  - Lifetime productivity: Genetic study of longevity and its associations with economically important traits in dairy buffaloes
T2  - LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To increase the permanence of animals in dairy herds by decreasing involuntary slaughter contributes to the development of a sustainable production system. This sustainability is the result of reduced sanitary costs, increased productive life of females, and increased animal welfare. This study aims to estimate genetic parameters for productive lifespan (PL) and functional productive life (FPL) associated with the following economically important traits: milk (MY), fat (FY), and protein yields (PY); fat percentage (%F) and protein percentage (%P); age at first calving (AFC); and calving interval (CI) in dairy buffaloes. The productive lifespan was defined at 48 (PL48), 60 (PL60), and 72 (PL72) months of age. The (co) variance components were estimated using the multi trait model and the Gibbs2F90 software. To determine the selection effects for FPL72, a deterministic simulation was performed to obtain the direct and indirect genetic gains. Selection indices were calculated, including or excluding FPL72, considering the economic values of dairy cattle (economic values for 2010 and 2014 - EV10 and EV14). The estimates of heritability of PL and FPL were low, ranging from 0.09 to 0.15 for PL48 and PL72, respectively, and from 0.12 to 0.18 for FPL48 and FPL72, respectively. The genetic correlations of PL or FPL with the productive traits (MY, FY, and PY) ranged from low to moderate, obtaining values between 0.07 (PL48/MY) and 0.34 (FPL72/MY). The genetic correlations of PL or FPL with %F and %P presented negative values, with some values reaching near zero. The estimated genetic correlations between PL or FPL and the reproductive traits ranged from 0.16 (FPL72/CI) to-0.11 (PL48/AFC). Regarding the genetic gain for FPL72, the results showed that indirect selection can be achieved by selecting the productive traits. The expected responses for EV10 and EV14 ranged from +$102 to $147. The results indicate that FPL should be considered in water buffaloes to allow identifying efficient animals. Thus, this trait should be considered in genetic improvement programs.

TI  - Online treatment of eruption dynamics improves the volcanic ash and SO<sub>2</sub> dispersion forecast: case of the 2019 Raikoke eruption
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In June 2019, the Raikoke volcano, Kuril Islands, emitted 0.4-1.8 x 10(9) kg of very fine ash and 1-2 x 10(9) kg of SO2 up to 14 km into the atmosphere. The eruption was characterized by several eruption phases of different duration and height summing up to a total eruption length of about 5.5 h. Resolving such complex eruption dynamics is required for precise volcanic plume dispersion forecasts. To address this issue, we coupled the atmospheric model system ICON-ART (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic with the Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases module) with the 1D plume model FPlume to calculate the eruption source parameters (ESPs) online. The main inputs are the plume heights for the different eruption phases that are geometrically derived from satellite data. An empirical relationship is used to derive the amount of very fine ash (particles < 32 mu m), which is relevant for long-range transport in the atmosphere. On the first day after the onset of the eruption, the modeled ash loading agrees very well with the ash loading estimated from AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager) observations due to the resolution of the eruption phases and the online treatment of the ESPs. In later hours, aerosol dynamical processes (nucleation, condensation, and coagulation) explain the loss of ash in the atmosphere in agreement with the observations. However, a direct comparison is partly hampered by water and ice clouds overlapping the ash cloud in the observations. We compared 6-hourly means of model and AHI data with respect to the structure, amplitude, and location (SAL method) to further validate the simulated dispersion of SO2 and ash. In the beginning, the structure and amplitude values for SO2 differed largely because the dense ash cloud leads to an underestimation of the SO2 amount in the satellite data. On the second and third day, the SAL values are close to zero for all parameters (except for the structure value of ash), indicating a very good agreement of the model and observations. Furthermore, we found a separation of the ash and SO2 plume after 1 d due to particle sedimentation, chemistry, and aerosol-radiation interaction.The results confirm that coupling the atmospheric model system and plume model enables detailed treatment of the plume dynamics (phases and ESPs) and leads to significant improvement of the ash and SO2 dispersion forecast. This approach can benefit the operational forecast of ash and SO2 especially in the case of complex and noncontinuous volcanic eruptions like that of Raikoke in 2019.

TI  - Wildland urban interface of the City of Cape Town 1990-2019
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire affecting urban areas at the wildland urban interface (WUI) is a growing global concern, where management is important for urban residents as well as wildland vegetation. We used a socio-ecological system perspective to investigate the interactions of urban land with a fire-dependent wildland in South Africa's City of Cape Town (CoCT). We examined changes in population growth, land cover change and related WUI footprint, occurrence of large fires, and related policies over time. We used Landsat data to track changes over the period 1990-2019 in the formal and informal urban and wildland footprint, census data to track changes in population, and difference normalised burn ratio and MODIS burned area product to track large fires. The urban footprint has expanded greatly and through consolidation has led to the reduction of the WUI. Furthermore, evidence points to an increase in fire suppression, even though national policies ask for wildfires to run their course where possible and appropriate. As a result of pressure from urban residents, local managers prefer short term fire suppression to long term risk reduction for urban areas and ecological management of wildland. Framing the problem as a socio-ecological system enabled us to highlight how WUI management is a product of interaction between urban development, wildland type and policies. Our findings emphasise the point that wildland management is driven by urban residents and local municipalities, with national fire and disaster management policies not fully implemented.

TI  - High-precision remote sensing mapping of aeolian sand landforms based on deep learning algorithms
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - It is significant to adopt deep learning algorithms and higher-resolution remote sensing images in mapping large-scale and high-precision of aeolian landform. In this study, the western part of Horqin Sandy Land was taken as the study area. Based on the data collected from 2,786 verification points located in sandy land and remote sensing images of high-spectral and spatial resolution Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and GDEM (V3), this article made a research on data of large-scale and high-precision mapping classification of this area between 2015 and 2020 by using convolutional neural network deep learning algorithm. The results showed that the types of aeolian sandy landform in the west of Horqin Sandy Land mainly include longitudinal dune, flat sandy land, mild undulating sand land, nest-shaped land, parabolic dune, barchan dune, and dune chain, with an area of 1735.62, 51.32, 251.38, 902.07, 49.57, and 101.63 km(2). Among them, longitudinal dune, barchan dune, and dune chain have the largest area, while parabolic dunes and flat sand land are smaller. Between 2015 and 2020, the area of aeolian landforms was reduced by 89.27 km(2) and transformed into an oasis from a desert. This study adopted remote sensing data by high-resolution Sentinel and GDEM (V3) and convolutional neural network deep learning algorithm to map the aeolian landforms effectively. The precision of aeolian landform classification and Kappa coefficient in the western part of Horqin Sandy Land is as high as 95.51% and 0.8961. Combined with Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and GDEM (V3), the deep learning algorithm based on the convolution neural network can timely and effectively monitor the changes of sand dunes, which can be used for large-scale aeolian landforms.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wadi-Allaqi district, in the southern part of the Eastern Desert of Egypt, is a historic well-known gold resource that has been exploited since the Pharaonic era. The study area represents the western segment of Wadi-Allaqi, about 220 km southeast Aswan city, Upper Egypt. It covers approximately 4702 km2. Exploring new potential mineralization zones was conducted by integrating the Landsat-8 and aeromagnetic data to map different surfaces of alteration zones and trace shallow and deep mineralized bodies. The corrected Landsat-Operational Land Imager (OLI) bands were processed using the Band Ratio (BR), Crosta, selective for the Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation, and False-Color Composition (FCC) techniques were used to detect the hydrothermal alteration zones and recognize the different geological units. The enhanced eigenimage (MNF1) was processed to delineate the fractures and weakness zones over the west Allaqi-Heini Suture (AHS). The shallow residual mineralized sources have been detected and mapped using the Tilt Derivative (TDR), First Derivative (FVD) and high pass filter techniques of aeromagnetic data. The depths to the mineralized magnetic sources, and hence the roots of gold and other minerals, were obtained using the power spectrum and Euler techniques. Accordingly, new gold and mineralization potential zones were successfully delineated over the study area's ophiolitic, metavolcanics, and granitic rocks. Lineaments deduced from aeromagnetic and remote sensing data represent the pathways of the ascending hydrothermal fluids. The main trends of the dominant structural systems were detected through the statistical analyses of these lineaments.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Urban settlements are rapidly growing outward and upward, with consequences for resource use, greenhouse gas emissions, and ecosystem and public health, but rates of change are uneven around the world. Understanding trajectories and predicting consequences of global urban expansion requires quantifying rates of change with consistent, well-calibrated data. Microwave backscatter data provides important information on upward urban growth - essentially the vertical built-up area. We developed a multi-sensor, multi-decadal, gridded (0.05 degrees lat/lon) data set of global urban microwave backscatter, 1993-2020. Comparison of backscatter from two C-band sensors (ERS and ASCAT) and one Ku-band sensor (QuikSCAT) are made at four invariant non-urban sites (similar to 3500 km(2)) to evaluate instrument stability and multi-decadal pattern. For urban areas, there was a strong linear correlation (overall R-2 = 0.69) between 2015 ASCAT urban backscatter and a continental-scale gridded product of building volume, across 8450 urban grid cells (0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees) in Europe, China, and the USA. This urban backscatter data set provides a time series characterizing global urban change over the past three decades.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil water is a critical component of the water balance to make water management decisions at multiple scales. While soil water can be sensed remotely, this is generally at coarse scales (> 12.5 km). In addition, soil moisture products developed at field scale resolutions (< 250 m) have been mostly limited to shallow observations (up to 10 cm depth) and are impacted by land use. The objective of this study was to create an accurate downscaled soil water content product at multiple depths and at a fine 90 m resolution by fusing modelled and remote sensing datasets via deep learning. Reference data was based on the OzFlux and Oznet networks. Covariates included the North America Space Agency (NASA) United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) remote sensing data assimilation model, Sentinel 1 from Copernicus, surface reflectance, land surface temperature and land cover from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and gridded soil properties. Two model approaches were used including a multilayer perceptron for the surface (0-10 cm), and recurrent neural networks for the surface/subsurface (0-30 cm and 30-60 cm) soil water content. The surface prediction performance resulted in a root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson's correlation of 0.073, 0.057, and 0.74, degrading in depth to 0.07, 0.062, and 0.5. Overall, these 90 m resolution predictions improve on the performance of NASA-USDA SMAP (10 km resolution) and the Australian Landscape Water Balance (5 km resolution) simulated soil water contents. Land use/land cover (LULC) are important explaining factors for performance and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) indicate high impor-tance of NASA-USDA SMAP for surface predictions, while soil properties and LULC increase in importance with depth.

TI  - Farmland use data and remote sensing for ex-post assessment of CAP environmental performances: An application to soil quality dynamics in Lombardy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the reform of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2013, subsidies to farms are now bound to the fulfilment of environmentally friendly measures, such as crop diversification and allocation of a share of their farmland to Ecological Focus Areas, the so-called "Greening re-quirements ". Research on the effects of these policy changes so far have focused mainly on land use transition; however, a detailed investigation of how CAP greening affects the properties of agricultural land is required to assess the actual environmental benefits of the reform. In this study, we present a first attempt to assess the impacts of CAP greening on selected soil quality indices in Lombardy, a populated region in northern Italy where high-intensity agriculture is widespread. We combine high resolution (10/30 m) soil indices from remote sensing based on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data with a regional administrative database covering all agricultural parcels of the region. We then perform a correlation analysis to investigate whether and to what extent greening prescriptions affect the soil quality indices from 2014, representing pre-greening conditions, to 2017, rep-resenting greening conditions after 3 years of implementation. Our analysis indicates a high persistence of soil quality indicators and suggests that some crops might have a significant impact on soil quality dynamics, along with farm's compliance with CAP greening. Although we identified some uncertainties in the soil indices, by integrating a large volume of data and an efficient processing algorithm our method paves the way for ex-post environmental performance assessment of agricultural policies.

TI  - Mapping crop residue cover using Adjust Normalized Difference Residue Index based on Sentinel-2 MSI data
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residues are effective for the prevention of soil erosion. The crop residue cover (CRC) can be mapped by remote sensing. Different morphologies of crop residue will affect the spectral reflectance, reducing the accuracy of CRC estimation by multispectral data. However, the influence of residue morphology is not fully considered on the accuracy of CRC mapping using satellite images. In addition, the spectral indices are easily saturated and less sensitive to high-density areas of crop residue. This study selected four maize planting sites to obtain hyperspectral reflectance and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. The effects of CRC and residue morphology on spectral reflectance were analyzed, and a new Residue Adjust Normalized Difference Residue Index (RANDRI) was proposed. UAV images were used to extract ground CRC data for training a CRC prediction model based on Sentinel-2 MSI data. Finally, the piecewise prediction model based on different residue indices was used to map CRC. The study results highlighted a linear relationship between the reflectance intersection of shortwave infrared 2 reflectance and red edge 3 of Sentinel-2 MSI with different residual morphologies, called the residue line. The model accuracy of RANDRI optimized by residual line parameters was better than that of the Normalized Difference Residue Index and Soil Adjust Normalized Difference Residue Index (SANDRI) in the highdensity area of crop residue. RANDRI can weaken the influence of residue morphologies on modeling accuracy. The CRC spatial distribution by the piecewise SANDRI+RANDRI model was more consistent with CRC measured than that of the RANDRI models individually. The determination coefficient of the piecewise model was 0.82, and the relative error was 10.66%. The piecewise model can effectively improve the anti-saturation ability of the spectral indices. We suggest a rapid and accurate approach for monitoring the CRC and provide a more suitable CRC mapping strategy for high-density areas of crop residue using multispectral remote sensing data.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present research aims to find the groundwater prospective areas by using Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing based frequency ratio technique. The data sets that affect groundwater such as geomorphology, lithology, slope, soil, rainfall, drainage density, lineament density and land use/ land cover were taken under consideration for finding the groundwater prospective areas in the Bundelkhand region, India. Thematic maps of all the above-mentioned factors have been prepared from the remotely sensed data, data taken from the different organizations and departments. The weights of each attribute class of each thematic layer are assigned according to the frequency ratio technique. A total, 799 numbers of spring locations and discharge rate data of 108 numbers of well locations have been taken under consideration for obtaining the frequency ratio of each attribute class of every parameter used and testing the obtained result, respectively. Finally, all layers were combined by raster calculator command in ArcGIS software to develop the map of groundwater prospective zones in the Bundelkhand region. The produced groundwater prospective areas were classified into five different zones such as very high, high, moderate, low and very low prospective zones and verified by actual well yield data.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Temporal and spatial dynamics of tropical macroalgal contributions to blue carbon
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems are a vital part of nature-based climate solutions due to their capacity to store and sequester carbon, but often exclude macroalgal beds even though they can form highly productive coastal ecosystems. Recent estimates of macroalgal contributions to global carbon sequestration are derived primarily from temperate kelp forests, while tropical macroalgal carbon stock in living biomass is still unclear. Here, using Singapore as a case study, we integrate field surveys and remote sensing data to estimate living macroalgal carbon stock. Results show that macroalgae in Singapore account for up to 650 Mg C biomass stock, which is greater than the aboveground carbon found in seagrass meadows but lower than that in mangrove forests. Ulva and Sargassum dominate macroalgal assemblages and biomass along the coast, with both genera exhibiting distinct spatio-temporal variation. The annual range of macroalgal biomass carbon is estimated to be 450 Mg C yr-1, or 0.77 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. Noting the uncertainties of the fate of macroalgal biomass carbon, we estimate the potential sequestration rate and find that it is comparable to mature terrestrial ecosystems such as tropical grasslands and temperate forests. This study demonstrates that macroalgal seasonality allows for a consistent amount of biomass carbon to either be exported and eventually sequestered, or harvested for utilization on an annual basis. These findings on macroalgal growth patterns and their considerable contributions to tropical coastal carbon pool add to the growing support for macroalgae to be formally included in blue carbon assessments.

TI  - A hierarchical category structure based convolutional recurrent neural network (HCS-ConvRNN) for Land-Cover classification using dense MODIS Time-Series data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Hierarchical classification of land cover can be used to describe the Earth's surface with different scales and properties. However, existing studies have rarely considered hierarchical information for land-cover classification, and have ignored dependencies in the hierarchical structure. In this study, we propose a hierarchical category structure-based convolutional recurrent neural network (HCS-ConvRNN). The HCS-ConvRNN method constrains the input through the leaf node of the hierarchical structure based input layer, and then constructs the dependencies among different layers in a top-down manner, in order to classify the pixels into the most relevant classes in a layer-by-layer manner. A total of 219 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images of China from 2015 to 2017, at a 5-day interval, were used in the reported experiments. It is shown that: 1) the results of HCS-ConvRNN have rich spatial details; 2) the accuracy at each level of HCS-ConvRNN is better than that of MOD12Q1; and 3) generally HCS-ConvRNN can obtain a better classification performance than other networks such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). In summary, the proposed HCS-ConvRNN method can effectively achieve hierarchical land cover classification, and has the potential for accurate land cover classification at a large scale.

TI  - Long-Term and Fine-Scale Surface Urban Heat Island Dynamics Revealed by Landsat Data Since the 1980s: A Comparison of Four Megacities in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term and fine-scale monitoring of surface urban heat island (SUHI) is critical for the design of heat mitigation strategies. Landsat series offer long-term (since the 1980s) and fine-scale land surface temperature (LST) observations for such SUHI analysis. However, Landsat data are characterized by a long revisit period (16 days) and are seriously impacted by cloud contamination and stripe gaps, making the Landsat-derived long-term SUHI trends across cities incomparable. To address this issue, here we applied the Prophet model to reconstruct temporally consistent long-term (similar to 1985-2019) clear-sky Landsat LSTs over four megacities in China (Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen). The results show that the mean absolute error of the SUHI intensity (SUHII) estimated using the reconstructed LSTs ranges from 0.2 to 0.6 degrees C. The reliability of the reconstructed LSTs is further evidenced by the general consistency between the reconstructed Landsat and original Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer LSTs. Our analysis further demonstrates that the overall SUHII has been increasing slowly over Beijing but has been increasing rapidly in the other three megacities since the 1980s. Local SUHII trends also varied between urban regions. Urban core is characterized by an initial increase and then a slight decrease in the local SUHII, while a continuously increasing trend is observed for the urban fringe. For the new urban development, the interannual SUHII trend lies somewhere between these trends. Overall, our study provides a practical approach to reconstruct long-term clear-sky Landsat LSTs, and delivers a better understanding of long-term and fine-scale SUHI variations across cities.

TI  - Effects of land use and land cover change on soil organic carbon storage in the Hexi regions, Northwest China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in arid inland regions is significantly affected by land use and land cover change (LUCC) associated with climate change and agricultural activities. A systematic evaluation to the LUCC effects on SOC storage could enable us to better manage soil carbon pools in arid inland regions. Here, we evaluated the effects of LUCC on SOC storage in the Hexi Regions based on high-resolution SOC and LUCC maps derived from Landsat imagery and digital soil mapping using machine learning algorithm and environmental covariates. The results showed that SOC generally increased from northwest to southeast over the Hexi Regions with an average stock of 7.15 kg C m(-2) at a soil depth of 100 cm and a total storage of 2783.05 Tg C. The SOC stock and storage in the Qilian Mountains (mountains) was about 3.90 and 4.55 times higher than that in the Hexi Corridor (plains), respectively. It was estimated that LUCC over the past four decades caused a net increase of 23.41 and 18.19 Tg C in total SOC storage for the Qilian Mountains and Hexi Corridor, respectively. Specifically, the development in grasslands quality as well as the land-use category conversion from the bare land to grassland mainly contributed to the increase in SOC storage of the Qilian Mountains, where the LUCC was mainly driven by climate change. By contrast, the SOC storage change in the Hexi Corridor was mainly associated with the conversion from sandy land and low-cover grassland to cropland as well as sandy land to grassland, being mainly affected by intense cropland expansion and desertification control. Our results highlighted the importance of climate change and cropland expansion in enhancing SOC storage of the Qilian Mountains and Hexi corridor, respectively.

TI  - Compressive strength of high strength concrete-encased composite columns with noncompact and slender steel angles
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Concrete-encased steel angle (CEA) column is an encased composite column where structural angles are used for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements. In this study, the compressive behavior of CEA columns was investigated, focusing on the use of high-strength concrete and noncompact and slender steel angles. Ten CEA column specimens (concrete strength fc' = 33 and 66 MPa and steel yield strength Fy = 454-552 MPa) were tested under compressive loading. The section classification of steel angles and the spacing of transverse ties were considered as test variables. The tests showed that the cover concrete spalled off at peak loads and local buckling occurred in steel angles. Due to the use of high-strength concrete, the compressive strength (i.e., peak loads) was increased but the post-peak degradation behavior became steeper. The peak and residual strengths of CEA columns were examined focusing on the effects of cover failure, confinement by transverse ties, and local buckling of steel angles. Based on the results, empirical equations to estimate the peak and residual strengths were proposed and the validity was assessed by comparisons with the test results.

TI  - Cardiotocography and Clinical Risk Factors in Early Term Labor: A Retrospective Cohort Study Using Computerized Analysis With Oxford System
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe role of cardiotocography (CTG) in fetal risk assessment around the beginning of term labor is controversial. We used routinely collected clinical data in a large tertiary hospital to investigate whether infants with "severe compromise" at birth exhibited fetal heart rate abnormalities in their first-hour CTGs and/or other clinical risks, recorded as per routine care. Materials and MethodsRetrospective data from 27,927 parturitions (single UK tertiary site, 2001-2010) were analyzed. Cases were included if the pregnancy was singleton, >= 36 weeks' gestation, cephalic presentation, and if they had routine intrapartum CTG as per clinical care. Cases with congenital abnormalities, planned cesarean section (CS), or CS for reasons other than "presumed fetal compromise" were excluded. We analyzed first-hour intrapartum CTG recordings, using intrapartum Oxford System (OxSys) computer-based algorithms. To reflect the effect of routine clinical care, the data was stratified into three exclusive groups: infants delivered by CS for "presumed fetal compromise" within 2 h of starting the CTG (Emergency CS, n = 113); between 2 and 5 h of starting the CTG (Urgent CS, n = 203); and the rest of deliveries (Others, n = 27,611). First-hour CTG and clinical characteristics were compared between the groups, sub-divided to those with and without severe compromise: a composite outcome of stillbirth, neonatal death, neonatal seizures, encephalopathy, resuscitation followed by >= 48 h in neonatal intensive care unit. Two-sample t-test, X-2 test, and Fisher's exact test were used for analysis. ResultsCompared to babies without severe compromise, those with compromise had significantly higher proportion of cases with baseline fetal heart rate >= 150 bpm; non-reactive trace; reduced long-term and short-term variability; decelerative capacity; and no accelerations in the first-hour CTG across all groups. Prolonged decelerations(>= 3 min) were also more common. Thick meconium and small for gestational age were consistently more common in compromised infants across all groups. There was more often thick meconium, maternal fever >= 38 C, sentinel events, and other clinical risk factors in the Emergency CS and Urgent CS compared to the Others group. ConclusionA proportion of infants born with severe compromise had significantly different first-hour CTG features and clinical risk factors.

TI  - Factors controlling spatio-temporal variations of sandy deserts during the past 110 Years in Xinjiang, Northwestern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Xinjiang, northwestern China, has the largest area of sandy desert landscapes in the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes and is known to be subject to so-called sandy desertification. Longer-term records of changes in the distribution of sandy desert landscapes are required to develop a more comprehensive understanding of mech-anisms underlying their spatial and temporal dynamics. Here, we integrate a diverse range of data sources, including historical maps, documentary accounts, government statistics, remote sensing data, global climate reanalysis data, and field reconnaissance data, to reconstruct 110 years of spatial variations in sandy desert distribution in Xinjiang. Our results show that, overall, there has been a 22.3% reduction in the area of sandy desert in Xinjiang over the past 110 years. Cross-wavelet and linear regression analyses reveal that vegetation changes are the major determinants of sandy desertification during this period and that, in contrast to previous studies in the region, aeolian factors and human-induced degradation are less important drivers than previously reported. Ecosystem management has markedly constrained sandy desert expansion even against a background of population increase. The suggested comprehensive approach may be useful in improving understanding of sandy desert dynamics and associated desertification forcing mechanisms in arid and semiarid regions globally.

TI  - Marine Heatwaves Characteristics in the Barents Sea Based on High Resolution Satellite Data (1982-2020)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) can potentially alter ocean ecosystems with far-reaching ecological and socio-economic consequences. This study investigates the spatiotemporal evolution of the main MHW characteristics in the Barents Sea using high-resolution (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) daily Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data from 1982 to 2020. The results reveal that the Barents Sea has experienced accelerated warming and several more MHWs in recent decades. Since 2004, an amplified increasing SST trend was observed across the entire Barents Sea, with a spatially averaged SST trend of 0.25 +/- 0.18 degrees C/decade and 0.58 +/- 0.21 degrees C/decade for the northern and southern Barents Sea, respectively. The annual mean MHW frequency, days, and duration over the entire Barents Sea increased by, respectively, 62, 73, and 31% from the pre- to the post-2004 period. More than half of all MHW days occurred in the last decade (2011-2020). The most intense MHW event occurred in summer 2016, which was also the warmest year during the study period. In general, the annual mean MHW frequency was relatively high in the northern Barents Sea, while the intensity and duration were higher in the southern Barents Sea. The highest annual MHW intensity and duration were observed in 2016, 2013, and 2020, respectively, while the highest annual MHW frequency was found in 2016. For the entire Barents Sea, the annual MHW frequency and duration increased significantly (p < 0.05) over the whole study period, with a trend of, respectively, 1.0 +/- 0.4 events/decade, which is a doubling of the global average, and 2.4 +/- 1.3 days/decade. In terms of the influence of climate variability on MHW characteristics, our findings revealed that the Eastern Atlantic Pattern (EAP) plays a significant role in controlling MHW characteristics, whereas the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has no significant relationship. Sea ice concentrations were found to have a significant negative correlation with MHW characteristics. Strong positive correlations were observed between SST, surface air temperature, and MHW frequency, implying that as global warming continues, we can expect continued rising in MHW frequencies and days in the Barents Sea with huge implications for the ocean ecosystem.

TI  - Aligning digitalisation and sustainable development? Evidence from the analysis of worldviews in sustainability reports
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The digitalisation of industrial production and the actual positive and negative consequences for sustainable development are not yet sufficiently understood. This study describes and evaluates the linkages between corporate digitalisation and sustainability management based on qualitative data analysis of sustainability reports of DAX 30 companies and applying the concept of sustainability worldviews. The results show a predominate worldview of weak or business-centred sustainability on digitalisation, which could potentially pose a threat to sustainable development. In particular, the focus on customer demands without stakeholder involvement and the worldview of digitalisation as a way of doing 'business as-usual' but in a more effective way reproduces unsustainable economic patterns. A holistic sustainable approach on digitalisation should also include possible negative impacts like increased resource consumption which is not the case yet in the studied companies. Different types of 'sustainability worldviews on digitalisation' can be distinguished. While 'Pioneer' companies can inform policy-making, the other types of 'Intermediates', 'Indecisive' and 'Laggards' could be addressed by information exchange, support and regulation to promote a more sustainable worldview on corporate digitalisation. The 'Unsustainable' digitalisation type would be the most difficult to address with soft policy instruments and requires a more regulated approach.

TI  - 'INDECENT AND SUGGESTIVE PICTORIAL MATTER' Banning <i>Picture Post</i> in Ireland
T2  - MEDIA HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - As an innovative photojournalism publication with a left-of-centre worldview, Picture Post was hugely popular in Ireland but also has the distinction of being one of the most frequently banned periodicals in twentieth-century Ireland. Senior church figures and morality campaigners viewed its photojournalism as indecent and obscene and engaged in a sustained decades-long battle to ban the publication. Utilising records held at the National Archives of Ireland, this article examines the campaign against Picture Post as a case study to offer a deeper comprehension of the Catholic Church inspired crusade against popular 'foreign' and 'immoral' publications. Understanding the motivations and rationale for targeting periodicals such as Picture Post is central to illuminating not just the censorship mentality that dominated Irish life in the period under consideration but is central also to appreciating the rational offered by morality campaigners in favour of the Irish censorship regime.

TI  - Enhanced Nighttime Fog and Low Stratus Occurrence Over the Landes Forest, France
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the drivers of fog and low stratus (FLS) cloud occurrence is important for traffic, ecosystems, and climate models, but it is challenging to analyze due to the complex interactions between meteorological factors and land cover. Here, we use active and passive satellite data, as well as reanalysis data to investigate nighttime FLS occurrence over the expansive Landes forest in France from 2006 to 2015. We find significant FLS enhancement over the forest compared to surrounding areas, especially in summer and fall. Lower wind speed and lower temperatures are found over the forest at night, which can enhance FLS development over the forest. Still, other drivers, such as biovolatile organic compounds acting as cloud condensation nuclei, are most likely important as well. The results show that the influence of forests on boundary layer clouds is not limited to convective daytime conditions.

TI  - Evolution of light use efficiency models: Improvement, uncertainties, and implications
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Light use efficiency (LUE) models have been widely used to estimate terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) at local, regional, and global scales, which is vital for understanding the carbon flux dynamics under climate change. LUE models express GPP as the product of the incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), the fraction of PAR absorbed by plants (FPAR), the maximum LUE, and the environmental stress factors (e.g., temperature, water, and carbon dioxide). Here, we investigate 21 LUE models reported in literatures and conclude their complicated evolutions in the aforementioned four components: 1) the representation of PAR was improved from total PAR to direct and diffuse PARs; 2) the representation of FPAR was improved from one-leaf to two-leaf (i.e., sunlit and shaded leaves) or chlorophyll based strategies; 3) the parameterization of the maximum LUE was improved from a constant value of 0.39 gC/MJ to the C3/C4-and sunlit/shaded leaf-specific values; and 4) the representation of environmental stress factors was improved both in their integration forms (e. g., from the multiplication method to the law of the minimum method) and the proxy optimization for a specific stress factor. For example, the proxy for water stress factor has evolved from atmospheric (e.g., vapor pressure deficit) and soil (e.g., soil moisture) water indicators to the plant (e.g., land surface water index) water indicators. We also identify uncertainties caused by model structures, parameterizations, input data with various resolutions and accuracies, and scale mismatch issues between remote sensing data and flux tower observations. The newly emerged indicators such as the photochemical reflectance index, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation simplify the methods to estimate GPP but fail to disentangle the influences of different environmental factors. These findings on the evolution of LUE models and their uncertainties are expected to contribute to future model improvements.

TI  - Classification of airborne multispectral imagery to quantify common vole impacts on an agricultural field
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND The common vole (Microtus arvalis) is a very destructive agricultural pest. Particularly in Europe, its monitoring is essential not only for adequate management and outbreak forecasting, but also for accurately determining the vole's impact on affected fields. In this study, several alternatives for estimating the damage to alfalfa fields by voles through unmanned vehicle systems (UASs) and multispectral cameras are presented. Currently, both the farmers and agencies involved in the integrated pest management (IPM) programs of voles do not have sufficiently precise methods for accurate assessments of the real impact to crops. RESULTS Overall, the four multispectral classification methods presented showed similar performances. However, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based segmentation exhibited the most accurate and reliable appraisal of the affected areas. Nevertheless, it must be noted that the simplest method, which was based on an automatic classification, provided results similar to those obtained by more complex methods. In addition, a significant direct relationship was found between the number of active burrows and damage to the alfalfa canopy. CONCLUSION Unmanned vehicle systems, combined with multispectral imagery classification, are an effective and easily transferable methodology for the assessment and monitoring of common vole damage to agricultural plots. This combination of methods facilitates decision-making processes for IPM control strategies against this pest.

TI  - Improved monitoring of shipping NO<sub>2</sub> with TROPOMI: decreasing NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emissions in European seas during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) measurements of tropospheric NO2 columns provide powerful information on emissions of air pollution by ships on open sea. This information is potentially useful for authorities to help determine the (non-)compliance of ships with increasingly stringent NOx emission regulations. We find that the information quality is improved further by recent upgrades in the TROPOMI cloud retrieval and an optimal data selection. We show that the superior spatial resolution of TROPOMI allows for the detection of several lanes of NO2 pollution ranging from the Aegean Sea near Greece to the Skagerrak in Scandinavia, which have not been detected with other satellite instruments before. Additionally, we demonstrate that under conditions of sun glint TROPOMI's vertical sensitivity to NO2 in the marine boundary layer increases by up to 60 %. The benefits of sun glint are most prominent under clear-sky situations when sea surface winds are low but slightly above zero (+/- 2 m s(-1)). Beyond spatial resolution and sun glint, we examine for the first time the impact of the recently improved cloud algorithm on the TROPOMI NO2 retrieval quality, both over sea and over land. We find that the new FRESCO+ (Fast Retrieval Scheme for Clouds from the Oxygen A band) wide algorithm leads to 50 hPa lower cloud pressures, correcting a known high bias, and produces 1-4x 10(15) molec. cm(-2) higher retrieved NO2 columns, thereby at least partially correcting for the previously reported low bias in the TROPOMI NO2 product. By training an artificial neural network on the four available periods with standard and FRESCO+ wide test retrievals, we develop a historic, consistent TROPOMI NO2 data set spanning the years 2019 and 2020. This improved data set shows stronger (35 %-75 %) and sharper (10 %-35 %) shipping NO2 signals compared to co-sampled measurements from OMI. We apply our improved data set to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ship NO2 pollution over European seas and find indications that NOx emissions from ships reduced by 10 %-20 % during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The reductions in ship NO2 pollution start in March-April 2020, in line with changes in shipping activity inferred from automatic identification system (AIS) data on ship location, speed, and engine.

TI  - Application of multi layer perceptron neural network Markov Chain model for LULC change detection in the Sub-Himalayan North Bengal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) changes may occur due to natural and anthropogenic activities. The present study area is situated in the Himalayan foothill region of north-eastern India and covers around 1507 km2. This area comprises Siliguri Municipal Corporation (SMC) and the surrounding five community development blocks. Geopolitical location of the study area makes it significant as it is exposed to the negative impacts of human and commercial activities across the region. The present study aims to identify the LULC classes in the study area from 1991 to 2021 with their change dynamics and predict the LULC changes in 2050. Apart from these, a perception study is also carried out to identify the major drivers of LULC changes in the study area. After delineating the study area, supervised classification of Landsat satellite images was done applying the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) tool for the year 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2021. Each image was classified into six LULC classes i.e., vegetation, plantation, agricultural land, built up, water bodies and fallow land and the overall accuracy (average) of the classified maps is 88.83%. The result shows that vegetation, agricultural land and fallow land are decreased from 23% to 20%, 35%-28% and 23%-19% respectively and plantation and built up areas are significantly increased from 14% to 24% and 2%-8% respectively. Then the land change modeler (LCM) under multi layer perceptron neural network Markov Chain (MLPNN-MC) model was applied to predict the spatio-temporal LULC changes from 2021 to 2050. The result reveals that in 2050 built up areas will be increased significantly and are expected to cover almost 12% of the total study area and only 24% of agricultural land will be left. The model was validated by Pearson's chi-squared test and found no significant distinguishes between simulated and actual classified maps. For identifying the main drivers of the LULC changes in the study area people's perceptions were taken from 25 focus group discussions (FGD) randomly over the area. The result reveals that physical and economic location, immigration, development of transport network, increasing multi-functional land use, expansion of small trade and enterprises, and cutting of trees for fuel wood and construction purposes are the key drivers of LULC change for this particular region. The change in the land surface in this Sub-Himalayan region is threatened by unplanned urbanization and unorganized land use practices so, crucial measures are needed indeed.

TI  - Retrieval of Lake Ice Characteristics from SAR Imagery
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Boreal lakes ecosystems can remain partially or completely covered by ice and snow during an important portion of the year. Alterations of lake and river ice properties can deteriorate the conditions of local ice roads, negatively influencing Nordic communities and economical activities. Monitoring of lake ice characteristics and dynamics is therefore crucial. In this study, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery is exploited to evaluate changes in the ice regime over shallow and deep high-latitude lakes during the winters of 2018 and 2019. The methodology proposed, based on the combined analysis of SAR intensity and interferometric coherence maps, enables the extraction of important characteristics of ice dynamics. Overall, the lake ice thickness change derived from Differential Interferometric SAR (D-InSAR) increases with the lake depth. The D-InSAR-derived mean rate of growth, in general, agrees with the one estimated from records of in-situ ice thickness measurements. The methodology presented herein could be temporally extended to support the understanding of historical and current climate conditions. This could be done by using archived and newly available imagery to improve lake ice models.

TI  - Study of dynamics of coastal sediment cell boundary in Cirebon coastal area based on integrated shoreline Montecarlo model and remote sensing data
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of the coastal cell boundary in the Cirebon coast have been investigated. The edge of the sediment cell is unique, with a river mouth and very active shoreline movement. A groin like structure model with the sediment output at the end of the structure is solved analytically using Laplace transforms methods. The morphological changes of these cell sediment boundaries were analyzed using modeling, field measurements, and Landsat satellite data. The study area consists of a single cell with boundaries of fine sediments containing coral fractions. The middle cell is generally a beach with mangroves with fish or a salt pond beach. The observations using Landsat imagery from 1978 to 2021 show changes in the boundary of sediment cells moving forward to the west as far as 1230 m. We use 1985 as the initial cell boundary for our modeling, with a cell boundary length of 1200 m from the shoreline. The first scenario with constant sediment rate input get shoreline changes from 1100 m from the cell boundary. Still, a linear sediment rate results in the coastline moving upward to 1190 m. The third scenario with periodic sediment input with a monsoon period gives a coastline addition of 750 m at the estuary of the cell boundary and erosion (240 m) in an area far from the cell boundary. The Montecarlo simulation generates a breaking wave with a Gaussian random function that produces a breaking wave height with a dominant variation between 0.5 1.5 m. The evolution of the coastline with a constant sediment rate resulted in the most developed beach as far as 1000 m with a relatively large chance of reaching 4000. As for the linear rate, producing a coastline with the highest probability of about 1200 m and periodic sediment rates created the most significant for the coastline between 1000-2500 m.

TI  - Graph-based block-level urban change detection using Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology has been frequently used to obtain information on changes in urban land cover because of its vast spatial coverage and timeliness of observation. Block-level change detection with high tem-poral resolution image data provides fine detail of urban changes, is suitable for urban management, and has gradually received widespread attention. High-dimensional features are required to express the heterogeneous structure of the blocks. High-dimensional high-frequency time series, namely, multivariate time series, are formed by arranging high-dimensional features chronologically. Classic change detection methods treat multi-variate time series as univariate time series one by one. Few studies have analyzed the change in a multivariate time series by considering all variables as an entirety. Therefore, a graph-based segmentation for multivariate time series algorithm (MTS-GS) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, 1) we construct a similarity matrix to explore the changing patterns of multivariate time series for seasonal change, trend change, abrupt change, and noise disturbance; 2) a multivariate time series graph is defined based on the changing patterns; and 3) the corresponding graph segmentation algorithm is proposed in the paper to detect the abrupt and trend changes under noise and seasonal disturbances. Sentinel-2 images of the rapidly developing third-tier city of Luoyang, Henan province, China, are adopted to validate the algorithm. The F1-score in the spatial domain is 84.1%; the producer's and the user's accuracy in the temporal dimension are 81.8% and 80.1%, respectively. Seven change types are defined and extracted, showing the development pattern and the efficiency of land use in the city. Furthermore, the proposed MTS-GS can be used for pixel-level change detection and performs well under various time intervals and cloud covers.

TI  - Influence of underlying surface change caused by urban renewal on land surface temperatures in Central Guangzhou
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change during urban renewal can have important impacts on ecological and environment indices. Exploring the impact of different urban renewal modes on land surface temperature (LST) is significant to city planning and the realization of urban sustainability. In this study, we selected five urban renewal regions of Central Guangzhou that are undergoing comprehensive or micro transformation. Deeplab V3+ was used to extract land use data from high-resolution remote sensing images; combined with LST data retrieved from Landsat series images, Pearson correlation analysis and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) analysis were used to explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of LST affected by underlying surface changes that were caused by urban renewal. The results indicate that urban renewal in all regions generated positive effects on LST reduction. However, comprehensive transformations in the diversity of land use types and more landscape pattern changes had higher potential for LST cooling effect than micro transformations. Owing to the heating effect of concrete, the LST peak point usually occurred in the block demolition phase of urban renewal. The transformation from dense low-rise to scattered high-rise buildings achieved LST cooling effect through shadows and ventilation to heat dissipation. In addition, parks with large areas of trees had stronger cooling capacity than other vegetation or farmland patches, and scattered vegetation patches played the role of connecting the influence of vegetation. Overall, appropriate transformation of architecture and green space landscape patterns are crucial to achieve LST cooling effect during urban renewal.

TI  - A global land aerosol fine-mode fraction dataset (2001-2020) retrieved from MODIS using hybrid physical and deep learning approaches
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol fine-mode fraction (FMF) is valuable for discriminating natural aerosols from anthro-pogenic ones. However, most current satellite-based FMF products are highly unreliable over land. Here, we developed a new satellite-based global land daily FMF dataset (Phy-DL FMF) by synergizing the advantages of physical and deep learning methods at a 1 degrees spatial resolution covering the period from 2001 to 2020. The Phy-DL FMF dataset is comparable to Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements, based on the analysis of 361 089 data samples from 1170 AERONET sites around the world. Overall, Phy-DL FMF showed a root-meansquare error (RMSE) of 0.136 and correlation coefficient of 0.68, and the proportion of results that fell within the +/- 20% expected error (EE) envelopes was 79.15 %. Moreover, the out-of-site validation from the Surface Radiation Budget (SURFRAD) observations revealed that the RMSE of Phy-DL FMF is 0.144 (72.50% of the results fell within the +/- 20% EE). Phy-DL FMF showed superior performance over alternative deep learning or physical approaches (such as the spectral deconvolution algorithm presented in our previous studies), particularly for forests, grasslands, croplands, and urban and barren land types. As a long-term dataset, Phy-DL FMF is able to show an overall significant decreasing trend (at a 95% significance level) over global land areas. Based on the trend analysis of Phy-DL FMF for different countries, the upward trend in the FMFs was particularly strong over India and the western USA. Overall, this study provides a new FMF dataset for global land areas that can help improve our understanding of spatiotemporal fine-mode and coarse-mode aerosol changes. The datasets can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5105617 (Yan, 2021).

TI  - Analysis of spatiotemporal changes and driving factors of desertification in the Africa Sahel
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The transitional characteristics of desert grasslands in the Sahel determine the ecosystem's fragility, which is extremely susceptible to the expansion and reversal of land desertification under the influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Accordingly, monitoring desertification dynamics is essential to combat this process. Based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, this study analysed the applicability of different feature space models to monitor desertification levels in the Sahel from 2000 to 2020, revealing the optimal monitoring model, analysing the spatiotemporal changes and primary driving factors. The results were as follows: In the Sahel, the albedo-modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) based on the point-to-point model is the best for desertification monitoring, with an overall accuracy of 86.78%. Generally, the level of desertification was reduced from 2000 to 2020, the area of extremely severe desertification decreased by retreating northward; and the areas of light, moderate, and severe desertification increased slowly by expanding northward. Light, moderate, and severe desertification lands were more sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic activities, undergoing greater change intensity. Precipitation was the most influential factor determining the spatial distribution of desertification in the Sahel, with anthropogenic activities also having a significant effect on the desertification level. This study comprehensively analysed desertification patterns in the Sahel and identified the primary driving factors, which are essential to inform Sahelian desertification control mechanisms in the future.

TI  - DINCAE 2.0: multivariate convolutional neural network with error estimates to reconstruct sea surface temperature satellite and altimetry observations
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - DINCAE (Data INterpolating Convolutional Auto-Encoder) is a neural network used to reconstruct missing data (e.g., obscured by clouds or gaps between tracks) in satellite data. Contrary to standard image reconstruction (in-painting) with neural networks, this application requires a method to handle missing data (or data with variable accuracy) already in the training phase. Instead of using a standard L2 (or L1) cost function, the neural network (U-Net type of network) is optimized by minimizing the negative log likelihood assuming a Gaussian distribution (characterized by a mean and a variance). As a consequence, the neural network also provides an expected error variance of the reconstructed field (per pixel and per time instance). In this updated version DINCAE 2.0, the code was rewritten in Julia and a new type of skip connection has been implemented which showed superior performance with respect to the previous version. The method has also been extended to handle multivariate data (an example will be shown with sea surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration and wind fields). The improvement of this network is demonstrated for the Adriatic Sea. Convolutional networks work usually with gridded data as input. This is however a limitation for some data types used in oceanography and in Earth sciences in general, where observations are often irregularly sampled. The first layer of the neural network and the cost function have been modified so that unstructured data can also be used as inputs to obtain gridded fields as output. To demonstrate this, the neural network is applied to along-track altimetry data in the Mediterranean Sea. Results from a 20-year reconstruction are presented and validated. Hyperparameters are determined using Bayesian optimization and minimizing the error relative to a development dataset.

TI  - Highland forest's environmental complexity drives landscape genomics and connectivity of the rodent <i>Peromyscus melanotis</i>
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Deciphering how the complex environmental dynamics of highland temperate forests drive local patterns of genetic variation is key to understanding species diversity and distribution. Objectives Evaluate how the environmental complexity of La Malinche volcano influences patterns of genomic variation in Peromyscus melanotis, across two mountain slopes and global and regional geographic scales. Methods Using reduced representation genomic sequencing we estimated population genetic diversity, subdivisions and migration rates. Remote sensing data and drone image processing were used to characterize landscape variables. We evaluated their effect on connectivity, based on a landscape analyses framework, using resistance surfaces, circuit theory and omnidirectional connectivity. Results In our global analysis assessing multiple elevation levels on two mountain slopes, we identified three genetic clusters differentiating two elevation levels of the north mountain slope (ECLM; 3150 m, 3300 m) from the rest of sampled areas. Within the northeast mountain slope (CVM), we found reduced genetic variation, limited connectivity, fewer migrants and isolation in higher elevation populations. ECLM populations showed higher genetic diversity and lowest connectivity at intermediate levels. NDVI and tree height were the main factors promoting connectivity in CVM, while tree height and litter cover were most important in ECLM. Conclusions Our findings showed how the forest environmental complexity across different geographic scales drives dispersal, genomic structure and connectivity patterns in this rodent, where dirt roads and disturbed areas limit its connectivity, while exhibiting higher connectivity at the highest elevations where the forest is less disturbed. Notably, that our 3D variable of tree height was significant demonstrates the utility in incorporating 3D vegetation structure variables into landscape genetic analyses.

TI  - Socio-economic determinants of land use and land cover change in South-Kivu wetlands, eastern D.R. Congo: Case study of Hogola and Chisheke wetlands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the South-Kivu province, wetlands are mainly converted into farmlands to ensure food and income security among rural populations. This study aimed at assessing the land use and land cover (LULC) change for the last three decades (1990-2020) in South-Kivu wetlands; mainly the Hogola and Chisheke, in Walungu territory, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Socioeconomic determinants of LULC in the two wetlands were also assessed. Google earth (CNI/ airbus) and airborne images were used for LULC while socio-economic data were collected through a survey questionnaire from 369 households. The Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) model allowed assessing factors determining conversion of wetlands' use. For the last three decades, there were 30 and 40% decreases in the acreage covered by Hogola and Chisheke wetlands, respectively, as a result of rapid farmland expansion and brick making. Farmers perceived wetlands as wastelands and thus unfit for agriculture and brick making activities. These two human activities provided significant monetary benefits to wetland users though the profitability of agriculture was dependent on practiced crops. The conversion of wetlands into farmlands was driven by annual household income, wetland utilization patterns, households' main activity and the seniority in exploiting wetlands. The perception of wetlands as degraded and wastelands, the exploited acreage and the farmer gender had also influenced significantly wetland conversions. On the other hand, perceiving wetlands as wastelands depended on the age of the household head, the inclination to brick making activities, the household's main activity and crop, and the wetland traditional/cultural values in the South-Kivu province. Though generating significantly higher annual incomes than any other land use in target wetlands, the conversion of wetlands for agriculture and brick making, under the current practices, is unsuitable for their sustainable management (use), as recommended to achieve the RAMSAR objectives of "wise use" of wetlands.

TI  - Modelling daily air temperature at a fine spatial resolution dealing with challenging meteorological phenomena and topography in Switzerland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Epidemiological studies investigating the relationship between air temperature or heat and health, still, by and large, rely on either information from the nearest weather station or on coarse gridded temperature predictions, thereby ignoring small-scale intra-urban variations. Recent methodological advances show promise in achieving high spatiotemporal temperature predictions, thus improving the characterization of spatial variations in temperature and decreasing bias in health studies. Here, we applied a two-stage approach using random forest to (a) impute missing moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature at a 1 x 1 km resolution and (b) to use the gap-filled MODIS data to explain spatiotemporal variation in the measured ground-based air temperature data at a 100 x 100 m resolution across Switzerland using a range of predictor variables, including meteorological parameters, normalized difference vegetation index, impervious surface and altitude. Models presented here managed to capture temporal and spatial variations in air temperature in Switzerland from 2003 to 2018 at a fine spatial resolution of 100 x 100 m. Stage 1 models achieved an overall R-2 of 0.98 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.49 degrees C (independent validation), and the stage 2 model performed well for all years with R-2 and RMSE ranging from 0.94 to 0.99 and 1.05 to 1.86 degrees C, respectively. We were also able to capture the urban heat island effect and some typical weather phenomena caused by Switzerland's complex topography, like the foehn effect and inversion conditions. The resulting daily temperature surfaces for 2003-2018 will facilitate ongoing epidemiological research investigating the health effects of heat.

TI  - Spatio-temporal coupling coordination analysis between marsh vegetation and hydrology change from 1985 to 2019 using LandTrendr algorithm and Google Earth Engine
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction between marsh vegetation and hydrology has become one of the hotspots in the field of ecosystem research. Taking the Honghe National Nature Reserve as the study area, this paper integrated the GEE platform and LandTrendr algorithm to build a spatio-temporal monitoring model for marsh vegetation and hydrology change using remote sensing techniques for the first time. The temporal and spatial dynamics of disturbance and restoration of marsh vegetation and hydrology from 1985 to 2019 were monitored. The Magnitude and Duration were selected to explore the temporal and spatial dynamic evolution of marsh vegetation and hydrology in the past 35 years. At the same time, an innovative coupling coordination model of marsh vegetation and hydrology was constructed to quantitatively assess the relationship between vegetation loss and restoration and hydrology change. The sensitivity analysis of the coupling relationship between marsh vegetation and hydrology was carried out by the transfer entropy model, and the influencing factors of marsh vegetation change were determined using the transfer rate. The results showed that: (1) This paper integrates the time series Landsat series images and the LandTrendr algorithm to monitor the dynamic changes of marsh vegetation and hydrology, and the accuracy rates are 83.68% and 85.78%, respectively, which proves that this method can effectively monitor the spatiotemporal evolution of marsh vegetation and hydrology. (2) In the past 35 years, the marsh vegetation in the study area has generally shown a recovery trend, and the recovery duration is & nbsp; >= 20 years. The vegetation disturbance is fragmented and marginalized, and the disturbance duration is less than 20 years. (3) The quadratic regression model was utilized to quantify the correlation between marsh vegetation and hydrology changes. The R2 between vegetation loss and restoration, and hydrology reached 0.885 and 0.811, respectively, which indicated that there is a significant correlation between wetland hydrology and vegetation changes. (4) The relationship between marsh vegetation and hydrology were in a state of imbalance from 1985 to 2019, but there was a high level of coupling between vegetation loss and hydrological changes. (5) The transfer entropy from hydrological changes to vegetation loss and restoration is significantly larger than the transfer entropy from marsh vegetation loss and restoration to hydrological changes, which indicated that hydrological changes are the driving factor for marsh vegetation loss and restoration.

TI  - A generalized model to predict large-scale crop yields integrating satellite-based vegetation index time series and phenology metrics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convenient and reliable large-scale crop yield prediction is needed when formulating administrative plans and ensuring food security, especially under changing climate and international conditions. In this study, we explored Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices-and phenology-based yield prediction generalization model taking the US Corn Belt as an example. We calculated the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and 2-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) time series, which were adjusted using greenup dates derived from the Land Cover Dynamics product MCD12Q2. Based on the adjusted VI (NDVI, EVI2) time series, the VI change rate (dVI) time series was calculated, which represents crop growth rate. The first step was to cluster the adjusted VI and dVI time series, called 'greenup groups', according to corresponding greenup dates with a five-day interval. Then in different greenup groups, we constructed empirical univariate models with VI having the maximum correlation with crop yield, and multivariate models with VI and dVI, which were also used to construct the generalized model. After clustering, the days with maximum VI correlation gradually decreased as greenup days increasing, and the univariate VI model and multivariate VI and dVI model performances in different groups improved. The generalized models with specific VI and dVI variables in each group predicted yields of corn and soybean with R-2 values mainly ranging from 0.55 to 0.75 and 0.55 to 0.70, while RMSE mainly ranging from 1000 to 1500 kg/ha and 300 to 400 kg/ha for both NDVI and EVI2 from 2008 to 2018 with leave-one-year-out cross-validation for all groups. The model using MODIS data was convenient and scalable with limited data requirements and date-determined variables after greenup, and offered a generalized method to predict crop yields at a large scale before harvest with good performance.

TI  - Myeloid Ikaros-SIRT1 signaling axis regulates hepatic inflammation and pyroptosis in ischemia-stressed mouse and human liver
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background & Aims: Although Ikaros (IKZF1) is a well-established transcriptional regulator in leukocyte lymphopoiesis and differentiation, its role in myeloid innate immune responses remains unclear. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a histone/protein deacetylase involved in cellular senescence, inflammation, and stress resistance. Whether SIRT1 signaling is essential in myeloid cell activation remains uncertain, while the molecular communication between Ikaros and SIRT1, two major transcriptional regulators, has not been studied.Methods: We undertook molecular and functional studies to interrogate the significance of the myeloid Ikaros-SIRT1 axis in innate immune activation and whether it may serve as a homeostatic sentinel in human liver transplant recipients (hepatic biopsies) and murine models of sterile hepatic inflammation (liver warm ischemia-reperfusion injury in wild-type, myeloid-specific Sirt1-knockout, and CD11b-DTR mice) as well as primary bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMM) cultures (Ikaros silencing vs. overexpression).Results: In our clinical study, we identified increased postreperfusion hepatic Ikaros levels, accompanied by augmented inflammasome signaling yet depressed SIRT1, as a mechanism of hepatocellular damage in liver transplant recipients. In our experimental studies, we identified infiltrating macrophages as the major source of Ikaros in IR-stressed mouse livers. Then, we demonstrated that Ikaros-regulated pyroptosis - induced by canonical inflammasome signaling in BMM cultures - was SIRT1 dependent. Consistent with the latter, myeloid-specific Ikaros signaling augmented hepatic pyroptosis to aggravate proinflammatory responses in vivo by negatively regulating SIRT1 in an AMPK-dependent manner. Finally, myeloid-specific SIRT1 was required to suppress pyroptosis, pro-inflammatory phenotype, and ultimately mitigate hepatocellular injury in ischemia-stressed murine livers.Conclusion: These findings identify the Ikaros-SIRT1 axis as a novel mechanistic biomarker of pyroptosis and a putative checkpoint regulator of homeostasis in response to acute hepatic stress/injury in mouse and human livers.Lay summary: This report describes how crosstalk between Ikaros and SIRT1, two major transcriptional regulators, influence acute hepatic inflammation in murine models of liver ischemia-reperfusion injury and liver transplant recipients. We show that the myeloid Ikaros-SIRT1 axis regulates inflammasome-pyroptotic cell death and hepatocellular damage in stressed livers. Thus, the Ikaros-SIRT1 axis may serve as a novel checkpoint regulator that is required for homeostasis in response to acute liver injury in mice and humans. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Drones reveal spatial patterning of sympatric Alaskan pinniped species and drivers of their local distributions
T2  - DRONE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic and its adjacent ecosystems are undergoing rapid ecological reorgani-zation in response to the effects of global climate change, and sentinel species provide criti-cal updates as these changes unfold. This study leverages emerging remote sensing techniques to reveal fine-scale drivers of distribution and terrestrial habitat use of two sympatric sentinel species of the central Bering Sea, the Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardii (Gray, 1864)) and the northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus (Linnaeus, 1758)), at non-breeding haul-outs in the Pribilof Islands. We surveyed these species using unoccupied air-craft systems with thermal and visible-light photography, and we applied distributional modeling techniques to quantify the relative influence of habitat characteristics and social dynamics on the local distributions of these species. Drone imagery yielded locations and population counts of each species, and spatial data products allowed quantitative charac-terization of occupied sites, revealing that conspecific attraction is a driver of local site selection for both species, and Pacific harbor seals and northern fur seals are differentially limited by terrain characteristics. These findings represent new applications of species dis-tribution modeling at local scales, made possible by ultra-high resolution drone surveillance and photogrammetric techniques, which add new spatial context to past observations and future scenarios in this changing ecosystem.

TI  - Variability of Aerosols and Clouds Over North Indian and Myanmar During the COVID-19 Lockdown Period
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The implementation of a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 disease has reduced the loading of anthropogenic aerosols. However, AOD distribution over South Asia during the lockdown period shows a dipole pattern: reduction over North Indian and enhancement over the Myanmar region. This dipole pattern is evident in some datasets (MODIS, MERRA, and CALIPSO). MODIS fire counts collocated with CALIPSO smoke aerosols show enhancement over Myanmar indicating the contribution from fires. However, over the North India region number of fires during the lockdown period are less compared to climatology. Thus, the observed reduction in AOD is due to fires and anthropogenic sources. Our analysis shows that aerosols originating from biomass burning forms a layer (900-600 hPa) over the Myanmar region that produces atmospheric heating (0-2.8 K/day) that eventually leads to cloud dissipation/burning (negative in-atmospheric cloud radiative forcing similar to -13 W/m(2)) and precipitation reduction (-1 to -4 mm) over Myanmar. In contrast, the aerosol reduction over North India favors cloud formation, that is, increase in cloud cover and reduction in specific cloud liquid water content leading to precipitation enhancement, indicating the anti-Twomey effect.

TI  - Temporal Stability of Seagrass Extent, Leaf Area, and Carbon Storage in St. Joseph Bay, Florida: a Semi-automated Remote Sensing Analysis
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrasses are globally recognized for their contribution to blue carbon sequestration. However, accurate quantification of their carbon storage capacity remains uncertain due, in part, to an incomplete inventory of global seagrass extent and assessment of its temporal variability. Furthermore, seagrasses are undergoing significant decline globally, which highlights the urgent need to develop change detection techniques applicable to both the scale of loss and the spatial complexity of coastal environments. This study applied a deep learning algorithm to a 30-year time series of Landsat 5 through 8 imagery to quantify seagrass extent, leaf area index (LAI), and belowground organic carbon (BGC) in St. Joseph Bay, Florida, between 1990 and 2020. Consistent with previous field-based observations regarding stability of seagrass extent throughout St. Joseph Bay, there was no temporal trend in seagrass extent (23 +/- 3 km(2), tau = 0.09, p = 0.59, n = 31), LAI (1.6 +/- 0.2, tau = -0.13, p = 0.42, n = 31), or BGC (165 +/- 19 g C m(-2), tau = - 0.01, p = 0.1, n = 31) over the 30-year study period. There were, however, six brief declines in seagrass extent between the years 2004 and 2019 following tropical cyclones, from which seagrasses recovered rapidly. Fine-scale interannual variability in seagrass extent, LAI, and BGC was unrelated to sea surface temperature or to climate variability associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation or the North Atlantic Oscillation. Although our temporal assessment showed that seagrass and its belowground carbon were stable in St. Joseph Bay from 1990 to 2020, forecasts suggest that environmental and climate pressures are ongoing, which highlights the importance of the method and time series presented here as a valuable tool to quantify decadal-scale variability in seagrass dynamics. Perhaps more importantly, our results can serve as a baseline against which we can monitor future change in seagrass communities and their blue carbon.

TI  - High-spatiotemporal resolution mapping of spatiotemporally continuous atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over the global continent
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is an important variable that connects the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. However, satellite-observed atmospheric CO2 concentrations are always spatially discrete, and spatiotemporally continuous atmospheric CO2 concentration maps with fine resolution are scarce at the global scale. Therefore, a spatiotemporally continuous CO2 concentration dataset with high-spatiotemporal resolution was generated based on satellite CO2 observations and environmental factors in this study. First, the environmental factors affecting atmospheric CO2 concentrations were selected, and by integrating the atmospheric CO2 concentration data observed by the OCO-2 satellite, a sample dataset was created. The extreme random tree (ERT) model was then trained to determine the relationship between environmental factors and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Finally, spatiotemporally continuous atmospheric CO2 concentration data (0.01 degrees and 8-day resolution) over the global continent were generated based on the established ERT model and environmental data. Validation results based on ground atmospheric CO2 concentration observations indicated that the estimated atmospheric CO2 concentration achieved satisfactory performance with coefficients of determination and root mean square errors of 0.83 and 1.79 ppm, respectively. The spatiotemporal analysis found that the distribution of atmospheric CO2 concentrations had obvious seasonal patterns and spatial heterogeneity across different climatic zones. The generated atmospheric CO2 concentration data have the potential for subsequent studies of global climate change and carbon cycling.

TI  - Effects of Forbush decreases on clouds determined from PATMOS-x
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the relationship between cosmic rays and clouds during Forbush decreases (FDs) to understand the cause-effect relationships between cloud microphysics, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and ionisation in the atmosphere. The results of a Monte Carlo analysis of cloud parameters during FDs, which were obtained using newly calibrated satellite data (Pathfinder Atmospheres Extended (PATMOS-x)) from 1978 to 2018, show the connections between some cloud parameters and FDs. For context, FD is the event where the number of cosmic rays arriving in the atmosphere decreases and recovers over several days. Other studies have shown that FDs impacted the cloud fraction, aerosol optical depth, CCN, water content, and cloud effective radius (r(eff)) in the atmosphere. Using the Monte Carlo analysis, nine atmospheric parameters from the dataset were evaluated and exhibited a significant response to FDs. Each added FD event (after the first event) reduces the noise, but only the strongest events add a significant signal (exceptionally when the 2nd and 5th rank FD data are added, the signal/noise ration dropped due to a change in the satellite version). We found that cloud fraction shows statistically significant signals following FDs at an achieved significance level of 0.33%. Cloud emissivity also showed highly significant signals from the analysis; however, these cannot be classified as physical causes of FDs since the response starts a week before the FDs. In contrast, the cloud optical depth, integrated total cloud water over the entire column, and r(eff) did not show any significant signals in the frameworks of the applied methods. The top of the atmosphere brightness temperatures (TABTs) at nominal wavelengths of 3.75, 11.0, and 12.0 mu m were analysed again along with surface BTs and showed significant signals. The estimated changes in the BT were determined using a radiative transfer model (Fu-Liou model) and showed consistent results with the observed changes in cloud parameters during FD events. Among the analysed several atmospheric/cloud/aerosol parameters, cloud fraction and TABT at nominal wavelengths of 3.75, 11.0, and 12.0 mu m are the only parameters depicting a statistically significant and correct-phase response to FDs.

TI  - Field-scale rice yield prediction from Sentinel-2 monthly image composites using machine learning algorithms
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning (ML) along with high volume of satellite images offers an alternative to agronomists in crop yield predictions for decision support systems. This research exploited the possibility of using monthly image composites from Sentinel-2 imageries for rice crop yield predictions one month before the harvesting period at the field level using ML techniques in Taiwan. Three ML models, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN), were designed to address the research question of yield predictions in four consecutive growing seasons from 2019 to 2020 using field survey data. The research findings of yield modeling and predictions showed that SVM slightly outperformed RF and ANN. The results of model validation, obtained from SVM models using the data from transplanting to ripening, showed that the root mean square percentage error (RMSPE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values were 5.5% and 4.5% for the 2019 second crop, and 4.7% and 3.5% for the 2020 first crop, respectively. The results of yield predictions (obtained from SVM) for the 2019 second crop and the 2020 first crop evaluated against the government statistics indicated a close agreement between these two datasets, with the RMSPE and MAPE values generally smaller than 11.2% and 9.2%. The SVM model configuration parameters used for rice crop yield predictions indicated satisfactory results. The comparison results between the predicted yields and the official statistics showed slight underestimations, with RMSPE and MAPE values of 9.4% and 7.1% for the 2019 first crop (hindcast), and 11.0% and 9.4% for the 2020 second crop (forecast), respectively. This study has successfully proven the validity of our methods for yield modeling and prediction from monthly composites from Sentinel-2 imageries using ML algorithms. The research findings from this research work could useful for agronomists to timely formulate action plans to address national food security issues.

TI  - Spatial distribution of aerosol optical depth over India during COVID-19 lockdown phase-1
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study analysed the spatial distribution of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over India during the COVID-19 lockdown phase -1 (March 25 to April 15, 2020) using MODIS Terra (MOD04) AOD data (550 nm) during 2001-2020. Air temperature, rainfall, forest fire incidents, and wind patterns were analysed to understand their effect on the distribution of aerosols over India during the lockdown phase-1. Moderate absorption fine aerosol type is predominant but sparsely distributed over India during the study period compared to the reference period indicating the positive influence of the lockdown. Mean AOD has reduced by 9% over India during the lockdown phase-1 compared to the corresponding mean of the past 19 years (2001-2019). About 70% of the states/UTs of India showed a reduction in mean AOD due to restrictions on non-essential economic activities and rainfall occurrence. However, some states showed an increase in aerosol loading over specific pockets despite the restrictions on economic activities (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Assam, Nagaland, Manipur and Karnataka) because of active forest fire cases. This study would be helpful for planners and policymakers to adopt suitable measures to control the rising concentrations of aerosols over hotspot regions of India.

TI  - Textural and compositional effects of ilmenite on the spectra of high-titanium lunar basalts
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary objective of this work is to constrain the physical and chemical effects of ilmenite on the spectral properties of high-titanium lunar basalts. Here we use a combination of electron probe microanalysis, x-ray diffraction and VIS-NIR spectroscopy to characterize a suite of Apollo 17 High-Ti lunar basalts and a suite of synthetic laboratory derived binary mixtures to further understand the mixing systematics of opaque Fe-Ti oxides in a transparent silicate matrix. We demonstrate how the texture (particle size and shape) and compo-sition (Fe-Mg content) of ilmenite exhibit strong controls over the spectral parameters of bulk basalts in the VIS-NIR wavelength range. We show that the presence of fine-grained ilmenite as opposed to coarse-grained ilmenite in high-Ti basalts causes suppression of pyroxene, olivine, and plagioclase absorption features, lowers reflectance values, and induces a stronger 'red' spectral slope at wavelengths > 1.8 mu m. These effects are considerably stronger for samples with fine-grained ilmenite crystals compared with coarse-grained samples that have similar ilmenite abundance. In addition, we show that minor variations in the Mg2+ content of ilmenite significantly alters the strength of the 1 mu m feature and the slope above 1.8 mu m, which similarly affects the spectral parameters of the bulk basalt. Our results indicate that lunar basalts with lower abundance of fine-grained ilmenite with slightly higher Mg content could exhibit a spectrum with an apparently stronger ilmenite signature when compared to basalts with more abundant, coarser ilmenite. Results presented here suggest that the accuracy of spectral mixing models of remotely sensed data on the Moon would improve by incorporating additional spectral end-members of ilmenite to better represent the compositional variability.

TI  - Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction and BinaxNOW Rapid Antigen Tests at a Community Site During an Omicron Surge A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests are an important public health tool.Objective: To evaluate field performance of the BinaxNOW rapid antigen test (Abbott) compared with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting infection with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2.Design: Cross-sectional surveillance study.Setting: Free, walk-up, outdoor, urban community testing and vaccine site led by Unidos en Salud, serving a predominantly Latinx community highly impacted by COVID-19.Participants: Persons seeking COVID-19 testing in January 2022.Measurements: Simultaneous BinaxNOW and RT-PCR from nasal, cheek, and throat swabs, including cycle threshold (Ct) measures; a lower Ct value is a surrogate for higher amounts of virus.Results: Among 731 persons tested with nasal swabs, there were 296 (40.5%) positive results on RT-PCR; 98.9% were the Omicron variant. BinaxNOW detected 95.2% (95% CI, 91% to 98%) of persons who tested positive on RT-PCR with a Ct value below 30, 82.1% (CI, 77% to 87%) of those who tested positive on RT-PCR with a Ct value below 35, and 65.2% (CI, 60% to 71%) of all who were positive on RT-PCR. Among 75 persons with simultaneous nasal and cheek swabs, BinaxNOW using a cheek swab failed to detect 91% (20 of 22) of specimens that were positive on BinaxNOW with a nasal swab. Among persons with simultaneous nasal and throat swabs who were positive on RT-PCR with a Ct value below 30, 42 of 49 (85.7%) were detected by nasal BinaxNOW, 23 of 49 (46.9%) by throat BinaxNOW, and 44 of 49 (89.8%) by either.Limitation: Participants were a cross-sectional sample from a community-based sentinel surveillance site, precluding study of viral or symptom dynamics.Conclusion: BinaxNOW detected persons with high SARS-CoV-2 levels during the Omicron surge, enabling rapid responses to positive test results. Cheek or throat swabs should not replace nasal swabs. As currently recommended, high-risk persons with an initial negative BinaxNOW result should have repeated testing.

TI  - Internal Mammary Lymph Node Biopsy during Microsurgical Breast Reconstruction: A Prospective Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF RECONSTRUCTIVE MICROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Accurate assessment of regional lymph node basins is critical for oncological management of breast cancer. The internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) basin directly drains the medial pole of the breast, but biopsy is not commonly performed. While the axillary sentinel lymph node sample remains the standard of care, the majority of patients who have been found to have a positive IMLN biopsy have simultaneously had negative axillary sentinel lymph nodes. This study prospectively examines routine IMLN biopsy during microsurgical breast reconstruction. Methods An IRB-approved study of routine IMLN biopsies in 270 consecutive patients who underwent microsurgical breast reconstruction was performed from July 1, 2018, to June 1, 2021. Recorded data included unilateral or bilateral breast reconstruction, unilateral or bilateral IMLN sampling, patient demographics, disease stage, and pathologic findings of IMLN. Results The majority of patients, 240 of 270 patients (88.9%), had bilateral reconstruction. Overall, 5 out of 270 (1.9%) patients had positive IMLN; one of these patients had positive axillary sentinel lymph nodes. The IMLN biopsy results in two of the five patients affected the clinical course as they were upstaged and required chemoradiation. Conclusion Direct visualization of the internal mammary lymph nodes during dissection of the recipient vessels for microsurgical breast reconstruction allows for convenient sampling, with minimal donor site morbidity and enhances the therapeutic management of patients in whom nodal involvement is present. As such, the authors recommend IMLN sampling.

TI  - Improving genomic prediction accuracy for harvest traits in Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer, Bloch 1790) via marker selection
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Genomic selection provides an efficient strategy to improve growth performance and processing traits in aquaculture. However, the high cost of genotyping animals using high-density SNP arrays may prevent its application in small-sized breeding programs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of low-density SNPs for genomic prediction of harvest traits in Asian seabass. A total of 1047 fish were genotyped for 29,521 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using the weighted genomic best linear unbiased prediction (wGBLUP) procedure revealed polygenic nature of harvest traits. GBLUP and BayesB were implemented using five sets of informative SNPs specific to each trait (ranging from 500 to 12,000) and five sets of evenly-spaced markers at the same density. Prediction accuracies were evaluated using five-fold crossvalidation with five replications. Using trait-specific panels with the largest effects of 500 to 2000 SNPs under GBLUP, prediction accuracies increased substantially for all traits relative to those from full SNPs, i.e., by -70% for body weight (BW), by -100% for standard length (SL), by -97% for fillet weight (FW) and by -660% for fillet yield (FY). A similar trend in prediction accuracy was observed from BayesB. Improvement in accuracy was marginal for evenly-spaced markers compared to full SNPs, i.e., by -25% for BW, SL, FW and by -30% for FY. Close relationship between training and validation fish appeared to be a major contributing factor to the favorable performance of prediction models for the within-family selection scheme of Asian seabass.

TI  - Development and validation of a nomogram incorporating gene expression profiling and clinical factors for accurate prediction of metastasis in patients with cutaneous melanoma following Mohs micrographic surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is a need to improve prognostic accuracy for patients with cutaneous melanoma. A 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) test uses the molecular biology of primary tumors to identify individual patient metastatic risk. Objective: Develop a nomogram incorporating 31-GEP with relevant clinical factors to improve prognostic accuracy. Methods: In an IRB-approved study, 1124 patients from 9 Mohs micrographic surgery centers were prospectively enrolled, treated with Mohs micrographic surgery, and underwent 31-GEP testing. Data from 684 of those patients with at least 1-year follow-up or a metastatic event were included in nomogram development to predict metastatic risk. Results: Logistic regression modeling of 31-GEP results and T stage provided the simplest nomogram with the lowest Bayesian information criteria score. Validation in an archival cohort (n = 901) demonstrated a significant linear correlation between observed and nomogram-predicted risk of metastasis. The resulting nomogram more accurately predicts the risk for cutaneous melanoma metastasis than T stage or 31-GEP alone. Limitations: The patient population is representative of Mohs micrographic surgery centers. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was not performed for most patients and could not be used in the nomogram. Conclusions: Integration of 31-GEP and T stage can gain clinically useful prognostic information from data obtained noninvasively. ( J Am Acad Dermatol 2022;86:846-53.)

TI  - Global Trends of Forest Loss Due to Fire From 2001 to 2019
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions and can negatively affect public health, economic activity, and provision of ecosystem services. In boreal forests, fires are a part of the ecosystem dynamics, while in the humid tropics, fires are largely human-induced and lead to forest degradation. Studies have shown changing fire dynamics across the globe due to both climate and land use change. However, global trends in fire-related forest loss remain uncertain due to the lack of a globally consistent methodology applied to high spatial resolution data. Here, we create the first global 30-m resolution satellite-based map of annual forest loss due to fire. When producing this map, we match the mapped area of forest loss due to fire to the reference area obtained using a sample-based unbiased estimator, thus enabling map-based area reporting and trend analysis. We find an increasing global trend in forest loss due to fire from 2001 to 2019, driven by near-uniform increases across the tropics, subtropical, and temperate Australia, and boreal Eurasia. The results quantify the increasing threat of fires to remaining forests globally and may improve modeling of future forest fire loss rates under various climate change and development scenarios.

TI  - Narrative Conflict and Implied Value Conflict: An Analysis of Aspects of the Implied Worldview of Richard Morgan's <i>Altered</i> <i>Carbon</i> (2002) and Hanif Kureishi's <i>The Body</i> (2002)
T2  - ANGLIA-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ENGLISCHE PHILOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay examines the narrative conflicts in the cyberpunk novel Altered Carbon and the neo-gothic novella The Body. The theoretical assumption of the analyses is that narrative conflict can serve as an indicator of aspects of a text's implied worldview: more specifically, narrative conflict is presumed to be indicative of an implied value conflict. Resorting to a spatial conflict model based on Jurij Lotman's concept of border crossing, the essay argues that both texts differ substantially regarding the values they negotiate despite both deploying the transhumanist concept of body swapping. Whereas Altered Carbon places a socio-economic conflict at its core, The Body negotiates a metaphysical conflict. Accordingly, Altered Carbon discusses the construction of self-worth in view of an economically and socially overpowering opponent, whereas The Body emerges as a search for a value which can fill the void created by the dwindling relevance of religious notions of eternity in a secular world.

TI  - Sediment connectivity of small watershed affected by gully development and vegetation restoration on the loess plateau
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment connectivity can reflect the linkage between sediment source and sink, and identify the hotspot of soil conservation in watersheds. Potential effects of gully development and vegetation restoration on sediment connectivity are not fully understood. This study was performed to quantify the temporal changes in sediment connectivity reflected by the index of connectivity (IC) triggered by the coupling effect of gully development and vegetation restoration in a representative small watershed in the Loess Plateau. Google maps and Landsat images were used to determine gully characteristics and vegetation coverage. Based on the source-sink landscape index, weights of different land use types were computed using the K and C factors of the Universal Soil Loess Equation to calculate the IC. Partial least squares regression was used to quantify the contribution of gully development and vegetation restoration to the IC. The results showed that IC decreased significantly from-1.27 in 2000 to-8.15 in 2020 due to rapid vegetation restoration. Sediment connectivity increased with slope gradient but decreased with vegetation coverage. Compared with grassland, sediment connectivity decreased by 0.35-2.86 for cropland and 1.29-3.56 for forestland from 2000 to 2020. Moreover, the length, width, circumference, and area of gullies increased by at least 73% from 2000 to 2010, and the rate of increase declined greatly with the effective implementation of vegetation restoration. With the increase in slope gradient, gully development became more intense, and the IC increased. The gully length, width, circumference and area, and IC of shady and semi-shady slope aspects were 27.25%, 23.29%, 26.76% and 61.46%, and 5.8%-18.6% less than that of sunny and semi-sunny slope aspects. Vegetation restoration inhibited sediment connectivity, whereas gully develop-ment promoted sediment connectivity. Overall, the decrease in sediment connectivity triggered by vegetation restoration was much greater than the increase induced by gully development. The results of this study help understand the change in sediment connectivity over time under the comprehensive impact of vegetation restoration and gully development at small watershed scales in semi-arid regions.

TI  - Vulvar cancer during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding: a report of five cases from a single center study at the University Hospital of Dusseldorf
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The incidence of vulvar cancer (VC) in pregnancy is unknown due to its rarity; between 1955 and 2014 only 36 case reports were reported worldwide. Underreporting may also be a contributing factor to the unknown incidence of VC in pregnancy. The aim of this study was to analyze the diagnosis, treatment and outcome of vulvar cancer cases diagnosed during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding. Case presentation Patient 1 was diagnosed at 18 weeks' gestation (WG) with Grade 2 VC (pT1a, pN0, 0/4 sentinel lymph nodes biopsy (SLNB) involved) and was treated by having the tumor resected (R0). She is currently recurrence-free at 4 years post-diagnosis. Patient 2 was diagnosed at 7 WG with Grade 2 VC (pT1b, pN1a, 1/17 SLNB, R0) and was treated during the first trimester and during the second trimester with SLNB. She is currently recurrence-free at 5 years post-diagnosis. Patient 3 was diagnosed at 30 WG with Grade 2 VC (pT1b, pN0, 0/5 SLNB, R0). She subsequently experienced a number of local recurrences postpartum that were managed by resection and is currently recurrence-free at 3 years post-diagnosis. Patient 4 was diagnosed a VL later, at 14 months during breastfeeding, that was diagnosed as Grade 3 VC (pT1b, pN1a, 1/14 SLNB, R0). The patient is currently recurrence-free at 9 years post-diagnosis. Patient 5 was not diagnosed during pregnancy, but was diagnosed with G3 VC (pT2, pN2c, 2/17 SLNB, R0) 8 months postpartum. The patient due to the extent of tumor involvement and lymph node metastasis, underwent chemoradiation therapy post-surgery. Despite adjuvant therapy, the patient progressed and developed bone metastases. Analysis of the tumour tissue revealed increased expression of PD-L1 (programmed cell death protein 1) indicating that the patient may have benefited from treatment with nivolumab to block the PD-L1 interaction; unfortunately the patient passed away at 24 months post-diagnosis before immunotherapy treatment could commence. Conclusion Surgical resection and simultaneous SLNB in VC cases are considered safe during pregnancy, with comparable outcomes to non-pregnant women. Prompt diagnostic workup and treatment should never be delayed during pregnancy as delayed diagnosis could lead to tumour progression with fatal consequences.

TI  - Geospatial and AHP Approach Rainwater Harvesting Site Identification in Drought-Prone Areas, South Gonder Zone, Northwest Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the most pervasive natural disasters because it depletes natural resource, environment disaster and an ecosystem devastation that support all forms of life. Remote sensing and geospatial modeling can be used in investigation of water harvesting through a scientific approach, hence making decision easier and precise. So, this research uses remotely sensed data and geospatial modeling with analytical hierarchical process (AHP) to identify locations for rainwater harvesting structure in the drought-prone area of south Gondar zone. Different thematic layers have been incorporated into the analysis including soil texture, soil depth, slope, rainfall, land use, distance from road and settlement, and lineament density. The aforementioned thematic layers were assigned respective weights of their importance by AHP and combined in a GIS environment to identify the potential site. This study is important to improve agriculture productivity, animal husbandry, water management and sustainable environment. The results of this study are to prepare map of potential rainwater harvesting sites. This will allow to build dams to store water, which will be especially beneficial in drought-prone areas. The suitability map is classified into four potential classes, from highly suitable to not suitable. The results of the suitability analysis show that 20.25% of the study area is highly suitable, 66.66% is moderately suitable, 4.70% is marginally suitable, and 8.39% is not suitable. The result of a suitable map is very convenient for decision-makers and planners to quickly select the sites for rainwater harvesting structure.

TI  - Estimation of Surface Ozone Concentration and Health Impact Assessment in China
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the context of PM2.5 concentrations decreasing annually, ozone concentrations have increased instead of decreased, and ozone has become one of the main pollutants in the warm season in China. Based on the idea of big data association analysis, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) ozone concentration estimation model was constructed and developed to estimate the maximum daily 8 h average ozone concentration (O-3_8h) in China in 2019 for human exposure assessment. The model input ground monitoring station data, high-resolution remote-sensing satellite data, meteorological data, emission inventory data, digital elevation model (DEM) data, and population data were used to capture the temporal and spatial variation of O-3_8h. In this study, ten-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the estimation performance of the model (R-2=0.871, RMSE=11.7 mu g.m(-3)). Compared to those with the random forest (RF) model and kernel ridge regression (KRR) model, due to the improvement in the algorithm itself and the advancement of parallel processing, the estimation results of the XGBoost model showed higher accuracy (RF:R-2=0.864, RMSE=12.387 mu g.m(-3)). The KRR model was as follows:R-2=0.582, RMSE=23.1 mu g.m(-3), and the computational efficiency of the model was significantly improved. At the same time, the level of ozone exposure and the relative risk of death due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in China's provinces and cities were evaluated. The results showed that the top five number of days exceeding the standard occurred in Shandong Province, Henan Province, Hebei Province, Anhui Province, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. In terms of exposure intensity, Hebei Province, Shandong Province, Shanxi Province, Tianjin City, and Jiangsu Province ranked the top five in terms of population weighted ozone concentration. In terms of health effects, the relative risk of COPD death showed seasonal changes, with the highest in summer and the lowest in winter.

TI  - Selective Adsorption of Au(III) by Activated Carbon Supported Polythioamides and Adsorption Mechanism
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - By using in-situ synthesis of polythioamide (PTA) on activated carbon (AC), a polythioamide-modified activated carbon-based adsorbent (AC-PTA) was successfully prepared and used to study the selective adsorption effect and mechanism of Au(III) in wastewater. The results showed that AC-PTA exhibited excellent selective adsorption to Au(III) in the coexisting solution of multiple metal ions in a wide pH range (<5.0). The adsorption effect for Au(III) was the best at a pH of 2 and 3; the concentration of residue Au(III) was less than 0.1 mg center dot L-1, whereas other metals were barely adsorbed. The selective adsorption process for Au(III) conformed to the pseudo-second kinetic model (R-2=0.9853), the thermodynamic process conformed to the Langmuir isotherm process (R-2=0.9936), and adsorption capacity was up to 2018 mg center dot g(-1). Such advantages were mainly attributed to the coordination interaction between the -C(=S)NH-functional groups on the AC-PTA surface and Au(III), the electrostatic adsorption between the positive AC-PTA and negative Au(III) complex anions, and the direct reduction of Au(III) by AC. The successful recovery of gold was finally realized by burning the adsorbed AC-PTA at 1000 degrees C for 4 hours under air conditions, and solid gold with a mass fraction higher than 90.0% was obtained. This study provided the possibility for selective adsorption and recovery of low concentration Au(III) from actual wastewater.

TI  - Multi-Temporal SAR Interferometry for Vertical Displacement Monitoring from Space of Tengiz Oil Reservoir Using SENTINEL-1 and COSMO-SKYMED Satellite Missions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused on the quantitative assessment of the vertical displacement velocities retrieved using Sentinel-1 and Cosmo-SkyMed synthetic aperture radar images for the Tengiz oilfield. Tengiz oilfield was selected as a study area because of its historically reported continuous subsidence and limited up-to-date studies during recent years. The small baseline subset time-series technique was used for the interferometric processing of radar images acquired for the period of 2018-2020. The geospatial and statistical analyses allowed to determine the existing hotspots of the subsidence processes induced by oil extraction in the study area. Ground deformation measurements derived from the Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed satellite missions showed that the Tengiz oilfield continuously subsided during 2018-2020 with the maximum annual vertical displacement velocity around -77.4 mm/y and -71.5 mm/y, respectively. The vertical displacement velocities derived from the Sentinel-1 and the COSMO-SkyMed images showed a good statistical relationship with R(2 >=)0.73 and RMSE <= 3.68 mm. The cumulative vertical displacement derived from both satellites for the most subsiding location also showed a good statistical relationship with R-2 equal to 0.97 and RMSE = +/- 4.69. The observed relative differences of measurements by both satellites were acceptable to determine the ongoing vertical surface displacement processes in the study area. These studies demonstrated a practical novelty for the petroleum industry in terms of the comparative assessment of surface displacement measurements using time-series of medium-resolution Sentinel-1 and high-resolution COSMO-SkyMed radar images.

TI  - Integration assay of bacteriological risks in marine environment using <i>salmonella </i>spp and multimarker response in the bivalve <i>Donax trunculus</i>: Novel biomonitoring approach
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Microbiological contamination is one of the riskiest forms of human contamination in seawater, which threaten the stability of ecosystems and human health. In this study, we study the accumulation of a pathogenic bacteria Salmonella spp; isolated from the marine environment, in the soft tissue of Donax trunculus (Mollusca, Bivalvia), a commonly used as a bioindicators species for aquatic ecosystems monitoring, under laboratory conditions during both exposure and recovery periods. These bacteria were added in seawater at three concentrations previously determined against sentinel specie at three exposure periods (24, 48 and 96 h). In a second series of experiments, exposed specimens were afterward transplanted to clean water to assess the recovery pattern. The mortality rate of bivalves was determined as biomarker of general stress. Our findings suggest that microbiological contamination by Salmonella spp was gradually incorporated into the body of D. trunculus causing a significant induction of enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as a function of time and concentration. Exposure to a bacterial concentration of 5.104 bacteria/liter resulted in the mortality of more than 80% of the specimens. This study is to test the pathogenicity of Salmonella strains at concentrations close to those of the marine environment, and their effects on biomarkers, thus deducing the existence of an exponential relationship between bacterial concentrations and enzymatic response. The principal component analysis shows that the four biomarkers had similar variation with bacterial concentrations, while two groups were obtained to change following the exposure time (CAT-GST and AChE-MDA). This study provides new findings on the potential accumulation of pathogenic bacteria associated with neurotoxicity and oxidative stress in the wedge clam Donax trunculus.

TI  - Evaluating recovery metrics derived from optical time series over tropical forest ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An increase in the frequency and severity of disturbances (such as forest fires) is putting pressure on the resilience of the Amazon tropical forest; potentially leading to reduced ability to recover and to maintain a functioning forest ecosystem. Dense and long-term satellite time series approaches provide a largely untapped data source for characterizing disturbance- recovery forest dynamics across large areas and varying types of forests and conditions. Although large-scale forest recovery capacity metrics have been derived from optical satellite image time series and validated over various ecosystems, their sensitivity to disturbance (e.g. disturbance magnitude, disturbance timing, and recovery time) and environmental data characteristics (e.g. noise magnitude, seasonality, and missing values) are largely unknown. This study proposes an open source simulation framework based on the characteristics of sampled original satellite image time series to (i) compare the reliability of recovery metrics, (ii) evaluate their sensitivity with respect to environmental and disturbance characteristics, and (iii) evaluate the effect of pre-processing techniques on the reliability of the recovery metrics for abrupt disturbances, such as fires, in the Amazon basin forests. The effect of three pre-processing techniques were evaluated: changing the temporal resolution, noise removal techniques (such as time series smoothing and segmenting), and using a varying time span after the disturbance to calculate recovery metrics. Here, reliability is quantified by comparing derived and theoretical values of the recovery metrics (RMSE and R-2). From the three recovery metrics evaluated, the Year on Year Average (YrYr) and the Ratio of Eighty Percent (R80p) are more reliable than the Relative Recovery Index (RRI). Time series segmentation tends to improve the reliability of recovery metrics. Recovery metrics derived from temporal dense Landsat time series tend to show a higher reliability than those derived from time series aggregated to quarterly or annual values. Although the framework is demonstrated on Landsat time series of the Amazon tropical forest, it can be used to perform such test on other datasets and ecosystems.

TI  - Near-Infrared Fluorescence Image-Guided Surgery in Esophageal and Gastric Cancer Operations
T2  - SURGICAL INNOVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Near-infrared fluorescence image-guided surgery helps surgeons to see beyond the classical eye vision. Over the last few years, we have witnessed a revolution which has begun in the field of image-guided surgery. Purpose, and Research design Fluorescence technology using indocyanine green (ICG) has shown promising results in many organs, and in this review article, we wanted to discuss the 6 main domains where fluorescence image-guided surgery is currently used for esophageal and gastric cancer surgery. Study sample and data collection Visualization of lymphatic vessels, tumor localization, fluorescence angiography for anastomotic evaluation, thoracic duct visualization, tracheal blood flow analysis, and sentinel node biopsy are discussed. Conclusions It seems that this technology has already found its place in surgery. However, new possibilities and research avenues in this area will probably make it even more important in the near future.

TI  - Quantifying albedo susceptibility biases in shallow clouds
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The evaluation of radiative forcing associated with aerosol-cloud interactions remains a significant source of uncertainty in future climate projections. The problem is confounded by the fact that aerosol particles influence clouds locally and that averaging to larger spatial and/or temporal scales carries biases that depend on the heterogeneity and spatial correlation of the interacting fields and the nonlinearity of the responses Mimicking commonly applied satellite data analyses for calculation of albedo susceptibility S-o, we quantify S-o aggregation biases using an ensemble of 127 large eddy simulations of marine stratocumulus. We explore the cloud field properties that control this spatial aggregation bias and quantify the bias for a large range of shallow stratocumulus cloud conditions manifesting a variety of morphologies and ranges of cloud fractions. We show that S-o spatial aggregation biases can be on the order of hundreds of percent, depending on the methodology. Key uncertainties emanate from the typically applied adiabatic drop concentration Nd retrieval, the correlation between aerosol and cloud fields, and the extent to which averaging reduces the variance in cloud albedo A(c) and N-d. S-o biases are more often positive than negative and are highly correlated with biases in the liquid water path adjustment. Temporal aggregation biases are shown to offset spatial aggregation biases. Both spatial and temporal biases have significant implications for observationally based assessments of aerosol indirect effects and our inferences of underlying aerosol-cloud-radiation effects.

TI  - Combining ATC and 3D-CNN for reconstructing spatially and temporally continuous land surface temperature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - More than half of the satellite-derived Land surface temperatures (LSTs) data are missing due to poor weather conditions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and other atmospheric conditions) and/or sensor failure, which has greatly limited the acquisition of spatially consistent and temporally regular LST data, leading to reduced utilization and accuracy of the data and hindering the understanding of the spatial-temporal patterns of surface thermal environments. Although several reconstruction methods have been developed, they are not effective in reconstructing daily LSTs for high spatial-temporal dynamics in urban regions. In this study, we developed a hybrid reconstructing method based on the annual temperature cycle (ATC) and three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) models. The proposed method has been validated on both Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra satellite LST datasets. The reconstructed results show that the proposed model incorporated with auxiliary data and 3D-CNN model significantly outperforms standard annual temperature cycle (ATCs) and enhanced annual temperature cycle (ATCe) models (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): Landsat ATCs = 4.21 K, Landsat ATCe = 3.25 K, Landsat ATCe&SATs&CNN = 0.96 K, MODIS ATCs = 3.83 K, MODIS ATCe = 3.15 K, MODIS ATCs&SATs&CNN = 0.61 K). The proposed method is simpler, more efficient with higher robustness in terms of reconstructing high spatiotemporal LSTs in urban settings compared with existing reconstruction methods.

TI  - Severe acute respiratory illness surveillance for influenza in Kenya: Patient characteristics and lessons learnt
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We describe the epidemiology and clinical features of Kenyan patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza compared with those testing negative and discuss the potential contribution of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance in monitoring a broader range of respiratory pathogens.Methods: We described demographic and clinical characteristics of SARI cases among children (<18 years) and adults, separately. We compared disease severity (clinical features and treatment) of hospitalized influenza positive versus negative cases and explored independent predictors of death among SARI cases using a multivariable logistic regression model.Results: From January 2014 to December 2018, 11,666 persons were hospitalized with SARI and overall positivity for influenza was similar to 10%. There were 10,742 (96%) children (<18 years)-median age of 1 year, interquartile range (IQR = 6 months, 2 years). Only 424 (4%) of the SARI cases were adults (>= 18 years), with median age of 38 years (IQR 28 years, 52 years). There was no difference in disease severity comparing influenza positive and negative cases among children. Children hospitalized with SARI who had an underlying illness had greater odds of in-hospital death compared with those without (adjusted odds ratio 2.11 95% CI 1.09-4.07). No further analysis was done among adults due to the small sample size.Conclusion: Kenya's sentinel surveillance for SARI mainly captures data on younger children. Hospital-based platforms designed to monitor influenza viruses and associated disease burden may be adapted and expanded to other respiratory viruses to inform public health interventions. Efforts should be made to capture adults as part of routine respiratory surveillance.

TI  - Detecting Soil pH from Open-Source Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study of Angul and Balangir Districts, Odisha State
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil sampling, collection, and analysis are a costly and labor-intensive activity that cannot cover the entire farmlands; hence, it was conceived to use high-speed open-source platforms like Google Earth Engine in this research to estimate soil characteristics remotely using high-resolution open-source satellite data. The objective of this research was to estimate soil pH from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 satellite-derived indices; data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 satellite missions were used to generate indices and as proxies in a statistical model to estimate soil pH. Step-wise multiple regression (SWMR), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forest (RF) regression were used to develop predictive models for soil pH, SWMR, ANN, and RF regression models. The SWMR greedy method of variable selection was used to select the appropriate independent variables that were highly correlated with soil pH. Variables that were retained in the SWMR are B2, B11, Brightness index, Salinity index 2, Salinity index 5 of Sentinel-2 data; VH/VV index of Sentinel 1 and TIR1 (thermal infrared band1) Landsat-8 with p-value < 0.05. Among the four statistical models developed, the class-wise RF model performed better than other models with a cumulative correlation coefficient of 0.87 and RMSE of 0.35. The better performance of class-wise RF models can be attributed to different spectral characteristics of different soil pH groups. More than 70% of the soils in Angul and Balangir districts are acidic soils, and therefore, the training of the dataset was affected by that leading to misclassification of neutral and alkaline soils hindering the performance of single class models. Our results showed that the spectral bands and indices can be used as proxies to soil pH with individual classes of acidic, neutral, and alkaline soils. This study has shown the potential in using big data analytics to predict soil pH leading to the accurate mapping of soils and help in decision support.

TI  - Thermal Front Detection Using Satellite-Derived Sea Surface Temperature in the Northern Indian Ocean: Evaluation of Gradient-Based and Histogram-Based Methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two different methods of detecting oceanic thermal fronts using satellite-derived high-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) data are evaluated in this study. High-resolution SST observations from INSAT, MODIS and the group of high-resolution SST (GHRSST) have been used to identify thermal fronts in the Northern Indian Ocean. The thermal fronts are identified using gradient-based and histogram-based techniques. Several sensitivity studies were conducted to determine various thresholds required to identify thermal fronts from both methods. It is found that the detected fronts using gradient-based method are noisy and more in number as compared to histogram-based edge detection technique. The edge detection method can detect prominent fronts with fewer false alarms. Front detection techniques were also applied on sub-daily SST images obtained from geostationary satellite, INSAT-3D. Winter time fronts were realistically detected by using both algorithms. Buoy observations confirmed the presence of detected fronts in the satellite images. Application of the two techniques of front detection on SST images during cyclone shows that the histogram-based method successfully detects thermal fronts associated with cooling. The gradient-based method missed most of the thermal fronts during the cyclone, mainly due to diffused gradients captured in the satellite based merged SST under cloudy conditions.

It comments significance of and elaborates on the issues raised in Nadaraj Govender and Edson Mudzamiri's paper entitled: Incorporating indigenous artefacts in developing an integrated indigenous-pedagogical model in high school physics curriculum: views of elders, teachers and learners. At the outset, I examine the study's conceptualisation of the terms indigenous knowledge (IK) and school science. Then, I offer an alternative view on the findings in light of the ubuntu theoretical framework, as used in other studies. The article foregrounds theoretical and methodological arguments put forward by Govender and Mudzamiri for the incorporation of IK artefacts with physics education in schools. After that, I analyse the applicability of the article's proposed integrated indigenous physics pedagogical model in the school curriculum. The paper ends with the contention that school science should be taught as a cultural way of knowing rather mere facts divorced from learners' culture.

TI  - Modeling Carbon Uptake of Dryland Maize Using High Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying carbon uptake or gross primary production (GPP) from agroecosystems is important for understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon fixation by crops. The availability of high-resolution remote sensing data can significantly improve GPP estimation of small-scale agricultural fields. Multispectral satellite data with 3-m spatial resolution and frequent global coverage are available from the PlanetScope network of satellites. However, this data remains largely unexplored for studying the carbon dynamics of agroecosystems. The overarching goal of this study was to develop a simple empirical method for quantifying the GPP of dryland maize (Zea mays L.) using remotely sensed vegetation indices along with in-situ measurements of photosynthetically active radiation and leaf area index by linking it with carbon uptake data from an eddy covariance flux tower. Four vegetation indices were investigated: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), the weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI), and the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2). This study was conducted over a three-year period from 2017 to 2019 in East-Central Texas. A total of 12 GPP prediction models were developed using individual yearly data and were used for predicting GPP of the other 2 years. Predicted maize GPP values were then compared against tower-based GPP. The NDVI models were the least successful in predicting GPP and had the highest root mean square error (average: 10.1 3 gC m-2; maximum: 26.3 gC m-2). Models based on SAVI performed especially well with error ranging from 0.05 to 0.94 gC m-2. The slope of the regression between SAVI-based estimated GPP and measured GPP was not different from 1.0 in all combinations of years. The success of the SAVI-based GPP models for predicting dryland maize carbon uptake indicates that it was the least affected vegetation index by changing soil background condition in this row cropping system.

M3  - Article
AB  - The tectonic framework, lithostructural and mineralised zones of Iwo-Apomu region of Precambrian Basement Complex rocks were investigated using integrated aeromagnetic and satellite remote datasets. Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) performed on aeromagnetic data were: Butterworth Filter (BF), Reduction to Magnetic Equator (RTE), Regional field, Residual field, Tilt-Angle Derivative (TDR), First and Second Vertical Derivative (FVD and SVD), Tilt angle and Total horizontal derivative (TDR and TDHR), and Total Gradient Amplitude (TGA); which range from-31.97 - 123.24,-27.12 - 131.75, 1.52 - 117.90,-58.55 - 50.42,-1.35 - 1.36,-0.0712 - 0.0643, 0.0004 - 0.0102, 0.005 - 0.261 respectively. Continuations and Radially Average Power Spectrum; revealed the variations of the deep-seated basement rocks, the structures and the mineralised anomalous bodies with depth. The upward continuation maps also show that the regional trends of the mapped lithologies and lineaments/faults in the area are generally in NW-SE, E-W, and NW-SE directions. These filters defined the lithostructures, lithological boundaries, geological structures, contacts, faults, folds and mineral deposit. The results of satellite data on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), False Colour Composite (FCC) images and Band Ratio (BR) discriminated the different rock types, lithostructural boundaries and alteration zones that hosted the mineralized ore bodies which trend in NE-SW and minor NW-SE and E-W directions. The combined techniques generated showing the probable positions and trend of suspected fault/fracture, mineral deposit as well as other basement structures.

TI  - Spatiotemporal change analysis of environmental quality in mining areas based on long-term landsat images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The mining of ion-adsorption rare-earth elements (REE) in South China has caused severe ecological disturbances in mining areas. Therefore, environmental monitoring and evaluation of REE mining areas have become a prerequisite for the sustainable development of the ion-adsorption REE industry. In this study, a remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) model was used to evaluate changes in the environmental quality of REE mining areas. Thirty Landsat images from 1986 to 2019 were used in a case study of the Lingbei mining area in Dingnan County, China. Google Earth images were used for visual interpretation and comparison with the classification results of different types of land damage and restoration for different disturbance levels. The random forest (RF) method was used for classification, and the underlying mechanism of the environmental changes was discussed. The results show that the RSEI accurately reflects the environmental quality of the REE mining areas. The analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of the environmental quality in the REE mining areas shows that since 1986, mining techniques, such as pool leaching, heap leaching, and in-situ leaching, resulted in surface vegetation removal and topsoil stripping, causing extensive environmental damage. After 2011, the environmental quality was slowly restored due to the optimization of mining technology and the government's focus on environmental management, resulting in the recovery of mining sites. The changes in the environmental quality of the REE mining areas in different disturbance states indicate that the area affected by human disturbance is 15.44 km(2), accounting for 44.43% of the total mining area and 16.31% of the area exhibits serious impacts on the ecological environment. The proposed method provides a quantitative approach to describe the evolution of environmental quality in the mining area over the past 34 years, providing a scientific basis for the sound management of the mining areas to promote the regional sustainable development.

TI  - Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data fusion to distinguish building damage level of the 2018 Lombok Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Following an earthquake, Building Damage Assessment (BDA) is crucial in detecting areas that need immediate rescue actions and planning for the best evacuation strategy. Remote sensing has been widely used for BDA. The availability of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images that are freely accessible could enhance remote sensing applications for building damage classification caused by natural disasters. The accuracy of using the two satellite images for BDA mapping in tropical regions is still uncertain. This research aims to assess Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data fusion per-formance for BDA mapping following the catastrophic 2018 Lombok Earthquake. Pre-and post-earthquake images of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were selected, preprocessed, and integrated using the random forest classifier. Three data scenarios were used in this study, i.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and the fusion of both datasets. The results demonstrated that all models showed excellent performance in classifying destroyed buildings compared to severely and moderately damaged buildings. This is due to the medium spatial resolution of the images could not identify the damage level in detail. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data fusion provided the highest overall accuracy value (62.4%) compared to other single dataset models. According to the feature importance analysis result, GLCM Mean, GLCM Variance, and NIR Band played crucial roles in the damage classification. In conclusion, the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 can provide the best model for destroyed building mapping. However, severely and moderately building damaged mapping can only be accurately mapped using higher spatial resolution images.

TI  - Simulation of land use/land cover change at a basin scale using satellite data and markov chain model
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study is to analyze the past and future land use and land cover change (LULCC) in Betwa River Basin (BRB), central India. The LULC maps were derived from Landsat satellite images using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). The artificial neural network (ANN) embedded with Land Change Modeler (LCM) was trained with driver variables. The model prediction accuracy has been accessed by evaluating Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) values. The study reveals that during the period 1990-2020 agriculture land, open forest, and built-up land area have increased significantly. Further, the LULCC prediction for the period 2030-2050 suggests that expansion in open forest and the built-up land area will continue while agriculture land area will keep back in the future. This research provides up-to-date LULCC information of BRB, which would be useful for all the stakeholders governing river basin management and land resource planning in this region.

TI  - Nanocarbon Tracer and Areola Injection Site Are Superior in the Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Procedure for Breast Cancer
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Axillary lymph node (ALN) staging is the most effective method to evaluate the condition of patients with breast cancer, their choice of treatment options, and prognosis. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) status assessment is the key to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with breast cancer. The choice of tracer and tracer injection sites affects SLNB. Objective. This study mainly analyzes the best tracer for SLNB and the best choice of tracer injection site. Methods. A total of 165 breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB were selected and injected with methylene blue or 99mTc-labeled sodium phytate or nanocarbon 20 min before biopsy. The number of SLNs detected by different tracers in different injection sites such as peritumoral tissue (PT) and subareolar area (SA) was counted, and the sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative prediction rates were recorded and compared. Results. The detection success rate, average detection number of SLNs, and detection accuracy of the nanocarbon tracer were higher than the other two. The detection sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative prediction rates of nanocarbon for SLNB were also higher than those of the other two tracers. When comparing the performance of tracers in different injection sites, it was found that the detection of three tracers injected in the SA was better than the injection in the PT. Conclusion. For women with early-stage breast cancer, nanocarbon can be used as the preferred tracer for SLNB to determine the status of the patient's ALNs, and the areola area can be used as the best injection site.

TI  - Perceived Human-Induced Causes of Landslide in Chattogram Metropolitan Area in Bangladesh
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates Land Use Land Cover changes in the Chattogram metropolitan area, the second-largest city in Bangladesh. Using a questionnaire survey of 150 local inhabitants, the study explores perceived human-induced causes of landslides. Using time series Landsat images, this study also analyzes Land Use Land Cover changes from 1990 to 2020. The analysis reveals built-up area extended rapidly during 1990-2020. In 1990, total built-up area was 82.13 km(2), which in 30 years, stood at 451.34 km(2). Conversely, total vegetative area decreased rapidly. In 1990, total vegetation area was 364.31 km(2), which reduced to 130.44 km(2) in 2020. The survey results show that most of the respondents faced landslide therefore; it is nothing new among them. Respondents were identified several reasons for landslide like extensive rainfall, hill cutting, steep hill, weak soil texture, etc. A large number of local people opined that diverse human activities are causes of landslide in their local area and it has impacted on their livelihood. Chi-square test suggests that there are statistically significant differences between local and non-local inhabitants regarding their opinion on whether excessive hill cutting is alone responsible for landslide and whether deforestation is the sole reason for landslide. This study also used four multinomial logistic regression (MLR) to examine the effects of independent variables like gender, age, level of education, income, housing pattern and experience of facing landslide on their perception of human-induced causes of landslide. Findings show that age and experience of facing landslide are two significant predictors for the first model, explaining excessive hill cutting was alone responsible for landslide. Level of education and experience of facing landslide are found statistically significant for explaining our second model that is building infrastructures solely causes landslide. Moreover, our third model claims only deforestation can be blamed for landslide which is significantly explained by three predictors, namely gender, age and income. Finally, we found our fourth model that is landslide occurs only due to excessive sand collection is significantly explained by participant's gender, level of education, and income.

TI  - Mapping terrestrial groundwater-dependent ecosystems in arid Australia using Landsat-8 time-series data and singular value decomposition
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial extent of terrestrial vegetation types reliant on groundwater in arid Australia is poorly known, largely because they are located in remote areas that are expensive to survey. In previous attempts, the use of traditional remote sensing approaches failed to discriminate vegetation using groundwater from surrounding vegetation. Difficulties in discerning vegetation groundwater use by remote sensing may be exacerbated by the unpredictable rainfall patterns and lack of annual wet and dry seasons common in arid Australia. This study presents a novel approach to mapping terrestrial groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to time-series of vegetation indices derived from Landsat-8 data, to isolate the temporal and spatial sources of variation associated with groundwater use. In-situ data from 442 sites were used to supervise and validate logistic regression models and neural networks, to determine whether sites could be correctly classified as GDEs using components obtained from the SVD. These results were used to produce a probability map of GDE occurrence across a 557 000 ha study area. Overall accuracy of the final classification map was 79%, with 72% of sites correctly identified as GDEs (true positives) and 16% incorrectly classified as GDEs (false positives). The approach is broadly applicable in arid regions globally, and is easily validated if general background knowledge of regional vegetation exists. Globally, and going forward, increased water extraction is expected to severely limit water available for GDEs. Successfully mapping GDEs in arid environments is a critical step towards their sustainable management, and the human and natural systems reliant upon them.

TI  - Impact assessments of wind farms on seabird populations that overlook existing drivers of demographic change should be treated with caution
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Population viability analyses (PVA) are now routinely used during the consenting process for offshore wind energy developments to assess potential impacts to vulnerable species, such as seabirds. These models are typically based on mean vital rates, such as survival and fecundity, with some level of environmental stochasticity (i.e., temporal variation). However, many species of seabird are experiencing population decline due to temporal (i.e., directional) trends in their vital rates. We assess the prevalence of temporal trends in rates of fecundity for a sentinel species of seabird, the black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, and examine how accounting for these relationships affects the predictive accuracy of PVA, as well as the projected population response to an extrinsic threat. We found that temporal trends in kittiwake rates of fecundity are widespread, and that including these trends in PVA assessments dramatically influences the projected rate of population decline. We advocate that model validation become a prerequisite step in seabird PVA assessments to identify potential biases influencing the projected population response. We also argue that environmental factors driving current population dynamics need to be incorporated in PVA impact assessments as potential "worst-case" scenarios. These findings have immediate application for improving and reducing uncertainty in impact assessments conducted as part of the consenting process for offshore wind energy developments.

TI  - Potential of remote sensing data to support the seismic safety assessment of reinforced concrete buildings affected by slow-moving landslides
T2  - ARCHIVES OF CIVIL AND MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Different forms of hazard can affect structures throughout their existence. The occurrence of a seismic event in areas exposed to different risks or already affected by other phenomena is highly likely, especially in countries characterized by high seismicity and equally high hydrogeological risk, as Italy. Nevertheless, the seismic safety assessment of reinforced concrete (RC) structures is commonly carried out considering the seismic action only, generally applied to an analytical model, neglecting the stress-strain state induced by previous ongoing phenomena. The aim of this work is to highlight the importance of the seismic safety assessment in a multi-hazard analysis, cumulating the action coming from two different hazards: landslide and earthquake. An existing RC building, located in an area affected by an intermittent landslide phenomenon with slow kinematics, that may also be subjected to strong earthquakes, is used as case study. The Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) approach is used to monitor the evolution in time of the landslide. DInSAR deformation data are used to detect surface ground movements applied to building foundations. A non-linear static analysis procedure is implemented for the code-based seismic safety assessment, in two different scenarios. The seismic assessment of the case-study building is implemented in a condition of structure deformed only for gravity loads, and, then, in a state of known landslide-induced deformed configuration. A comparison is proposed between the building seismic safety assessment performed in both cases, with or without the consideration of the landslide-induced displacements, showing the importance of a multi-hazard evaluation.

TI  - A Comparison of Discrete and Continuous Metrics for Measuring Landscape Changes
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of landscape patterns in a correct way is an important issue in landscape ecology, which has recently attracted much attention from landscape ecologists. It is believed that Patch-Corridor-Matrix or discrete model does not take into account the continuous heterogeneity and has limitations and problems that undermine the validity of the results. Various continuous methods have been developed to overcome the problems associated with the discrete approach for measuring landscape fragmentation. Continuous methods use remotely sensed data directly for quantifying landscape pattern changes. In this regard, the purpose of this study is to compare landscape metrics obtained from the discrete model and alternative continuous metrics, including spatial autocorrelation indices, Fourier transforms, and surface metrics. To achieve this goal, we used two subsets that were different in terms of urban and agricultural changes. We measured temporal changes of three subsets between the years 2013 and 2020. Results showed that percentage of landscape (PLAND) as a landscape metric had a good statistical relationship with Getis of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (R-2 = 95.9%) and a moderate relationship with Getis of the built-up index (PNBI) (R-2 = 43.7%) as alternative metrics. The results of discrete metrics showed that in 2013, the spatial patterns of urban and cultivated farms patches were more fragmented than in 2020. Also, the area of cultivated farms increased by 3 to 6 percent and urban areas between 1 and 8 percent in 2020. All continuous metrics showed that the subsets in the study changed in 2020. However, Fourier transforms could not determine the magnitude of these changes. Our results also showed that landscape metrics have some drawbacks for measuring landscape patterns that some of them can be resolved by continuous metrics. Generally, the use of discrete and continuous metrics depends on factors like the scale of the study, time and budget available, desired ecological processes, and the degree of heterogeneity of the landscape of interest.

TI  - Chromosome-level genome assembly, annotation, and phylogenomics of the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes.
T2  - GigaScience
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The barnacles are a group of >2,000 species that have fascinated biologists, including Darwin, for centuries. Their lifestyles are extremely diverse, from free-swimming larvae to sessile adults, and even root-like endoparasites. Barnacles also cause hundreds of millions of dollars of losses annually due to biofouling. However, genomic resources for crustaceans, and barnacles in particular, are lacking. Results Using 62x Pacific Biosciences coverage, 189x Illumina whole-genome sequencing coverage, 203x HiC coverage, and 69x CHi-C coverage, we produced a chromosome-level genome assembly of the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes. The P. pollicipes genome is 770 Mb long and its assembly is one of the most contiguous and complete crustacean genomes available, with a scaffold N50 of 47 Mb and 90.5% of the BUSCO Arthropoda gene set. Using the genome annotation produced here along with transcriptomes of 13 other barnacle species, we completed phylogenomic analyses on a nearly 2 million amino acid alignment. Contrary to previous studies, our phylogenies suggest that the Pollicipedomorpha is monophyletic and sister to the Balanomorpha, which alters our understanding of barnacle larval evolution and suggests homoplasy in a number of naupliar characters. We also compared transcriptomes of P. pollicipes nauplius larvae and adults and found that nearly one-half of the genes in the genome are differentially expressed, highlighting the vastly different transcriptomes of larvae and adult gooseneck barnacles. Annotation of the genes with KEGG and GO terms reveals that these stages exhibit many differences including cuticle binding, chitin binding, microtubule motor activity, and membrane adhesion. Conclusion This study provides high-quality genomic resources for a key group of crustaceans. This is especially valuable given the roles P. pollicipes plays in European fisheries, as a sentinel species for coastal ecosystems, and as a model for studying barnacle adhesion as well as its key position in the barnacle tree of life. A combination of genomic, phylogenetic, and transcriptomic analyses here provides valuable insights into the evolution and development of barnacles.

TI  - Radioactive and non-radioactive seeds as surgical localization method of non-palpable breast lesions
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasingly early diagnosis of breast disease and the more widespread use of primary systemic therapy leads to an increasing number of surgeries for non-palpable breast lesions (NPL) in clinical practice.Breast-conserving surgery often requires the use of an image-guided preoperative localization proce-dure, in which a device is placed within the lesion to be removed to guide the surgeon during surgery. These are patients with small, non-palpable tumors detected in the population screening mammogram, cases with significant reduction of the lesion after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and sometimes it is even necessary to mark axillary lymphadenopathies prior to systemic treatment.

TI  - Merging Landsat and airborne LiDAR observations for continuous monitoring of floodplain water extent, depth and volume
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Darling River system in Australia is under pressure from water extraction and climate change. Management interventions such as environmental flow releases require understanding of water storage dynamics and the connectivity of floodplains and wetlands. Such knowledge can be gleaned from the long observational record of the Landsat series of satellite sensors and high (<5 m) resolution digital elevation models derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Here, for the first time, we develop and demonstrate an approach to reconstruct 16-day floodplain water dynamics, including extent, depth, and volume for a long Landsat time series (1987 to present). Time series mapping of surface water extent at 5-m resolution was achieved by topographic downscaling of Landsat-derived surface water data. We propose a simple and effective algorithm to restore missing data in the images caused by, e.g., cloud and shadows, swath edges and the Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure, thereby increasing the number of useable images five-fold. The 5-m surface water extent maps clearly delineate the narrow river channel and the boundary of floodplain wetlands. They can capture the development, peak and retreat of flood events. By combining Landsat and airborne LiDAR observations, we produced time series of surface water depth mapping at 5-m resolution, accounting for the degree of hydraulic surface water connectivity. Based on these maps, we derived 16-day floodplain volume dynamics for 1987 to present. The correlation coefficient between upstream river flow records and floodplain volume time series was 0.88, indicating that the estimates were robust. The algorithms developed can be used for ongoing very high-resolution mapping to assist in managing human water use and environmental health in the Murray-Darling Basin.

TI  - Beyond Matern: On A Class of Interpretable Confluent Hypergeometric Covariance Functions
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Matern covariance function is a popular choice for prediction in spatial statistics and uncertainty quantification literature. A key benefit of the Matern class is that it is possible to get precise control over the degree of mean-square differentiability of the random process. However, the Matern class possesses exponentially decaying tails, and thus, may not be suitable for modeling polynomially decaying dependence. This problem can be remedied using polynomial covariances; however, one loses control over the degree of mean-square differentiability of corresponding processes, in that random processes with existing polynomial covariances are either infinitely mean-square differentiable or nowhere mean-square differentiable at all. We construct a new family of covariance functions called the Confluent Hypergeometric (CH) class using a scale mixture representation of the Matern class where one obtains the benefits of both Matern and polynomial covariances. The resultant covariance contains two parameters: one controls the degree of mean-square differentiability near the origin and the other controls the tail heaviness, independently of each other. Using a spectral representation, we derive theoretical properties of this new covariance including equivalent measures and asymptotic behavior of the maximum likelihood estimators under infill asymptotics. The improved theoretical properties of the CH class are verified via extensive simulations. Application using NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite data confirms the advantage of the CH class over the Matern class, especially in extrapolative settings. for this article are available online.

M3  - Article
AB  - A B S T R A C T Aim: To evaluate the effect of technical problems and patient characteristics on sentinel lymph node (SLN) scintigraphic detection and mapping success in early stages of endometrial cancer (EC).Methods: Patients with clinical early stage EC (IA-IB) underwent SLN mapping using technetium-99m-nanocolloid,between September 2011 and February 2020. were included. There were excluded cases with technical problems, 92 patients were included for the analysis of the diagnostic performance and the relation of mapping failure (pelvic unilateral or not detected SLN) with patient (age, body mass index, previous pelvic disease or surgery) and disease characteristics (histology, grade, myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space infiltration, tumor size, and lymphatic infiltration risk).Results: The overall detection rate was 79%. Lymph node metastases were diagnosed in 7 patients. Age (p=0.01), depth of myometrial invasion > 50% (p=0.04) and high risk of lymphatic infiltration (p=0.02) were positively associated with mapping failure. In multivariate analysis, age was significantly associated with mapping failure [odds ratio=1.63, 95%CI: 1.06-2.50; p=0.027].Conclusions: Age, depth of myometrial invasion and high risk of lymphatic infiltration were the factors associated with higher mapping failure. An individualized injection technique, optimizing the methodo-logy, could minimize the detection failures.(c) 2021 Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular.

TI  - Radioguided surgery with iodine-125 seeds in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the use of radioactive iodine-125 seed (RIS) in breast and/or axillary surgery, in patients with breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Material and methods: Prospective study between January 2016 and June 2020. 80 women T1-3,N0 2,M0: 30 RIS marking the breast tumor, 36 both the tumor and the biopsied positive axillary node, and 14 only the axilla. Age: 54.7 +/- 11.4 years. Tumor size: 34.1 +/- 14.6 mm. Histological type: invasive ductal carcinoma 90.0%. Molecular subtypes: luminal-A 23.8%, luminal-B/HER2-33.7%, luminal-B/HER2+ 18.8%, HER2+ 7.5%, basal-like 16,2%. Results: Of the 66 patients with RIS marking of the tumor (51 pre-NAC, 15 post-NAC), 92.1% had tumor free surgical margins, with a specimen volume of 126.7 +/- 111.2 cm(3). Of the 5 second local excisions, in 3 the resection margin was involved (1 mastectomy). Of the 50 patients N1 with RIS marking (MLN), 44 pre-NAC and 6 post-NAC, MLN was identified in 97.2%: negative 23, positive 26. In 45/50 patients, sentinel node biopsy (SNB) was performed and it was identified in 93.3%: negative 26, positive 16. In 1 case RIS was not placed correctly and SNB was not identified due to non-migration. In 61.9% of the patients, MLN was among the SNB identified in the surgery. In 5 patients with mismatched SNB and MLN, the pathological result of the SNB was negative and the MLN was positive. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed in 53.8% of the patients. Conclusion: RIS allow to perform breast-conserving surgery and improve detection of residual axillary disease in patients treated with NAC.

TI  - Processing of remote sensing information to retrieve leaf area index in barley: a comparison of methods
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key variable in understanding and modeling crop-environment interactions. With the advent of increasingly higher spatial resolution satellites and sensors mounted on remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), the use of remote sensing in precision agriculture is becoming more common. Since also the availability of methods to retrieve LAI from image data have also drastically expanded, it is necessary to test simultaneously as many methods as possible to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Ground-based LAI data from three years of barley experiments were related to remote sensing information using vegetation indices (VI), machine learning (ML) and radiative transfer models (RTM), to assess the relative accuracy and efficacy of these methods. The optimized soil adjusted vegetation index and a modified version of the Weighted Difference Vegetation Index performed slightly better than any other retrieval method. However, all methods yielded coefficients of determination of around 0.7 to 0.9. The best performing machine learning algorithms achieved higher accuracies when four Sentinel-2 bands instead of 12 were used. Also, the good performance of VIs and the satisfactory performance of the 4-band RTM, strongly support the synergistic use of satellites and RPAs in precision agriculture. One of the methods used, Sen2-Agri, an open source ML-RTM-based operational system, was also able to accurately retrieve LAI, although it is restricted to Sentinel-2 and Landsat data. This study shows the benefits of testing simultaneously a broad range of retrieval methods to monitor crops for precision agriculture.

TI  - Using regional characteristics to improve uncalibrated estimation of rootzone soil moisture from optical/thermal remote-sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing methods based on optical and thermal satellite imagery have been proposed to estimate fine-resolution (30 m) rootzone soil moisture (theta) over bar. In these methods (theta) over bar. is most commonly estimated using a single empirical relationship with evaporative fraction Lambda(SEB) or evaporative index Lambda(PET). Methods have been proposed recently to estimate these relationships based on regional climate, soil, and vegetation characteristics, but those methods have not yet been applied to estimate (theta) over bar from remote sensing data. The objective of this study is to evaluate the. estimates from remote sensing when the Lambda(SEB) vs. (theta) over bar and Lambda(PET) vs. (theta) over bar relationships are inferred from regional characteristics using the previously proposed methods. Four study regions are considered including the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in Arizona, the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site and Lower Arkansas River Valley in Colorado, the Little Washita and Fort Cobb Experimental Watersheds in Oklahoma, and the Mississippi Delta region in Mississippi. The (theta) over bar estimates from the regionally adapted relationships are compared to (theta) over bar estimates from the single empirical relationship and to in situ (theta) over bar measurements. The estimates from the regionally adapted relationships consistently outperform the estimates form the single empirical relationship. The performance typically improves as more regional information is used in the relationships and reduces the root mean squared error of (theta) over bar by an average of 45% among the four regions. The regional method typically performs better for the arid and semiarid regions with root mean squared errors of 0.05 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively. The regionally adapted relationships better capture both spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture than the single empirical relationship.

TI  - Saline soil moisture mapping using Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar data and machine learning algorithms in humid region of China's east coast
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely information on soil moisture (SM) is crucial for better understanding the hydrological and ecological processes in humid saline regions. This study investigated the potential of using Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Machine Learning Algorithms for SM mapping in China's east coast. This study used the recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique to select optimum SAR indices from the back-scattering coefficients of the sampling date as well as the averaged backscattering coefficients of the neighbouring dates. The newly developed support vector regression (SVR) model provided more accurate SM estimation than that from the random forest regression (RFR) and multivariate linear regression (MLR) models. By using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), the achieved coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and the relative RMSE (RRMSE) in SM estimation were 0.77, 1.82%, and 10.29%, respectively. The SVR model was able to map the SM effectively over a large area under the condition that the information of soil surface roughness, soil salinity, and land cover types was unknown. Results from this study demonstrate that high-temporal-resolution Sentinel-1A SAR, with its free-accessibility, offers a great source for the SVR model to provide frequent and accurate SM mapping over coastal saline regions.

TI  - Evaluating Sentinel-2 red edge through hyperspectral profiles for monitoring LAI & chlorophyll content of Kinnow Mandarin orchards
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content are efficient plant health and nutrition indicators. However, retrieving these traits is challenging for the multilayered canopy of evergreen fruit trees like Citrus. The spectral reflectance's Red Edge Position (REP) is a surrogate measure of LAI and chlorophyll content. Sentinel-2 (20 m) estimates REP at a much higher spatial resolution than before. However, retrieval of the traits in the dense canopy structure of orchards requires proper validation of the Sentinel-2 REP (S2REP) through the hyperspectral profiles of plants. The objective here is to evaluate the potential of S2REP to retrieve the LAI and chlorophyll of kinnow mandarin fruit orchards and validate the results with REP extracted from the hyperspectral profiles and ground measurements of these traits. For this, we first tested several algorithms to enumerate the REP range from hyperspectral data that corresponds well to the kinnow mandarin's LAI and Chl content. Next, we used the S2REP to estimate these traits at sampled locations. Hence, we calibrated the regression models of LAI and chlorophyll content with the Sentinel-2 REP as an explanatory variable and traits ground measurements as response variables. The prediction accuracy was tested through an independent validation data set. The results show that the kinnow mandarin trees demonstrated significant spectral response in the 695-725 nm S2REP range of the electromagnetic spectrum similar to the spectral profiles from ground-based hyperspectral data. With this S2REP range, LAI and chlorophyll content models outperformed to predict these traits for the orchards, with adjusted-R2 0.86 and 0.80 and RMSE 3.7 and 53.3%, respectively. We conclude that the S2REP can effectively evaluate kinnow mandarin's LAI and Chlorophyll over large areas. The plants' LAI and chlorophyll content are best represented by the REP derived from the hyperspectral profiles through Polynomial fitting and Linear Extrapolation. Such spectrally-validated Sentinel-2 REP for kinnow orchards can calibrate the LAI and chlorophyll models more accurately over large scales. Our methods can be extrapolated to other fruit traits to enable the real-time monitoring of orchards' health and nutritional status.

TI  - Machine Learning Strategies for the Retrieval of Leaf-Chlorophyll Dynamics: Model Choice, Sequential Versus Retraining Learning, and Hyperspectral Predictors
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring leaf Chlorophyll (Chl) in-situ is labor-intensive, limiting representative sampling for detailed mapping of Chl variability at field scales across time. Unmanned aeria-l vehicles (UAV) and hyperspectral cameras provide flexible platforms for observing agricultural systems, overcoming this spatio-temporal sampling constraint. Here, we evaluate a customized machine learning (ML) workflow to retrieve multi-temporal leaf-Chl levels, combining sub-centimeter resolution UAV-hyperspectral imagery (400-1,000 nm) with leaf-level reflectance spectra and SPAD measurements, capturing temporal correlations, selecting relevant predictors, and retrieving accurate results under different conditions. The study is performed within a phenotyping experiment to monitor wild tomato plants' development. Several analyses were conducted to evaluate multiple ML strategies, including: (1) exploring sequential versus retraining learning; (2) comparing insights gained from using 272 spectral bands versus 60 pigment-based vegetation indices (VIs); and (3) assessing six regression methods (linear, partial-least-square regression; PLSR, decision trees, support vector, ensemble trees, and Gaussian process; GPR). Goodness-of-fit (R-2) and accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE) were determined using training/testing and validation data subsets to assess the models' performance. Overall, while equally good performance was obtained using either PLSR, GPR, or random forest, results show: (1) the retraining strategy improved the ability of most of the approaches to model SPAD-based Chl dynamics; (2) comparative analysis between retrievals and validation data distributions informed the models' ability to capture Chl dynamics through SPAD levels; (3) VI predictors slightly improved R-2 (e.g., from 0.59 to 0.74 units for GPR) and accuracy (e.g., MAE and RMSE differences of up to 2 SPAD units) in specific algorithms; (4) feature importance examined through these methods, revealed strong overlaps between relevant bands and VI predictors, highlighting a few decisive spectral ranges and indices useful for retrieving leaf-Chl levels. The proposed ML framework allows the retrieval of high-quality spatially distributed and multi-temporal SPAD-based chlorophyll maps at an ultra-high pixel resolution (e.g., 7 mm).

TI  - A case study of a severe hailstorm in Mendoza, Argentina, during the RELAMPAGO-CACTI field campaign
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Storms in central Argentina are known for producing large and severe hail. Environmental conditions and strong interaction with topography in this region provide unique conditions for the initiation and intensification of severe storms. The RELAMPAGO (Remote sensing of Electrification, Lightning, And Mesoscale/microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations) and CACTI (Clouds, Aerosols, and Complex Terrain Interactions) field campaigns deployed between October 2018 and April 2019 over west-central Argentina have collected unprecedented periods of intensive observation in the region. During the Intense Observation Period (IOP) number 10 (November 26, 2018), 4 cm diameter hail was reported over wide areas of the province of Mendoza. This was the first time a severe hailstorm was measured with multi-platform observations in Mendoza as the IOP deployment included multiple atmospheric soundings, observations from the Center for Severe Weather Research (CSWR) Doppler on Wheel radars (DOWs) and high temporal resolution satellite data from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) onboard GOES-16. High-temporal frequency soundings and surface observations collected prior to the convection initiation are analyzed, allowing a detailed description of the pre-convective environment. The establishment of the upslope flow and the role of boundary layer processes that resulted in the development of the severe hailstorm are also analyzed. In addition, several GOES-16 ABI and GLM derived products are investigated, in order to test their ability to forecast convective initiation and provide hail proxies in the region.

TI  - COSMOS-Europe: a European network of cosmic-ray neutron soil moisture sensors
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change increases the occurrence and severity of droughts due to increasing temperatures, altered circulation patterns, and reduced snow occurrence. While Europe has suffered from drought events in the last decade unlike ever seen since the beginning of weather recordings, harmonized long-term datasets across the continent are needed to monitor change and support predictions. Here we present soil moisture data from 66 cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNSs) in Europe (COSMOS-Europe for short) covering recent drought events. The CRNS sites are distributed across Europe and cover all major land use types and climate zones in Europe. The raw neutron count data from the CRNS stations were provided by 24 research institutions and processed using state-of-the-art methods. The harmonized processing included correction of the raw neutron counts and a harmonized methodology for the conversion into soil moisture based on available in situ information. In addition, the uncertainty estimate is provided with the dataset, information that is particularly useful for remote sensing and modeling applications. This paper presents the current spatiotemporal coverage of CRNS stations in Europe and describes the protocols for data processing from raw measurements to consistent soil moisture products. The data of the presented COSMOS-Europe network open up a manifold of potential applications for environmental research, such as remote sensing data validation, trend analysis, or model assimilation The dataset could be of particular importance for the analysis of extreme climatic events at the continental scale. Due its timely relevance in the scope of climate change in the recent years, we demonstrate this potential application with a brief analysis on the spatiotemporal soil moisture variability. The dataset, entitled "Dataset of COSMOS-Europe: A European network of Cosmic-Ray Neutron Soil Moisture Sensors", is shared via Forschungszentrum Julich: https://doi.org/10.34731/x9s3-kr48 (Bogena and Ney, 2021).

TI  - Impact of land use change and rapid urbanization on urban heat island in Kolkata city: A remote sensing based perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Kolkata is one of the cities located in the eastern parts of India and experiences rapid urban growth. Because of the rapid urbanization, land use and land cover are changing very rapidly in which impacts on the local land resources and the surface temperature of Kolkata are much higher than its surroundings. In this study, an effort has been done to find out how the vegetation cover is affected by urban growth and how the built up area grew over time. Except this, the attempt has also been made to scrutinize the trends of surface temperature in Kolkata city. This study was done between 2005 and 2019. To find out the vegetation cover and built up area of Kolkata city, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Built up Area Index and Landsat satellite images between the year 2005 and 2019 have been used. This study reveals that vegetation area is declining towards the city core areas and percentages of built up areas are increased towards the urban area. Surface temperature is high in the city core areas which records 41 degrees C temperature in 2019. This study will throw new light in case of urban heat island studies.

AB  - In this paper, the problem of restoration of cloud contaminated optical images is studied in the case when we have no information about brightness of such images in the damage region. We propose a new variational approach for exact restoration of optical multi-band images utilising Synthetic Aperture Radar (EOS - Spatial Data Analytics, GIS Software, Satellite Imagery - is a cloud-based platform to derive remote sensing data and analyse satellite imagery for business and science purposes) images of the same regions. We prove existence of solutions, propose an alternating minimisation method for computing them, prove convergence of this method to weak solutions of the original problem and derive optimality conditions.

T2  - CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem addressed in this paper is that of fault-tolerant mull-sensor data-fusion for flight navigation during approach and landing of a civil jetliner. The work falls within the scope of a large collaborative project on future single pilot operations issues. The proposed methodology is based on a mull-layer hierarchical architecture which can integrate several heterogeneous information sources. The study is restricted to three classical information sources, namely, Inertial Reference System (IRS), Global Positioning System (GPS) and Instrument Landing System (ILS). The system is designed to meet the specified navigation performance requirements in terms of validity, accuracy, continuity and on-board implementation issues. The methodology takes advantage of recently developed set-membership tools, and paves the way toward a new and simple tuning of global merging filter.

TI  - Reimagining Fowler's Stages of Faith: shifting from a seven stage to a four step framework for faith development
T2  - JOURNAL OF BELIEFS & VALUES-STUDIES IN RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Since 1981, James Fowler's stage model of faith development has provided researchers with a framework for understanding the ways in which people develop belief systems over the course of their lives. Despite its helpfulness, there are several notable areas of critique that can be levelled against the model, including its lack of parsimony, heavy reliance on structural-developmental design, and lack of responsiveness to diversity. This article revises Fowler's stage model into a process model, reducing the seven stages of his original design into four process steps that occur during belief formation and re-evaluation. These four steps - religious socialisation, early questioning, exploration and engagement, and refinement - can offer researchers a meaningful and parsimonious path for understanding the process of belief formation, transition, and maintenance. Implications and future directions are discussed.

TI  - Long-term spatiotemporal variability in the surface velocity of Eastern Himalayan glaciers, India
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigation of spatiotemporal variation in glacier velocity is imperative to comprehend glacier mass and volume loss as a function of their sensitivity to climate change. The long-term glacier velocity record for the Eastern Himalayan region is of utmost importance owing to its data scarcity and climate sensitivity. Here, we present a long-term dataset spanning more than two decades (1994-2020) of glacier surface velocity for the entire Sikkim Himalaya by applying image correlation methods on the multi-temporal Landsat images. Our results demonstrate an average glacier surface velocity decline from 15.7 +/- 5.69 (1994/96) to 12.88 +/- 2.09 m yr(-1) (2018/2020), that is a decline of similar to 15% during the period of investigation. Trend analysis shows a decreasing trend in median velocity (32.2%) at a rate of 0.25 m yr(-1). Despite the general decline in average glacier velocity, the rate of slowdown of individual glaciers is extremely heterogeneous (3.6-20 m yr(-1)). Our study shows that up to 32% of the observed heterogeneity in velocity variation can be explained by the variation in glacier size. The present study highlights that large glaciers with thick ice cover move faster compared to small glaciers (even those situated on steep slopes). The findings are significant and have direct implications for assessing future water availability scenarios and modelling glacio-hydrology in the region.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This data set is the first-of-its-kind spatial representation of multi-seasonal, global C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometric repeat-pass coherence and backscatter signatures. Coverage comprises land masses and ice sheets from 82 degrees Northern to 79 degrees Southern latitudes. The data set is derived from multi-temporal repeat-pass interferometric processing of about 205,000 Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images acquired in Interferometric Wide-Swath Mode from 1-Dec-2019 to 30-Nov-2020. The data set encompasses three sets of seasonal (December-February, March-May, June-August, September-November) metrics produced with a pixel spacing of three arcseconds: 1) Median 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 36-, and 48-days repeat-pass coherence at VV or HH polarizations, 2) Mean radiometrically terrain corrected backscatter (gamma(0)) at VV and VH, or HH and HV polarizations, and 3) Estimated parameters of an exponential coherence decay model. The data set has been produced to obtain global, spatially detailed information on how decorrelation affects interferometric measurements of surface displacement and is rich in spatial and temporal information for a variety of mapping applications.

TI  - Dynamic drought risk assessment and analysis with multi-source drought indices and analytical hierarchy process
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic information systems and remote sensing techniques are useful for the study of natural and man-made disasters. The current research implements remote sensing and a GIS-based approach for drought risk assessment. Traditionally, drought occurs in an area having scanty rainfall and a lesser level of groundwater. It is one of the most complicated and less understood among all natural hazards, as these adversely affects our economy along with the ecology. Droughts mostly lead to lower rainfall causing a falloff in agricultural productivity. It also affects human suffering with disastrous damage to our economy and environment along with life losses. The present work proposes to identify the drought risk zone from Landsat satellite data for the years 2014 and 2017 with the help of different indices through the analytical hierarchy process approach. The Landsat 8 satellites data is used for generating brightness value, land surface temperature, and vegetative condition. The vegetation and agricultural health conditions are used to deduce the drought conditions with the help of vegetation condition index, temperature condition index along brightness value. The correlation was performed among several indices along with land surface temperature (LST) for different land use and land cover classes. The final maps are prepared with satellite-based indices and are classified into four major zones high, moderate, low, no drought with the help of geographic information system (GIS) software. It is observed that the whole research area is distressed with moderate drought with a complex concentration.

TI  - Satellite-based interferometric monitoring of deformation characteristics and their relationship with internal hydrothermal structures of an earthflow in Zhimei, Yushu, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the influence of climate change, permafrost landforms are sensitive to seasonal heave and contraction, thus exacerbating surface instability and fostering landslides as a consequence. In the pastureland of Zhimei on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), a typical earthflow has drawn significant attention through social media. However, detailed knowledge of the deformation characteristics, internal hydrothermal regime, and structure is still scarce. In this study, we aim to enhance traditional satellite synthetic aperture radar interferometry to divide ground deformation into the seasonal oscillation and slope deformation components and identify the magnitude and spatial distribution of unstable slopes in frozen regions. Then, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) was combined with geophysical monitoring techniques to recognise the deformation dynamics from the pre- to post-failure stages. Sentinel-1 images, covering almost five years, highlighted that obvious creep behaviour dominated at the pre-failure stage, while a seasonal deformation pattern characterised by a piecewise distribution associated with the hydrothermal regime was observed at the post-failure stage. Fast retrogressive erosion on the head scarps at the post-failure stage was clearly identified by multidifferential digital surface models from the UAV observations. To better understand the internal structure, both electrical resistivity tomography and ground-penetrating radar were combined to determine the seasonal frozen thickness, underlying thawing materials, and vertical cracks, which controlled the kinematic evolution from the initial creep to the narrow and long oversaturated flow that represented the terminal portion of the landslide. Finally, by comparing in situ monitoring data with field investigations, the main driving factors controlling the movement mechanism are discussed. Our results highlight the specific kinematic behaviour of an earthflow and can provide a reference for slope destabilisation on the QTP under the influence of climate change.

TI  - Improved Cartosat-1 Based DEM for Flood Inundation Modeling in the Delta Region of Mahanadi River Basin, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate flood mapping is a non-structural measure that helps to reduce damages and minimizes losses. The availability of large-scale and good quality topographic input data is of great concern for such studies. The present study involves the integration of Cartosat-1 stereo image pairs (remotely sensed) and ground truth points (surveyed) to develop digital elevation model (DEM) for the Mahanadi delta in India. The integration was performed for two cases: (i) A single Cartosat-1 image at a time and (ii) Aggregation of Cartosat-1 images one after another. Both the cases involve different numbers of ground control points (GCPs) (to be integrated with Cartosat-1 images) to study the quality and suitability of DEMs for flood inundation modeling. The best one among the DEMs prepared for each Cartosat-1 image with different number of GCPs was further used for hydrodynamic modeling. The MIKE 11 model was calibrated for 2009 and validated for 2010 using cross-sections extracted from Cartosat-1 DEMs. Further, bathymetry for the MIKE 21 model was prepared using the best Cartosat-1 DEM. MIKE FLOOD model setup was prepared to simulate flood inundation for the year 2011. The results indicate that DEMs of reasonable quality can be generated by incorporating GCPs and rational polynomial coefficients. The areal extent of simulated flood using MIKE FLOOD is in reasonable agreement with the observed counterpart.

TI  - Data of satellite observation for environmental assessment before and during COVID-19 pandemic in part of Indonesia using the cloud-computing platform
T2  - GEOSCIENCE DATA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The global pandemic of COVID-19 has been insisted by many countries in the world to implement social distancing, including Indonesia. This research measured the environmental impact before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Variables, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) of Sentinel-5P Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (Tropomi), nighttime light condition of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) and land surface temperature (LST) of Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), were monitored using the cloud-based computing platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE). This study found that all monitored variables decreased during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the period before the pandemic. However, the pattern of reduction of NO2 concentration and nighttime light was not observed to be coherent with large-scale social distancing regulation enforced by the government. This study found that the reduction has begun 2 months earlier than the official regulation enforced by the government. The lower LST shown in both the time-series map and the graph demonstrated changes before and during the pandemic. The hypothesis was tested using the t-test method, and the statistical results show the significant difference between two groups of observed variables (e.g. before and during the pandemic) with the lower p-values and higher Cohen's d. Results of this study indicate that it should be feasible to monitor the environmental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using the combination of NO2 concentration, nighttime light and LST information as a proxy.

TI  - Forest damage and subsequent recovery alter the water composition in mountain lake catchments
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest damage by insect infestation directly affects the trees themselves, but also indirectly affects water quality via soil processes. The changes in water composition may undergo different pathways depending on site-specific characteristics and forest components, especially the proportion of coniferous and deciduous trees. Here, we test whether changes in forest components and the intensity of disturbance can predict the chemical properties of water outflow from affected lake catchments. Information about forest regeneration (a phase dominated by deciduous trees) and the proportions of damaged and healthy coniferous trees and treeless areas were obtained from satellite data. The four study catchments of Pra"silske, Laka, Ple"sne, and Certovo lakes are geographically close and located in the same mountain range (Sumava Mts., Czech Republic) at similar altitude, but they differ in extents of forest disturbances and recoveries. The water quality measured at the lake catchment outflows differed, and better reflected the development of forest components and health than did meteorological (temperature and precipitation) or hydrological (discharge) variables. Several of the outflow properties (concentrations of inorganic aluminium, protons, potassium, calcium, magnesium, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate, and total phosphorus), responded catchment-specifically and with different delays to forest disturbance. The most pronounced differences occurred in DOC concentrations, which started to increase in the most disturbed Ple"sne and Laka catchments 7 and 6 years, respectively, after the peak in tree dieback, but did not increase significantly in the Pra"silske catchment, which was disturbed several times during the last 3-4 decades. This study demonstrates an importance of extents of forest disturbances, the following changes in forest composition, and catchment-specific characteristics on water composition.

TI  - An insight into the sensitivity of fully polarimetric SAR data to biomass of pearl millet crop
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of polarimetric decomposition techniques improves the capability to understand the complex scattering mechanisms occurring in the dryland crops. The present study is focused on assessing the sensitivity of coherent, incoherent, model and Eigen vector-based decomposition techniques from multitemporal Radarsat-2 polarimetric dataset to scattering mechanisms occurring in the critical growth stages of pearl millet crop. Yamaguchi volume component along with its temporal response was observed to be sensitive and reliable due to its dynamic biomass characterization. Overestimation of volume component and earlier saturation of biomass from 4 kgm-2 were observed limitations in Freeman 2 & 3 component decomposition when dealing with higher vegetation crops. The decrease in volume scattering over increasing biomass proved Van Zyl response contrary to the established understanding. Panicle stage was identified as the critical stage for discriminating pearl millet from similar structured maize and sorghum crops. In this stage, alpha angle generated from Cloude-Pottier decomposition almost reached 550 indicating the increase in contribution of dihedral scattering due to vertical prominent panicles in the pearl millet fields. The various Touzi parameters (a1, gi1, u1 and s1) were observed to have sensitivity towards changes in crop canopy structures, which will require further research to verify. The proposed D(F3-Y4) was the most suitable Volume Difference Index (VDI) for characterizing biomass of erectophile crops as the dynamic biomass response was found even beyond 8 kgm2.

TI  - Modeling and Mapping of Soil Salinity and Alkalinity Using Remote Sensing Data and Topographic Factors: a Case Study in Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity and alkalinity seriously threaten crop production, soil productivity, and sustainable agriculture, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, leading to land degradation. Therefore, the spatial distribution of these parameters is really important for the successful management of such areas. The salinity and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of soil surface have been modeled in this article. Auxiliary data were terrain attributes derived from the digital elevation model (DEM), remote sensing spectral bands, and indices of vegetation and salinity derived from the Landsat 8 OLI satellite. In total, 118 soil samples were collected from a depth of 0-15 cm in homogenous units at Doviraj plain in the southern part of Ilam province, western Iran. Saturated electrical conductivity (ECe), SAR, and other soil properties were analyzed and calculated. To model ECe and SAR parameters with the auxiliary data, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and random forest (RF) regression were applied. The highest accuracy was obtained through the RF model with validation coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.82 and 0.83 and validation root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.40 dS/m and 11.20 for ECe and SAR, respectively. Furthermore, results indicated that the strongest influence on the prediction of soil salinity was obtained with Band10, principal component analysis (PC3), vertical distance to channel network (VDCN), and analytical hill-shading (AH). Also, Band10, Band11, flow accumulation (FA), and topographic wetness index (TWI) were the important covariates in alkalinity prediction through the RF model. Finally, it is suggested that similar techniques can be used to map and monitor soil salinity and alkalinity in other parts of arid regions.

TI  - The link between circulating follicular helper T cells and autoimmunity
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Individuals with autoimmunity often have an increased frequency of T cells bearing features of follicular helper T cells in their blood. Lucy Walker proposes that alterations in pathways that regulate autoimmunity are coupled to alterations in follicular helper T cell homeostasis.Follicular helper T (T-FH) cells provide help to B cells, supporting the formation of germinal centres that allow affinity maturation of antibody responses. Although usually located in secondary lymphoid organs, T cells bearing features of T-FH cells can also be identified in human blood, and their frequency and phenotype are often altered in people with autoimmune diseases. In this Perspective article, I discuss the increase in circulating T-FH cells seen in autoimmune settings and explore potential explanations for this phenomenon. I consider the multistep regulation of T-FH cell differentiation by the CTLA4 and IL-2 pathways as well as by regulatory T cells and highlight that these same pathways are crucial for regulating autoimmune diseases. The propensity of infection to serve as a cue for T-FH cell differentiation and a potential trigger for autoimmune disease development is also discussed. Overall, I postulate that alterations in pathways that regulate autoimmunity are coupled to alterations in T-FH cell homeostasis, suggesting that this population may serve as a core sentinel of dysregulated immunity.

TI  - Remote sensing of total suspended matter concentration in lakes across China using Landsat images and Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended matter (TSM) has a crucial impact on light propagation in the water column, and often co-varies with nutrients, heavy metal and micropollutant fluxes. The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of mapping TSM in lakes (area > 1 ha) across China using Landsat surface reflectance product embedded in Google Earth Engine. We conducted 44 sampling campaigns at 423 natural and manmade lakes across China, and determined TSM from 2036 water samples collected during 2011-2020. Landsat surface reflectance was matched with water sampling events within & PLUSMN;7 days of satellite overpasses, yielding 1908 matched pairs. We divided the TSM dataset into nine subsets, with eight subsets dedicated to building of simple regression and Random Forest (RF) models, and the remaining subset used to validate model performance. Regression analysis indicated strong associations between TSM concentration and both the Red band (Band 4; R-2 = 0.76, RMSE = 21.4 mg/L) and the suspended matter index [(Nir + Red)/2); R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 17.1 mg/L]. The RF model outperformed the Red band model as indicated by higher coefficient of determination for model calibration (R2 = 0.95) and validation (R-2 = 0.81). We also assembled samples (N = 1703) from lakes in different continents, and both the RF (RMSE = 16.04 mg/L) and Red band (RMSE = 18.9 mg/L) models exhibited acceptable performance. The models were further evaluated using a time series of TSM records from six large lakes in the USA and Japan (in situ TSM collected during 1988-2018). Finally, we used 460 scenes of Landsat/OLI images mainly acquired in 2019 to map TSM in lakes across China. Results showed considerable regional variability (TSM range: 0.12-860 mg/L), with lakes in Northeast China (44.6 mg/L), East China (38.8 mg/L) and Xinjiang-Inner Mongolia (39.7 mg/L) exhibiting much higher TSM concentration than lakes in the Yungui Plateau (17.62 mg/L) and the Tibetan Plateau (5.31 mg/L). Results confirmed the stability and spatial transferability of both models. Given the relationships among TSM and various indicators (e.g. nutrients, water clarity, chlorophyll-a) of the trophic state of aquatic ecosystems, these models would greatly facilitate TSM monitoring in lakes, and provide water resources managers with additional tools to assess the impact of water protection measures.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - As a fundamental aspect of the urban form, building height is a key attribute for reflecting human activities and human-environment interactions in the urban context. However, openly accessible building height maps covering the whole China remain sorely limited, particularly for spatially informed data. Here we developed a 1 km x 1 km resolution building height dataset across China in 2017 using Spatially-informed Gaussian process regression (Si-GPR) and open-access Sentinel-1 data. Building height estimation was performed using the spatially-explicit Gaussian process regression (GPR) in 39 major Chinese cities where the spatially explicit and robust cadastral data are available and the spatially-implicit GPR for the remaining 304 cities, respectively. The cross-validation results indicated that the proposed Si-GPR model overall achieved considerable estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 4.22 m) across the entire country. Because of the implementation of local modelling, the spatially-explicit GPR outperformed (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 2.82 m) the spatially-implicit GPR (R-2 = 0.72, RMSE = 6.46 m) for all low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise buildings. This dataset, with extensive-coverage and high-accuracy, can support further studies on the characteristics, causes, and consequences of urbanization.

TI  - An object-based image analysis in QGIS for image classification and assessment of coastal spatial planning
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In practice, urban and regional planners often use a pixel-based method for image classification. Unfortunately, it produces lower accuracy than an Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) method, espe-cially for the high-resolution images. To assess spatial planning, scholars rarely used the OBIA method in open-source software. This paper aims to develop a method for classifying land cover and assessing coastal spatial planning. We used Sentinel-2A in 2015 and 2020 as the basic data. For image classification, we used the OBIA method in Quantum GIS (QGIS) 3.10.6 and Orfeo ToolBox 7.1.0. Furthermore, we used Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Cellular Automata (CA) algorithms in QGIS 2.18.20 for projecting future land cover change, and then used the projected land cover map to assess the spatial planning in 2031. The results show that the OBIA method is useful for image classification, achieving 94.50 and 90.98 percent of the overall accuracy for the imageries in 2015 and 2020, respectively. Our coastal spatial planning assessment shows that the plan has not considered adequately the rapid land cover change of the region, especially the increase in waterbodies. We advocate that the local government should con -sider this issue when evaluating the spatial planning. The methodology using an open-source software such as QGIS in a developing country context also provides a promising exemplar that other local govern-ments can use for assessing their spatial planning.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Effects of Fuyou Formula on GnRH Secretion and Related Gene Expression in Treating Precocious Puberty
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fuyou (Fy) formula is an in-hospital preparation consisting of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that has been used for treating precocious puberty (PP) for more than 20 years. In this study, we aimed to clarify the effect of the Fy formula and its major components on PP. To confirm the effect of the Fy formula on the release of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), GT1-7 cells were treated with estrogen to build the model group and subsequently treated with the Fy formula and its major components to explore their effects on the secretion of GnRH. The level of GnRH in GT1-7 cells was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results illustrated that, compared to the model group, the Fy formula inhibited the release of GnRH. In addition, the expression levels of proteins related to GnRH secretion, including GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), Kiss-1 metastasis-suppressor (Kiss1), G-protein coupled receptor 54 (GPR54), estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The results demonstrated that the Fy formula significantly reduced the level of GnRH secretion in the GT1-7 cell lines compared with the model group. Moreover, it significantly downregulated the expression of GnRH, GnRHR, Kiss1, GPR54, ER alpha, IGF-1, and IGF-1R. In summary, our results indicate that the Fy formula and its major components may inhibit the effects of estrogen, which alleviates PP through transcriptional regulation of target genes.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background Achieving the elimination of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections requires a sufficient understanding of the current epidemiological status of STH endemicity. We aimed to examine the status of STH in Myanmar - a country with the eighth highest STH prevalence in the world, 10 years after instigation of the national deworming programme. Methods In August 2016 we screened for STH infections using Kato Katz (KK) microscopy and real-time PCR (qPCR) in schoolchildren from the Bago Region township of Phyu, a STH sentinel site in Myanmar. Ten schools were randomly selected, and one stool sample each from a total of 264 students was examined. Prevalence and intensity of infection were calculated for each STH. Results High prevalence of STH was identified in the study area with 78.8% of the schoolchildren infected with at least one STH by qPCR, and 33.3% by KK. The most prevalent STH was Trichuris trichiura, diagnosed by both KK (26.1%) and qPCR (67.1%), followed by Ascaris lumbricoides (15.5% KK; 54.9% qPCR). No hookworm infections were identified by KK; however, the qPCR analysis showed a high prevalence of Ancylostoma sp. infection (29.6%) with few Necator americanus (1.1%) infections. Conclusions Despite bi-annual deworming of schoolchildren in the fourth-grade and below, STH prevalence remains stubbornly high. These results informed the expansion of the Myanmar National STH control programme to include all school-aged children by the Ministry of Health and Sports in 2017, however further expansion to the whole community should be considered along with improving sanitation and hygiene measures. This would be augmented by rigorous monitoring and evaluation, including national prevalence surveys.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To understand the HIV infection status in male outpatients in sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in Tianjin from 2016 to 2020. Methods: According to the sentinel surveillance protocol, continuous cross-sectional studies were conducted between April and June during 2016-2020 to collect the information about the awareness of AIDS related knowledge, related sex behaviors, HIV infection, syphilis prevalence and HCV infection of male STD outpatients in Tianjin with a sample seize of 400 in each sentinel clinic. Results: From 2016 to 2020, a total of 4 000 male STD outpatients were surveyed. The HIV positive rate increased from 1.13% (9/800) to 2.25% (18/800) (trend chi2=14.22, P<0.001), the positive rate of syphilis increased from 9.38% (75/800) to 13.00% (104/800) (trend chi2=7.30, P=0.007) in this population during this period. The overall HCV positive rate was 0.45% (18/4 000). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that compared with those who were unmarried, had registered residence in Tianjin, had no temporary sexual behavior in the past 3 months, had no anal sex and had negative syphilis test result, the risk factors of HIV infection in the male STD outpatients included cohabitation (aOR=7.53, 95%CI:2.13-26.62), being from other provinces (aOR=3.64,95%CI:1.58-8.38), having temporary sexual behavior in the past 3 months (aOR=2.24,95%CI:1.03-4.89), having homosexual anal sex (aOR=85.99,95%CI:38.76-190.74) and suffering from syphilis (aOR=6.06,95%CI:3.18-11.56). Conclusion: The detection rates of HIV infection and syphilis in male STD outpatients in Tianjin showed upward trends from 2016 to 2020. Having temporary sexual behavior and anal sex, and suffering from syphilis were the main risk factors of HIV infection in male STD outpatients.

TI  - Intrepid Spirit Centers: Considerations for Active Duty, National Guard, Reserves, and Retirees
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant concern to the military health system (MHS) and a signature wound of America's current conflict. To address the influx of patients with military-related TBI, the Department of Defense has partnered with the Fisher Foundation and the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund to establish the National Intrepid Center of Excellence and satellite network of Intrepid Spirit Centers. The purpose of this study is to review the prevalence of disease and geographic density of TBI among active duty, National Guard, reservist, and retired military populations in order to inform decision-making around the development of additional Intrepid Spirit Centers. Methods We used the MHS Data Repository to perform a cross-sectional examination to assess the prevalence of TBI among active duty, National Guard, reservist, and retired military personnel from fiscal years (FY) 2016 to 2019. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics on patient demographics and the prevalence of TBI. Results We identified a total of 3,221,682 active duty, National Guard, reservists, and retired military personnel in the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps during FY 2016 to 2019; 59.5% were active duty personnel, 23.1% were Retirees, and 17.4% were National Guard and reservists. A total of 72,002 were found to have a TBI-related diagnosis. Texas, North Carolina, and California had the highest case counts for TBI. High prevalence of TBI was found in Bexar County, TX, Muscogee County, GA, Okaloosa County, FL, San Diego County, CA, and Virginia Beach City, VA. Conclusions Additional Intrepid Spirit Centers are warranted to better meet the needs of active duty, active and inactive National Guard and reservists, and retired military personnel in locations including San Antonio, TX, and Columbus, GA. These locations currently have the medical infrastructure necessary to facilitate the care of wounded warriors and return to duty ensuring the health of the Nation's fighting force and veterans.

T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing and GIS play an important role in wildlife species conservation through their applicability to study spatial distribution, landscape pattern and also factors that affect the distribution, density and movement of wild fauna. The present study deals with the distribution of blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) in Nahargarh Wildlife Sanctuary, Haryana, India, and to determine their habitat suitability which is shrinking due to the spread of settlements (urban and rural). For habitat suitability analysis of blackbuck, data from WorldClim, 19 bioclimatic variable layers such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc. were utilized to calculate the maximum entropy using MaxEnt version 3.2. Satellite data from Landsat 8 were used to generate land use and land cover for analysing habitat suitability. An area of 330.71 ha was found to be suitable for blackbuck habitat within the 10 km buffer area, against the present area of 28.32 ha. The growth of Prosopis juliflora which causes damage to the skin of blackbuck during movement was found to be another factor responsible for confining its niche within the Sanctuary. The present study will help in the effective safeguarding of blackbuck species by the Wildlife Wing of the Haryana Forest Department.

TI  - Complex Moral Injury: Shattered Moral Assumptions
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - An infographic model of moral injury (MI) is introduced in this conceptual paper that distinguishes the development of a worldview discrepancy-induced genus of MI, called complex moral injury (C-MI), from a standard expression of moral injury (S-MI), clearly delineated as perpetration-focused and a violation of moral belief in the contemporary view. It builds upon a previous essay that examined the potential of paradoxical circumstance (e.g., clashes of value, competing moral expectations, and moral paradox) to inflict MI among military personnel during wartime (Fleming in J Relig Health 60(5):3012-3033, 2021). Accordingly, it heeds Litz et al.'s recommendation to expand the research of MI beyond the effects of perpetration and investigate the impact of morally injurious events that shake one's core moral beliefs about the world and self (Litz et al. in Clin Psychol Rev 29(8):695-706, 2009). A review of definitional, scale, and qualitative studies shows evidence of a nuanced and complex form of MI that presents as moral disorientation and is a response to a disruption and subsequent failure of foundational moral beliefs to adequately appraise ethical problems and inform moral identity. Interrelations between MI, assumptive world, and meaning theories suggest the mechanism of C-MI and potential therapies. Case studies from a Veterans Administration hospital in the United States and a walk through the diagram will help illustrate the model. Clinical implications of a definition that includes morally injurious events that shatter fundamental moral assumptions are discussed. The role of chaplains in facilitating acceptance and meaning-making processes is recommended for C-MI recovery. Acknowledging the model's need for empirical support, a plausible scale is discussed for future research.

TI  - Genetic and pathogenic characterisation of a virulent Akabane virus isolated from goats in Yunnan, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Akabane virus (AKAV) has been detected in a variety of host species in China, but there are only limited records of its occurrence in goats. However, more attention needs to be paid to understanding the diversity of viruses in this species. The aim of the study was to explore the genotype characteristics and variation trend of AKAV and their relationship with virulence in Yunnan, China. Material and Methods Blood samples were collected from goats during routine surveillance of goat diseases in Yunnan province in 2019. The AKAV CX-01 strain was isolated using BHK-21 cells. To understand pathogenicity, the virus was intraperitoneally (IP) and intracerebrally (IC) inoculated into suckling mice and tissue samples were subsequently analysed histopathologically and immunohistochemically. Results Akabane virus CX-01 strain induced encephalitis and impairment of the central nervous system with fatal consequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on the ORF sequences of the small segments indicated that the AKAV isolate used was most closely related to the GD18134/2018 Chinese midge and bovine NM BS/1strains, while phylogenetic analysis based on the medium segments showed a close relationship between CX-01 and the Chinese GLXCH01 strain. Conclusion The CX-01 isolate was related to AKAV genogroup Ia and probably originated from a recombination of different strains.

TI  - Advances in site-specific weed management in agriculture-A review
T2  - WEED RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The developments of information and automation technologies have opened a new era for weed management to fit physical and chemical control treatments to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of weed distributions in agricultural fields. This review describes the technologies of site-specific weed management (SSWM) systems, evaluates their ecological and economic benefits and gives a perspective for the implementation in practical farming. Sensor technologies including 3D cameras, multispectral imaging and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for weed classification and computer-based decision algorithms are described in combination with precise spraying and hoeing operations. Those treatments are targeted for patches of weeds or individual weed plants. Cameras can also guide inter-row hoes precisely in the centre between two crop rows at much higher driving speed. Camera-guided hoeing increased selectivity and weed control efficacy compared with manual steered hoeing. Robots combine those guiding systems with in-row hoeing or spot spraying systems that can selectively control individual weeds within crop rows. Results with patch spraying show at least 50% saving of herbicides in various crops without causing additional costs for weed control in the following years. A challenge with these technologies is the interoperability of sensing and controllers. Most of the current SSWM technologies use their own IT protocols that do not allow connecting different sensors and implements. Plug & play standards for linking detection, decision making and weeding would improve the adoption of new SSWM technologies and reduce operational costs. An important impact of SSWM is the potential contribution to the EU-Green Deal targets to reduce pesticide use and increase biodiversity. However, further on-farm research is needed for integrating those technologies into agricultural practice.

TI  - Self-degradable poly(β-amino ester)s promote endosomal escape of antigen and agonist
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vaccination with subunit nanovaccines is a promising strategy to combat virus infection and tumor development. However, immunogenicity of present nanovaccines is still unsatisfied for clinical translation. Here, we developed a nanovaccine loading a STING agonist, 2'3'-cGAMP and, a model subunit antigen, OVA, by using a well-defined self-degradable poly(beta-amino ester)s to treat B16F10-OVA melanoma tumors. The polymer underwent slow hydrolysis at pH 5.5 but self-degraded induced by the amino groups along the polyester chain at pH > 6.5. It is shown that the self-degradation products facilitated the release of 2'3'-cGAMP and OVA from early endolysome to the cytosol, where the two components strongly activated CD8(+) T lymphocytes (CTLs) and significantly enhanced Ifn1, TNF, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10 expression. In turn, the tumor microenvironment was remolded from cold to hot. Moreover, the nanovaccine could be quickly drained to sentinel lymph nodes after intratumoral injection. The nanovaccine with strong immunogenicity also could reduce the side effects of systemic inflammatory re-action caused by molecular 2'3'-cGAMP. The tumor progression of animals was inhibited, and their survival rates increased significantly. Thus, the multifunctional biodegradable material provided a new delivery system for a cancer vaccine to translate to clinics.

TI  - Development of the GLASS 250-m leaf area index product (version 6) from MODIS data using the bidirectional LSTM deep learning model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a terrestrial essential climate variable that is required in a variety of ecosystem and climate models. The Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI product has been widely used, but its current version (V5) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data has several limitations, such as frequent temporal fluctuation, large data gaps, high dependence on the quality of surface reflectance, and low computational efficiency. To address these issues, this paper presents a deep learning model to generate a new version of the LAI product (V6) at 250-m resolution from MODIS data from 2000 onward. Unlike most existing algorithms that estimate one LAI value at one time for each pixel, this model estimates LAI for 2 years simultaneously. Three widely used LAI products (MODIS C6, GLASS V5, and PROBA-V V1) are used to generate global representative time-series LAI training samples using K-means clustering analysis and least difference criteria. We explore four machine learning models, the general regression neural network (GRNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and identify Bi-LSTM as the best model for product generation. This new product is directly validated using 79 high-resolution LAI reference maps from three in situ observation networks. The results show that GLASS V6 LAI achieves higher accuracy, with a root mean square (RMSE) of 0.92 at 250 m and 0.86 at 500 m, while the RMSE is 0.98 for PROBA-V at 300 m, 1.08 for GLASS V5, and 0.95 for MODIS C6 both at 500 m. Spatial and temporal consistency analyses also demonstrate that the GLASS V6 LAI product is more spatiotemporally continuous and has higher quality in terms of presenting more realistic temporal LAI dynamics when the surface reflectance is absent for a long period owing to persistent cloud/aerosol contaminations. The results indicate that the new Bi-LSTM deep learning model runs significantly faster than the GLASS V5 algorithm, avoids the reconstruction of surface reflectance data, and is resistant to the noises (cloud and snow contamination) or missing values contained in surface reflectance than other methods, as the Bi-LSTM can effectively extract information across the entire time series of surface reflectance rather than a single time point. To our knowledge, this is the first global time-series LAI product at the 250-m spatial resolution that is freely available to the public (www.geodata.cn and www.glass.umd.edu).

TI  - Ice viscosity is more sensitive to stress than commonly assumed
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate representation of the viscous flow of ice is fundamental to understanding glacier dynamics and projecting sea-level rise. Ice viscosity is often described by a simple but largely untested and uncalibrated constitutive relation, Glen's Flow Law, wherein the rate of deformation is proportional to stress raised to the power n. The value n = 3 is commonly prescribed in ice-flow models, though observations and experiments support a range of values across stresses and temperatures found on Earth. Here, we leverage recent remotely-sensed observations of Antarctic ice shelves to show that Glen's Flow Law approximates the viscous flow of ice with n = 4.1 +/- 0.4 in fast-flowing areas. The viscosity and flow rate of ice are therefore more sensitive to changes in stress than most ice-flow models allow. By calibrating the governing equation of ice deformation, our result is a pathway towards improving projections of future glacier change.The rate of deformation in Antarctic ice shelves is proportional to stress to the power of 4, not 3 as often used in models, according to a calibration of Glen's Flow Law with satellite remote sensing data from Antarctic ice shelves.

TI  - From forest to finished products: The contribution of Industry 4.0 technologies to the wood sector
T2  - COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study offers a Systematic Literature Review of the main applications of Industry 4.0 technologies in the wood sector, from forest management and raw materials production to the manufacturing of finished wood and paper products. The review, based on a rigorous and structured process, includes 106 papers published between January 2011 and December 2020. The analysis and categorization of the selected papers brings to the creation of a summary framework, which identifies (1) the needs of the wood sector that can be ad-dressed with Industry 4.0, (2) the actions to be implemented to satisfy each need and (3) the specific Industry 4.0 technologies to be adopted for the implementation of the identified actions. Overall, the analyses conducted show that Industry 4.0 is mainly applied in previous literature to collect, share and analyze different types of data through network and data processing technologies, thus supporting deci-sion-making processes along the entire wood supply chain. The aforementioned summary framework, which provides a complete overview of the contribution of Industry 4.0 to the wood sector, is used for the development of promising future research opportunities, deriving mainly from the investigation of un-derexploited Industry 4.0 technologies (i.e., blockchain, augmented reality, autonomous and collaborative robots). The research provides contributions to both academics and practitioners interested in the appli-cation of the new technologies to the different wood supply chain processes.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Urban Green Areas Using Change Detection: A Case Study of Kharkiv, Ukraine
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The contemporary globalized world characterizes the rapid population growth, its significant concentration in cities, and an increase in the urban population. Currently, many socio-cultural, economic, environmental, and other challenges are arising in modern cities, negatively affecting the state of the urban environment, health, and quality of life. There is a need to study these problems in order to solve them. Urban Green Areas (UGAs) are a part of the social space and a vital part of the urban landscape. They act as an environmental framework of the territory and a factor ensuring a more comfortable environment of human life. This study aims at substantiating the importance of the UGAs, identifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of their functioning, and transforming changes in their infrastructure given the expansion of their functions. This research was carried out as a case study of the second city in Ukraine, Kharkiv. The authors developed and used an original integrated approach using urban remote sensing (URS) and GIS for changes detection to evaluate the current state and monitor spatial transformations of the UGAs. We used several GIS platforms and online resources to overcome the lack of digital cadastre of the thematic municipal area of Kharkiv. This resulted in the present original study. The study analyses the dynamics of the spatial and functional organization of the UGAs according to the Master Plans, plans, maps, and functional zoning of the city for the period from 1867 to 2019. The peripheral green areas became important after the large-scale development of the extensive residential areas during the rapid industrial development in remote districts of the city. They provide opportunities for population recreation near living places. Central UGAs are modern, comprehensively developed clusters with multidisciplinary infrastructure, while the peripheral UGAs are currently being developed. The use of URS/GIS tools in the analysis of the satellite images covering 2000-2020 allowed identifying the factors of the UGAs losses in Kharkiv and finding that UGAs were not expanding and partially shrinking during the study period. It is caused by the intensive construction of the residential neighborhoods, primarily peripheral areas, infrastructure development, and expansion of the city transport network. Nonetheless, some sustainable trends of UGA functioning without more or less significant decrease could be proved as existing in a long-term perspective. The authors analyzed and evaluated changes and expansion of the UGAs functions according to modern social demand. The research value of this is the usage of different approaches, scientific sources, URS/GIS tools to determine the UGAs transformation in the second-largest city in Ukraine (Kharkiv), to expand and update the main functions of UGAs and their role in the population's recreation. The obtained scientific results can be used to update the following strategies, programs, and development plans of Kharkiv.

TI  - Palpating history: Magical healing and revolutionary care in Rural Serbia and Macedonia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Marxist feminist Silvia Federici has identified the figure of the witch as exemplifying a non-capitalist worldview. While Federici's analysis has significantly nuanced understandings of primitive accumulation, its significance for traditions of magical healing remains to be studied. While Federici focuses on the violent campaign against witchcraft in Western Europe, she does not deal with those people who still practice ways of healing glossed as 'witchcraft' or 'magic' in the present, which have been largely subsumed by the academic discipline of folklore. As the Ottoman Empire was exempt from the early-modern witch craze, the ongoing practices of magical healing found in Serbia and Macedonia provide a particularly rich site for such an investigation. Grounded in ethnographic research on incantation-based healing practices in the Balkan region, this article reveals the contemporary significance of vernacular healing practices in cultivating a relational view of the body. While folklorists have anticipated the death of these practices since the 19th century, the continuation of these practices in the Balkan region tells us that these premonitions of cultural death did not come to fruition. By revealing the false distinction between the social body, the physical body and the mind, healers recognize the body as not only a sack of organs, but as a historical subject embedded in a specific set of material relations. Health is constituted not only by the absence of disease, but by intersubjective relations with the natural world and an ongoing obligation to act ethically toward the dead, toward one's neighbors and toward future generations. Refusing to accept a vision of time and history that regards incantations as archaic, the dead as foreign and the village as the site of the past, the healing practices discussed in this article provide a fertile agenda for revolutionary planning.

TI  - Hydrological evaluation of satellite and reanalysis-based rainfall estimates over the Upper Tekeze Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial rainfall data is an essential input to parametrically distributed hydrological models and is a main contributor to hydrological model uncertainty. Two important issues should be addressed before the use of satellite and reanalysis rainfall product at the basin level: (1) How useful are these rainfall estimates as forcing data for regional hydrological modelling? and (2) Which should be preferred at high-flow and low-flow conditions? This paper presents the hydrological performance of satellite and reanalysis rainfall products (CHIRPSv8 and EWEMBI) at three hydrological stations in the Upper Tekeze River Basin (UTB), northern Ethiopia. Results showed that the daily rainfall data from both CHIRPSv8 and EWEMBI are close to the rain gauge data, with relative errors 2.12 and 3.85%, respectively. The monthly streamflow simulated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model driven by CHIRPSv8 and EWEMBI had a Kling-Gupta Efficiency of 0.6-0.79 and 0.58-0.64, respectively. The hydrological performance during high-flow seasons is superior to low-flow seasons for both CHIRPSv8 and EWEMBI. In particular, CHIRPSv8 showed a relatively better hydrological performance than EWEMBI. This study provides insights on the usefulness of gridded rainfall products for hydrological modelling and under which conditions they can be used to generate a plausible level of adequacy and reliability over the UTB and other related basins.

TI  - Mesoscale patterns in barnacle reproduction are mediated by upwelling-driven thermal variability
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental variables are known to regulate the reproductive output of marine intertidal organisms, but typically these variables are studied as averages and interpreted at a macroscale level. Along 200 km of coast in NW Iberia, great variability in the reproductive activity of the stalked barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes was found among 7 different locations. We found the highest number of broods reported to date in this species and suggest a more realistic method of predicting reproductive success that takes into account sea surface temperature (SST). At these same locations, we studied 13 yr of SST, thermal upwelling index (UI), ground skin temperature and chlorophyll a (chl a) satellite data, using spectral analyses to partition their temporal variability over ecologically relevant time scales. SST played the most relevant role as an environmental driver, explaining 48% of the variability in the proportion of breeding individuals (BI), but the SST-BI goodness-of-fit decreased sharply northwards. Variance-partitioning analyses indicated that cycles between 20 and 100 d in SST and UI were more important southwards, which is consistent with a latitudinal gradient in upwelling intensity and frequency along this coast. Thus, we found better biophysical coupling towards the south, where shorter fluctuation time scales in SST match the gonadal development period (around 1 mo). This pattern may explain the spatial variability in the strength of association between key environmental variables and the reproductive cycle of coastal species along their distribution range.

AB  - As a kind of well-known edible mushroom, the medicinal values of Agaricus blazei Murill also have been well acknowledged. There is no efficient treatment strategy for multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) so far, a crucial cause of clinical death. The present work was designed to evaluate the beneficially protective effects of Agaricus blazei Murill polysaccharides (ABMP) on liver and lung against zymosan (ZY)-induced MODS related damages. The MODS mice were successfully established by given one-time injection of zymosan solution (500 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. The in vivo results demonstrated that ABMP could improve the 10-day survival rate, ease abnormal physiological behavior and alleviate tissues oxidative stress in MODS mice. Besides, ABMP showed potential effects on attenuating the functional impairments of liver and lung. Meanwhile, ABMP effectively inhibited the activation of NF-kappa B signaling pathway and reduced the expressions of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, COX-2 and PGE-2. Additionally, the structural characterizations showed that the significant function of ABMP was possibly related with the beta-pyranose configuration with a triple-helical structure composing of glucose mainly with the proper molecular weights of 12.26 kDa. These findings demonstrated that ABMP exhibited potential protections against liver and lung damages in the ZY-induced MODS mice, providing more theoretical basis and reference significance for the exploration of biological activity of A. blazei Murill.

TI  - VODCA2GPP-a new, global, long-term (1988-2020) gross primary production dataset from microwave remote sensing
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term global monitoring of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) is crucial for assessing ecosystem responses to global climate change. In recent decades, great advances have been made in estimating GPP and many global GPP datasets have been published. These datasets are based on observations from optical remote sensing, are upscaled from in situ measurements, or rely on process-based models. Although these approaches are well established within the scientific community, datasets nevertheless differ significantly.Here, we introduce the new VODCA2GPP dataset, which utilizes microwave remote sensing estimates of vegetation optical depth (VOD) to estimate GPP at the global scale for the period 1988-2020. VODCA2GPP applies a previously developed carbon-sink-driven approach (Teubner et al., 2019, 2021) to estimate GPP from the Vegetation Optical Depth Climate Archive (Moesinger et al., 2020; Zotta et al., 2022), which merges VOD observations from multiple sensors into one long-running, coherent data record. VODCA2GPP was trained and evaluated against FLUXNET in situ observations of GPP and compared against largely independent state-ofthe-art GPP datasets from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), FLUXCOM, and the TRENDY-v7 process-based model ensemble.The site-level evaluation with FLUXNET GPP indicates an overall robust performance of VODCA2GPP with only a small bias and good temporal agreement. The comparisons with MODIS, FLUXCOM, and TRENDY-v7 show that VODCA2GPP exhibits very similar spatial patterns across all biomes but with a consistent positive bias. In terms of temporal dynamics, a high agreement was found for regions outside the humid tropics, with median correlations around 0.75. Concerning anomalies from the long-term climatology, VODCA2GPP correlates well with MODIS and TRENDY-v7 (Pearson's r 0.53 and 0.61) but less well with FLUXCOM (Pearson's r 0.29). A trend analysis for the period 1988-2019 did not exhibit a significant trend in VODCA2GPP at the global scale but rather suggests regionally different long-term changes in GPP. For the shorter overlapping observation period (2003-2015) of VODCA2GPP, MODIS, and the TRENDY-v7 ensemble, significant increases in global GPP were found. VODCA2GPP can complement existing GPP products and is a valuable dataset for the assessment of large-scale and long-term changes in GPP for global vegetation and carbon cycle studies. The VODCA2GPP dataset is available at the TU Data Repository of TUWien (https://doi.org/10.48436/1k7aj-bdz35, Wild et al., 2021).

TI  - Association of Operating Room Costs With Head and Neck Surgical Instrumentation Optimization A Surgeon-Led Quality Improvement Initiative
T2  - JAMA OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE In an era of increasing health care expenditure, reduction of redundant head and neck surgical instrumentation may minimize waste.OBJECTIVE To (1) optimize head and neck surgical instrument trays at a single large academic tertiary care center and (2) identify associated direct cost savings.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective quality improvement initiative was conducted at an academic tertiary care medical center from July 2017 through July 2021. Participants were a multidisciplinary surgical quality team consisting of head and neck surgeons, operating room nurses, surgical technicians, and supply chain analysts.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The 4 primary surgical instrument trays (major otolaryngology [Oto], Oto plastics, direct laryngoscopy, and microdirect laryngoscopy) used in all head and neck procedures were reviewed by 10 head and neck surgical faculty with detailed case observation of instrument utilization performed by trained operating room nurses and surgical technologists. Instruments used in less than 40% of cases were excluded from surgical trays, and novel instrument trays were established based on faculty feedback and utilization. Data on instrument processing, utilization, and associated institutional direct costs were prospectively collected over a 3-year period. The primary outcome measure was change in operating room direct costs. Surgeon satisfaction with the quality improvement intervention was the secondary outcome. Direct cost savings were identified as a function of surgical volume, labor and supply costs, and instrument depreciation.RESULTS More than 1500 eligible surgical cases were reviewed during the preintervention period. Of the 149 instruments in the major Oto tray, only 118 (79%) instruments were used in more than 40% of cases. There were 58 (49%) and 32 (21%) instruments in this tray that were used in more than 40% of neck dissections and sentinel lymph node biopsies, respectively. Resulting intervention included development of a streamlined major Oto tray with 118 instruments and novel neck dissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy trays. Similar processes were applied to the remaining head and neck trays, with a total of 257 instruments removed. Over a 3-year postintervention period, streamlined surgical trays were used 9284 times with direct cost savings of $228 338 (95% CI, $227 817-$228 854). Overall surgeon satisfaction with the optimized head and neck surgical trays was 100%.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this quality improvement study, surgeon-led elimination of redundant or rarely used instruments from surgical instrument trays was associated with reduced operating room direct costs while maintaining stakeholder satisfaction.

TI  - Adaptive Fusion of Multi-Source Tropospheric Delay Estimates for InSAR Deformation Measurements
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric propagation delay correction is the key to improving the accuracy of deformation measurement of satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). The empirical phase-elevation models and external data-based models present uneven performances of atmospheric delay correction for InSAR deformation monitoring. In this study, based on our previous fusion of delays predicted by multiple weather models (FDWM), we propose a new approach of adaptive fusion of multi-source tropospheric delay (AFMTD) estimates derived from multiple models over wide areas, i.e., ERA5, GACOS, WRF, MERRA2, NARR, MODIS, Linear model, and Powerlaw model. The spatially varying scaling algorithm is employed to refine the tropospheric delays predicted by the weather models. Meanwhile, we adopt a multiple-window strategy to cope with the spatially lateral variation of tropospheric delays. The AFMTD not only improves the spatial heterogeneity of tropospheric delay, but also adaptively combines multiple models to achieve a more reliable delay estimation. This AFMTD method is incorporated into the StaMPS-SBAS procedure. We compared the AFMTD with other single models using ENVISAT ASAR and Sentinel-1 datasets over Los Angeles of Southern California. The result of ASAR first demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of the AFMTD method by referring to the assumed ground truth of simultaneous MERIS observations. The results of Sentinel-1 data show that over 95% of unwrapped interferograms have the minimum root-mean-square values after AFMTD correction for both descending and ascending tracks. The validation against GPS observation presents that the RMSEs of InSAR displacement time series after AFMTD correction decreases at more than 90% of 125 GPS stations. The average reductions of RMSE are 35.79% and 36.28% for descending and ascending data, respectively, and the maximum improvement is more than 70%. Overall, the proposed AFMTD method outperforms any single model for InSAR tropospheric delay correction and provides an open framework to fuse multi-source tropospheric delay estimates.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of the thermohaline structure and cyclonic response in the northern Bay of Bengal: The evaluation of a global ocean forecasting system
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the performance of the high-resolution global ocean forecasting system, which is based on First Institute of Oceanography surface wave-tide-circulation coupled ocean model (FIO-COM) has been demonstrated to have reasonable accuracy in global context, especially in tropical oceans and some special cases, the assessment needs to be extended in different parts of the global oceans. As such, given the significance of a regional Ocean Forecasting System (OFS) in the world's prominent freshwater dominated basin, the northern Bay of Bengal, a groundwork is crucial for the modeling community. Thus, performance of FIO-COM analysis and forecasting results is assessed by utilizing available moored buoy, satellite, and reanalysis datasets. The present study compares the thermohaline structure related variables (e.g., temperature, salinity) from FIO-COM with aforementioned datasets on a seasonal and daily basis. We focused on evaluating the FIO-COM outputs during a very severe cyclonic storm named Titli that formed in October, 2018. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for sea surface temperature (SST) ranges from 0.47 to 0.71 degrees C, and for sea surface salinity from 0.62 to 0.83 psu; while vertical profile RMSE ranges from 0.27 to 1.0 degrees C for temperature, and 0.22 to 0.56 psu for salinity between FIO-COM products and observations. Daily variations in different thermohaline structure related variables at two RAMA positions are also well captured by the FIO-COM outputs. Both model and satellite data show pronounced SST cooling (approximately 2.0-2.5 degrees C) and increased sea surface salinity (similar to 1 psu) on the right side of the cyclone track. High SST, TCHP and deep isothermal layer depth were the main oceanic triggering forces to intensify the cyclone Titli.

TI  - Structural investigation of Zungeru-Kalangai fault zone and its environ, Nigeria using aeromagnetic and remote sensing data
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analysed aeromagnetic and satellite imagery data over parts of northern Nigeria to delineate magnetic and surface lineaments associated with fault system trends. The aeromagnetic data were analysed using the Fast Fourier transform technique for reduction-to-equator, total horizontal derivative, analytic signal amplitude and Euler deconvolution. Landsat-8 OLI and SRTM data have been enhanced using spatial filtering and hill-shading techniques for the delineation of lineament features. The extracted surface lineaments are denser on the satellite imageries than on the HRAD because the datasets respond to different physical properties of the geological units and features. The location and orientation of the Zungeru/Kalangai fault zone, which extends about 245 km from the Bida Basin Basement to the northern part of Nigeria, correlate with the existing fault on the published geological map and form a conjugate pair with a fault around Kaya. The derived maps revealed the presence of several previously undetected geological lineaments corresponding to faults and folded dyke, striking predominantly N-S, NNE-SSW, NE-SW and NW-SE lacking in previous geological maps. The application of 2D forward modelling revealed the 2D image of the nature of the subsurface, magnetic susceptibilities of rocks and the block boundaries coinciding with the geological lineaments.

TI  - Assessment of the Emerging Threat Posed by Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances to Male Reproduction in Humans
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Per-fluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a diverse group of synthetic fluorinated chemicals used widely in industry and consumer products. Due to their extensive use and chemical stability, PFAS are ubiquitous environmental contaminants and as such, form an emerging risk factor for male reproductive health. The long half-lives of PFAS is of particular concern as the propensity to accumulate in biological systems prolong the time taken for excretion, taking years in many cases. Accordingly, there is mounting evidence supporting a negative association between PFAS exposure and an array of human health conditions. However, inconsistencies among epidemiological and experimental findings have hindered the ability to definitively link negative reproductive outcomes to specific PFAS exposure. This situation highlights the requirement for further investigation and the identification of reliable biological models that can inform health risks, allowing sensitive assessment of the spectrum of effects of PFAS exposure on humans. Here, we review the literature on the biological effects of PFAS exposure, with a specific focus on male reproduction, owing to its utility as a sentinel marker of general health. Indeed, male infertility has increasingly been shown to serve as an early indicator of a range of co-morbidities such as coronary, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases. It follows that adverse associations have been established between PFAS exposure and the incidence of testicular dysfunction, including pathologies such as testicular cancer and a reduction in semen quality. We also give consideration to the mechanisms that render the male reproductive tract vulnerable to PFAS mediated damage, and discuss novel remediation strategies to mitigate the negative impact of PFAS contamination and/or to ameliorate the PFAS load of exposed individuals.

TI  - The photometric study of the low-mass-ratio contact binary EK Aqr
T2  - NEW ASTRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we have carried out photometric analysis and orbital period variation study of the contact binary EK Aqr. The Transiting Explanation Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves were analyzed by using Wilson-Devinney (W-D) program. Through the research, it is found that EK Aqr is an A-type low mass ratio median-contact binary (q = 0.192, f = 32.8%). A hot spot added on the primary component can model the asymmetric light curves. In addition, the TESS light curves exhibit continuous variation, which may be result from the position changes of the hot spot on the primary star. The absolute physical parameters were estimated by assuming the more massive primary component is a main-sequence star. Through O-C analysis, it is discovered that the orbital period is increasing, and the rate is (3.63 + 0.06)x10(-7)d/yr. The long-term increase of the period is due to the mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive component. The evolutionary status of EK Aqr is analyzed, and the age of EK Aqr is also calculated.

TI  - Histologic grade has a higher-weighted value than nodal status as predictor of outcome in dogs with cutaneous mast cell tumours and overtly metastatic sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In canine cutaneous mast cell tumours (cMCTs), histologic grade and clinical stage are the most important prognostic factors, with high-grade tumours and metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) significantly influencing the evolution of disease. However, it is uncertain whether histologic grade and clinical stage should be given equal weighting value in patient prognostication and management. Dogs with low- and high-grade cMCTs and at least one overtly metastatic sentinel LN undergoing standardized treatment, consisting of surgical excision of the cMCT, lymphadenectomy and chemotherapy, were retrospectively included. The aim was to determine whether, at the same clinical stage, histologic grade retained prognostic relevance. Sixty dogs were included: 26 had a high-grade cMCT tumour and 34 had a low-grade cMCT. Median follow-up was 367 days (range, 187-748) in the high-grade group, and 1208 days (range, 180-2576) in the low-grade group. Median time to progression was significantly shorter in the high-grade group than in the low-grade group (214 days versus not reached; p < .001), as well as tumour-specific survival (545 days versus not reached; p < .001). On multivariable analysis, a high histologic grade and incomplete margins retained prognostic significance for both tumour progression and tumour-specific death. In dogs with cMCT and at least one overtly metastatic LN undergoing multimodal treatment, histologic grade significantly correlated with outcome. Overall prognosis was not unfavourable, even in the high-grade group, further supporting that a multimodal therapeutic approach, addressing primary tumour and sentinel LN, should be offered. Whether chemotherapy should be incorporated in the therapeutic planning of low-grade cMCTs remains to be defined.

TI  - Generating landslide density heatmaps for rapid detection using open-access satellite radar data in Google Earth Engine
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid detection of landslides is critical for emergency response, disaster mitigation, and improving our understanding of landslide dynamics. Satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be used to detect landslides, often within days of a triggering event, because it penetrates clouds, operates day and night, and is regularly acquired worldwide. Here we present a SAR backscatter change approach in the cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) that uses multi-temporal stacks of freely available data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites to generate landslide density heatmaps for rapid detection. We test our GEE-based approach on multiple recent rainfall- and earthquake-triggered landslide events. Our ability to detect surface change from landslides generally improves with the total number of SAR images acquired before and after a landslide event, by combining data from both ascending and descending satellite acquisition geometries and applying topographic masks to remove flat areas unlikely to experience landslides. Importantly, our GEE approach does not require downloading a large volume of data to a local system or specialized processing software, which allows the broader hazard and landslide community to utilize and advance these state-of-the-art remote sensing data for improved situational awareness of landslide hazards.

TI  - A Real-Time Respiration Monitoring and Classification System Using a Depth Camera and Radars
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Respiration rate (RR) and respiration patterns (RP) are considered early indicators of physiological conditions and cardiorespiratory diseases. In this study, we addressed the problem of contactless estimation of RR and classification of RP of one person or two persons in a confined space under realistic conditions. We used three impulse radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB) radars and a 3D depth camera (Kinect) to avoid any blind spot in the room and to ensure that at least one of the radars covers the monitored subjects. This article proposes a subject localization and radar selection algorithm using a Kinect camera to allow the measurement of the respiration of multiple people placed at random locations. Several different experiments were conducted to verify the algorithms proposed in this work. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the estimated RR and reference RR of one-subject and two-subjects RR estimation are 0.61 +/- 0.53 breaths/min and 0.68 +/- 0.24 breaths/min, respectively. A respiratory pattern classification algorithm combining feature-based random forest classifier and pattern discrimination algorithm was developed to classify different respiration patterns including eupnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, Kussmaul respiration and apnea. The overall classification accuracy of 90% was achieved on a test dataset. Finally, a real-time system showing RR and RP classification on a graphical user interface (GUI) was implemented for monitoring two subjects.

TI  - Influence of climate change and extreme weather events on an estuarine fish community
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent as a result of climate change, and the increasing frequency of these events may lead to significant changes in fish assemblages. In this sense, this work aimed to study the effects of climate change and extreme weather events on fish assemblages in the Rio Minho estuary (Portugal). Between 2010 and 2019, continuous weekly sampling with fyke nets was carried out to assess the dynamics of fish assemblages in the estuary. In addition, temperature and precipitation data were obtained from satellite information to assess the relationship between climatic variables and fish composition, structure, and diversity. Fish populations changed significantly over time, becoming less diverse and largely dominated by a few, mostly invasive species (e.g., carp, goldfish, pumpkinseed, and tench), while the abundance of most native species declined over the years (e.g., panjorca, stickleback, and shad). High temperatures and low precipitation negatively affected native species, while the invasive species benefited from increased temperatures and extreme weather events (droughts and floods).

TI  - Assimilating remote sensing data into a crop model improves winter wheat yield estimation based on regional irrigation data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation plays an important role in crop yield production in arid and semi-arid regions. However, irrigation effects have not been well addressed in the application of crop models at a regional scale due to limited availability, which constrains the reliability and accuracy of simulation results. Assimilating remote sensing information into crop models can provide a viable approach to reduce associated uncertainties. In this study, regional irrigation data for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown on the Loess Plateau was used to calibrate and validate the ChinaAgrosys (China Agricultural System) crop model at site and regional scales. Remote sensing data was then assimilated into the ChinaAgrosys crop model under four assimilation schemes. remotely sensed assimilation state variables (i.e., LAI and NDVI) and two assimilation algorithms (i.e., (Partical swarm optimization) and SCE-UA (Shuffled complex evolution)) were considered. During the winter wheat growing season on the Loess Plateau, 30.6% of the wheat production area was irrigated once, 6.7% irrigated two times, 3.7% was irrigated three times, and the remaining wheat area was rainfed. The R2 values between maturity date, LAI, and yield simulated by the ChinaAgrosys crop model and observations agrometeorological stations on the Loess Plateau were greater than 0.73, 0.44, and 0.60, respectively, during 2010-2015. The accuracy and spatial heterogeneity of winter wheat yield estimation were effectively improved by assimilating remote sensing data into the ChinaAgrosys crop model based on regional irrigation data. the four assimilation schemes, the combination of PSO+NDVI produced the highest accuracy for yield estimation in Hongtong county (92.8%), followed by SCE-UA+NDVI (92.0%). Our results demonstrated the importance accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of water availability when applying a crop model in arid and semi-arid regions. Additionally, our analysis regarding different assimilation state variables and algorithms indicated both simulation accuracy and calculation efficiency should be considered when assimilating remote sensing

TI  - Use of GIS and dasymetric mapping for estimating tsunami-affected population to facilitate humanitarian relief logistics: a case study from Phuket, Thailand
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami led to improvements in Thailand's early warning systems and evacuation procedures. However, there was no consideration of better aid delivery, which critically depends on estimates of the affected population. With the widespread use of geographical information systems (GIS), there has been renewed interest in spatial population estimation. This study has developed an application to determine the number of disaster-impacted people in a given district, by integrating GIS and population estimation algorithms, to facilitate humanitarian relief logistics. A multi-stage spatial interpolation is used for estimating the affected populations using ArcGIS software. We present a dasymetric mapping approach using a population-weighted technique coupled with remote sensing data. The results in each target area show the coordinates of each shelter location for evacuees, with the minimum and maximum numbers of people affected by the tsunami inundation. This innovative tool produces not only numerical solutions for decision makers, but also a variety of maps that improve visualisation of disaster severity across neighbourhoods. A case study in Patong, a town of Phuket, illustrates the application of this GIS-based approach. The outcomes can be used as key decision-making factors in planning and managing humanitarian relief logistics in the preparedness and response phases to improve performance with future tsunami occurrences, or with other types of flood disaster.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal High-Resolution Subsoil Compaction Risk Assessment for a 5-Years Crop Rotation at Regional Scale
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil compaction results whenever applied soil stress by machinery exceed the soil strength. Both, soil strength and stress, are spatially and temporally highly variable, depending on the weather situation, the current crop type, and the machinery used. Thus, soil compaction risk is very dynamic, changes from day to day and from field to field. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of soil compaction risk and to identify hot-spot areas of high soil compaction risk at regional scale. Therefore, we selected a study area (similar to 2,000 km(2)) with intensive arable farming in Northern Germany, having a high share of cereals, maize and sugar beets. Sentinel-2 images were used to derive the crop types for a 5-years crop rotation (2016-2020). We calculated the soil compaction risk using an updated version of the SaSCiA-model (Spatially explicit Soil Compaction risk Assessment) for each single day of the period, with a spatial resolution of 20 m. The results showed the dynamic changes of soil compaction risk within a year and throughout the entire crop rotation. The relatively dry years 2016 and 2018-2020 reduced the soil compaction risk even at high wheel loads applied to soil during maize and sugar beet harvest. Contrary, high precipitation in 2017 increased the soil compaction risk considerably. Focusing on the complete 5-year period, 2.7% of the cropland area was identified as hot-spots of soil compaction risk, where the highest soil compaction risk class ("extremely high") occurred every year. Additionally, 39.8% of the cropland was affected by "extremely high" soil compaction at least in one of the 5 years. Although the soil compaction risk analysis does not provide information on the actual extent of the compacted area, the identification of risk areas within a period may contribute to understand the dynamics of soil compaction risk in crop rotation at regional scale and provide advice to mitigate further soil compaction in areas classified as high risk.

TI  - An empirical analysis of surface-level methane emission from anthropogenic sources in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an empirical analysis of surface-level methane emission from anthropogenic sources in two major Indian cities. Three categories of sources were considered-(1) fossil fuel exploration and energy pro-duction (2) agriculture and livestock farming and (3) waste processing and disposal. In each city, specific sources were identified and mapped to the nearest methane monitoring station. As these sources were active for varying periods, treatment and control periods were designed by partitioning the observation period based on the activity of sources. This experimental design framework was used to formulate and test hypotheses on contribution of these sources to methane emission. Given the limitations and statistical properties (non-normal residuals and heteroskedasticity) of the data a robust alternative to classical analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test three hypotheses. Tests confirmed that these sources contributed significantly to methane emission. Specifically, emission from MSW disposal facilities was substantial as evident from the data in Delhi. In Bengaluru, aggregate emission from following sources was found significant-(1) a diesel-based power plant and a landfill (2) a sewage treatment plant and a landfill. This empirical work compliments previous studies on greenhouse gas emissions, which were based on climate models and satellite remote sensing data. This analysis of natural experiment ends with recommendations to manage methane emission from anthropogenic sources.

TI  - Land-use/land-cover changes and implications in Southern Ethiopia: evidence from remote sensing and informants
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding land use/cover (LULC) changes and their impacts on the catchment are imperative for proper land management. Hence, useful information concerning responses to LULC changes becomes important to minimize negative impacts on future land uses. The aim of the study was to evaluate the LULC changes and consequences of the change at Bilate catchment from 1986 to 2018. The LULC change evaluations were undertaken by using Landsat images of 1986, 2002 and 2018. Supervised image classification was employed to map the land cover classes. Informant interviews and group discussions with field observations were used to identify the conse-quences of the changes. Over the past periods, built-up areas, water bodies, cultivation, and barren lands have increased by 0.97, 0.13, 9.27, and 1.36%, respectively. However, the forest and grazing lands have decreased by 8.56 and 3.18% respectively. Exhaustive land cultivation without appropriate management and cultivation of sloppy lands have increased soil erosion and sediment yield to water bodies. A decline in crop yields, livestock products and numbers, and fish population in Lake Abaya are the major implications of LULC change in the catchment. Therefore, to ensure sustainable land use, responsible bodies commit and work closely with com-munities through participatory approaches.

TI  - Unique NISTAR-Based Climate GCM Diagnostics of the Earth's Planetary Albedo and Spectral Absorption Through Longitudinal Data Slicing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) measurements of Earth's reflected solar and emitted thermal radiation permit a unique model/data comparison perspective that is not readily available from other satellite data. The key factor is the unique Lissajous orbital viewing geometry from the Lagrangian L1 point, which enables a continuous view of Earth's sunlit hemisphere. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Advanced Radiometer (NISTAR) is the DSCOVR Mission energy budget instrument, which views the reflected and emitted radiation of the Earth's sunlit hemisphere by means of single pixel active cavity full-spectrum (Band-A, 0.2-100 & mu;m) and filtered solar wavelength (Band-B, 0.2-4.0 & mu;m; and Band-C, 0.7-4.0 & mu;m) radiometer measurements. An additional solar wavelength photodiode channel (0.3-1.1 & mu;m) provides a calibration reference. The objective of this study is the assessment of climate GCM performance via direct model/data comparisons. Such comparisons are difficult due to quasi-chaotic natural variability present in real-world observational data and in climate GCM simulations. This is where the unique DSCOVR viewing geometry makes possible the longitudinal data slicing methodology for more direct model/data comparison. The key point of the longitudinal slicing approach is that data integration over the entire sunlit hemisphere eliminates the quasi-chaotic meteorological weather-scale noise, while preserving intra-seasonal and planetary-scale variability. The rotation of the Earth that retrieves this climate-style, large-scale longitudinal and seasonal variability. The hemispheric averaging is accomplished automatically in NISTAR measurements with its single-pixel view of the Earth. For climate GCMs, this requires implementing the Sunlit Hemisphere Sampling (SHS) scheme to operate on the GCM run-time output data, utilizing the DSCOVR Satellite Ephemeris data to assure precise viewing geometry between NISTAR measurements and GCM output data, while averaging out the meteorological weather noise. However, GCM generated data are radiative fluxes, while NISTAR (and EPIC) measurements are near-backscattered radiances. Conversing NISTSR measurements into radiative fluxes cannot be accomplished using NISTAR data alone, even with detailed support from conventional satellite data. But the identical viewing geometry of Earth's sunlit hemisphere, and synergistic analyses of EPIC data make it feasible for this conversion of NISTAR near-backscatter radiances into radiative fluxes.

TI  - Shallow coastal water turbidity monitoring using Planet Dove satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity monitoring in shallow coastal waters is fundamental to marine ecosystem research, management and protection. Satellite-based water turbidity monitoring can be conducted at a greater spatial extent and higher temporal frequency than field measurements. The new Planet Dove satellite constellation has a daily revisit frequency and higher spatial resolution than Sentinel or Landsat satellites, allowing Planet Dove to track water turbidity dynamics in greater detail when suitable atmospheric correction is provided. We developed a new shallow coastal water turbidity estimation algorithm for Planet Dove and similar multi-spectral satellites. Our algorithm accounts for bottom reflectance in total water-leaving radiance to derive turbidity values in shallow coastal waters. We tested the algorithm with data from 235 Dove satellite images at five sites with different water conditions (Pelekane Bay, Big Island, Hawai'i; Hilo Bay, Big Island, Hawai'i; Kilo Nalu and Ala Wai, O'ahu, Hawai'i; Fagatele Bay, American Samoa; Vieques Island, Puerto Rico). We then validated satellite-derived turbidity results (RMSE = 0.79-1.12 FNU [Formazin Nephelometric Unit]) using 75 days of field-measured data, ranging in turbidity from 0.1 to 11.6 FNU in the five sites. Results show that our algorithm accurately detects turbidity in critical nearshore environments. In Hawai'i, we used similar to 6700 Dove images to support a weekly turbidity monitoring study at a large geographic scale. We found this new, shallow-water algorithm can be effectively applied to Dove satellite data to monitor water turbidity at high temporal resolution.

TI  - The state and fate of lake ice thickness in the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - SCIENCE BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice thickness (LIT) is important for regional hydroclimate systems, lake ecosystems, and human activities on the ice, and is thought to be highly susceptible to global warming. However, the spatiotemporal variability in LIT is largely unknown due to the difficulty in deriving in situ measurements and the lack of an effective remote sensing platform. Despite intensive development and applications of lake ice models driven by general circulation model output, evaluation of the global LIT is mostly based on assumed "ideal " lakes in each grid cell of the climate forcing data. A method for calculating the actual global LIT is therefore urgently needed. Here we use satellite altimetry to retrieve ice thickness for 16 large lakes in the Northern Hemisphere (Lake Baikal, Great Slave Lake, and others) with an accuracy of similar to 0.2 m for almost three decades. We then develop a 1-D lake ice model driven primarily by remotely sensed data and cross-validated with the altimetric LIT to provide a robust means of estimating LIT for lakes larger than 50 km(2) across the Northern Hemisphere. Mean LIT (annual maximum ice thickness) for 1313 simulated lakes and reservoirs covering similar to 840,000 km(2) for 2003-2018 is 0.63 +/- 0.02 m, corresponding to similar to 485 Gt of water. LIT changes are projected for 2071-2099 under RCPs 2.6, 6.0, and 8.5, showing that the mean LIT could decrease by similar to 0.35 m under the worst concentration pathway and the associated lower ice road availability could have a significant impact on socio-economic activities.

TI  - Coseismic Displacement and Slip Distribution of the 21 May 2021 Mw 6.1 Earthquake in Yangbi, China Derived From InSAR Observations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - On 21 May 2021, a Mw 6.1 earthquake struck Yangbi County, Yunnan Province, China. In this study, InSAR data from Sentinel-1 SAR images were processed to image the coseismic deformation fields of the Yangbi earthquake. Then, the optimal slip model was obtained by applying the particle swarm optimization method. The interferometry results revealed that the earthquake triggered obvious surface deformation near the epicenter, while the earthquake did not produce an obvious surface rupture zone from field investigation. The optimal slip model suggests that the strike of the seismogenic fault responsible for this event is 139 degrees, the dip angle is 81 degrees, and the average rake angle is -170 degrees. Additionally, the slip was concentrated mainly at depths of 2-8 km, the maximum dip-slip amount was 0.5 m, and the cumulative seismic moment reached 1.43 x 10(18) N.m, equivalent to a Mw 6.1 earthquake. The geodetic and geophysical inversion results demonstrate that the Yangbi earthquake was dominated by a steeply dipping dextral strike-slip rupture. The rupture fault generally strikes NNW-SSE, which is consistent with that of the Weixi-Qiaohou fault, and may be a relatively new fault formed by an E-W-oriented extension of the western boundary of the Sichuan-Yunnan block. Finally, based on the InSAR results in combination with the spatial distribution characteristics of ground fissures and the strong historical earthquakes, we analyzed the tectonic background preceding the Yangbi earthquake and analyzed the relationship between the Yangbi earthquake and strong historical earthquakes in the region, thereby providing empirical evidence for analyzing seismic risk and fault rupture parameters, interpreting seismic deformation characteristics, and better understanding the seismogenic background of the western boundary of the Sichuan-Yunnan block.

TI  - When the clipped node goes missing, CT guided SAVI SCOUT placement: A novel approach for localizing soft tissue targets
T2  - CLINICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary staging in breast cancer is performed with physical exam and axillary imaging. Suspicious lymph nodes are biopsied and clipped prior to surgery to identify the previously biopsied node during surgery. Conventional mapping techniques of blue dye and radioisotope do not always accurately identify the clipped lymph node and therefore many techniques have been described to improve the identification of the clipped lymph node. Most of these techniques rely on axillary ultrasound to identify the previously biopsied lymph node or previously placed clip. A marker such as a fiducial reflector is then placed percutaneously. In this case report we describe a novel technique of Computed tomography (CT) identification of a previously clipped lymph node with CT guided placement of a fiducial reflector (SAVI SCOUT). The SAVI SCOUT was then identified and successfully excised with the previously biopsied lymph node.A precis: CT guided placement of SAVI SCOUT is a novel technique for the identification and retrieval of a previously biopsied axillary lymph node in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Modelling Fault Scarp Degradation to Determine Earthquake History on the Muztagh Ata and Tahman Faults in the Chinese Pamir
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency of earthquakes on active faults is usually revealed by palaeoseismic trenching and geological dating. Nonetheless, field trenching and sampling are sometimes limited by difficulties in logistics, therefore impeding palaeoseismological studies. As surface rupture earthquakes create fault scarps that evolve with time, they may also provide important information about the timing of earthquakes. In this study, we provide a new approach to determine earthquake history based on the morphology of fault scarps. We select the Muztagh Ata and Tahman normal faults in the Chinese Pamir as a test area, on which fault scarps are well preserved but the earthquake history has not been quantified yet. We first simulate fault scarp degradation using a nonlinear transport model to obtain the empirical relationship between scarp width and its evolution time. We then measure 68 fault scarps from high-resolution topographic data derived from WorldView-2 stereo imagery. The measured fault scarps are clustered in four groups, each group possibly representing one earthquake event. Combining the time-width relationship and scarp width measurements, we infer that four earthquakes occurred at 0.1 +/- 0.4 kyrs before the present (BP), 2.1 +/- 0.5 kyrs BP, 2.9 +/- 0.4 kyrs BP and 4.9 +/- 0.5 kyrs BP, respectively. The first event is likely to be the most recent earthquake occurred on the faults, i.e., the 1895 Tashkurgan earthquake ( similar to 0.13 kyrs BP). Based on the estimated earthquake recurrence intervals and vertical offsets, we obtain a vertical slip rate of 2.2 +/- 0.3 mm/yr on the Muztagh Ata and Tahman faults, conforming to previous geological rate estimates.

TI  - Multi-variable assimilation into a modified AquaCrop model for improved maize simulation without management or crop phenology information
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop modeling at the field-level is important for yield prediction and agricultural risk mitigation, but is often hindered by the lack of information on field management as well as crop phenology of different cultivars. This study aims to develop a data assimilation framework for field-level crop modeling without management or crop phenology information for potential remote sensing applications. To do this, we first present a Monte Carlo simulation-based approach to estimating planting date and quasi-calibrated phenological parameters. Second, a simplified fertility stress scheme is developed for the AquaCrop model. The aim here is not necessarily to improve the AquaCrop model but to facilitate ensemble simulation when the field-level fertility stress condition is unknown. Finally, in situ soil moisture, canopy cover and biomass measurements are assimilated into the model to estimate crop yield, with the potential for yield prediction also explored. The experiments were performed for a rainfed maize field over 9 growing seasons, with each using a different maize cultivar. Results suggest that the planting dates can be accurately estimated (RMSE = 7.1 days, MAE = 5.4 days), and that the simplified fertility stress scheme adequately approximates the biomass and yield estimates from the original AquaCrop model under different fertility stress conditions. Data assimilation improves yield estimation, with an RMSE of 0.97 Mg/ha compared to 2.14 Mg/ha from the no-assimilation case. Yield prediction experiments reveal that the method is able to predict yield within 15% of the observed values up to 3 months before harvest. The proposed methodology does not rely on field-based information (e.g., planting date, plant density, crop phenology, fertility condition), and illustrates the potential for field-level crop modeling and yield forecasting using remote sensing data.

TI  - Pansharpened landsat 8 thermal-infrared data for improved Land Surface Temperature characterization in a heterogeneous urban landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable urban Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) characterization are important for land use planning as well as climate and thermal impact analysis in cities. High resolution LULC and LST datasets are required for detailed spatial analysis such as understanding the contribution of small LULC fragments to thermal characteristics of the entire urban landscape. To date, detailed analysis of urban surfaces using satellite imagery has been hindered by low to moderate spatial resolution of freely available sensors of past and existing missions. Hence, this study sought to investigate the potential of pansharpening Landsat 8 data in improving LULC mapping and LST characterization in Bulawayo metropolitan city, Zimbabwe. Six LULC classes namely; bare area, built-up, low density, dense forest, grasslands and water bodies were considered for the study and respective spatially-explicit locational information (GPS coordinates) class samples identified. Supervised image classification using the Support Vector Machines algorithm was adopted for the un-pansharpened (30m) and separately using different pansharpened (i.e. Brovey, Simple Mean, ESR, IHS and Gram-Schmidt) datasets (15m) as input. Results indicated improved discriminability of LULC and LST features as well as increased classification accuracy from all pansharpening methods when compared to the 30m resolution data. Average inter-class separability increased from 1.577 using original data to 1.863 after pansharpening. The simple mean method showed the highest classification accuracy (92.13%), outperforming un-pansharpened data (89.77%) and other pansharpening methods (89.45-91.75%). Pansharpened data showed better accuracy in LST spatial characterization than un-pansharpened thermal data. For each LULC class, mean LST was slightly higher before, than after pansharpening, by between 0.1 and 1 degrees C. The study further established that pansharpening based on simple mean method did not compromise the spatial correlation between LULC and LST. These findings present a great improvement towards accurately mapping LULC and LST in heterogeneous urban landscapes.

TI  - Digitalization between environmental activism and counter-activism: The case of satellite data on deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes the uses of digital satellite data on deforestation in the Amazon region, drawing on post-structuralist studies of scientific knowledge practices and Science and Technology Studies (STS). Focusing on changes under the government of President Jair Bolsonaro, we argue that populist right-wing rhetoric, policies, and practices towards deforestation in the Amazon must be understood in the context of a broad and sophisticated effort to discredit and dismantle pre-existing knowledge infrastructures and transparency regime. These structures had developed over time with the aim of making deforestation visible and manageable. The dismantling of these structures is part of the effort to establish a competing alethurgy, i.e an assemblage of procedures and rituals that claim to manifest the "truth" about the Amazon. This new alethurgy depends, crucially, on a regime of hypertransparency which enables practices of environmental counter-activism. This new alethurgy promotes an extractivist use of the Amazon in which deforestation is an acceptable price to pay for economic development.

TI  - Spatiotemporal distribution of labeled data can bias the validation and selection of supervised learning algorithms: A marine remote sensing example
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supervised learning allows the prediction of variables measured in-situ from variables that can be measured from satellites. A labeled data set for this purpose is typically created by matching in-situ and satellite data and split into subsets for model training and initial validation. However, the available data are often not randomly distributed in space and time. In theory, this can bias estimates of prediction errors. Here, remote sensing of chlorophyll a in the Baltic Sea serves as an example to demonstrate the importance of this problem in marine remote sensing, and to test how well different statistical designs for validation mitigate it. Semi-synthetic data sets were created by combining daily chlorophyll a fields from a biogeochemical model hindcast with real-world locations and times of in-situ measurements, generated by sampling 2,000 combinations of cruises from an oceanographic database. These data sets were matched with co-located satellite data and used to train and validate four algorithms using remote sensing reflectances as input. The algorithms were validated using different methods including random hold-out sets and various block cross-validation designs based on geographical location, time, or location in predictor space. The resulting error estimates were compared to true errors calculated from differences to the biogeochemical model outputs serving as response variable. All validation methods underestimated prediction errors, in many cases by > 30%. While a simple band-ratio algorithm had the smallest true errors (e.g., absolute percentage difference: APD = 50%), estimated errors were smallest for more complicated and in fact less accurate machine learning algorithms. For example, ten-fold cross-validation led to selection of the truly best algorithm among four candidates for < 10% of data sets. The biases were smallest, but not absent, for spatial block cross-validation, which selected the truly best algorithm for 21-46% of data sets, depending on the error measure. When the analyses were repeated with data that were randomly distributed in space and time, the biases of error estimates based on random splits became much smaller (e.g., 10 fold cross-validation estimated errors within 2% of their true values and selected the truly best algorithm for > 99% of data sets), spatial block cross-validation overestimated prediction errors (often by > 40%), all algorithms achieved lower true errors, and a random forest made the most accurate predictions overall (APD = 27%). These results show that more attention should be paid to statistical methods for estimating the errors of supervised learning algorithms, e.g., by using multiple validation methods in combination and critically discussing error estimates considering questions of dependence, representativeness, and stationarity. Furthermore, nonrandom spatiotemporal distribution of labeled data can be a barrier to harnessing the full potential of machine learning algorithms in marine remote sensing.

TI  - Monitoring the damage of armyworm as a pest in summer corn by unmanned aerial vehicle imaging
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND The timely, rapid, and accurate near real-time observations are urgent to monitor the damage of corn armyworm, because the rapid expansion of armyworm would lead to severe yield losses. Therefore, the potential of machine learning algorithms for identifying the armyworm infected areas automatically and accurately by multispectral unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) dataset is explored in this study. The study area is in Beicuizhuang Village, Langfang City, Hebei Province, which is the main corn-producing area in the North China Plain. RESULTS Firstly, we identified the optimal combination of image features by Gini-importance and the comparation of four kinds of machine learning methods including Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayesian (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) was done. And RF was proved to be the most potential with the highest Kappa and OA of 0.9709 and 0.9850, respectively. Secondly, the armyworm infected areas and healthy corn areas were predicted by an optimized RF model in the UAV dataset, and the armyworm incidence levels were classified subsequently. Thirdly, the relationship between the spectral characteristics of different bands and pest incidence levels within the Sentinel-2 and UAV images were analyzed, and the B3 in UAV images and the B6 in Sentinel-2 image were less sensitive for armyworm incidence levels. Therefore, the Sentinel-2 image was used to monitor armyworm in two towns. CONCLUSIONS The optimized dataset and RF model are effective and reliable, which can be used for identifying the corn damage by armyworm using UAV images accurately and automatically in field-scale.

TI  - Left External Iliac Vein Injury During Laparoscopic Pelvic Lymphadenectomy for Early-Stage Ovarian Cancer: Our Experience and Review of Literature
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Laparoscopic surgical staging is the standard treatment of early-stage ovarian tumors with similar survival outcomes if compared with laparotomic procedures. In this article, we report a case regarding an incidental external iliac vein injury during a pelvic lymphadenectomy for fertility sparing treatment of early-stage ovarian cancer with a video showing the laparoscopic repair without any consequence or side effect. A 36 year-old obese woman with Body Mass Index 30 kg/m(2) referred at our hospital with an histological diagnosis of high grade ovarian serous carcinoma after a left laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy performed in another hospital. After an hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy, a laparoscopic surgical staging with a pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy with lymph-node dissection until the left renal vein, omentectomy, and appendectomy were performed. A thermal injury to the left external iliac vein occurred using the bipolar forceps during lymphadenectomy and was repaired after an immediate clamping of the site using endoclinch and the suction irrigator probe. The laceration on the iliac vein was successfully repaired using 10 mm laparoscopic titanium clips; after a follow-up of 42 months no recurrence was detected. In conclusion, laparoscopy is a safe and effective therapeutic option for fertility sparing treatment patients with early stage ovarian carcinoma with a significantly low morbidity and postoperative hospitalization, but it should be reserved for oncologic surgeons trained in advanced laparoscopic procedures and repair of vascular injuries potentially associated with high mortality rate.

TI  - Using Sentinel-1 and GRACE satellite data to monitor the hydrological variations within the Tulare Basin, California
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Subsidence induced by groundwater depletion is a grave problem in many regions around the world, leading to a permanent loss of groundwater storage within an aquifer and even producing structural damage at the Earth's surface. California's Tulare Basin is no exception, experiencing about a meter of subsidence between 2015 and 2020. However, understanding the relationship between changes in groundwater volumes and ground deformation has proven difficult. We employ surface displacement measurements from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and gravimetric estimates of terrestrial water storage from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite pair to characterize the hydrological dynamics within the Tulare basin. The removal of the long-term aquifer compaction from the InSAR time series reveals coherent short-term variations that correlate with hydrological features. For example, in the winter of 2018-2019 uplift is observed at the confluence of several rivers and streams that drain into the southeastern edge of the basin. These observations, combined with estimates of mass changes obtained from the orbiting GRACE satellites, form the basis for imaging the monthly spatial variations in water volumes. This approach facilitates the quick and effective synthesis of InSAR and gravimetric datasets and will aid efforts to improve our understanding and management of groundwater resources around the world.

TI  - Evaluation of the prediction capability of AHP and F-AHP methods in flood susceptibility mapping of Ernakulam district (India)
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are one of the frequent natural hazards occurring in Kerala because of the remarkably high annual rate of rainfall. The objective of this study is to prepare the flood susceptibility maps of Ernakulam district by integrating remote sensing data, GIS, analytical hierarchy process (AHP), and fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process methods. Ernakulam is one of Kerala's most flood-prone districts. The development of this map can help to raise awareness about the risks of flooding. Factors such as slope angle, soil types (texture), land use/land cover, stream density, water ratio index, normalized difference built-up index, topographic wetness index, stream power index, aspect, and sediment transport index have been selected. The area of the final maps is grouped into five flood susceptible zones, ranging from very low to very high. The major reasons for flood occurrence in Ernakulam district are the combined effect of multiple factors such as excess silting, reduction of stream width due to anthropogenic activities, and changes in land cover and land-use pattern, lower slope, higher soil moisture content, lower stream capacity, and poor infiltration capacity of soils. The prepared map was validated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve method. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.75 and 0.81 estimated by the ROC curve method for the AHP and F-AHP methods are considered acceptable and excellent, which confirms the prediction capability of the prepared maps. The very high susceptible zone constitutes around 19% of the district. This map is useful for land-use planners and policymakers to adopt strategies that will reduce the impact of flood hazards and damage in the future.

TI  - Yield of baseline imaging for distant metastases in high-risk primary melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The yield of baseline imaging in patients presenting with higher risk primary tumours, at least American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition stage IIC or III melanoma, is unclear. Methods This retrospective study included patients referred to the Victorian Melanoma Service from January 2017 to April 2020, diagnosed with at least stage IIC or stage III melanoma. Patients with a T4b tumour and no sentinel lymph node biopsy were included as 'T4bNX'. Results One hundred and sixty-four patients (median age 65 years) with baseline imaging (T4bNX: 19, IIC: 30, IIIA: 21, IIIB: 43, IIIC: 50, IIID: 1) were included. The majority were male (73%), and those with T4bNX melanoma tended to be older (median age 79 years). Distant metastases were detected in 21% (4/19) of T4bNX, 3% (1/30) of stage IIC, 0% (0/21) of stage IIIA, and 6% (6/94) of stages IIIB-D melanoma patients. All stage III patients with distant metastases had palpable lymphadenopathy a presentation. Two patients had brain metastases, both of whom had T4bNX melanoma and synchronous extra-cranial metastases. Conclusions Compared to stage IIC, baseline imaging detects higher rates of extra-cranial distant disease in stages IIIB-D and T4bNX melanoma. Intracranial imaging has greater yield in patients with distant extra-cranial disease.

TI  - Crop classification based on the spectrotemporal signature derived from vegetation indices and accumulated temperature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to differences in environmental factors, the phenology of the same crop is different every year, causing divergent performances of the classifier built by spectral or time-series features Here, we proposed a random forest classifier (RFC) based on an asymmetric double S curve model fitted by accumulated temperature (AT) and Vegetation Index (VI), which can be applied in different years without ground samples. We built AT and VI time series from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer 8-day composites of land surface temperatures and Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, respectively. The RFC was trained by characteristics from the asymmetric double S curve. We prepared RFC by ground samples of 2018 and 2019 and then mapped crops of the same region in 2017. Results indicated that, compared with diverse VI-AT series, the overall accuracy based on universal normalized vegetation index (UNVI) was the best of all (2017: F1 = 0.91, 2018: F1 = 0.92, 2019: F1 = 0.91) and better than that based on the UNVI-TIME series (2017: F1 = 0.84, 2018: F1 = 0.81, 2019: F1 = 0.88). It proved that the classification features from the VI-AT series have smaller intra-class differences in 2017, 2018, and 2019.

TI  - Rapid surface water expansion due to increasing artificial reservoirs and aquaculture ponds in North China Plain
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water shortage has severely threatened the North China Plain (NCP), a typical grain bowl and highly populated and urbanized area in China. As surface water body area (SWA) is a critical variable for measuring regional water resources, understanding its changes and driving mechanisms is important for sustainable water management. Here, we examine the interannual variations and trends of SWA in the NCP during 1987-2020 by using all the available Landsat imagery, the water indices-and threshold-based water mapping algorithm, and cloud computing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE). The results show that SWA of the NCP significantly (p < 0.05) expanded by 68.0% (from 4740.0 km(2) in 1987 to 7963.7 km(2) in 2020) at a rate of 101.9 km(2)/yr. The most remarkable expansion of SWA happened in Shandong Province (75.0 km(2)/yr), which is an increasingly important aquaculture production region. We find that the increasing artificial reservoirs/lakes due to the implementation of water projects, together with aquaculture development, are the main drivers for the expansion of SWA in the NCP. The expansion of SWA caused a significant increase in water evaporation (0.09 km(3)/yr) in the NCP as the shallow nature of these artificial reservoirs/lakes and aquaculture ponds could lead to excess evaporation because of the frequent heating and cooling cycles due to their limited abilities to store energy. Similarly, Shandong Province experienced the most rapid increase in water evaporation (0.03 km(3)/yr), which could accelerate the loss of water storage at a rate of 8.4-14.4 mm/yr in the regions covered by surface water bodies. Continuous temperature rise (0.02-0.06 ?/yr) in the future, as predicted by the climate models (CMIP5) under the two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios of medium (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas emission, could further increase water evaporation, which may add more pressure to regional water shortage. This study warns that, despite an observed significant SWA expansion, water shortage remains a major concern in the NCP.

TI  - Framework for Automatic Coral Reef Extraction Using Sentinel-2 Image Time Series
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using supervised and unsupervised classification on a single image to extract coral reef extent results in missing data and wrong extraction results. To improve the accuracy of coral reef extraction, this study proposes a novel technical framework for automatic coral reef extraction based on an image filtering strategy and spatiotemporal similarity measurements of pixel-level Sentinel-2 image time series. This method was applied to the Anda Reef, Daxian Reef, and Nanhua Reef, China, using 1464 Sentinel-2 images obtained from 2015-2020. Sentinel-2 images were automatically selected considering space, time, cloud cover, and image entropy after atmospheric correction. With the binary classification measurement standard using the digitization coral reef results of the Sentinel-2 images as the true value, the time series established by the modified normalized difference water index demonstrated high robustness and accuracy. Analyzing the time series curves of the coral reef and deep water verified that the spatiotemporal similarity measurement of this framework can stably extract the boundaries of the coral reef.

TI  - Long-Term Variability on Suspended Particulate Matter Loads From the Tributaries of the World's Largest Choked Lagoon
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Continental freshwater contributions are the main long-term control on the variability of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations in choked lagoons. The current work aims to assess the seasonal to interdecadal variability in SPM concentrations from Patos Lagoon tributaries, as a case study towards the understanding of tributaries contributions to coastal lagoons. Thus, an interdecadal dataset (1984-2020) was collected in the region of the tributaries of Patos Lagoon (southern Brazil), integrating Landsat series (653 scenes) and in situ measurements. SPM concentrations were estimated from the scenes using a semi-analytical multiwavelength algorithm, applied in the regions of the lower course of the tributaries. Results identified SPM concentrations variability in seasonal scales, enhanced by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in interannual time scales, also influencing in interdecadal trends. The seasonal SPM concentration variability reached 50 g.m(-3) to each tributary. Higher SPM concentration values occurred from winter to spring, enhanced during El Nino periods and frequently reaching annual means higher than 100 g.m(-3). Periods from summer to autumn, however, presented lower SPM concentrations, especially during La Nina periods, when the mean annual SPM concentration remained mostly below 50 g.m(-3). Seasonal and interannual (ENSO) forcings combined developed configurations of high input periods (HIP) and low input periods (LIP). During the LIP, the river plumes are limited to their tributary zone of influence and the whole lagoon has reduced SPM concentrations. During the HIP, the river plumes spread over the lagoon sub-environments, and the SPM concentrations of all tributaries reach the estuarine zone and the ocean. Thus, the mentioned natural phenomena influence the river plumes spreading, the SPM concentrations in the lagoon, and the export to the Atlantic Ocean in time scales varying from seasonal to interdecadal.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i>: systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BJS OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node status remains the most powerful prognostic indicator in invasive breast cancer. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-invasive disease and does not spread to axillary lymph nodes. The presence of an invasive component to DCIS mandates nodal evaluation through sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Quantification of the necessity of upfront SLNB for DCIS requires investigation. The aim was to establish the likelihood of having a positive SLNB (SLNB+) for DCIS and to establish parameters predictive of SLNB+.Methods: A systematic review was performed as per the PRISMA guidelines. Prospective studies only were included. Characteristics predictive of SLNB+ were expressed as dichotomous variables and pooled as odds ratios (o.r.) and associated 95 per cent confidence intervals (c.i.) using the Mantel-Haenszel method.Results: Overall, 16 studies including 4388 patients were included (mean patient age 54.8 (range 24 to 92) years). Of these, 72.5 per cent of patients underwent SLNB (3156 of 4356 patients) and 4.9 per cent had SLNB+ (153 of 3153 patients). The likelihood of having SLNB+ for DCIS was less than 1 per cent (o.r. <0.01, 95 per cent c.i. 0.00 to 0.01; P < 0.001, I-2 = 93 per cent). Palpable DCIS (o.r. 2.01, 95 per cent c.i. 0.64 to 6.24; P = 0.230, I-2 = 0 per cent), tumour necrosis (o.r. 3.84, 95 per cent c.i. 0.85 to 17.44; P = 0.080, I-2 = 83 per cent), and grade 3 DCIS (o.r. 1.34, 95 per cent c.i. 0.80 to 2.23; P = 0.270, I-2 = 0 per cent) all trended towards significance in predicting SLNB+.Conclusion: While aggressive clinicopathological parameters may guide SLNB for patients with DCIS, the absolute and relative risk of SLNB+ for DCIS is less than 5 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are required to establish fully the necessity of SLNB for patients diagnosed with DCIS.

AB  - Endometrial cancer (EC) is the fourth most common cancer in women in Germany. The incidence increases with an increase in risk factors. Due to bleeding disorders in premenopausal and postmenopausal bleeding, predominantly early stages are diagnosed by hysteroscopy with fractionated abrasion. Pathologically, EC can be subdivided into type I (estrogen-dependent endometroid adenocarcinomas) and type II disease (estrogen-independent serous, clear cell carcinomas). While type I tumors have a better prognosis, type II carcinomas have a significantly worse prognosis. Minimally invasive treatment by laparoscopic total hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy created the gold standard of treatment in early-stage endometroid adenocarcinomas. In advanced stages, paraaortic and pelvic lymphonodectomy or omentectomy are additionally required for type II carcinomas. Recent scientific achievements in molecular typing of carcinoma have created new challenges in routine patient care. Polymerase epsilon (POLE)-mutated tumors have a very good prognosis, microsatellite instability (MSI)-hypermutated and copy-number low (also NSMP = no specific molecular risk profile) show intermediate prognosis, while and copy-number high (also TP53-mutated) have the worst prognosis. L1CAM positivity (>= 10% of tumor cells) has been shown to be another poor prognostic feature.

TI  - Pre-fire aboveground biomass, estimated from LiDAR, spectral and field inventory data, as a major driver of burn severity in maritime pine <i>(Pinus pinaster)</i> ecosystems
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The characterization of surface and canopy fuel loadings in fire-prone pine ecosystems is critical for understanding fire behavior and anticipating the most harmful ecological effects of fire. Nevertheless, the joint consideration of both overstory and understory strata in burn severity assessments is often dismissed. The aim of this work was to assess the role of total, overstory and understory pre-fire aboveground biomass (AGB), estimated by means of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Landsat data, as drivers of burn severity in a megafire occurred in a pine ecosystem dominated by Pinus pinaster Ait. in the western Mediterranean Basin.Results: Total and overstory AGB were more accurately estimated (R-2 equal to 0.72 and 0.68, respectively) from LiDAR and spectral data than understory AGB (R-2 = 0.26). Density and height percentile LiDAR metrics for several strata were found to be important predictors of AGB. Burn severity responded markedly and non-linearly to total (R-2 = 0.60) and overstory (R-2 = 0.53) AGB, whereas the relationship with understory AGB was weaker (R-2 = 0.21). Nevertheless, the overstory plus understory AGB contribution led to the highest ability to predict burn severity (RMSE = 122.46 in dNBR scale), instead of the joint consideration as total AGB (RMSE = 158.41).Conclusions: This study novelty evaluated the potential of pre-fire AGB, as a vegetation biophysical property derived from LiDAR, spectral and field plot inventory data, for predicting burn severity, separating the contribution of the fuel loads in the understory and overstory strata in Pinus pinaster stands. The evidenced relationships between burn severity and pre-fire AGB distribution in Pinus pinaster stands would allow the implementation of threshold criteria to support decision making in fuel treatments designed to minimize crown fire hazard.

TI  - Thermally stable poly(3-hexylthiophene): Nonfullerene solar cells with efficiency breaking 10%
T2  - AGGREGATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar cells featuring polythiophenes as donors are one of the optoelectronic devices that hold notable promises for commercial application, profiting from the lowest synthetic complexity and excellent scalability. However, the complex phase behaviors of polythiophenes and their blends put constraints on modulating electrical performance and thus realizing stable performance under thermal stress. In this contribution, we present a multi-technique approach that combines calorimetry, scattering, spectroscopy, and microscopy to thoroughly probe the thermodynamic mixing, thermal properties of materials, the evolution of nanoscale domain structure, and device performance of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with a range of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) such as ITIC, IDTBR, and ZY-4Cl. Accordingly, two blending guidelines are established for matching these popular NFAs with P3HT to enable highly efficient and thermally stable cells. First, blend systems with weak vitrification and hypo-miscibility are excellent candidates for efficient solar cells. Furthermore, high thermal stability can be achieved by selecting NFAs with diffusion-limited crystallization. The P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend was found to endow the best performance of over 10% efficiency and an exceptionally high T-80 lifetime of >6000 h under continuous thermal annealing, which are among the highest values for P3HT-based solar cells. This realization of high thermal stability and efficiency demonstrates the remarkable potentials of simple polythiophene :nonfullerene pairs in electronic applications.

TI  - Personalized laparoscopic resection of colon cancer with the use of indocyanine green lymph node mapping: Technical and clinical outcomes
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: To describe the experience of utilization of real time indocyanide green (ICG) fluorescent imaging for mapping out drainage lymph node and hence personalized lymphadenectomy in colorectal resection.Methods: Perioperative injection of ICG before or during colon cancer resection by either intraluminal submucosal injection or laparoscopic peritumoural injection. The drainage lymph nodes were mapped out, and hence lymphadenectomy was performed enbloc with the main tumor. The effectiveness of mapping of drainage lymphatics and the procedure performed were recorded.Results: A total of 21 patients (M:F = 14: 7) had perioperative ICG injection to map out the drainage lymphatics. The overall success rate was 86%. Seven patients (33%) had endoscopic submucosal injection, while 14 patients (67%) had intraoperative peritumoural injection. Three patients who had endoscopic submucosal injection had ICG extravasation, and hence failed lymph node mapping. Four patients (19%) had a change in extent of resection according to the lymph node mapping results.Conclusions: Personalized oncological colorectal resection and lymphadenectomy can be performed with the aid of ICG technology. Laparoscopic subserosal ICG injection may be the preferred route, as it minimize extravasation and aids to identify drainage lymph nodes without prolonging minimally invasive surgery. Further studies are required to determine the best route, strength, and timing of ICG injection and concordance with pathology to tailor the extent of resection for individual patients.

TI  - Indigenous peoples as sentinels of change in human-wildlife relationships: Conservation status of mountain goats in Kitasoo Xai'xais territory and beyond
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Local people can act as sentinels for change, especially for wildlife populations not monitored by centralized governments. Responding to concern expressed by the Kitasoo Xai'xais (KX) First Nation over a decline in mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) sightings, our community-academic partnership assessed the conservation status of goats in KX territory and beyond in British Columbia by evaluating three independent information sources. Aerial surveys (2019 and 2020) over 542 km(2) revealed a low-density population (mean 0.25, SD 0.12 goats/km(2)), typical of peripheral coastal range. Interviews with KX Knowledge Holders revealed that sightings from sea level have declined sharply over 40 years, a period during which temperatures have increased and snowpack has decreased. Finally, Kill data (1980-2018) showed that kills/hunter/day initially increased among guided hunters before plateauing, but declined among resident hunters (similar to 70% of hunt days) in both coastal and interior BC. Convergent patterns among datasets suggest that coastal goats declined in abundance and/or reduced use of low-elevation habitat, disrupting a millennia-old relationship between KX people and goats, thereby posing a conservation concern. Broadly, our work shows that detecting threats to peripheral populations, and wildlife in general, can be informed and empowered by the knowledge of place-based peoples and associated decentralized management. Kitasoo Xai'xais First Nation mountain goat research illustrates roles of Indigenous peoples as sentinels of population and ecosystem change.

TI  - Development and application of an analytical framework for mapping probable illegal dumping sites using nighttime light imagery and various remote sensing indices
T2  - WASTE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Illegal dump sites (IDS) pose significant risks to human and the environment and are a pressing issue worldwide. Due to their secretive nature, the detection of IDS is costly and ineffective. In this study, an analytical framework was developed to detect probable IDSs in rural and remote areas using nighttime light (NTL) as a proxy for populated areas. An IDS probability map is produced by aggregation of Landsat-8 and Suomi NPP satellite imagery, multiple-criteria decision-making analysis, and classification tools. Six variables are considered, including modified soil adjusted index, land surface temperature, NTL, highway length, railway length, and the number of landfills. Vulnerability of the inhabitants on reserve lands was assessed using three sample regions. The method appears effective in reducing potential IDSs. Only about 7% of the 31,285 km(2) study area are identified as probable IDS, being classified as "very high " and "high ". Landfills without permit are found more effective in lowering IDS occurrence. Spatial distributions of reserve lands and the maturity of highways network nearby may be more important than the length of railways when assessing the inhabitant vulnerability due to IDS. Highway length is the most decisive factor on IDS probability among all classes, with membership grades ranging from 0.99 to 0.55. Land surface temperature appears less effective for the identification of smaller scale IDS. NTL is more prominent on IDS probability in the "very high " class, with a membership grade of 0.80. The finding suggests that populated areas represented by NTL is a priori of IDS.

TI  - PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure during pregnancy is associated with altered placental expression of lipid metabolic genes in a US birth cohort
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Inhalation of ambient PM2.5, shown to be able to cross the placenta, has been linked to adverse obstetric and postnatal metabolic health outcomes. The placenta regulates fetal growth and influences postnatal development via fetal programming. Placental gene expression may be influenced by intrauterine exposures to PM2.5. Herein, we explore whether maternal PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy alters placental gene expression related to lipid and glucose metabolism in a U.S. birth cohort, the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS). Average PM2.5 exposure level was estimated linking residential addresses and satellite data across the three trimesters using spatio-temporal models. Based on Gene Ontology annotations, we curated a list of 657 lipid and glucose metabolism genes. We conducted a two-staged analysis by leveraging placental RNA-Seq data from 148 subjects to identify top dysregulated metabolic genes associated with PM2.5(Phase I) and then validated the results in placental samples from 415 participants of the cohort using RT-qPCR (Phase II). Associations between PM2.5 and placental gene expression were explored using multivariable linear regression models in the overall population and in sex-stratified analyses. The average level of PM(2.5)exposure across pregnancy was 8.0 mu g/m(3), which is below the national standard of 12 mu g/m(3). Phase I revealed that expression levels of 32 out of the curated list of 657 genes were significantly associated with PM2.5 exposure (FDR P < 0.01), 28 genes showed differential expression modified by sex of the infant. Five of these genes (ABHD3, ATP11A, CLTCL1, ST6GALNAC4 and PSCA) were validated using RT-qPCR. Associations were stronger in placentas from male births compared to females, indicating a sex-dependent effect. These genes are involved in inflammation, lipid transport, cell-cell communication or cell invasion. Our results suggest that gestational PM2.5 exposure may alter placental metabolic function. However, whether it confers long-term programming effects postnatally, especially in a sex-specific matter, warrants further studies.

TI  - Prescriptions of Psychotropic Medications by Providers Treating Children of Military Service Members
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction There are approximately 1.5 million U.S. military-dependent children. However, little is known about mental health referrals for these youths. This study sought to examine the type of mental health treatment referrals made by primary care providers for child military-dependent beneficiaries receiving care in the direct (within Military Treatment Facilities) and private care (civilian-fee-for service facilities) sectors of the Military Health System. Materials and Methods A between-subjects, cross-sectional study was performed on children aged 5-18 years old in fiscal years 2011-2015 and enrolled in TRICARE Prime. Study analyses examined specialty ("talk therapy") mental health care and psychotropic medication referrals from TRICARE Prime (the Defense Health Agency-managed health care program) providers for beneficiary children diagnosed with attention-, mood-, anxiety-, or behavior-related disorders in direct versus private sector care. Results Of 1,533,630 children enrolled in TRICARE Prime (50.03% female), 8.6% (n = 131,393) were diagnosed with a psychological disorder during FY 2011-2015. Most were attention-related (5.2%, n = 79,770), followed by mood (1.7%, n = 25,314), anxiety (1.1%, n = 16,155), and conduct-related diagnoses (0.7%, n = 10,154). Adjusting for age, sex, and sponsor rank, children within direct care diagnosed with attention-related disorders were 1.7 times more likely to receive a prescription for psychotropic medication than those in private sector care, odds ratio (OR) = 1.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): [1.66, 1.77]. Children diagnosed with mood-related disorders in direct care were 2.1 times more likely to receive a prescription for psychotropic medication than those in private sector care, OR = 2.08, 95% CI: [1.96, 2.21]. Across disorders, children who received private sector care were more likely to have a referral specialty mental health ("talk therapy") follow-up (ps < 0.0001). Conclusions For attention- and mood-related disorders, but not anxiety- or conduct-related disorders, direct care providers were more likely than private sector care providers to prescribe psychotropic medications. Inconsistencies of provider referrals within and outside of the Military Health System should be elucidated to determine the impact on outcomes.

TI  - Increased flooded area and exposure in the White Volta river basin in Western Africa, identified from multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on flood extent and exposure is critical for disaster management in data-scarce, vulnerable regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, uncertainties in flood extent affect flood exposure estimates. This study developed a framework to examine the spatiotemporal pattern of floods and to assess flood exposure through utilization of satellite images, ground-based participatory mapping of flood extent, and socio-economic data. Drawing on a case study in the White Volta basin in Western Africa, our results showed that synergetic use of multi-temporal radar and optical satellite data improved flood mapping accuracy (77% overall agreement compared with participatory mapping outputs), in comparison with existing global flood datasets (43% overall agreement for the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) Near Real-Time (NRT) Global Flood Product). Increases in flood extent were observed according to our classified product, as well as two existing global flood products. Similarly, increased flood exposure was also observed, however its estimation remains highly uncertain and sensitive to the input dataset used. Population exposure varied greatly depending on the population dataset used, while the greatest farmland and infrastructure exposure was estimated using a composite flood map derived from three products, with lower exposure estimated from each flood product individually. The study shows that there is considerable scope to develop an accurate flood mapping system in SSA and thereby improve flood exposure assessment and develop mitigation and intervention plans.

TI  - Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation under hypoxia induces nuclear swelling with DNA outflow but not extracellular trap formation of neutrophils
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Neutrophils stand sentinel over infection and possess diverse antimicrobial weapons, including neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are composed of web-like extracellular DNA decorated with antimicrobial substances and can trap and eliminate invading microorganisms. Although phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is a potent NET inducer, previous studies have demonstrated that not all neutrophils exhibit NET formation even if stimulated by PMA at high concentrations. This study first showed that some neutrophils stimulated by PMA displayed a swollen nucleus but not NET formation and that hypoxic environments suppressed the NET release. Next, characterization of PMA-stimulated neutrophils with a swollen nucleus was accomplished by differentiating between suicidal-type NETosis and apoptosis. Furthermore, the significance of the phenomenon was examined using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human lung disease tissues with and without pneumonia. As a result, histone H3 citrullination, DNA outflow, propidium iodide labeling, resistance to DNase I, and suspended actin rearrangement were characteristics of PMA-stimulated neutrophils with a swollen nucleus distinct from neutrophils that underwent either suicidal-type NETosis or apoptosis. Neutrophils stimulated by PMA under hypoxic conditions secreted matrix metalloproteinase-9 cytotoxic to human lung-derived fibroblasts. Further, deposition of neutrophil-derived citrullinated histone H3(+) chromatin substances in pulmonary lesions was greater in patients with pneumonia than in patients without pneumonia and positively correlated with hypoxiainducible factor-1 alpha expression. The collective findings suggested that neutrophils activated under hypoxic conditions could be putative modulators of hypoxia-related disease manifestations.

TI  - Andy Duncan's "Senator Bilbo": Reflections on J. R. R. Tolkien and Matters of Race
T2  - SCRUTINY2-ISSUES IN ENGLISH STUDIES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the short story "Senator Bilbo" by fantasy writer Andy Duncan, in which the author provides a futuristic view of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, specifically the hobbits' world of the Shire, in a setting which has become xenophobic and racist, excluding all those who are "other" than hobbits. The chief protagonist of the story, Senator Bilbo, is modelled on the American senator Theodore Bilbo, a mid-twentieth-century southern senator known for his segregationist views and writings on "miscegenation". In the article I investigate how Duncan's character Senator Bilbo mirrors the real Senator Bilbo as he fails to adjust to the Shire's new attitudes to a multicultural Middle-earth-a view Tolkien supported-and how Tolkien's views on "race" were in fact non-racist and, in contrast to many ideologies of his time, advanced in terms of the acceptance of different cultures and ethnicities. In doing so I examine some of Tolkien's views on South Africa and how these ideas influenced his writing; I also explore the ways in which both segregation and apartheid were anathema to his worldview in the 1940s and 1950s, at the time of the writing of The Lord of the Rings. I argue that Duncan's story is meaningful in showing how Bilbo Baggins's descendant can successfully realise that the hobbits of the Shire cannot, for all time, live in an isolated Shire but must, eventually, engage with other peoples.

TI  - 3D simulation of ground motion for the 2015 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal, based on the spectral element method
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2015 M(w)7.8 Gorkha earthquake is the latest strong event with magnitude greater than M(w)7.5 in the Himalayas. The occurrence of this event provides a good opportunity to better understand the characteristics of ground motion produced by a low dip thrust fault. In this study, we constructed a kinematic source model and established a numerical model that incorporates realistic surface topography, velocity structure and the Kathmandu basin for the Gorkha event. Based on the source and structure models, ground motions in the periods of 2-20 s were simulated by a spectral element method. Our results are as follow. (1) Ground motions show prominent directivity along strike. (2) The basin effect can amplify the amplitude of ground motion in Kathmandu especially on the horizontal component. (3) Horizontal ground motions in Kathmandu valley exhibit obvious amplification in the frequency range of 0.2-0.4 Hz, which is absent in vertical component. The results of this work are of importance for future studies on assessing seismic hazard in the Himalayas.

TI  - The center for regional and tribal child welfare studies: Students' experiences of an Anishinaabe-centered social work education program
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The dramatic over removal of Indigenous children in North American governmental child welfare systems re-mains one of the most important and neglected issues facing Tribal Nations, child welfare policymakers and practitioners today. This paper is the second in a series of three papers (Authors 2019, 2020) presenting an ethnographic study of the Center for Regional and Tribal Child Welfare Studies in the Department of Social Work, University of Minnesota - Duluth, a child welfare education program grounded in an Anishinaabe knowledge and worldview. This paper focuses on the experiences of 8 student alums and the transformation of their cultural and professional identities and impact on their social work practice through their involvement at the Center. Broadly, students described similar experiences in the transformation of their cultural identities, as Indigenous or white people, and professional identities as social workers as a result of : 1) the Center's supportive environment that allowed them to let down their guards and learn emotionally painful child welfare history; 2) relationships established with Indigenous and non-Indigenous role models and tribal elders who provided meaningful mentorship; 3) Anishinaabe knowledge, culture, language and spirituality that decentered Eurocentrism in social work; and 4) exposure to accurate U.S. history and child welfare policy vis -`a-vis Indigenous peoples. Indigenous students described unique experiences: strengthening of their Indigenous cultural identities, healing from his-torical trauma, and support in practicing decolonized, Anishinaabe-centered child welfare practice. White stu-dents described unique opportunities to address what it means to be "white" within a settler-colonial system, moving past shame when learning about U.S. history and child welfare policy, and addressing their own culturally based assumptions in their practice.

TI  - Analysis of surface urban heat islands based on local climate zones via spatiotemporally enhanced land surface temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface Urban heat island (SUHI) is a major adverse environmental consequence of urbanization. Many algo-rithms measuring SUHI across varying spatial or temporal scales are developed rapidly with the availability of thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data from satellites. However, the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolution of TIR sensors limits the study of SUHI on both spatial and temporal domains. Therefore, this study aims to improve the characterization of SUHI using spatiotemporally enhanced land surface temperature (LST) derived from the synergistic use of coarse-and fine-spatial-resolution TIR data. Combining the spatial downscaling and temporal interpolation techniques, we generated daily 100 m-resolution LST in both daytime and nighttime to analyze the SUHI in different local climate zones (LCZs) in Beijing. LCZ is a manifestation of the urban form on the thermal environment, covering hundreds of meters to several kilometers in horizontal scale. The results indicate the spatiotemporally enhanced LST is reliable in capturing the LCZ-based SUHI magnitude compared with original observations, and providing a more accurate time range when the SUHI reaches to its maximum compared with those time-discontinuous original observations. Compared with temporally interpo-lated coarse-resolution LST, the spatiotemporally enhanced LST shows a larger annual variation of SUHI (especially in LCZ 2 with a mean absolute SUHI difference of 0.8 K and 1.3 K for daytime and nighttime, respectively) and provides larger SUHI difference between compact building and open building (especially when there is a significant SUHI effect). The superiority of the spatiotemporally enhanced LSTs in analyzing LCZ-based SUHI is more evident in daily and monthly SUHI analysis than in single-day analysis or annual analysis, espe-cially in compact building types (LCZ 1 and 2). These findings are valuable information for better and healthier urban planning for SUHI mitigation and public health care.

TI  - Analysis on factors behind sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer by color ultrasonography, molybdenum target, and pathological detection
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study aimed to identify the factors underlying the metastasis of breast cancer and sentinel lymph nodes and to screen and analyze the risk factors of sentinel lymph node metastasis to provide a reference and basis for clinical work. Methods A total of 99 patients with breast cancer were enrolled in this study. These patients received treatment in our hospital between May 2017 and May 2020. The general information, characteristics of the color Doppler echocardiography, molybdenum, conventional pathology, and molecular pathology of the patients were collected. Factors influencing sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients were retrospectively analyzed. Results In this study, age, tumor diameter, BI-RADS category, pathology type, expression profiles of CK5/6, EGFR, and CK19, and TP53 and BRAC1/2 mutations were independent risk factors for sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer (P < 0.05). The number and locations of tumors, quadrant of tumors, regularity of tumor margins, presence of blood flow signals, presence of posterior echo attenuation, presence of calcification, histological grade, molecular typing, and mutations of BRAF, ATM, and PALB2 were irrelevant factors (P > 0.05). Conclusions In conclusion, age, tumor diameter, BI-RADS category, invasive type, expression of CK5/6, EGFR, and CK19, and mutations in TP53 and BRAC1/2 were positively correlated with sentinel lymph node metastasis. These independent risk factors should be given more attention in clinical studies to strengthen the management and control of sentinel lymph node metastasis in high-risk breast cancer and support early chemotherapy or targeted therapy.

TI  - A Lightweight Anchor-Free Subsidence Basin Detection Model With Adaptive Sample Assignment in Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferogram
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The excessive exploitation of coal resources has caused serious land subsidence, which seriously threatens the lives of the residents and the ecological environment in coal mining areas. Therefore, it is of great significance to precisely monitor and analyze the land subsidence in the mining area. To automatically detect the subsidence basins in the mining area from the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) interferograms with wide swath, a lightweight model for detecting the subsidence basins with an anchor-free and adaptive sample assignment based on the YOLO V5 network, named Light YOLO-Basin model, is proposed in this paper. First, the depth and width scaling of the convolution layers and the depthwise separable convolution are used to make the model lightweight to reduce the memory consumption of the CSPDarknet53 backbone network. Furthermore, the anchor-free detection box encoding method is used to deal with the inapplicability of the anchor box parameters, and an optimal transport assignment (OTA) adaptive sample assignment method is introduced to solve the difficulty of optimizing the model caused by abandoning the anchor box. To verify the accuracy and reliability of the proposed model, we acquired 62 Sentinel-1A images over Jining and Huaibei coalfield (China) for the training model and experimental verification. In contrast with the original YOLO V5 model, the mean average precision (mAP) value of the Light YOLO-Basin model increases from 45.92 to 55.12%. The lightweight modules of the model sped up the calculation with the one billion floating-point operations (GFLOPs) from 32.81 to 10.07 and reduced the parameters from 207.10 to 40.39 MB. The Light YOLO-Basin model proposed in this paper can effectively recognize and detect the subsidence basins in the mining areas from the InSAR interferograms.

TI  - A Triple-Double Convolutional Neural Network for Panchromatic Sharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Pansharpening refers to the fusion of a panchromatic (PAN) image with a high spatial resolution and a multispectral (MS) image with a low spatial resolution, aiming to obtain a high spatial resolution MS (HRMS) image. In this article, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture with level-domain-based loss function for pansharpening by taking into account the following double-type structures, i.e., double-level, double-branch, and double-direction, called as triple-double network (TDNet). By using the structure of TDNet, the spatial details of the PAN image can be fully exploited and utilized to progressively inject into the low spatial resolution MS (LRMS) image, thus yielding the high spatial resolution output. The specific network design is motivated by the physical formula of the traditional multi-resolution analysis (MRA) methods. Hence, an effective MRA fusion module is also integrated into the TDNet. Besides, we adopt a few ResNet blocks and some multi-scale convolution kernels to deepen and widen the network to effectively enhance the feature extraction and the robustness of the proposed TDNet. Extensive experiments on reduced- and full-resolution datasets acquired by WorldView-3, QuickBird, and GaoFen-2 sensors demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TDNet compared with some recent state-of-the-art pansharpening approaches. An ablation study has also corroborated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/liangjiandeng/TDNet.

TI  - MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields tree cover needs calibrating in tropical savannas
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Vegetation Continuous Fields (MODIS VCF) Earth observation product is widely used to estimate forest cover changes and to parameterize vegetation and Earth system models and as a reference for validation or calibration where field data are limited. However, although limited independent validations of MODIS VCF have shown that MODIS VCF's accuracy decreases when estimating tree cover in sparsely vegetated areas such as tropical savannas, no study has yet assessed the impact this may have on the VCF-based tree cover data used by many in their research. Using tropical forest and savanna inventory data collected by the Tropical Biomes in Transition (TROBIT) project, we produce a series of calibration scenarios that take into account (i) the spatial disparity between the in situ plot size and the MODIS VCF pixel and (ii) the trees' spatial distribution within in situ plots. To identify if a disparity also exists in products trained using VCF, we used a similar approach to evaluate the finer-scale Landsat Tree Canopy Cover (TCC) product. For MODIS VCF, we then applied our calibrations to areas identified as forest or savanna in the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land cover mapping product. All IGBP classes identified as "savanna" show substantial increases in cover after calibration, indicating that the most recent version of MODIS VCF consistently underestimates woody cover in tropical savannas. We also found that these biases are propagated in the finer-scale Landsat TCC. Our scenarios suggest that MODIS VCF accuracy can vary substantially, with tree cover underestimation ranging from 0 % to 29 %. Models that use MODIS VCF as their benchmark could therefore be underestimating the carbon uptake in forest-savanna areas and misrepresenting forest-savanna dynamics. Because of the limited in situ plot number, our results are designed to be used as an indicator of where the product is potentially more or less reliable. Until more in situ data are available to produce more accurate calibrations, we recommend caution when using uncalibrated MODIS VCF data in tropical savannas.

TI  - Automatic detection of vegetation cover changes in urban-rural interface areas
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work started from the need to streamline the process of monitoring changes in vegetation in the in urban-rural interface fuel management bands, defined by Portuguese legislation as areas where the existing biomass must be totally or partially removed. The model developed uses a time series of Sentinel 2 satellite images to search for changes in the vegetation cover in a 100 m buffer around built-up areas. The use of satellite data allows analysing large areas and speeds up the task of identifying the places where fuel management took place and the places where there is a need to carry out such management. The objective of the proposed method is to give a script in Python language that can verify the cleanliness of vegetation in the fuel management ranges through multi-temporal analysis of satellite images.The paper presents a step-by-step procedure for a Sentinel 2 time series vegetation index analysis.Automated routine to detection of spatiotemporal vegetation changes based on statistical parameters.Used Python language to do geoprocessing analysis.

TI  - Exceptional Human Experiences Among Pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago: A Typology of Experiences and Transformative Aftereffects
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The increasing popularity of pilgrimage at the Camino de Santiago is one of the most interesting developments in terms of religion and spirituality in the Western world. Based on qualitative and quantitative content analysis of 32 pilgrim travelogues, this study constructs an empirically grounded typology of Exceptional Human Experiences (EHEs) among pilgrims, whereby EHEs are understood as specific combinations of out-of-the-ordinary experiences during the pilgrimage and their transformative aftereffects (TAs). Combining different techniques of coding and statistical analyses, we identify seven basic types of EHEs. The most common type is denoted as the experience of interconnectedness with the main effect of a higher emphasis on unity and love. Together with six other identified types, it forms a coherent worldview that closely resembles the "Being-values" defined by Abraham Maslow. These values are at the core of the process of self-actualization of an individual and typically include notions of interconnectedness, unity, wholeness, simplicity, essentiality, just-rightness, spontaneity, effortlessness, benevolence, honesty, autonomy, and individuality. We conclude that the main effect of walking the Camino is a boost in self-actualization as understood in terms of humanistic psychology. It is also argued that the EHE perspective is a useful approach for studying the experiences of pilgrims at Camino de Santiago and for other aspects of late modern spirituality as well.

TI  - Revising the Impact and Prospects of Activity and Ventilation Rate Bio-Loggers for Tracking Welfare and Fish-Environment Interactions in Salmonids and Mediterranean Farmed Fish
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Behavioral parameters are reliable and useful operational welfare indicators that yield information on fish health and welfare status in aquaculture. However, aquatic environment is still constraining for some solutions based on underwater cameras or echo sounder transmitters. Thus, the use of bio-loggers internally or externally attached to sentinel fish emerges as a solution for fish welfare monitoring in tanks- and sea cages-rearing systems. This review is focused on the recently developed AEFishBIT, a small and light data storage tag designed to be externally attached to fish operculum for individual and simultaneous monitoring of swimming activity and ventilation rates under steady and unsteady swimming conditions for short-term periods. AEFishBIT is a tri-axial accelerometer with a frequency sampling of 50-100 Hz that is able to provide proxy measurements of physical and metabolic activities validated by video recording, exercise tests in swim tunnel respirometers, and differential operculum and body tail movements across fish species with differences in swimming capabilities. Tagging procedures based on tag piercing and surgery procedures are adapted to species anatomical head and operculum features, which allowed trained operators to quickly complete the tagging procedure with a fast post-tagging recovery of just 2.5-7 h in both salmonid (rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon) and non-salmonid (gilthead sea bream, European sea bass) farmed fish. Dual recorded data are processed by on-board algorithms, providing valuable information on adaptive behavior through the productive cycle with the changing environment and genetics. Such biosensing approach also provides valuable information on social behavior in terms of adaptive capacities or changes in daily or seasonal activity, linking respiratory rates with changes in metabolic rates and energy partitioning between growth and physical activity. At short-term, upcoming improvements in device design and accompanying software are envisaged, including energy-harvesting techniques aimed to prolong the battery life and the addition of a gyroscope for the estimation of the spatial distribution of fish movements. Altogether, the measured features of AEFishBIT will assist researchers, fish farmers and breeders to establish stricter welfare criteria, suitable feeding strategies, and to produce more robust and efficient fish in a changing environment, helping to improve fish management and aquaculture profitability.

TI  - Preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis using deep learning-based features
T2  - VISUAL COMPUTING FOR INDUSTRY BIOMEDICINE AND ART
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node involvement increases the risk of breast cancer recurrence. An accurate non-invasive assessment of nodal involvement is valuable in cancer staging, surgical risk, and cost savings. Radiomics has been proposed to pre-operatively predict sentinel lymph node (SLN) status; however, radiomic models are known to be sensitive to acquisition parameters. The purpose of this study was to develop a prediction model for preoperative prediction of SLN metastasis using deep learning-based (DLB) features and compare its predictive performance to state-of-the-art radiomics. Specifically, this study aimed to compare the generalizability of radiomics vs DLB features in an independent test set with dissimilar resolution. Dynamic contrast-enhancement images from 198 patients (67 positive SLNs) were used in this study. Of these subjects, 163 had an in-plane resolution of 0.7 x 0.7 mm(2), which were randomly divided into a training set (approximately 67%) and a validation set (approximately 33%). The remaining 35 subjects with a different in-plane resolution (0.78 x 0.78 mm(2)) were treated as independent testing set for generalizability. Two methods were employed: (1) conventional radiomics (CR), and (2) DLB features which replaced hand-curated features with pre-trained VGG-16 features. The threshold determined using the training set was applied to the independent validation and testing dataset. Same feature reduction, feature selection, model creation procedures were used for both approaches. In the validation set (same resolution as training), the DLB model outperformed the CR model (accuracy 83% vs 80%). Furthermore, in the independent testing set of the dissimilar resolution, the DLB model performed markedly better than the CR model (accuracy 77% vs 71%). The predictive performance of the DLB model outperformed the CR model for this task. More interestingly, these improvements were seen particularly in the independent testing set of dissimilar resolution. This could indicate that DLB features can ultimately result in a more generalizable model.

M3  - Article
AB  - AIM: To retrospectively analyse the clinical and MRI data of primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), particularly pure squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) and mixed squamous cell carcinoma (MSCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MRI data and clinicopathological characteristics of 20 patients with histopathologically confirmed SCC of the breast, including eight PSCC patients and 12 MSCC patients, from multiple centres between January 2013 and December 2020 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Nine of 12 patients in the MSCC group showed hyperintensity on T1-weighted imaging (WI), while this feature was not observed in the PSCC group (p=0.001). Most of the PSCC group showed rim enhancement, whereas most of the MSCC group showed heterogeneous enhancement (p=0.007). In addition, there was no significant difference in the thickness of the rim enhancement and the percentage of necrotic components in the tumours between the two types of SCCs of the breast (p=0.545 and p=0.662, respectively). Four patients (4/12) in the MSCC group had sentinel lymph node metastasis, while only one patient (1/8) in the PSCC group showed lymph node metastasis (p=0.603). Metastatic disease occurred in 25% of patients with PSCC and in approximately 41.7% of patients with MSCC.

T2  - AREA DEVELOPMENT AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing countries lack subnational data to assess mega-events. Accordingly, an economic proxy is developed to quantify city-level income growth of economies of the South African cities that hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup by performing a geographically weighted regression between night light data and total city-level income and using it to predict total income from 1992 to 2013. A panel data comparison of income growth in host and non-host cities revealed similar income growth. However, the cities that invested the most in building or renovating their stadia experienced 9% lower income growth than other host cities, suggesting the limited ability of the World Cup to stimulate economic growth and the presence of inefficient investment.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to analyze spatial correlations of NDVI and MSAVI(2) indices in a large urban agglomeration. The study area, encompassing the Warsaw agglomeration, was located almost in the center of Poland and the central part of Europe.Methods: The study was based on the Sentinel 2 images with 0% cloud coverage that were taken in the years 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. After the NDVI and MSAVI(2) indices were calculated, resulting rasters were exported to the text files and imported to the Stanford Geostatistical Modeling Software (SGeMS) software. Experimental variograms were calculated using values of vegetation indices from each pixel, separately for areas covered with natural forests, with a predominance of grass vegetation, and for areas with only rare vegetation of various types. Next, experimental variograms were modeled using the spherical or exponential model, and its parameters: range of correlation, nugget effect, and a sill.Results: Spatial differences in the extents of green areas determined using NDVI and MSAVI(2) indices were observed, especially for areas characterized by low values of both indices. Temporal variation of the extents of the green area was minimal and could have resulted from usual variability related to weather conditions, precipitation, and other factors.The longest ranges of correlation of NDVI and MSAVI(2) were observed in natural forests, probably because they represent the greatest spatial continuity and homogeneity of all the examined areas. Long ranges of correlation were observed in strictly urban areas where the vegetation was relatively sparse and scattered. Despite the NDVI and MSAVI(2) values being not high, this area was characterized by a relatively good spatial continuity of urban infrastructures such as buildings and roads. The shortest correlations ranges were observed in areas with a relatively large share of grasslands.

TI  - A Google Earth Engine code to estimate properties of vegetation phenology in fire affected areas - A case study in North Evia wildfire event on August 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work aims to demonstrate the application of a previously published methodology concerning the properties of NDVI time series in fire-affected areas. Our work has been motivated by the devastating fire events in the northern part of Evia island, during August 2021, that destroyed more than 400 km2 of forest and agricultural land. The fire had a strong impact on the environment and the local communities, depriving them of their main income sources. Within this paper, a Google Earth Engine tool was developed, to facilitate access, processing and estimation of properties of remotely sensed NDVI time series in distinct zones, that corresponds to the fireaffected area, whereas the second one delineates a zone of equal area and with the same land cover characteristics to the burned land as described by the CORINE Level 1 and Level 3 nomenclature. Landsat 8 NDVI times series, at a spatial resolution of 30 m, with a 32-day time step, was used to construct a time series from January 2014 to September 2021 and assess structural phenological differences in the two predefined zones. Results fully support our previous findings concerning the differences in the NDVI time series of the two examined zones that is of considerably lower standard deviation values in the fire-affected areas.

TI  - THEORIZING AND PRACTICING HISTORY AS THE METABOLIZATION OF THE WORLD: A CONVERSATION WITH HANS ULRICH GUMBRECHT
T2  - HISTORY AND THEORY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - In this exchange, Gregory Jones-Katz and Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht discuss Gumbrecht's oeuvre, his book on Denis Diderot, and what this all might offer historians as they grapple with a transforming professional and intellectual landscape in the not-so-early twenty-first century. Of broad significance to the field of historical theory and practice are Gumbrecht's explorations into the "presence"-based epistemologies embedded in often-canonical cultural protagonists' lives and works. In his new book on Diderot, for example, Gumbrecht creates and employs a concept of our metabolic relationship to the environment to understand Diderot's "implicit epistemology" as a way of thinking that was peripheral to Enlightenment and its "historical worldview." Gumbrecht's concept of metabolism describes certain intellectual operations that were emblematic for Diderot (and his times) and can also prove useful for historians (and humanists) in different contemporary contexts.

AB  - Comprehensive and objective evaluation of ecological environment quality is of great significance to regional sustainable development. In this study, Landsat remote sensing images of 1991, 2000, 2004, 2010, 2013, 2018, and 2019 are selected to evaluate the changes of ecological environment quality in the Headwaters of Dongjiangyuan River by using remote sensing ecological index RSEI. The influencing factors of ecological environment change in Dongjiangyuan River are also discussed. The results showed that, from 1991 to 2019, the ecoenvironmental quality of the Dongjiangyuan River showed a good trend of development. Humidity index, greenness index, and dryness index all fluctuated in a small range; the greenness and dryness showed an overall increase. The average temperature in the Headwaters of the Dongjiangyuan River presents a rising trend. This study establishes the evaluation system of ecological environment quality from two dimensions of time and space and gives the change rule of environmental quality quantitatively, which provides the theoretical basis for the ecological environment management of Dongjiangyuan River.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics of agro-meteorological drought in Mberengwa and Zvishavane districts between 2017 and 2020, Zimbabwe
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought severity is increasing in Southern Africa which is affecting rain-fed agriculture, the main source of livelihood in most countries in this region. The study assessed the seasonal spatio-temporal dynamics of agro-meteorological drought between 2017 and 2020 in Mberengwa and Zvishavane districts. An empirical research design supported by quantitative geographical information system techniques for data analysis was adopted in this study. Remote sensing data and precipitation records from the Meteorological Services Department were main data sources in this study. Microsoft excel 2013, SPI generator and ArcMap 10.5 software were used for data analysis in this study. Results showed that both Mberengwa and Zvishavane districts experienced an increasing trend in spatial coverage of drought from 2017 to 2019 before a slight decline in 2020. From 2017, drought severity increased in terms of spatial coverage with this spatial distribution increasing to almost over 3/4 of the wards in both Mberengwa and Zvishavane districts between 2018 and 2020. Since 2017, on a ward level basis, both districts have been experiencing late onset and early cessation of the rain season as shown by increasingly dry October, November and March, months which determine the length of crop growing season in these two districts. Results indicated that the month of March was drier in Mberengwa whilst the month of December was drier in Zvishavane, an indication of more mid-season dry spells in Zvishavane and earlier rainfall cessation in Mberengwa. Drought is worsening in both Mberengwa and Zvishavane districts; hence, long-term drought resilience interventions are required to improve drought resilience of communities in these areas. The study recommends the Government of Zimbabwe and other stakeholders of drought resilience building like CARE International, World Vision among others to prioritise launching of resilience building initiatives in most vulnerable areas whilst guided by fine empirical information on spatial distribution of drought.

TI  - Centralised pathology service for sentinel node biopsy in oral cavity cancer: The Southeast England Consortium experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL PATHOLOGY & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an increasingly recognised option for accurate staging and subsequent management of the clinically negative neck in early stage oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. However, the technique is currently underused due to several logistic constraints including increased burden on pathology services. Here, we describe the feasibility of an outsourced centralised pathology processing and reporting service for sentinel lymph node biopsies in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. Patients and methods The Southeast England Consortium comprises four surgical centres utilising a central pathology service. Consecutive cases between January 2016 and February 2020 were retrospectively evaluated for survival outcomes and laboratory turnaround times. Results Twenty-eight per cent from a cohort of 139 patients had positive sentinel nodes. There was a trend towards greater overall, disease-free and disease-specific survival (OS, DFS and DSS, respectively) in sentinel node negative compared to sentinel node positive patients, but these differences were not statistically significant. The sensitivity, negative predictive value and false negative rate were 92.8%, 97.0% and 6.8%, respectively. The mean and mode laboratory TAT were 5 and 4 working days, respectively. Conclusion An outsourced centralised pathology service is a feasible option to widen the availability of sentinel node biopsy in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.

TI  - The influence of the summer tropospheric circulation on the observed ozone mixing ratios at a coastal site in the Eastern Mediterranean
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study combines surface ozone (O-3) measurements at the Finokalia site (Eastern Mediterranean) with backward trajectory modeling results, reanalysis, and satellite data to investigate how the summer tropospheric circulation affects the O-3 mixing ratios in the Eastern Mediterranean. The whole dataset covers the summer months (June, July, August) of 2011-2018. Our findings show that north-northeastern flow, known as the Etesians, is a high frequent wind system over the Eastern Mediterranean during the summer period. Under this flow regime, polluted air masses from the continental central and Eastern Europe reach the monitoring site, increasing the O-3 mixing ratios of the area. Contrary, western flows carrying maritime air masses from the Mediterranean Sea, though less frequent, have a central role in controlling the annual O-3 mixing ratios in the Eastern Mediterranean. Furthermore, the vertical O-3 profile analysis over the Finokalia site indicates enhanced O-3 mixing ratios in the middle troposphere when northern flows prevail, confirming the significant relationship between the low-level summer atmospheric circulation and the downward transport of O-3-rich air masses to the lower troposphere over Finokalia station, Eastern Mediterranean.

AB  - This paper provides a Bakhtinian reading of Kristen Roupenian's "Cat Person" in order to register the status of dialogue pertaining to questions of sexual coercion and consent in the wake of the #metoo movement. I identify two prominent discourses in the short story: feminist critiques of domination (perspectives that account for structural imbalances that tend to put men in a hierarchy above women) and sex-positive feminism (a worldview that promotes female sexual agency). These two discourses, this paper argues, are relevant to understanding why a collapse of dialogue ensues in the narrative. I then use "Cat Person" to propose a way of contemplating the contemporary media landscape as a generator of failed dialogue.

TI  - Satellite data reveal differential responses of Swiss forests to unprecedented 2018 drought
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme events such as the summer drought of 2018 in Central Europe are projected to occur more frequently in the future and may cause major damages including increased tree mortality and negative impacts on forest ecosystem services. Here, we quantify the response of >1 million forest pixels of 10 x 10 m across Switzerland to the 2018 drought in terms of resistance, recovery, and resilience. We used the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) derived from Sentinel-2 satellite data as a proxy for canopy water content and analyzed its relative change. We calculated NDWI change between the 2017 pre-drought and 2018 drought years (indicating resistance), 2018 and the 2019 post-drought (indicating recovery), and between 2017-2019 (indicating resilience). Analyzing the data from this large natural experiment, we found that for 4.3% of the Swiss forest the NDWI declined between 2017 and 2018, indicating areas with low resistance of the forest canopy to drought effects. While roughly 50% of this area recovered, in 2.7% of the forested area NDWI continued to decline from 2018 to 2019, suggesting prolonged negative effects or delayed damage. We found differential forest responses to drought associated with site topographic characteristics and forest stand characteristics, and to a lesser extent with climatic conditions and interactions between these drivers. Low drought resistance and high recovery were most prominent at forest edges, but also on south-facing slopes and lower elevations. Tree functional type was the most important driver of drought resilience, with most of the damage in stands with high conifer abundance. Our results demonstrate the suitability of satellite-based quantification of drought-induced forest damage at high spatial resolution across large areas. Such information is important to predict how local site characteristics may impact forest vulnerability to future extreme events and help in the search for appropriate adaptation strategies.

AB  - The fraction of observable nights is an essential parameter for selecting astronomical sites. In recent years, meteorological satellite data have played an essential role in recognizing and providing statistics of observable nights. We present a method to estimate the fraction of observable nights based on the FengYun-2 series of geostationary meteorological satellites and weather records of multiple astronomical sites. We have calculated the fraction of observable nights at 27 sites in Indonesia and two astronomical sites in China to validate the method. The results derived from our method show good agreement with previous works. Furthermore, we have derived the yearly distribution of the fraction of observable nights above China, which indicates that the area near 40 degrees N has more observable nights than other areas in China.

TI  - Machine learning-based prediction for grassland degradation using geographic, meteorological, plant and microbial data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive grassland degradation under climate change and intensified human activities has threatened ecological security and caused a variety of environmental problems. However, it is still challenging to predict the grassland degradation status on a large scale because it is a multi-factorial phenomenon with complex changes in ecosystem structure and function, which is hard to be fully characterized through mechanism models. The emergence of machine learning algorithms provides a potential to model complex systems and mine information from multi-source data without elucidating underlying mechanisms. Here, we utilized random forest and neural network algorithms to predict the grassland degradation represented by the net primary productivity (NPP) changing rate based on multi-source data including geographic, meteorological, plant traits, land use type and microbial variables in the Chinese Northern grassland. Particularly, the microbial roles in determining the degradation status were concerned. Results show that a high prediction precision was achieved by random forest model, rather than by neural network model, with a mean relative error of 16.9% and a mean square error of 9.273e-05. Besides identified longitude, arid index and current NPP state, specific soil microbial groups, mainly Solirubrobacter, were screened as credible biomarkers. Regarding model fitting, geographic, meteorological and plant variables explained 61.8% of the total variance, which was enhanced up to 72.8% by the rest microbial markers. These findings provide a theoretical basis to establish a pre-warning system for grassland management and policy-making.

T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast reconstruction with transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap is performed for the treatment of large defects of the breast. However, this may result in an abdominal wall hernia or bulging. A 53-year-old Japanese woman with left breast cancer underwent left skin-sparing mastectomy, sentinel node lymph node dissection, and immediate reconstruction with a contralateral pedicled TRAM flap. Thirty-two months following surgery, right lower abdominal wall hernia (15.5 x 12 cm) and bulging were observed at the suprapubic region. The patient was diagnosed with an incisional hernia and was scheduled for laparoscopic intraperitoneal mesh repair. The mesh was coated with an absorbable hydrogel barrier and was trimmed to 26 x 22 cm, with a 5 cm overlap around the defect. The patient demonstrated a good postoperative course. In conclusion, intraperitoneal onlay mesh with hernia repair closure (IPOM-Plus) is a simple and useful method for hernia repair following TRAM flap reconstruction.

TI  - Monitoring rice crop and yield estimation with Sentinel-2 data
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The future success of rice farming will lie in developing productive, sustainable, and resilient farming systems in relation to coexistent ecosystems. Thus, accurate information on agricultural practices and grain yield at optimum temporal and spatial scales is crucial. This study evaluates the potential application of Sentinel-2 (S2) to monitor the dynamics of rice fields in two consecutive seasons (2018 and 2019) in the Ebro Delta growing area. For this purpose, time series of four different spectral indices (NDVI, NDWIMF, NDWIGAO, and BSI), derived from smoothed S2 data at 20 m spatial resolution, were generated. Then, a combination of the first and second derivative analysis on the temporal profiles of spectral indices was used to automatically identify key phenology and management features from regional to field scale; and for estimating crop yield at fields. Features extracted from NDVI and NDWIGAO were used for identifying significant phenological stage dates (i.e. Tillering, Heading Date, and Maturity), and field status (i.e. hydroperiod), although the performance of the proposed method at field-scale was limited by S2 data gaps. The absolute minimum of NDWIMF showed great potential for estimating rice yield, including different cultivars (r = -0.8), and less sensibility to the number of valid images. Sentinel-2 alone cannot assure a consistent phenology monitoring at all fields but demonstrated strong capabilities for studying the performance of rice fields, thus must be considered in the development of new strategies for the management of rice-growing areas.

TI  - The vertical turbulent structure within the surface boundary layer above a Vineyard in California's Central Valley during GRAPEX
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is already a limited resource in California, and meeting the competing water needs, there will be only more challenges in the coming decades. Thus, sustaining the production of wine grapes, which are among the highest value specialty crops in the state, requires water to be used efficiently as possible. At the same time, improving irrigation management in vineyards requires spatially distributed information regarding vine water use or evapotranspiration (ET) at the sub-field scale that can only be collected via remote sensing. However, due to their unique canopy structure, current remote sensing models may not accurately describe the underlying turbulent exchange controlling ET from vineyards. To address that knowledge gap, this study investigates the vertical turbulent structure over a vineyard in the Central Valley of California. Using data from a profile of sonic anemometers (2.5 m, 3.75 m, 5 m, and 8 m, above the surface) collected during 2017 as a part of the Grape Remote sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX), this study characterized the relationship between the turbulent flow at different heights using spectral analysis. It was found that the turbulent structure is strongly influenced by the underlying canopy. It also showed that the characteristics of the vertical structure differ significantly from what would be expected over other types of crops because of the unique configuration of vineyards, i.e., the concentration of the biomass in the upper part of the canopy and wide inter-row spacing. As a result, surface energy balance modeling using remote sensing data will likely require modifications to formulations of the turbulent energy exchange of the inter-row-canopy system with the lower atmosphere to reliably estimate vine ET. An example of this effect is shown for the mean wind profile which deviates from predicted profile using classical Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) used in remote sensing-based energy balance models resulting in errors in heat flux exchange which in turn affects modeled ET.

TI  - Deep learning techniques to classify agricultural crops through UAV imagery: a review
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - During the last few years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) technologies are widely used to improve agriculture productivity while reducing drudgery, inspection time, and crop management cost. Moreover, they are able to cover large areas in a matter of a few minutes. Due to the impressive technological advancement, UAV-based remote sensing technologies are increasingly used to collect valuable data that could be used to achieve many precision agriculture applications, including crop/plant classification. In order to process these data accurately, we need powerful tools and algorithms such as Deep Learning approaches. Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has emerged as a powerful tool for image processing tasks achieving remarkable results making it the state-of-the-art technique for vision applications. In the present study, we reviewed the recent CNN-based methods applied to the UAV-based remote sensing image analysis for crop/plant classification to help researchers and farmers to decide what algorithms they should use accordingly to their studied crops and the used hardware. Fusing different UAV-based data and deep learning approaches have emerged as a powerful tool to classify different crop types accurately. The readers of the present review could acquire the most challenging issues facing researchers to classify different crop types from UAV imagery and their potential solutions to improve the performance of deep learning-based algorithms.

TI  - An unsustainable level of take: on-farm storages and floodplain water harvesting in the northern Murray-Darling Basin, Australia
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources for irrigation in the Murray-Darling Basin have been heavily over-allocated, with major detrimental effects on wetlands and rivers. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan is intended to return water from irrigated agriculture to the environment but requires comprehensive, accurate water accounting to achieve this objective. Floodplain harvesting - the diversion and storage of overland flows into on-farm dams - is widely practised by irrigators in the northern Basin. By reducing volumes of river flows, floodplain harvesting has negative effects on downstream water users and the environment. The volume of diversions is not known, creating a major source of uncertainty over water availability and use. We focussed on floodplain harvesting in northern New South Wales (NSW) catchments (Border Rivers, Gwydir, Namoi, Macquarie and Barwon-Darling) because the NSW government is attempting to licence and regulate the practice. We found in 2019-20 there were 1,833 storages in these catchments with a total surface area of 42,650 ha. Storage capacity has risen from 557 GL in 1993-94 to 1,067 in 1999-2000, 1,225 in 2008-09 to 1,393 GL in 2019-20, a 2.5-fold increase in 26 years. We estimated mean annual floodplain harvesting take (2004-2020) in northern NSW was 778 GL (range 632-926 GL). For context, this volume represents half of the mean volume of held environmental water released annually for the entire Basin between 2009-10 and 2018-19 (1,576 GL) and six times that for the northern NSW Basin (125 GL). The volume of take from floodplain harvesting is not sustainable and in breach of legislation on water use and management. We discuss the negative impacts of floodplain harvesting on downstream communities and flow-dependent ecosystems and their social justice implications.

TI  - Validation sentinel lymph node biopsy study in cN0 axilla using low-cost dual dye technique: potential solution for resource poor settings
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using radio-pharmaceutical and a blue dye is gold standard for axillary staging in clinically node-negative breast cancer. High costs and limited availability of radio-pharmaceutical and/or gamma probe are major deterrents in performing SLNB in developing countries. In this study, we evaluated feasibility of SLN identification (SLN-IR) of fluorescein-guided (FG) SLNB in combination with methylene blue dye (MBD). Methods This was a prospective cross-sectional non-randomized validation study in patients with clinically node-negative axilla. Patients underwent validation SLNB using fluorescein (and blue LED light) and MBD. Axillary dissection was performed irrespective of SLNB histology. SLIN-IR and False Negative Rate (FNR) were assessed for both groups. Results The SLNs were identified in 29 (96.6%) pre-chemotherapy patients and 23 (82%) post Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT) patients. The median number of sentinel lymph nodes identified was 3 (range of 1-5) in pre-chemotherapy patients and 1 (range of 1-3) in post NACT patients. The SLN-IR using MBD was 90%, FD was 86.7% and combined MBD FD was 96.7% in pre-chemotherapy patients. The SLN-IR using MBD was 82%, FD was 71% and combined MBD FD was 82% in in post NACT patients. The false negative rate (FNR) in pre-chemotherapy group was 8.0% (MBD), 8.3% (FD) and 7.4% (MBD + FD). The FNR in post NACT group was 8.7% (MBD), 10% (FD) and 8.7% (MBD + FD). Conclusion This prospective validation study showed adequate SLN-IR and FNR using low-cost dual dyes in early breast cancer patients and can be used in low resource settings. However, SLNB in post NACT axilla though viable along with a satisfactory FNR, is associated with low identification rate and needs further evaluation.

TI  - Omitting axillary lymph node dissection after positive sentinel lymph node in the post-Z0011 era: Compliance with NCCN and ASCO clinical guidelines and Z0011 criteria in a large prospective cohort
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose > In the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, patients with primary breast cancer and 1-2 tumor-involved sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) undergoing breast-conserving surgery had no ontological outcome benefit after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), despite a relevant rate of non-SIN metastases of 27%. According to the St Gallen expert consensus, and NCCN and ASCO clinical guidelines, ALND may be avoided in patients who meet all ACOSOG Z0011 inclusion criteria. This recommendation can also be extended to patients undergoing mastectomy, with 1 or 2 positive SLNs and an indication for chest wall radiation, in whom axillary radiotherapy can be proposed as an alternative to completion ALND. The aim of this study was to assess non-compliance with the NCCN and ASCO clinical guidelines and Z0011 criteria, namely the rate of performance of completion ALND when it was not recommended, and the rate of failure to perform completion ALND when recommended.Methods > Data were prospectively analysed from T1-2 NO breast cancer patients undergoing an SLN procedure and treated at the Georges-Francois Leclerc Cancer Center between November 2015 and May 2017. Factors associated with non-compliance treatment decisions were identified using logistic regression.Results > Among 563 patients included, 122 (21.7%) had at least one positive SLN. ALND was not recommended for 76 patients (62.3%), and was recommended in 46 patients (37.7%). The rate of non-compliant treatment was 32% (39/122) overall: ALND was performed despite not being recommended in 16/76 patients (21.1%) and was not performed in 50% of patients in whom it was recommended (23/46). By multivariate analyses, lymphovascular invasion ((Odds Ratio (OR) = 6.1; 95% confidence interval (Cl): 1.4-26.7; P = 0.02)) and only one SLN removed (OR = 9.1; 95% CI: 2.2-33.3; P = 0.002) were associated with performance of completion ALND when not recommended. Conversely, >1 SLN removed (OR = 5.1; 95%CI: 1.2-22.2; P = 0.03) was associated with the failure to perform completion ALND when recommended.Conclusion > Almost one third of patients with invasive breast cancer receive treatment that is not in compliance with recommendations regarding completion ALND.

TI  - Quantification of the dynamics of antibody response to malaria to inform sero-surveillance in pregnant women
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Malaria remains a major public health threat and tools sensitive to detect infections in low malaria transmission areas are needed to progress elimination efforts. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to malaria infections. Throughout pregnancy they access routine antenatal care, presenting a unique sentinel population to apply novel sero-surveillance tools to measure malaria transmission. The aim of this study was to quantify the dynamic antibody responses to multiple antigens during pregnancy so as to identify a single or multiple antibody response of exposure to malaria in pregnancy. Methods This study involved a secondary analysis of antibody responses to six parasite antigens [five commonly studied merozoite antigens and the variant surface antigen 2-chondroitin sulphate A (VAR2CSA), a pregnancy-specific erythrocytic antigen] measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) over the gestation period until delivery (median of 7 measurements/woman) in 250 pregnant women who attended antenatal clinics located at the Thai-Myanmar border. A multivariate mixture linear mixed model was used to cluster the pregnant women into groups that have similar longitudinal antibody responses to all six antigens over the gestational period using a Bayesian approach. The variable-specific entropy was calculated to identify the antibody responses that have the highest influence on the classification of the women into clusters, and subsequent agreement with grouping of women based on exposure to malaria during pregnancy. Results Of the 250 pregnant women, 135 had a Plasmodium infection detected by light microscopy during pregnancy (39% Plasmodium falciparum only, 33% Plasmodium vivax only and 28% mixed/other species), defined as cases. The antibody responses to all six antigens accurately identified the women who did not have a malaria infection detected during pregnancy (93%, 107/115 controls). Antibody responses to P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 3 (PfMSP3) and P. vivax apical membrane antigen 1 (PvAMA1) were the least dynamic. Antibody responses to the antigens P. falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (PfAMA1) and PfVAR2CSA were able to identify the majority of the cases more accurately (63%, 85/135). Conclusion These findings suggest that the combination of antibodies, PfAMA1 and PfVAR2CSA, may be useful for sero-surveillance of malaria infections in pregnant women, particularly in low malaria transmission settings. Further investigation of other antibody markers is warranted considering these antibodies combined only detected 63% of the malaria infections during pregnancy.

TI  - The effects of Landsat image acquisition date on winter wheat classification in the North China Plain
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate winter wheat distribution provides critical information for yield estimation and agricultural resources monitoring, which is associated with food security and agricultural ecosystem sustainability. The increasingly high spatiotemporal resolutions of globally available satellite images (e.g., Landsat) create new possibilities for generating accurate datasets. Although winter wheat classification using Landsat time-series data has been increasingly acknowledged in the literature, the contributing effects of a single acquisition date on classification remain poorly explored. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of a single acquisition date (nine acquisition dates were obtained throughout the growing season) on winter wheat classification using multi temporal Landsat 8 imagery. We adopted Dynamic time warping (DTW) to discriminate winter wheat and determined the most relevant acquisition dates for classification accuracy with different numbers of images. The most significant advantage of DTW from other similarity measurement methods is that DTW can identify the optimal alignment of two time-series datasets with an unequal number of images. Then, we calculated the importance of each acquisition date using the random forest algorithm and quantified their contributions to the classification using variance analysis. The conditional combination of our best accuracy was 84.51% for overall accuracy (OA) and 84.62% for F-score when all nine images were used for the classification. While the lowest accuracy was 46.2% for OA and 51.3% for F-score through the classification of two image combinations from the wintering and heading images. It was shown that the initial and late growth images were the most discriminating dates for time series classification of winter wheat in ~ 91% of the total combinations explored (i.e., 456 combinations). The main effects of the late growth images and their interactions significantly affected model accuracy, while the interactions between the initial growth images also played an important role, particularly for greater numbers of acquisition dates. The relative contributions explained by the main effects of late growth images gradually decreased with the increasing image acquisition dates, while those explained by the internal interactions of both initial and late growth images significantly increased. The wide distribution of winter wheat in many parts of the world and its strong consequences for global food security suggest that better monitoring of wheat is necessary, and the results indicated that appropriate selection of image dates was significant for accomplishing this task.

TI  - From tissue engineering to mosquitoes: biopolymers as tools for developing a novel biomimetic approach to pest management/vector control
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Pest management has been facing the spread of invasive species, insecticide resistance phenomena, and concern for the impact of chemical pesticides on human health and the environment. It has tried to deal with them by developing technically efficient and economically sustainable solutions to complement/replace/improve traditional control methods. The renewal has been mainly directed towards less toxic pesticides or enhancing the precision of their delivery to reduce the volume employed and side effects through lure-and-kill approaches based on semiochemicals attractants. However, one of the main pest management problems is that efficacy depends on the effectiveness of the attractant system, limiting its successful employment to semiochemical stimuli-responsive insects. Biomaterial-based and bioinspired/biomimetic solutions that already guide other disciplines (e.g., medical sciences) in developing precision approaches could be a helpful tool to create attractive new strategies to liberate precision pest management from the need for semiochemical stimuli, simplify their integration with bioinsecticides, and foster the use of still underemployed solutions.Approach proposed: We propose an innovative approach, called "biomimetic lure-and-kill". It exploits biomimetic principles and biocompatible/biodegradable biopolymers (e.g., natural hydrogels) to develop new substrates that selectively attract insects by reproducing specific natural environmental conditions (biomimetic lure) and kill them by hosting and delivering a natural biopesticide or through mechanical action. Biomimetic lure-and-kill-designed substrates point to provide a new attractive system to develop/improve and make more cost-competitive new and conventional devices (e.g. traps). A first example application is proposed using the tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus as a model.Conclusions: Biomaterials, particularly in the hydrogel form, can be a useful tool for developing the biomimetic lure-and-kill approach because they can satisfy multiple needs simultaneously (e.g., biomimetic lure, mechanical lethality, biocompatibility, and bioinsecticide growth). Such an approach might be cost-competitive, and with the potential for applicability to several pest species. Moreover, it is already technically feasible, since all the technologies necessary to design and configure materials with specific characteristics are already available on the market.

TI  - Syndromic surveillance during religious mass gatherings, southern India 2015-2018
T2  - TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mass gathering events carry a risk of public health emergencies such as outbreaks of infectious diseases, stampedes, and injuries and pose an increased risk for individuals with non-communicable diseases. India celebrates many festivals mass gatherings. However, operational research on syndromic surveillance during such events is limited. In this context, we documented the use of information technology tools for syndromic surveillance during selected mass gatherings in South India during 2015-2018.Method: We collaborated with health systems for syndromic surveillance during selected religious mass gatherings. We finalized priority syndromes and their surveillance definitions through stakeholder meetings. We used open-source software for surveillance data collection and trained the health care professionals and volunteers for data capture and collation. We consolidated, analyzed, generated near-real-time daily reports and shared them with health authorities for action.Results: The number of participants in these mass gatherings ranged from 100 thousand to 3 million, and recorded out-patients seeking care for syndromic illness ranged from 4,000 to 25,000 per event. We used more than five platforms and captured information on 17 syndromes. We captured a total of 61,523 patient details during syndromic surveillance. The most frequently reported syndromes were injuries, fever, and diarrhea of the reported illness.Conclusions: These cost-effective open-source technologies are intuitive, adaptable, and inexpensive to maintain and operate in real-time. Therefore, enhanced syndromic surveillance could detect diseases early in mass gatherings.

TI  - Monitoring the tropical cyclone <i>'Yass'</i> and <i>'Amphan'</i> affected flood inundation using Sentinel-1/2 data and Google Earth Engine
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical cyclone is influenced the natural environmental conditions, biodiversity, mangrove forest degradation; salinity increased, and flood inundation at the global landscape and frequently in the coastal regions. Flood inundation is increase due to global sea-level rise and shoreline shifting. In India, several tropical cyclones are influenced by the natural environment, like Fani, Bulbul, Amphan, and Yass. This study is to identify the flood inundation and land use land cover (LULC) affected area due to tropical cyclone Amphan and Yass. Cloud computing-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was used for the development of flood inundation area calculation in affected Indian coast. Random forest algorithm was used for the LULC classification and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Rader (SAR) of pre and post-cyclone was used for mapping and monitoring the cyclonic effect. The tropical cyclone Amphan and Yass have influenced the agricultural land and mangrove forest areas, like Sundarban and Bhitarkanika, and massive economic losses. Saltwater intrusion in the coastal area has been increased the salinity and frequently those types of cyclonic activities are triggering the coastal vulnerability. Total 11,405.21 sq. km of West Bengal and 10,437.58 sq. km Odisha coastal regions are inundated due to Yass and 22,735.29 sq. km areas are flooded due to Amphan cyclone. Mostly agricultural lands are affected because most of the areas are covered by agricultural land. This study results could be useful for the post-cyclone emergency response, coastal planners, and administrators for sustainable development of people life.

TI  - Water clarity mapping of global lakes using a novel hybrid deep-learning-based recurrent model with Landsat OLI images
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Information regarding water clarity at large spatiotemporal scales is critical for understanding comprehensive changes in the water quality and status of ecosystems. Previous studies have suggested that satellite observation is an effective means of obtaining such information. However, a reliable model for accurately mapping the water clarity of global lakes (reservoirs) is still lacking due to the high optical complexity of lake waters. In this study, by using gated recurrent units (GRU) layers instead of full-connected layers from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to capture the efficient sequence information of in-situ datasets, we propose a novel and transferrable hybrid deep-learning-based recurrent model (DGRN) to map the water clarity of global lakes with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. We trained and further validated the model using 1260 pairs of in-situ measured water clarity and surface reflectance of Landsat 8 OLI images with Google Earth Engine. The model was subsequently utilized to construct the global pattern of temporal and spatial changes in water clarity (lake area > 10 km(2)) from 2014 to 2020. The results show that the model can estimate water clarity with good per-formance (R-2 = 0.84, MAE = 0.55, RMSE = 0.83, MAPE = 45.13%). The multi-year average of water clarity for global lakes (16,475 lakes) ranged from 0.0004 to 9.51 m, with an average value of 1.88 +/- 1.24 m. Compared to the lake area, elevation, discharge, residence time, and the ratio of area to depth, water depth was the most important factor that determined the global spatial distribution pattern of water clarity. Water clarity of 15,840 global lakes between 2014 and 2020 remained stable (P >= 0.05); while there was a significant increase in 243 lakes (P < 0.05) and a decrease in 392 lakes (P < 0.05). However, water clarity in 2020 (COVID-19 period) showed a significant increase in most global lakes, especially in China and Canada, suggesting that the worldwide lockdown strategy due to COVID-19 might have improved water quality, espically water clarity, dueto the apparent reduction of anthropogenic activities.

TI  - Assessing drought and its impacts on wheat yield using remotely sensed observations in rainfed Potohar region of Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a serious threat to agriculture particularly of rainfed regions like Potohar region of Pakistan. Wheat, staple food crop of this region, is mostly affected by drought, thereby impacting food security of the region. Effective drought monitoring and its impacts on wheat production have therefore been the key concerns of the farmers and policy makers in order to plan for any upcoming food crises in the region. A proactive drought management approach is needed in this regard. This study aims to assist the decision-making process for drought monitoring and yield predictions, as it informs drought assessment and its impacts on crop yield using drought and vegetation indices along with climate and crop yield data. This research quantifies recurrent drought events for Rubi (wheat crop) season (November-April) from 2000 to 2018 in the Potohar region using indices such as standardized precipitation index (SPI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) along with climatic parameters, i.e., mean temperature, rainfall and soil moisture. Results show a strong positive correlation of wheat yield with rainfall (r = 0.97) and soil moisture (r = 0.88), while a strong negative correlation with temperature (r = - 0.98). Three moderate (2000-01, 2001-02, 2009-10) and two weak (2011-12, 2017-18) drought events are identified using SPI, whereas two more drought events (2007-08 and 2016-17) are noticed when vegetation indices are used. Looking at Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), no definite pattern relating to ongoing La-Nina or El-Nino conditions during the specific drought years is observed for the Potohar region. Artificial neural network (ANN), a multilayer perception (MLP) model, is applied afterward to see the individual impact of each study parameter on wheat yield. Soil moisture is found to impact yield by 100%, temperature as 74%, rainfall as 61% and then rest of the indices. The findings of this study not only provide a scientific base for future studies on drought indicators, but assert that a cumulative approach is needed for effective drought management at national level.

TI  - Impact of neighborhood socioeconomic status, income segregation, and greenness on blood biomarkers of inflammation
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Neighborhood deprivation is linked with inflammation, which may explain poorer health across populations. Behavioral risk factors are assumed to largely mediate these relationships, but few studies have examined this. We examined three neighborhood contextual factors that could exert direct effects on inflammation: (1) neighborhood socioeconomic status, (2) an index of concentration at extremes (that measures segregation), and (3) surrounding vegetation (greenness).Methods: Using blood samples and addresses collected from prospective cohorts of 7,930 male (1990-1994) and 16,183 female (1986-1990) health professionals with at least one inflammatory marker, we prospectively linked neighborhood contextual factors to inflammatory biomarkers (adiponectin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-2). Log-transformed, z-scaled component measures were used to calculate an inflammation score. Neighborhood socioeconomic status and index of concentration of extremes were obtained from the 1990 decennial census and linked to participant addresses. Surrounding greenness was assessed from satellite data and focal statistics were applied to generate exposures within 270 m and 1230 m of the participants' address. We fit multiple linear regression models adjusting for demographic, clinical, and behavioral risk factors.Results: Higher neighborhood socioeconomic status was associated with lower inflammation score in women (beta for interquartile range increase = -27.7%, 95% CI: -34.9%, -19.8%) and men (beta = -21.2%, 95% CI: -31.0%, -10.1%). Similarly, participants in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of high-income households were associated with lower inflammation score in women (beta = -27.8%, 95% CI: -35.8%, -18.7%) and men (beta = -16.4%, 95% CI: -29.7%, -0.56%). Surrounding greenness within 270 m of each participant's address was associated with lower inflammation score in women (beta = -18.9%, 95% CI: -28.9%, -7.4%) but not men. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses to assess unmeasured confounding and selection bias.Discussion: Our findings support the hypothesis that adverse neighborhood environments may contribute to inflammation through pathways independent of behavioral risk factors, including psychosocial stress and toxic environments.

TI  - Association of tumor molecular factors with in-transit metastasis in primary cutaneous melanoma
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In-transit metastases (ITM) are a form of locoregional relapse representing intralymphatic metastatic spread and occur in approximately 4-9% of patients with melanoma >1 mm Breslow thickness. Our objective was to evaluate a combination of clinicopathologic risk factors and gene expression biomarkers predictive of ITM risk. Methods We used PCR to quantify gene expression in diagnostic biopsy tissue across a prospectively designed archival cohort of 854 consecutive thin and intermediate thickness primary cutaneous melanomas. The outcome of interest was ITM >90 days after a melanoma diagnosis. Cox proportional hazard models were fit to estimate each clinicopathologic and molecular characteristic's association with the risk of ITM. Results The 5-year cumulative incidence of ITM was 3.2%. Clinical factors univariately associated with an increased risk of ITM were older age, greater Breslow thickness, greater mitotic rate, lower extremity location, ulceration, and a positive SLN biopsy. Of 108 genes tested, five were significantly upregulated and five significantly downregulated when evaluated in Cox models adjusted for age, Breslow thickness, mitotic rate, and lower extremity location. Among the upregulated genes, the strongest association was observed for interleukin-8 (IL8). Conclusion A subset of gene expression biomarkers was identified as independently associated with the risk of ITM after adjusting for key covariates. Once sufficiently validated, our results may lead the way to regional therapy trials for a small, selected group of high-risk patients.

TI  - Assessment of predatory activity in residential lawns and sod farms
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence and abundance of predatory fauna in turfgrass systems have been reported; however, the activity of predators has rarely been described. The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a major pest of turfgrass in the United States for which arthropod predation is not considered a key pest management option, but the role of predation on S. frugiperda has not been assessed in turfgrass systems, which are managed at varying intensities. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine (1) the incidence and (2) the severity of predation in less intensively managed residential lawns and intensively managed sod farms. The percentage of predation on live S. frugiperda sentinel larvae and the percentage of predation and its severity on clay models were significantly greater in the residential lawns than in the sod farms. Among the seven impression types recorded on clay models, paired marks were the most abundant. Four new impression types, deep cut marks, stacked surface marks, scooped marks, and U-shaped marks, were observed on clay models in both turfgrass systems. Formicids were documented at significantly greater densities than were other predatory groups, such as carabids. Thus, the results show the need for enhanced predatory activity in sod farms by developing integrated pest management strategies and adopting measures to conserve natural enemies.

TI  - High diagnostic accuracy of inguinal ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration followed by dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy in men with impalpable and palpable inguinal lymph nodes
T2  - BJU INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To assess the accuracy of dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (DSNB) after negative ultrasonography (US) guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for inguinal lymph node (ILN) staging. Patients and Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of men with >= T1G2 penile cancer and negative inguinal US-guided FNA undergoing DSNB. Men with suspicious US but negative FNA underwent US-guided ILN excision. Men with >= T1G2 local recurrence during follow-up and non-squamous cell histologies were excluded. Descriptive analysis was performed, and sensitivity and negative predictive values (NPVs) were calculated. Results We included 403 men with 728 groins with negative FNA undergoing DSNB +/- US-guided LN excision. At least one sentinel LN (SN) was visualised in 93% during the first and in 7% during the second lymphoscintigraphy. The median SNs visualised preoperatively was 1 SN and a median of 2 LNs were resected. ILN metastases were detected in 9% groins in men with impalpable and in 17% men with palpable LNs. Stratified by impalpable and palpable ILN, non-local recurrence despite pathologically negative DSNBs was seen in 0.5% and 0%, respectively. Limited to men with >= 24 months follow-up, non-local recurrence after negative DSNBs was seen in 0.4% and 0%, respectively. The sensitivity of DSNB was 96% and the NPV was 100%. The main limitation of this analysis is its retrospective nature with inherit biases. Conclusions Inguinal US and FNA followed by DSNB can accurately stage men with both impalpable and palpable ILN, which provides logistical and surgical advantages.

TI  - Simulating future intra-urban land use patterns of a developing city: a case study of Jashore, Bangladesh
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing urban growth at an unprecedented rate entails adverse implications for societal, economic, and environmental sustainability. In the cities of Bangladesh, the land covers are experiencing rapid construction-associated land expansion, population growth, and socioeconomic development. Comprehensive assessment and understanding of the prospects for rapid land use/land cover (LULC) changes are essential for managing land surface resources and ensuring sustainable development. Therefore, this study aims to assess the historical land use/land cover (LULC) changes and simulate future potential intra-urban LULC growth patterns of Jashore City up to 2050. We used (i) Landsat images to analyze LULC change using maximum likelihood supervised image classification method; (ii) Markov-CA model to illustrate the LULC transition matrix during 2000-2020, (iii) Multilayer Perception Neural Network Markov Chain (MPNNMC) Model to simulate future LULC patterns. The result shows that built-up area expanded quickly, while cropland and water areas have had a large loss of coverage. The LULC change analysis derived from prior LULC was utilized for future simulations, where natural and anthropogenic factors were chosen as the driving variables in the MPNNMC model. The future LULC modeling shows that compared to 2020, the urban area is expected to increase by 23.64%, whereas cropland, vegetation, unused land, and water areas are expected to reduce by 1.16%, 5.47%, 9.55%, and 7.73% respectively, by 2050. The change analysis shows that urban areas will increase the fastest during 2020-2030. The findings demonstrate that the rapid and unplanned urbanization and the rise of the population due to migration resulted in the fastest LULC transformation. The study findings contribute to the long-term ecological development of Jashore City and potentially enhance environmental decision making.

TI  - Axillary lymph node dissection vs. sentinel node biopsy for early-stage clinically node-negative breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Review
AB  - omicron bjective This study aimed at comparing survival outcomes between systematic axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) vs sentinel lymph node and axillary lymph node dissection only if sentinel positive (SLN +/- ALND) in early-stage, clinically node-negative breast cancer patients. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to PRISMA guidelines was performed. Included studies were prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing survival outcomes of ALND vs. SLN +/- ALND in early-stage, node-negative breast cancer patients. Patients enrolled were only those with tumor size lower than 4 cm, clinically negative nodes and treated with breast-conservative surgery. Primary endpoints were locoregional recurrence, overall death and cancer-related death. Results There were four studies included in the analysis, enrolling overall 2982 patients, of which 1494 in ALND arm and 1488 in the SLN +/- ALND arm. No statistically significant difference was observed in locoregional recurrence, breast cancer-related death and overall death. Locoregional recurrence was observed in 2.8% (ALND) vs. 4.1% (SLND +/- ALND), (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.20-2.30). Overall death rate was 7.0% vs. 6.8% respectively, (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73-1.39, I-2 = 28.7%). Breast cancer-related death was 3.6% vs. 3.5%, respectively (SLN +/- ALND), (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.70-1.78, I-2 = 0%). No statistically significant difference was observed in any of secondary study outcomes. Conclusions Systematic axillary axillary lymph node dissection provides no survival benefit compared with sentinel lymph node dissection for early-stage clinically node-negative breast cancer patients.

TI  - Evaluation of surface water quality of Ukkadam lake in Coimbatore using UAV and Sentinel-2 multispectral data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing was used as a potential solution for monitoring the surface water quality parameters as an alternative to the traditional in situ measurements which are time consuming and labour-intensive. While most of the studies are restricted in just analysing the optical water quality parameters, only few studies have attempted the estimation of non-optical water quality parameters. In this paper, a correlation was developed between various optical and non-optical water quality parameters, thereby establishing an indirect relationship between non-optical parameters and reflectance data based on which the predictive models were developed. The water body chosen for this present study is the Ukkadam Lake situated in Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India (10.9917 degrees North, 76.9722 degrees East). The correlation between reflectance data obtained from Sentinel-2 and Unmanned aerial vehicle images along with in situ measured data were analysed using stepwise regression method. Algorithms were developed for assessing the water quality parameters like turbidity, Total suspended solids, Total organic carbon, Chemical oxygen demand, Biological oxygen demand and Dissolved oxygen that were based on Sentinel-2 with high coefficient of determination (R-2). Unmanned aerial vehicle-based Stepwise regression models were employed for assessing Total suspended solids, Total organic carbon and Chemical oxygen demand. The developed models were validated with 25% of sample data acquired, and the algorithms showed that multispectral data from Sentinel-2 and RGB data from Unmanned aerial vehicles can be effectively used to estimate the concentration of various water quality parameters with reasonable accuracy in case of large water bodies, including the one chosen for this study.

TI  - Forest Land Cover Changes and Its Socio-economic Consequences on South-eastern Part of Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hill forest vegetation cover in the southeastern part of Bangladesh has been facing degradation and depletion over a few decades. The forest estimation and mapping of this country are well documented and mainly restricted to the mangrove extent. However, the monitoring of the hill forest vegetation of Bangladesh is limited till now. This study monitor and analyzes the forest vegetation cover changes using Landsat imagery from 1974 to 2020, specifically in Khagrachari and Rangamati hill district, Bangladesh. We preprocess the satellite imagery and then perform a decision tree classification algorithm based on the spectral indexes derived from the imagery. The initial assessment indicates the negative change of dense vegetation/forest vegetation cover (FVC) in most parts of the study area since 1974. Further results show that similar to 57.17%, similar to 39.3%, similar to 31.27%, and similar to 24.97% of the total area were classified as FVC type in 1989,1999, 2010 and 2020, respectively. Besides, this study briefly discusses how the change of FVC impacts the life of the local indigenous community living around the area. This preliminary investigation highlights deforestation over the similar to 46 years around the study area, which could be beneficial for planning to manage and conserve forest resources, and protect the local indigenous community.

TI  - A dark target Kalman filter algorithm for aerosol property retrievals in urban environment using multispectral images
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural and anthropogenic aerosol atmospheric emissions play a fundamental role in directly modulating the incoming solar radiation and affecting the air quality, especially in large metropolitan regions. Likewise, aerosols indirectly impact cloud lifetime, atmospheric column thermodynamics and precipitation patterns. For these reasons, it is of particular importance to assess the aerosol spatial and temporal variability in the first instance to reduce the associated global climate models uncertainty to correctly forecasting future scenarios and then to react fast in applying mitigation strategies. In this paper, an aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval algorithm for high-spatial resolution images in the blue wavelength range for urban environments is developed for the first time. The proposed approach is completely blind because does not use look-up-tables or complex radiative transfer models, which require the setting/estimation of many parameters. The multi-wavelength (exploiting the coastal and the blue bands) AOD retrieval permits to retrieve also important aerosol micro-physical properties, e.g., the size. The proposed method leverages on the use of Kalman filters to deal with the unavoidable sensor's noise improving the accuracy of the estimation of the AOD. The approach is assessed on four different test cases acquired by Landsat 8 involving two metropolitan areas. A strong agreement to ground-based AERONET measurements is observed on several performance metrics. Clear advantages in comparison with the baseline approach relied upon the simple inversion of the explored model are pointed out.

TI  - Surface reflectance and pXRF for assessing soil weathering indexes
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite images is a widespread technique for estimating soil attributes. However, what is the potential of satellite data on the prediction of soil weathering indices? How much in their performance is affected by spectral mixing and data resolution? There is no consensus for answering these questions. Hence, the main objectives of this work were: i) to show the difference of spectral signature between prepared and field-condition samples; ii) to compare the convoluted data from laboratory spectroradiometer with the spectral signatures from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites; and iii) to build and evaluate predictive models for soil weathering indices using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy from samples under natural conditions, air-dried-sieved and from satellite images. Soil samples were collected from the first 1-cm depth in 27 locations along seven catenas located in a 163-ha area in Sa & SIM;o Paulo State, Brazil. The samples were analyzed by a Vis-NIR-SWIR spectrometer without sample preparation (field conditions) and after being air-dried and sieved (prepared). The air-dried-sieved samples were also analyzed by an X-ray fluorescence equipment. Reflectance data were obtained from Sentinel and Landsat for the same 27 locations. The spectral data from the lab were convoluted to respective bands of the real satellite data. Predictive models for soil weathering indices using the convoluted laboratory data and the satellite data were also built and compared. The reflectance of samples under field conditions contrasted significantly between soils derived from basalt and sedimentary rocks. In general, the reflectance intensity of prepared samples was 80% higher than that observed for field-conditions, which can be explained by the roughness and the structure effect. However, some cases showed an opposite trend, with a smaller relative reflectance from the air-dried-sieved samples. These trends support the hypothesis of aggregates heterogeneity and clay occlusion. The sample preparation can increase or decrease the reflectance of the soil surface material, depending, mainly, on roughness, soil structure and particles occlusion by the structure. The Landsat spectral signatures were more similar to those from convoluted laboratory than to the Sentinel ones. The satellite per-formance on the estimation of the soil weathering indices is comparable to those from convoluted laboratory data, but it is limited by spectral resolution. Sentinel and Landsat achieved ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) from 1.53 to 2.38 and from 1.56 to 2.42 on soil weathering indices estimation, respectively. The models for Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA) and Si/Ti [Si and (Ti and Al) ratio] indices were considered the best ones (RPIQ from 2.17 to 3.6; and RPIQ from 1.90 to 5.56; respectively) for both laboratory and satellite data; in turn, Si/Al, Si (Al + Fe) and Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) indices performed poorly/reasonably (RPIQ < 1.92).

TI  - Monitoring irrigation using landsat observations and climate data over regional scales in the Murray-Darling Basin (vol 590, 125356, 2020)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Correction
AB  - This corrigendum is related to Bretreger et al. (2020) where a range of Landsat 5, 7 and 8 observations were used to monitor irrigated cropping conditions and using these observations in three modelling approaches with meteorological data to quantify the irrigation-area level water use (i.e., actual evapotranspiration (AET))., One of the remote sensing AET methods was CMRSET (Guerschman et al., 2009) and in a response to Bretreger et al. (2020) the authors Pena-Arancibia et al. (2021) clarified the implementation of CMRSET by using the Landsat SWIR2 band (2090 - 2350 nm wavelength). Using this Landsat band matched the naming of the band used in the CMRSET development with MODIS (i.e., SWIR2) despite having a different wavelength (1628 - 1652 nm wavelength) between the two remote sensing instruments. The SWIR bands from MODIS and Landsat may match in naming but their wavelengths differ. This means that the Landsat SWIR1 band (1550 - 1750 nm wavelength) should have been used when implementing CMRSET with Landsat to optimally represent the CMRSET method rather than using Landsat SWIR2 (2090 - 2350 nm wavelength) as performed in Bretreger et al. (2020). The analysis contained in this corrigendum acknowledges this mistake and shows the impact of this on the estimated irrigation results, demonstrating that CMRSET is a viable option for the AET component of methodologies that are attempting to quantify regional irrigation water use. Other results originally documented in Bretreger et al. (2020), specifically those generated using the IrriSat and Kamble AET methods, were not impacted by the sub-optimal use of the Landsat SWIR2 band.

TI  - Hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion addressing spectral variability by an augmented linear mixing model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of hyperspectral (HS) and multispectral (MS) images with complementary high spectral and high spatial resolution information has been successfully applied to improve the low spatial resolution limitation of current satellite sensors with high spectral resolution. Fusion methods based on spectral unmixing have led to state-of-the-art results with the advantage of obtaining pure spectral signatures and their proportion in the image of analysis as a result of the fusion process. However, pure spectral signatures observed in HS images are affected by variations in atmospheric, environmental and illumination conditions which are significant sources of errors in HS image analysis. Conventional unmixing-based fusion methods neglect the spectral variability of HS images introducing and propagating errors through the fusion process, affecting further inference tasks such as classification, target detection, and change detection. Therefore, this paper proposes HS-MS image fusion algorithm based on spectral unmixing accounting for spectral variability through an augmented linear mixing model (ALMM). An alternating optimization strategy is combined with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to efficiently minimize the underlying cost function of the fusion problem. Simulation results on realistic data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art fusion methods in different metrics. Additionally, the fusion of crop images acquired with DESIS and Sentinel-2 sensors in a region of Colombia confirms the advantages of the proposed fusion method.

TI  - A direct algorithm for estimating clear-sky surface longwave net radiation (SLNR) from MODIS imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface longwave net radiation (SLNR) is the key component of the surface radiation budget. SLNR is estimated by using the conventional method, in which surface longwave downward radiation (SLDR) and surface longwave upward radiation (SLUR) are estimated separately, and then SLNR is calculated by subtracting SLUR from SLDR. However, uncertainties in SLDR and SLUR may accumulate and propagate into the calculated SLNR, affecting the SLNR estimate accuracy. This paper proposes a direct algorithm that links clear-sky SLNR with the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances in MODIS channels 29, 31 and 32 and column water vapour (CWV). The multivariate regression (MVR) and extreme gradient boosting (xGBoost) were employed to establish the relationships sequentially with collocated ground measurements and satellite data for high-latitude, mid-latitude, and low-latitude areas. According to the training and validation results, the GBoost model performs slightly better than the MVR model, which indicates that weak nonlinearity exists between clear-sky SLNR and its predictors. The absolute biases of the XGBoost models are approximately 1.0 Wm(-2), and the RMSEs of the XGBoost model are 17.77, 27.33, and 19.60 Wm(-2) in high-latitude, mid-latitude, and low-latitude areas. These results indicate that nonlinear relationships exist between clear-sky SLNR and predictors, but this nonlinearity is not strong. The superiority of the direct algorithm over the conventional method was also demonstrated. In the future, we will collect more data to improve the performance of the proposed direct algorithm especially in high-latitude and mid-latitude areas.

TI  - Dynamics of land cover transitions and agricultural abandonment in a mountainous agricultural landscape: Case of Ifugao rice terraces, Philippines
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountainous agricultural landscapes experienced large-scale land cover changes in the past decades due to traditional land modification practices and increasing permanent agricultural abandonment. However, there is lack of observation of short-period land cover transitions and paddy field dynamics of fallowing and recultivation. This study was implemented in the Philippines' Ifugao rice terraces with three aims. The first aim is to analyze rapid land cover transitions by mapping land cover maps in consistent five-year intervals from 1990 to 2020. The second aim is to analyze paddy field dynamics that involve permanent abandonment, fallowing, firsttime cultivations, and recultivation by developing an analysis framework involving time-series land cover maps. The third aim is to confirm the relationship between abundance of vegetation land covers and permanent abandonment of paddy fields by implementing regression analysis. Results show that a two-step process involving low vegetation as an intermediary land cover typically occurs in between agricultural abandonment and afforestation that was widely observed in mountainous agricultural landscapes. Observed temporal dynamics of paddy fields aligned with historical records such as high rates of permanent abandonment in the 1990s and recultivation (416% increase) in the 2000s. Regression analysis revealed that there is a significant correlation between low vegetation cover abundance and subsequent paddy field permanent abandonment (P = 0.0498), which confirms that afforestation in the landscape decreased the water yield and promoted agricultural abandonment. The findings suggest that planning of mountainous agricultural landscapes should address social and environmental driving factors to mitigate the land-transition feedback loop that further promotes agricultural abandonment.

TI  - Gaussian processes retrieval of crop traits in Google Earth Engine based on Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedented availability of optical satellite data in cloud-based computing platforms, such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), opens new possibilities to develop crop trait retrieval models from the local to the planetary scale. Hybrid retrieval models are of interest to run in these platforms as they combine the advantages of physically-based radiative transfer models (RTM) with the flexibility of machine learning regression algorithms. Previous research with GEE primarily relied on processing bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) reflectance data, which requires atmospheric correction. In the present study, we implemented hybrid models directly into GEE for processing Sentinel-2 (S2) Level-1C (L1C) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data into crop traits. To achieve this, a training dataset was generated using the leaf-canopy RTM PROSAIL in combination with the atmospheric model 6SV. Gaussian process regression (GPR) retrieval models were then established for eight essential crop traits namely leaf chlorophyll content, leaf water content, leaf dry matter content, fractional vegetation cover, leaf area index (LAI), and upscaled leaf variables (i.e., canopy chlorophyll content, canopy water content and canopy dry matter content). An important pre-requisite for implementation into GEE is that the models are sufficiently light in order to facilitate efficient and fast processing. Successful reduction of the training dataset by 78% was achieved using the active learning technique Euclidean distance-based diversity (EBD). With the EBD-GPR models, highly accurate validation results of LAI and upscaled leaf variables were obtained against in situ field data from the validation study site Munich-North-Isar (MNI), with normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) from 6% to 13%. Using an independent validation dataset of similar crop types (Italian Grosseto test site), the retrieval models showed moderate to good performances for canopy-level variables, with NRMSE ranging from 14% to 50%, but failed for the leaf-level estimates. Obtained maps over the MNI site were further compared against Sentinel-2 Level 2 Prototype Processor (SL2P) vegetation estimates generated from the ESA Sentinels' Application Platform (SNAP) Biophysical Processor, proving high consistency of both retrievals (R2 from 0.80 to 0.94). Finally, thanks to the seamless GEE processing capability, the TOA-based mapping was applied over the entirety of Germany at 20 m spatial resolution including information about prediction uncer-tainty. The obtained maps provided confidence of the developed EBD-GPR retrieval models for integration in the GEE framework and national scale mapping from S2-L1C imagery. In summary, the proposed retrieval workflow demonstrates the possibility of routine processing of S2 TOA data into crop traits maps at any place on Earth as required for operational agricultural applications.

TI  - Assessing the impacts of natural disasters on rice production in Jiangxi, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural productivity is affected by natural disasters, such as drought and flood, which can be assessed by remote sensing (RS) technology. The main objective of this research is to develop an operational methodology for predicting rice yield that is utilized to assess the impacts of drought and flood disasters on agricultural productivity taking Jiangxi, China as an example. For this purpose, we first calculated the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) using monthly rainfall data of 83 stations from 1960 to 2020 to identify the disastrous years and their spatial extent of impact. Then, time-series MODIS data from 2000 to 2020, Landsat images, digital elevation model (DEM) were obtained and utilized for rice plantation mapping using decision-tree algorithm and yield estimation. The identified 3-cropping rice plantations were converted into rice masks for calculating the county-level cumulative NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) to match the reported county-level annual rice yield for building remote sensing-based rice yield models taking the averages of 2016-2019 as test. By comparing the determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE) and prediction accuracy of the models, we found that the best model for rice yield estimation is Y (D) = 4.899 x 10(-6)xNDVI (2) + 2.891 x NDVI + 98511.218 (R-2 = 0.898). This model was applied to estimate the county-level annual rice production of 2014 and 2015, and provincial annual rice production of 2010-2019 for validation and prediction. The agreement with the government-reported yield reaches 97-98% at provincial level and the models were hence considered reliable. After verification, the models were applied to other remained years after 2010 for estimating the provincial annual rice production. Then, a new disaster indicator, that is, the disaster composite index (DCI) was developed for assessing the disaster impact on annual rice production in a pilot area around Nanchang City. Results show that developed models are capable of achieving rice yield estimation using both MODIS data for regional and Landsat data for local scale. In comparison with the normal or least affected year, impacts of drought and flood were successfully evaluated using DCI for pilot area and their relationship was created. We hence believe the developed methodology is extendable to South China and other rice plantation area in the world.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of grassland aboveground biomass and its driving factors in North China over the past 20 years
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although remote sensing has enabled rapid monitoring of grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) at a regional scale, it is still a difficult challenge to construct an accurate estimation model of grassland AGB in a vast region to support the AGB dynamics analysis over a long time series. In this study, extensive grassland AGB measurements (collected in North China during the grassland growing season of 2000-2019), MODIS data, and environmental factors (climate, topography and soil) were employed to construct the grassland AGB models using four machine learning algorithms (random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural network and extreme learning machine) combined with four variable selections. The spatial distributions of annual grassland AGB from 2000 to 2019 were simulated based on the optimal AGB model. The temporal change and future trend of AGB series from 2000 to 2019 were comprehensively analyzed by the slope model and Hurst exponent. The influences of natural and anthropogenic factors on grassland AGB dynamics were explored quantitatively using the Geodetector model. The results showed that (1) the random forest model constructed from the variables selected by the successive projections algorithm is the optimal grassland AGB model. (2) The 20-year average grassland AGB in North China showed an overall spatial distribution of being low in the central and western parts and high in the southeastern part. (3) The annual maximum grassland AGB in most regions (82.71%) showed an increasing trend during 2000-2019; and most of the grasslands with a decreasing trend of AGB were located in regions with low AGB values and arid climates. (4) The future trend of grassland AGB after the study period may be optimistic, as reflected by more grassland AGB was predicted to increase rather than decrease (70.38% vs. 29.62%). (5) The main driving factors of spatiotemporal dynamics of grassland AGB were precipitation, soil type, and livestock density; the interactive influence of two drivers on AGB showed mutual enhancement.

TI  - Grazing influences biomass production and protein content of alpine meadows
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine grasslands are essential for carbon sequestration and food supply for domestic and wild herbivores inhabiting mountainous areas worldwide. These biomes, however, are alternatively threatened by the abandonment of agricultural and livestock practices leading to a fast-growing shrubification process while other mountain grasslands are suffering from the impacts of overgrazing. The functioning of alpine meadow ecosystems is primarily driven by climatic conditions, land-use legacies and grazing. However, although it is critically important, the role of large herbivores on the aboveground biomass and protein content of palatable plants is poorly understood for most alpine meadows. In this work, we explore the effects of grazing on grassland vegetation at two different spatial and temporal scales in the Eastern Pyrenees, Spain. Remote sensing was used to assess the effect of high and moderate grazing (HG and MG respectively) on grass biomass using the leaf area index (LAI) at the meso-scale (patches between 2.3 and 38.7 ha). We also explored the impact of null (NG), overgrazing (MO, mimicked overgrazing) and high (HG) grazing intensities at local scale setting eighteen 1 m2 exclusion boxes in six meadows (three boxes each) commonly used by domestic and wild ungulates. Historical satellite data showed that LAI values are greater in high than in low grazed areas (HG, mean = 0.66, LG, mean = 0.55). Along the same lines, high and moderate grazing pressures improved biomass production at the local-scale (HG, mean = 590.3 g/m(2), MO, mean = 389.3 g/m(2) and NG, mean = 110.8 g/m(2)). Crude protein content reached higher values under MO pressure than under HG pressure. Our results confirm that grazing intensity exerts significant changes on the above-ground biomass production and the protein content of plants consumed by domestic (cattle and horses) and wild ungulates (Southern Chamois, Rupicapra pyrenaica). We can conclude that ungulates sustain biomass and nutritive values of grass exerting a negligible effect on biomass and protein content of woody vegetation. Our results will inform management guidelines to support profitable grazing activities and promote conservation of the open landscapes in the alpine ecosystems under the current global change scenario.

TI  - Prediction of water turbidity in a marine environment using machine learning: A case study of Hong Kong
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The water quality measurement of marine water is a key research topic for environmental and ocean modelers in the past several decades. Marine water quality is mainly described by its chemical, physical and biological properties. According to the Environmental Protection Department (EPD), Hong Kong, the chemical and physical measurements are integrative parameters for water quality measurements. The existence of undesirable components in marine water degrades the water quality. The increase of natural and anthropogenic events in coastal regions poses the marine ecosystem in danger day by day. Therefore, the prediction of marine water quality indicators is essential. Turbidity is a key indicator of marine water quality, whose prediction is difficult due to its non-linear time series behavior. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to predict turbidity in the marine environment of Hong Kong using Machine Learning (ML) approach. The artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), and Long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) have been used as ML tools in the marine environment. The ML model prediction results were compared and the obtained results suggest that the LSTM-RNN model outperforms the ANN and SVR model results with an accuracy of 88.45%. The neural network-based approaches give better prediction accuracy over the SVR model in this study. Thus, it can be concluded that the neural network-based algorithm results can be used to monitor water quality parameters in the marine environment. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - One-Bed-One-Team-Does an Integrated General Hospital Inpatient Model Improve Care Outcomes and Productivity: An Observational Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionWith the increasing complexity of healthcare problems worldwide, the demand for better-coordinated care delivery is on the rise. However, current hospital-based practices remain largely disease-centric and specialist-driven, resulting in fragmented care. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of an integrated general hospital (IGH) inpatient care model. MethodsRetrospective analysis of medical records between June 2018 and August 2019 compared patients admitted under the IGH model and patients receiving usual care in public hospitals. The IGH model managed patients from one location with a multidisciplinary team, performing needs-based care transition utilizing acuity tagging to match the intensity of care to illness acuity. Results5,000 episodes of IGH care entered analysis. In the absence of care transition in intervention and control, IGH average length of stay (ALOS) was 0.7 days shorter than control. In the group with care transition in intervention but not in control, IGH acute ALOS was 2 days shorter, whereas subacute ALOS was 4.8 days longer. In the presence of care transition in intervention and control, IGH acute ALOS was 6.4 and 10.2 days shorter and subacute ALOS was 15.8 and 26.9 days shorter compared with patients under usual care at acute hospitals with and without co-located community hospitals, respectively. The 30- and 60-days readmission rates of IGH patients were marginally higher than usual care, though not clinically significant. DiscussionsThe IGH care model maybe associated with shorter ALOS of inpatients and optimize resource allocation and service utilization. Patients with dynamic acuity transition benefited from a seamless care transition process.

TI  - Deformation monitoring and analysis of Kunyang phosphate mine fusion with InSAR and GPS measurements
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to prevent landslide and collapse in the mining area, it is essential not only to gain a full understanding of the surface defor-mation information about the open-pit mining area and surrounding dumps, but also to closely monitor the development of surface deformation. Small baseline set (SBAS) technology can be applied to extract the high-resolution spatial-temporal deformation informa-tion from the mining areas. Due to decoherence, however, it is difficult to obtain the effective information on deformation from some areas where the results are monitored. This paper proposes a kriging interpolation method that performs better in filling the missing values in the InSAR monitored results by integrating GPS measured data with InSAR monitored data. In the experimental process, 69 Sentinel-1 image data were collected from July 2018 to November 2020. The SBAS-InSAR technology was applied to monitor the surface deformation caused to the Kunyang phosphate mining area and surrounding dumping sites. It was found out that all the mining areas across the Kunyang Phosphorus Mine and the surrounding dumps suffered severe surface deformation, with the maximum line of sight (LOS) deformation rate of-132 mm/yr located in the dump in the north of the second mining area. The verification result shows that InSAR measurement results are consistent with the deformation estimated from GPS measurements. The root mean square error of most points is maintained within & PLUSMN;10 mm. The Kriging interpolation results of fusion GPS data are in good agreement with the GPS results. The root mean square errors at the 4 verification points are & PLUSMN;6.2 mm, & PLUSMN;4.6 mm, & PLUSMN;6.4 mm, & PLUSMN;7.8 mm. The method proposed in this paper is effective in filling in the missing values in the incoherent area, and can be applied to mine surface deformation monitoring with high reliability. The results of this paper serve as a scientific basis for the prevention and control of landslides, collapses and other hidden risks of geological disasters posed by the mining operations conducted in the Kunyang Phosphorus Mine.

TI  - Seasonal snow cover classification based on SAR imagery and topographic data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Melting snow is a sensitive indicator of regional climate change and snowmelt runoff. Optical remote sensing offers an effective tool to delineate the extent of snow cover, but its application is limited by sky conditions and illumination. In contrast, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the advantages of high penetration and can obtain the bulk properties of snowpack, such as snow wetness, in addition to the snow-covered area (SCA). The widely used algorithm based on the multitemporal backscattering coefficient can delineate wet snow and further estimate dry snow cover by empirical rules. However, employing a fixed threshold on wet snow extraction and only considering altitude in dry snow estimation lead to the misclassification of snow cover. In this study, an algorithm was developed for dry and wet snow discrimination based on C-band dual-polarization SAR data. First, the adaptive threshold obtained by the Otsu thresholding method (OTSU) was implemented on the ratio image to improve wet snow extraction, and then topographic information, including elevation, slope and aspect, was added to further infer dry snow cover. Snow field observations were carried out in March 2021 and February 2017 to evaluate the effectiveness of the presented method in typical snow regions with different snowpack characteristics. Compared with using a single equation with a fixed threshold (57.9% and 56.5%, respectively), the overall accuracy of the novel approach in prairie and alpine snow areas was 84.2% and 73.9%, respectively. The results show that considering the adaptive threshold and topography offers superior performance in identifying dry and wet snow.

TI  - Long-term water quality assessments under changing land use in a large semi-arid catchment in South Africa
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing nutrient loads from land use and land cover (LULC) change degrade water quality through eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems globally. The Vaal River Catchment in South Africa is an agriculturally and economically important area where eutrophication has been a problem for decades. Effective mitigation strategies of eutrophication in this re-gion require an understanding of the relationship between LULC change and water quality. This study assessed the long-term impacts of LULC changes on nitrate (NO3-N) and orthophosphate (PO4-P) pollution in the lower Vaal River Catchment between 1980 and 2018. Multi-year LULC was mapped from Landsat imagery and changes were de-termined. Long-term trends in NO3-N and PO4-P loads and concentrations in river water samples were analysed, while multi-year LULC data were ingested into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate the impacts of LULC changes in NO3-N and PO4-P loads. Main LULC changes included an increase in the irrigated area by 262% and in built -up area by 33%. This occurred at the expense of cultivated dryland fields and rangelands. In situ data analysis showed that at the catchment inlet, PO4-P concentration and loads significantly increased, while NO3-N concentration and loads decreased between 1980 and 2018. At the catchment outlet, only PO4-P loads increased, while NO3-N loads and concentrations remained the same. SWAT simulations at the Hydrologic Response Unit scale showed that irrigated land was the largest contributor to NO3-N leaching per ha. Aggregation of nutrient loads by LULC type showed in-creased nutrient loads from irrigated and built-up areas over time, while loads from dryland areas decreased. At catchment scale, dryland remained an important contributor of the annual nutrient loads total because of its large area. In future, research efforts should focus on crop management practices to reduce nutrient loads.

TI  - Land cover classification of treeline ecotones along a 1100 km latitudinal transect using spectral- and three-dimensional information from UAV-based aerial imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The alpine treeline ecotone is expected to move upwards in elevation with global warming. Thus, mapping treeline ecotones is crucial in monitoring potential changes. Previous remote sensing studies have focused on the usage of satellites and aircrafts for mapping the treeline ecotone. However, treeline ecotones can be highly heterogenous, and thus the use of imagery with higher spatial resolution should be investigated. We evaluate the potential of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the collection of ultra-high spatial resolution imagery for mapping treeline ecotone land covers. We acquired imagery and field reference data from 32 treeline ecotone sites along a 1100 km latitudinal gradient in Norway (60-69 degrees N). Before classification, we performed a superpixel segmentation of the UAV-derived orthomosaics and assigned land cover classes to segments: rock, water, snow, shadow, wetland, tree-covered area and five classes within the ridge-snowbed gradient. We calculated features providing spectral, textural, three-dimensional vegetation structure, topographical and shape information for the classification. To evaluate the influence of acquisition time during the growing season and geographical variations, we performed four sets of classifications: global, seasonal-based, geographical regional-based and seasonal-regional-based. We found no differences in overall accuracy (OA) between the different classifications, and the global model with observations irrespective of data acquisition timing and geographical region had an OA of 73%. When accounting for similarities between closely related classes along the ridge-snowbed gradient, the accuracy increased to 92.6%. We found spectral features related to visible, red-edge and near-infrared bands to be the most important to predict treeline ecotone land cover classes. Our results show that the use of UAVs is efficient in mapping treeline ecotones, and that data can be acquired irrespective of timing within a growing season and geographical region to get accurate land cover maps. This can overcome constraints of a short field-season or low-resolution remote sensing data.

TI  - Wavelet transform approach for denoising and decomposition of satellite-derived ocean color time-series: Selection of optimal mother wavelet
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wavelet Transform (WT) has remarkable advantages for feature extraction and denoising of satellite-derived ocean color time series datasets. The selection of mother wavelet (MWT) is the main challenging issue in the wavelet transform analysis of ocean color time series, since different MWT applied to the same dataset may produce different results. In this study, 57 MWTs were investigated to find the optimal wavelet functions for WT analysis of ocean color time series datasets with particular emphasis on the quantitative approaches. The daily, weekly, and monthly averaged of MODIS Level-3 Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) series were denoised and decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) using different MWTs. The seasonal trends of all datasets were extracted using the Seasonal Trend decomposition procedure based on LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) (STL) and Census X-11 methods, used as references. The statistical Cross Correlation Function (CCF), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and Mean Standard Error (MSE), indexes, plus a Magnitude-Shape quantitative model were used to calculate the correlation and similarity between original and corresponding decomposed and denoised reference Chl-a signals. The similarity indexes were analyzed to evaluate the similarity and correlation between reconstructed denoised signals with original Chl-a series, and between DWT seasonal components with the reference seasonal trends. For a more assessment, two different weekly averaged Chl-a series of SeaWiFS satellite sensor over Bermuda Atlantic region (open ocean waters) and Chesapeake Bay (coastal waters) were evaluated using SeaBASS in situ measurements, and seasonal trends in comparison with corresponding DWT components. The results revealed that the "db10 " and "db5 " from Daubechies wavelet family were respectively the best options for denoising and decomposition of Chl-a series using WT methods. Also MWTs from Biorthogonal and Reverse biorthogonal wavelet families gave a poor performance, and therefore these functions are not recommended to use in DWT denoising and decomposition of Chl-a signals.

TI  - Applying landscape approach in assessing effectiveness of mangrove conservation in Ca Mau Cape National Park, Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to assess the effectiveness of mangrove conservation in Ca Mau Cape National Park (CMCNP) during 1973-2018 using remote sensing and landscape metrics. The maximum likelihood method was used to classify time-series Landsat images with overall accuracy ranging from 87.8% to 90.3% and Kappa from 0.83 to 0.88. Additionally, landscape structure which expresses the spatial pattern and the connections between landscape elements such as number, size, and shape were assessed using landscape metrics including Number of patches, Landscape Shape, Largest Patch, Cohesion, Core, Contiguity, and Contagion index. The results showed that mangroves increased by 1,078 ha (7%), and the landscape structure was simple in the first period (1973-1979). In the second period (1979-2003), mangroves decreased by 1,411 ha (9.2%) during 1989-1995, and then they increased by 4,564 ha (29.9%) from 1995 to 2003. The landscape structure was fragmented, disconnected, and had irregular shapes during the beginning but improved at the late phase. In the third period (2003-2018), mangroves increased by 1,596 ha (10.5%). In which, dense mangroves increased by 2,500 ha (16.4%). And sparse mangroves decreased by 904 ha (5.9%). The landscape structure was more homogenous and connected than the second period. Since CMCNP was established in 2003, mangroves have enlarged year by year. The landscape structure became more aggregated. These proved the effectiveness of mangrove conservation in both quality and quantity.

TI  - Wind field and gust climatology of the Persian Gulf during 1988-2010 using in-situ, reanalysis and satellite sea surface winds
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the wind-field and gust climatology of the Persian Gulf (PG), using three offshore wind-field resources, including data buoys, ERA-Interim/ERA5 as reanalysis datasets, and satellite-based observations, collected from the National Climatic Data Center-Blended Sea Winds (NCDC-BSW) dataset. Upon the verification of the in-situ observations via estimations in the reanalysis and satellite data, the wind fields were extracted, and then the long-term wind trends were retrieved and compared with the document released by the International Map Collectors' Society (IMCoS). The study results demonstrated a relative increase and decrease in the wind trends estimated by the reanalysis and satellite data, respectively. The long-term investigation of the rising and falling trends at different stations also established the effect of the summer and winter Shamal (viz. strong northwesterly wind) on the minimum and maximum wind speed and the wind regime over the PG region. Accordingly, June was estimated with high wind speed, mostly corresponding to the summer Shamal. The winter Shamal was also seen in wind gusts in February over the central area of the PG. As for the ERA5 data, the comparisons illuminated general improvements in the results, and the wind speed estimated by the reanalysis ERA5 data in winter outweighed that in summer. The reanalysis estimations were further effective in Qeshm Island and the satellite-based ones were better correlated in Asaluyeh. It was concluded that the reanalysis suffered from limitations in estimating high winds and the satellite observations were facing challenges at very low wind speeds. The gustiest winds, estimated by the IMCoS, were also coming from the west or the northwest of the PG, and most wind gusts were estimated in February. This was consistent with the reanalysis ERA-Interim wind gust data that had estimated the highest values over the central area of the PG, but with lower wind speeds, indicating a general weakness of the reanalysis data in accurately detecting the patterns in the midscale, e.g., gusts.

TI  - The Terror Management Function of Descendent Continuity: Evidence That Descendent Continuity Acts as a Distal and Proximal Defense
T2  - PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous researches showed that offspring can function as a distal defense, we presented seven studies to further explore the role of offspring in terror management for Chinese people based on their unique fertility culture. Both Studies 1a and 1b found that mortality salience increased desire for children. Study 2 showed that offspring salience reduced the effect of mortality salience on social transgressions judgments. Study 3 revealed that disruption of procreation strivings increased death-thought accessibility. Study 4 demonstrated that conscious responses to worldview threats overwhelmed the unconscious compensation effect of worldview threats on desire for children. Study 5a and Study 5b found that offspring salience decreased death anxiety for parents and nonparents. Taken together, these findings expand terror management theory, emphasizing descendent continuity not only as a related yet separate distal defense from the cultural worldviews, self-esteem, and close relationship but also as a proximal defense, especially for Chinese.

TI  - Dense canopies browning overshadowed by global greening dominant in sparse canopies
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Greening, an increase in photosynthetically active plant biomass, has been widely reported as period-related and region-specific. We hypothesized that vegetation trends were highly density-dependent with intensified browning in dense canopies and increased greening in sparse canopies. We exploited this insight by estimating vegetation trends in peak growth from dense to sparse canopies graded from 1 to 20 using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test based on the 500 m 8-day composite MODIS Near Infrared Reflectance of terrestrial vegetation (NIRv) time series datasets in the past two decades (2001-2019) at the global scale. We found that global greening increased by 1.42% per grade with strong fit before grade 15 (R-2 = 0.95): net browning (11% browning vs 9% greening) exhibited in high-density canopies (NIRv > 0.39) in contrast to 32% greening in low-density canopies (NIRv asymptotic to 0.15). While the density-dependent greening was evidenced across different biomes and ecosystems, the steepest gradient (changes per grade) in cropland highlighted the increasingly intensified agricultural activities globally. Greening gradients declined in the dryland, but enhanced in the High-latitude ecosystems driven by warming, especially in the shrubland. Density-dependent vegetation trends were accounted for by the disproportionately impacts from climate changes and the un-equal contributions of Land Cover Changes (LCC) among dense and sparse canopies. Vegetation trends and greening gradients could be extensively facilitated by Wetting or Decreasing solar Radiation (WDR), especially in sparse grass -land and shrubland. Browning was dominant in dense canopies, which was further aggravated by Drying and Increasing solar Radiation (DIR), especially woody vegetation. This study implied the widespread degradation or mortality of highly productive vegetation hidden among global greening dominant in open ecosystems, which might be further exacerbated by the predicted increasing drought under global warming.

TI  - Aerosol models from the AERONET database: application to surface reflectance validation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols play a critical role in radiative transfer within the atmosphere, and they have a significant impact on climate change. In this paper, we propose and implement a framework for developing an aerosol model using their microphysical properties. Such microphysical properties as the size distribution, the complex refractive index, and the percentage of sphericity are derived from the global AERosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). These measurements, however, are typically retrieved when almucantar measurement procedures are performed (i.e., early mornings and late afternoons with clear sky) and might not have a temporal correspondence to a satellite overpass time, so a valid validation of satellite-derived products cannot be carried out. To address this problem of temporal inconsistency of satellite and ground-based measurements, we developed an approach to retrieve these microphysical properties (and the corresponding aerosol model)using the optical thickness at 440 nm, tau(440), and the Angstrom coefficient between 440 and 870 nm, alpha(440-870). Such aerosol models were developed for 851 AERONET sites within the last 28 years. Obtained results suggest that empirically microphysical properties can be retrieved with uncertainties of up to 23 %. An exception is the imaginary part of the refractive index ni, for which the derived uncertainties reach up to 38 %. These specific parametric models of aerosol can be used for the studies when retrieval of microphysical properties is required as well as validation of satellite-derived products over land. Specifically, we demonstrate the usefulness of the aerosol models to validate surface reflectance records over land derived from optical remote sensing sensors. We then quantify the propagation of uncertainties in the surface reflectance due to uncertainties with the aerosol model retrieval that is used as a reference from radiative transfer simulations. Results indicate that individual aerosol microphysical properties can impact uncertainties in surface reflectance retrievals between 3.5 x 10(-5) to 1 x 10(-3) (in reflectance units). The overall impact of microphysical properties combined yields an overall uncertainty in surface reflectance < 0.004 (in reflectance units). That corresponds, for example, to 1 to 3 % of the retrieved surface reflectance in the red spectral band (620-670 nm) by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. These uncertainty values are well below the specification (0.005 + 0.05 rho; rho is the retrieved surface reflectance) used for the MODIS atmospheric correction.

TI  - Mapping spatial-temporal nationwide soybean planting area in Argentina using Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Argentina is one of the three most crucial soybean-producing countries in the world. Timely and accurate monitoring of the soybean planting area and its changes across the country is extremely important for global food security. This study effectively extracted the spatial-temporal nationwide soybean planting areas in Argentina from 2016 to 2019 based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and pixel-based machine learning method random forest. About 8000 soybean sampling points were gathered from the high spatial resolution imagery available on Google Earth. Comprehensive consideration of phenological period, monitoring area and imagery availability, multi-bands of Landsat 8 imagery and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) waverage annual temperatures range as used to map dynamics of nationwide soybean planting areas. The primary soybean planting areas were mapped between 2016 and 2019 and occupied 5.90%-6.76% of Argentina's total land area. Soybean planting areas at the provincial level explained more than 84% of the variability in most years compared with those obtained from official statistics. The spatial distribution of primary soybean planting areas changed from 2016 to 2019 resulting in the shift of area-weighted centroids. Results showed that NDVI and NIR features calculated by the first three months' composites contributed more to the classification. This study provides an effective way to retrieve the soybean planting area accurately and rapidly, especially when lacking chances for field measurement over a large spatial extent.

TI  - The Ambivalence of Early Gentry Liberalism in Russia
T2  - RUSSIAN STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using material from contemporary scholarly debate, the author shows that the term "early Russian liberalism" remains conceptually vague both in content and in its chronological sense. In the strictly conceptual approach, the beginnings of liberalism correlate with its doctrinal form, which corresponds to the liberalism of the mid-nineteenth to early twentieth centuries. There is no unanimity in modern historiography on the question of criteria for liberalism, but there is an understanding that the simple imposition of Western models is methodologically wrong, since it would ignore a national specificity for which the main feature is the integration of the liberal worldview with the principle of autocracy. This article considers early Russian liberalism in the chronological sense as a response to the challenges of the time. The historically conditioned diversity of liberal forms allows us to demonstrate the complexity and ambiguity of Russian liberalism as a phenomenon and its syncretic nature. Early liberal ideas were generated among the upper nobility as a means of protecting them from the tyranny of those in power. The main obstacle to the development of political-legal discourse in Russia was paternalism. Alexander I's encouragement of a liberal agenda contributed to the temporary liberalization of the political system but did not change the essence of the legal situation. Nicholas I's usurpation of the political discourse began the process of marginalizing political liberalism's ideas and led to the transformation of liberal discourse into an essentially latent liberal one and a formally ethical one, which prevented full implementation of a liberal agenda.

TI  - DOCSNet: a dual-output and cross-scale strategy for pan-sharpening
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening aims to obtain a multi-spectral image of high resolution from inputs of a high spatial resolution panchromatic image and a low spatial resolution multi-spectral image. In recent years, pan-sharpening methods based on supervised learning have achieved superior performance over traditional methods. However, all these supervised pan-sharpening methods rest upon the assumption that performance of model trained on a coarse scale can generalize well on a finer one, which is not always the case. To address this problem, we propose a novel dual-output and cross-scale learning strategy DOCSNet for pan-sharpening. DOCSNet consists of two sub-networks, ReducedNet1 and FullNet2, which are both adapted from simple three convolutional layers and progressively cascaded. ReducedNet1 is first trained on the reduced-scale training set, its parameters are frozen, and then the whole network (fixed ReducedNet1 cascaded with FullNet2) adopts a cross-scale training strategy which involves simultaneously reduced and full resolution training samples. Each sub-network has an output terminal for reduced-scale and target-scale results, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to introduce a dual-output architecture to pan-sharpening framework. Extensive experiments on GaoFen-2 and WorldView-3 satellite images demonstrate that DOCSNet outperforms other state-of-the-art pan-sharpening methods in terms of qualitative visual effects and quantitative metrics evaluations.

TI  - Exploring the links between variations in snow cover area and climatic variables in a Himalayan catchment using earth observations and CMIP6 climate change scenarios
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial extent of the Snow Cover Area (SCA) of the Bhagirathi River Basin (BRB) has changed in recent decades, impacting the hydrology of the region. Previous studies examining variations in SCA in the region have yet been limited to the effects of terrain variables, namely elevation, slope and aspect, without considering the influence of climate variability. This study first investigates temporal changes in SCA and Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) in the BRB during the period 2001-2019, which were calculated using satellite images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), respectively, and their linkages to variation in climatic variables, and then examines how future climate change could impact on the SCA of the basin and its implications for water resources.& nbsp;A trend analysis revealed an increase in the SCA during the study period, correlating with an increase in precipitation and TWS over the basin. Statistically significant positive correlation were detected between the post-monsoon (r = 0.49, p < 0.05) and winter (r = 0.54, p < 0.05) SCA and precipitation, while a negative correlation was identified between SCA and Tmax during the post-monsoon (r =-0.53, p < 0.05) and winter (r =-0.69, p < 0.05) seasons. Climate change scenarios, obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and downscaled over the study region, project an increase in both maximum and minimum temperature, and precipitation for the pre-monsoon and winter seasons in the 2030 s under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios: SSP245 and SSP585. These scenarios, together with a Multiple-Linear Regression (MLR) model developed on the basis of the relationships identified between variations in SCA and climatic variables, indicate a reduction in the SCA at 4000 + m altitudes in all seasons under both scenarios, thereby resulting a decline in the Bhagirathi river flow in spite of a projected increase in precipitation. This study demonstrates the impact of projected changes in climate on the SCA of a Himalayan catchment, and the potential implications for regions where snowmelt is important to streamflow regimes.& nbsp;

TI  - Monitoring rice lodging grade via Sentinel-2A images based on change vector analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lodging stress influences the yield, quality, and mechanical harvesting ability of rice (Oryza sativa L.). It is of great significance for the quantitative and objective evaluation of rice yield loss to obtain the rice lodging distribution and grade information rapidly and nondestructively. The purpose of this paper was to establish a remote sensing monitoring method for the grade of rice lodging based on change vector analysis via Sentinel-2A images before and after lodging. Taking the lodging ratio (LR) of rice in the parcel as the characterization index, the changes in spectral reflectance and vegetation index of the rice canopy under different lodging grade stresses were analyzed. A 7-dimensional space vector was composed of a canopy spectral reflectance and vegetation index. A new angle vector was formed by the angle between each vector object and the axis of the canopy spectrum (vegetation index). Based on the difference in feature vectors before and after lodging, a lodging grade monitoring model based on rice parcels was constructed, and the accuracy of the model was verified using field observations. The results showed that the spectral reflectance of the rice canopy after lodging increased with the increase in lodging stress. The difference in vegetation index before and after lodging increased with the increase in lodging severity. Based on the change in the magnitude of the canopy spectral reflectance and its angle vector, and the vegetation index and its angle vector, the R ( 2 ) of the rice lodging model was 0.66, 0.66, 0.60, and 0.59, respectively, and the RMSE values were 21.03%, 20.37%, 22.13%, and 22.84%, respectively. Therefore, the accuracy of the model constructed using the vegetation index was the highest. The canopy spectral reflectance and difference in the vegetation index of rice changed regularly with lodging grade stress. The model based on the change magnitude of the vegetation index could effectively realize remote sensing monitoring of the grade of rice lodging in Wuchang.

TI  - Quad-polarimetric SAR sea state retrieval algorithm from Chinese Gaofen-3 wave mode imagettes via deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful tool for monitoring sea states in terms of the significant wave height (SWH). Regarding the specific wave mode, to date, the previous empirical models for estimating SWH from SAR data rely on single polarization. In the emerging deep learning era, few published quad-polarized SAR SWH retrieval algorithms have been based on machine learning technique, and whether quad-polarimetry improves the skill of wave height estimation remains a question. Here we propose a deep residual convolutional neural network-based SAR SWH retrieval algorithm in quad-polarization. By collocating WaveWatch III sea state hindcasts and all available archives of quad-polarized Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR imagettes in wave mode, a database with approximately 30,000 matchups was employed to establish our deeply-learned network. The GaoFen-3 significant wave height retrievals were validated against the hindcast dataset independent of training along with altimeter observations. The result of good consistency in terms of a root mean square error of 0.32 m (under sea state conditions of approximately 0.5-7.0 m) outperforms the existing Gaofen-3 wave height retrieval algorithms. Additionally, this paper introduces a discussion about the contribution of polarizations by comparing SWH derived from single-, dual-and quad-polarized deep convolutional neural networks. Single-polarized Gaofen-3 SAR data are found to be sufficient to provide accurate estimates compared to quad-polarization via a deep learning model under moderate sea conditions. Exploitation of SAR quad-polarimetry information will improve SAR wave height retrievals under high sea conditions.

TI  - Epidemiological characteristics of imported respiratory infectious diseases in China, 2014-2018
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: With the progress of globalization, international mobility increases, greatly facilitating cross-border transmission of respiratory infectious diseases (RIDs). This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and factors influencing imported RIDs, with the goal of providing evidence to support adoption of high-tech, intelligent methods to early find imported RIDs and prevent their spread in China.Methods: We obtained data of imported RIDs cases from 2014 to 2018 from the Inbound Sentinel Network of Customs and the National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System in China. We analyzed spatial, temporal, and population distribution characteristics of the imported RIDs. We developed an index to describe seasonality. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine associations between independent variables and imported cases. Data analyses and visualizations were conducted with R software.Results: From a total of 1 409 265 253 inbound travelers, 31 732 (2.25/100 000) imported RIDs cases were reported. RIDs cases were imported from 142 countries and five continents. The incidence of imported RIDs was nearly 5 times higher in 2018 (2.81/100 000) than in 2014 (0.58/100 000). Among foreigners, incidence rates were higher among males (5.32/100 000), 0-14-year-olds (15.15/100 000), and cases originating in Oceania (11.10/100 000). The vast majority (90.3%) of imported RIDs were influenza, with seasonality consistent with annual seasonality of influenza. The spatial distribution of imported RIDs was different between Chinese citizens and foreigners. Increases in inbound travel volume and the number of influenza cases in source countries were associated with the number of imported RIDs.Conclusions: Our study documented importation of RIDs into China from 142 countries. Inbound travel poses a significant risks bringing important RIDs to China. It is urgent to strengthen surveillance at customs of inbound travelers and establish an intelligent surveillance and early warning system to prevent importation of RIDs to China for preventing further spread within China.

TI  - A classification-based spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model for the evaluation of remotely sensed evapotranspiration in heterogeneous irrigated agricultural area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) with high spatial and temporal resolution is frequently required to understand the regional hydrological processes, particularly in agricultural areas with complex planting structures. Most of the existing spatio-temporal fusion models lacked the fusion of ET because they ignored the physiological characteristics of the vegetation moisture condition. Therefore, we propose a classification-based spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model (CSAFM) for the evaluation of remotely sensed ET in an irrigated agricultural area with a complex planting structure. This model combines the unmixing-based and weight-based fusion approaches to produce ET maps with high spatiotemporal resolution. It uses the mainstream weight based fusion algorism-the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM)-in the fusion step. However, in contrast to the existing reflectance-based fusion algorithms, the CSAFM considers the effects of soil moisture and crop category on evapotranspiration rates. It replaces the unmixing window with an irregular hydrological response unit (HRU) containing homogeneous meteorological and irrigation conditions, and then unmixing the mixed pixels using a planting structure map. Moreover, an ET correction method was proposed in CSAFM to restore the spatial heterogeneity. The performance of CSAFM was compared to that of two mainstream fusion models using Landsat-ET and MODIS-ET based on the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL): the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion method (FSDAF). The models were validated with ground-based ET monitored by eddy covariance observed ET and Landsat inverted ET. It was found that the CSAFM model (mean MAE: 0.40 mm/day) beat the ESTARFM model (mean MAE: 0.49 mm/day) and the FSDAF (mean MAE: 0.53 mm/day) in accurately fusion ET and reproduce the details of complex surface landscapes. Additionally, CSAFM (RMSE: 0.66-1.10 mm/day) is less sensitive to the update frequency of input data in the crop growing season than ESTARFM (RMSE: 0.79-1.36 mm/day) and FSDAF (RMSE: 0.79-1.17 mm/day), indicating its suitability in areas with limited input dataset. Overall, the proposed CSAFM model can greatly improve the ET fusion accuracy in irrigated agricultural areas.

TI  - Increased tropical vegetation respiration is dually induced by El Nino and upper atmospheric warm anomalies
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical vegetation respiration (TVR) is affected by extreme climate change. As it is very difficult to directly observe TVR, our understanding of the land-ocean-atmosphere carbon cycle, and particularly the regulatory effect of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on TVR and the land-atmosphere carbon balance, is very limited. Therefore, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and meteorological data, we investigated the response of TVR to changes in ENSO during 2000-2015. The influence of El Nino on TVR was approximately 10.8% higher than that of La Nina. During El Nino years, a significant and anomalous increase in thermal measures related to TVR and ENSO and a significant and anomalous decrease in related hydrological measures favor the formation of warmer and drier climate conditions. Furthermore, the zonal distributions of air temperature and vertical velocity at 200-1000 hPa during El Nino years show that a stronger atmospheric inversion over tropical regions causes an increase in the surface temperature. Moreover, anomalous atmospheric subsidence inhibits the upward transport of water vapor, leading to a decrease in the cloud formation probability and reduced precipitation. In summary, increased surface temperatures caused by increased solar radiation and enhanced atmospheric inversion and decreased precipitation cause warmer and drier climate conditions, which forces TVR to increase. As TVR constitutes the key node of the land-atmosphere-carbon cycle process, we focus on TVR and its close linkage with ENSO events and further establish a knowledge framework for understanding the land-atmosphere-ocean carbon cycle. This study deepens our understanding of not only the mechanism of the land-atmosphere carbon balance but also the ocean-induced terrestrial ecosystem processes spurred by ENSO-involved climate change.

T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the response mechanism winter wheat growth in response to climate change is critical for winter wheat production and field management. Therefore, in this study, we employed relative contribution and path analysis along with a crop model and remote sensing data to investigate to the effect of climate on winter wheat production for the 2009-2019 period in China's Guanzhong Plain (GZP). We registered three key findings. First, winter wheat yield and water use efficiency (WUE) were increasing in the central-south and eastern GZP and were decreasing in the central-north and western GZP. Average temperature (T-avg ) influenced winter wheat production by shorting vegetative and reproductive stage. Net solar radiation (R-n ) and sunshine hours (Ssh) affected winter wheat production by altering irrigation requirements (IRs), and precipitation (P) had a strong correlation with yield and WUE despite a limited contribution. Second, climatic factors were not independent, and they affected each other; T-avg and P mainly affected winter wheat production through R-n and Ssh. Finally, approximately 90% of the variation in yield and WUE of winter wheat could be explained by IRs and phenology, the yield and WUE decreased with an increase in IRs, and the prolongation of the reproductive stage exerted a positive effect on winter wheat production and effectively offset the negative effect of the shortening of the vegetative stage. This means that the adoption of long-lasting winter wheat varieties and high irrigation levels in a changing climate benefit winter wheat production and may be a viable strategy for adaptation to climate change. The results provide potentially valuable information for alleviating the impact of climate change on winter wheat production and improving the planting management of winter wheat in the GZP.

TI  - Enhanced Landsat surface reflectance prediction considering land cover change by using an ensemble of spectro-temporal and spectro-spatial predictions
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud-induced contaminations limit the availability of Earth observation data acquired by Landsat satellites. In the field of cloud contaminated image prediction and restoration, abrupt land cover change is an important but usually unconsidered issue. Based on the existing Time Series Models and Continuous Change Detection algorithm (TSM-CCD), an enhanced TSM-CCD algorithm (eTSMCCD) is proposed in this paper to improve Landsat surface reflectance (SR) predictions based on all available Landsat data. The proposed eTSM-CCD method integrates time-series model estimation in the temporal domain and similar pixel replacement in the spatial domain to both address the issue of abrupt land cover changes and improve the prediction accuracy of SR. The proposed method was applied to Landsat time-series data in two study areas in the United States. The results indicated that the proposed method achieved higher overall and band-wise (especially NIR band) prediction accuracies than the original TSM-CCD algorithm. Specifically, the accuracies were improved more significantly for land cover types with distinct phenological characteristics at the peak of the growing season. In addition, compared to classical spatiotemporal prediction algorithms, such as modified neighborhood similar pixel interpolator (MNSPI) and enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM), the proposed method also yielded higher prediction accuracies and performed much better in predicting abrupt changes in land cover. The eTSM-CCD algorithm proposed in this paper is promising for the prediction and restoration of surface reflectance, especially in the vegetated areas during the peak of the growing season or in areas undergoing abrupt land cover changes.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Fusing Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance to generate dense time series images with 10m spatial resolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the influence of the external atmospheric environment and the physical constraints of the sensors, it is difficult for existing medium spatial resolution sensors to produce intensive time-series images. The easy accessibility and similar sensor configuration of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data make them suitable for synthesizing time-series images. Currently, some deep learning-based studies have achieved significant success in multi-sensor fusion, but these deep-learning fusion networks only use single features that are not enough to produce intensive time-series images. Shallow features are easy to extract but have weak representation, while the deep network can extract abstract features with strong representation ability but faces the problem of gradient disappearance and model degradation. To address these problems, we propose a novel spatial-temporal-spectral integration model that can simultaneously fuse Landsat-7,8 and Sentinel-2 sensors. First, an enhanced residual dense network (ERDN) is proposed to improve Landsat's four bands (Blue, Green, Red, and Near-infrared) to 10 m spatial resolution. ERDN's residual dense structure utilizes abundant shallow features (i.e. texture and spectral information) and deep features (i.e. angles of view and aspect ratios of objects) to reconstruct spatial structures. At the same time, the introduced high-resolution images can provide reliable spatial auxiliary information for the missing image parts. Second, we employ a time-series-based reflectance adjustment (TRA) method to reduce the reflectance differences between Landsat and Sentinel-2 images. The fusion results indicate that our fusion framework can not only fill the gap caused by the Landsat-7 scan-line corrector (SLC) failure but also restore more spatial details than previous methods. More importantly, it can predict tiny reflectance changes in land cover. Overall, our study can produce continuous reflection observations with a higher time density and provides important data guarantee for extracting dynamic changes in land coverages.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Distributions of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region From 2013 to 2020
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) seriously affects the environment, climate, and human health. Over the past decades, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH) has been severely affected by pollutant gas and PM2.5 emissions caused by heavy industrial production, topography, and other factors and has been one of the most polluted areas in China. Currently, the long-term, large-scale, and high spatial resolution monitoring PM2.5 concentrations ([PM2.5]) using satellite remote sensing technology is an important task for the prevention and control of air pollution. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved by satellites combined with a variety of auxiliary information was widely used to estimate [PM2.5]. In this study, a two-stage statistical regression [linear mixed effects (LME) + geographically weighted regression (GWR)] model, combined with the latest high spatial resolution (1 km) AOD product and meteorological and land use parameters, was constructed to estimate [PM2.5] in BTH from 2013 to 2020. The model was fitted annually, and the ranges of coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square prediction errors (RMSPE), and relative prediction error (RPE) for the model cross-validation were 0.85-0.95, 7.87-29.90 mu g/m(3), and 19.19%-32.71%, respectively. Overall, the model obtained relatively good performance and could effectively estimate [PM2.5] in BTH. The [PM2.5] showed obvious temporal characteristic within a year (high in winter and low in summer) and spatial characteristic (high in the southern plain and low in the northern mountain). During the investigated period of 2013-2020, the high pollutant areas ([PM2.5] > 75 mu g/m(3)) in 2020 significantly narrowed compared to 2013, and the annual average [PM2.5] in BTH fell below 55 mu g/m(3), with a drop of 54.04%. In particular, the [PM2.5] in winter season dropped sharply from 2015 to 2017 and declined steadily after 2017. Our results suggested that significant achievements have been made in air pollution control over the past 8 years, and they still need to be maintained. The research can provide scientific basis and support for the prevention and control of air pollution in BTH and beyond.

TI  - Variation of Thermal Infrared Brightness Temperature Anomalies in the Madoi Earthquake and Associated Earthquakes in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (China)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We processed MODIS data received from ground receiving stations into the spatial range of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (China) and the eastern margin of the plateau, and then 283 K was set as the threshold value to remove the area covered by clouds. The monthly background field was calculated based on 17 years' data, then we obtained the spatial Brightness Temperature anomaly of the current month by deducting the background field. Furthermore, the Brightness Temperature anomaly curves for secondary tectonic blocks in the plateau were calculated. The data indicated that since June 2020, the Brightness Temperature radiation within the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau began to increase abnormally, starting from the western part of the study area and expanding eastward to cover the entire plateau. In January 2021, such an anomaly was seen again, extending to the Sichuan-Yunnan Block in the easternmost part of the study area in april. With the ongoing anomaly, a series of moderate and strong earthquakes occurred in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and finally, on 22 May 2021, the M7.4 earthquake struck the Madoi County. Moreover, according to the internal Brightness Temperature time series curves of the different secondary tectonic blocks, the Brightness Temperature has increased simultaneously since the beginning of 2020. A twofold standard deviation was found in the middle-east segment of the Bayanhar Block and the Qiangtang Block in October 2020, and an almost twofold standard deviation was found in March, while a twofold standard deviation was found in the Sichuan-Yunnan Block in april 2021. The occurrence of earthquakes in the plateau before the Madoi earthquake coincided with an upward trend of the time series curve. The spatial anomaly of Brightness Temperature over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau disappeared and the Brightness Temperature time series curve dropped drastically after the Madoi earthquake. The development of spatial anomaly of Brightness Temperature and the time series curve both coincide with the occurrence of earthquakes and are consistent with the generation of tectonic stress in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Our study showed that thermal infrared Brightness Temperature radiation reasonably reflects regional stress development and enables the detection of anomalies prior to moderate and strong earthquakes.

TI  - Evaluation and optimal selection of Dunhuang radiometric calibration site based on OLI/Landsat 8 and MSI/Sentinel 2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Dunhuang radiometric calibration site is an important component of the China Radiometric Calibration Sites (CRCS), which has served for in-flight radiometric calibration of Chinese satellites sensors since the 1990s, whereby the homogeneity has been verified since its construction. However, due to the increasing demand for radiometric calibration of the in-flight satellite sensors, and the impacts of a changing natural environment and the destruction of human activities of the site, it is essential to reassess the homogeneity of Dunhuang site and redefine the suitable region for calibration. Accordingly, the homogeneity of the Dunhuang site is reevaluated based on the satellite images of OLI/Landsat 8 (with resolutions of 30 m) and MSI/Sentinel 2 (with resolutions of 10 m) observed from 2015 to 2021. An ROI of 50 x 75 km is selected covering three historical definitions of the Dunhuang site with an area of 25 x 25 km, 20 x 20 km, and 10 x 10 km, respectively. Firstly, the spatial-temporal coefficients of variation (CVST) of the ROI is calculated. The homogeneity of the three existing sites is analyzed, and the results show that the 20 km site (40.06 degrees N-40.25 degrees N, 94.25 degrees E -94.42 degrees E) has the best homogeneity among the existing sites in Dunhuang. Then, by using a hierarchical region statistical method, three optimal locations and scopes of the Dunhuang site (10 x 10 km: 40.044 degrees N-40.144 degrees N, 94.284 degrees E-94.384 degrees E; 20 x 20 km: 40.002 degrees N -40. 202 degrees N, 94.216 degrees E-94.416 degrees E; 25 x 25 km: 40.021 degrees N-40.247 degrees N, 94.071 degrees E-94.364 degrees E) are defined. The average CVST of the three OGT sites decrease from about 0.94%similar to 2% to 0.7%similar to 1.54% relative to the existing sites, and the standard deviation of CVST decrease from about 0.45%similar to 2% to 0.24%similar to 1%. The Getis statistics also indicate that they are more homogeneous than the existing definitions of the site. Additionally, the optimal Dunhuang sites are compared with the north Africa Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS). The homogeneity of optimal Dunhuang sites is proved to be better than most sites hence that could be the complement for each other. These three optimal Dunhuang sites are new candidate sites served for the satellite in-flight radiometric calibration.

TI  - Is there an association between previous infection with <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> and gonococcal AMR? A cross-sectional analysis of national and sentinel surveillance data in England, 2015-2019
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Quarterly STI screening is recommended for high-risk gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in the UK, but frequent antibiotic exposure could potentially increase the risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) developing in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We investigated whether repeat diagnosis of gonorrhoea in those attending sexual health services (SHS) was associated with reduced antimicrobial susceptibility.Methods Antimicrobial susceptibility data relating to the most recent gonorrhoea diagnosis for each individual included in the Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme (2015-2019) were matched to their historical records in the national GUMCAD STI surveillance data set (2012-2019). The number of gonorrhoea diagnoses in the previous 3 years was calculated for each SHS attendee. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between the number of diagnoses and reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >0.03 mg/L), cefixime (MIC >0.06 mg/L) and azithromycin (MIC >0.25 mg/L) at the time of the latest diagnosis.Results Of 6161 individuals included in the analysis, 3913 (63.5%) were MSM, 1220 (19.8%) were heterosexual men and 814 (13.2%) were women. Among MSM, 2476 (63.3%) had 1 past gonorrhoea diagnosis, 1295 (33.1%) had 2-4, 140 (3.6%) 5-9, and 2 (0.1%) >= 10. Most women and heterosexual men (91.7%) had one past gonorrhoea diagnosis; none had more than four. Reduced ceftriaxone and cefixime susceptibility was more common among MSM with two to four gonorrhoea diagnoses (3.8% and 5.8%, respectively) compared with those with one (2.2% and 3.9%, respectively). After adjusting for potential confounding, this association remained (adjusted OR: 1.59, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.37, p=0.02; adjusted OR: 1.54, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.14, p=0.01). No evidence was found for any other associations.Conclusions Among MSM, repeat diagnosis of gonorrhoea may be associated with reduced ceftriaxone and cefixime susceptibility. As these are last-line therapies for gonorrhoea, further research is needed to assess the impact of intensive STI screening on AMR.

TI  - Anti-KIT monoclonal antibody CDX-0159 induces profound and durable mast cell suppression in a healthy volunteer study
T2  - ALLERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mast cells (MC) are powerful inflammatory immune sentinel cells that drive numerous allergic, inflammatory, and pruritic disorders when activated. MC-targeted therapies are approved in several disorders, yet many patients have limited benefit suggesting the need for approaches that more broadly inhibit MC activity. MCs require the KIT receptor and its ligand stem cell factor (SCF) for differentiation, maturation, and survival. Here we describe CDX-0159, an anti-KIT monoclonal antibody that potently suppresses MCs in human healthy volunteers. Methods CDX-0159-mediated KIT inhibition was tested in vitro using KIT-expressing immortalized cells and primary human mast cells. CDX-0159 safety and pharmacokinetics were evaluated in a 13-week good laboratory practice (GLP)-compliant cynomolgus macaque study. A single ascending dose (0.3, 1, 3, and 9 mg/kg), double-blinded placebo-controlled phase 1a human healthy volunteer study (n = 32) was conducted to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CDX-0159. Results CDX-0159 inhibits SCF-dependent KIT activation in vitro. Fc modifications in CDX-0159 led to elimination of effector function and reduced serum clearance. In cynomolgus macaques, multiple high doses were safely administered without a significant impact on hematology, a potential concern for KIT inhibitors. A single dose of CDX-0159 in healthy human subjects was generally well tolerated and demonstrated long antibody exposure. Importantly, CDX-0159 led to dose-dependent, profound suppression of plasma tryptase, a MC-specific protease associated with tissue MC burden, indicative of systemic MC suppression or ablation. Conclusion CDX-0159 administration leads to systemic mast cell ablation and may represent a safe and novel approach to treat mast cell-driven disorders.

TI  - Evaluating ecotourism assets in the Cameroonian cities hosting the 33rd edition of the Africa Cup of Nations
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the African Cup of Nations (AfCoN) as an important tourism opportunity, the present article aims to advertise Cameroon's touristic potential by assessing the ecological conditions of 11 cities hosting matches of the competition and their respective dance patrimony. In addition to the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI), the land surface temperature (LST) was computed. Both parameters are derived from Landsat-8 OLI images using a combined GIS-remote sensing method and spatially represented. According to the UTFVI values, the ecological conditions are at least acceptable everywhere except a thin zone in Ngaoundere where conditions are bad. Minimum values of UTFVI in those cities are respectively -0.12, -0.22, -1.05, -0.14, -0.08, -0.06, -0.50, -0.77, -0.50, -0.57 and -0.12 while maximum values are respectively 0.23, 0.29, 0.23, 0.14, 0.42, 0.11, 20, 0.35, 21, 56 and 0.14. LST range from 10 degrees C (in Douala with a max value of 27 degrees C) to 71 degrees C (in Foumban with a min value of 59 degrees C). Each city under study has a set of traditional dances that can attract potential visitors. The article contributes to the promotion of sustainability and ecotourism in Cameroon on the occasion of the 33(rd) AfCoN edition.

TI  - Numerical simulation for local buckling behaviour of HSS welded I-section columns under axial compression
T2  - THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the local buckling behaviour of high-strength steel (HSS) welded I-section stub columns under axial compression is investigated using finite element method, which is verified against previous experimental results. Finite element analysis is carried out to investigate the influences of the width-to-thickness ratios of plates, slenderness, and steel grade on local buckling load and ultimate load of HSS welded I-section stub columns under axial compression. The results show the width-to-thickness ratios of plates have significant influences on the stress ratios sigma(cr)/f(y) and sigma(u)/f(y). The stress ratio sigma(cr)/f(y) decreases as the slenderness and steel grade increase. The influences of steel grade and the slenderness on the stress ratio sigma(u)/f(y) of stub columns are not obvious. Current guidance for predicting the local buckling load and ultimate load of HSS welded I-section columns is evaluated. The results show that Eurocode 3, ANSI/AISC 360-16 and GB 50017-2017 are slightly overestimated for predicting the local buckling load and ultimate load of HSS welded I-section columns. More accurate empirical models for estimating the local buckling load and ultimate load of HSS welded I-section columns are suggested. The reliability analysis of Eurocode 3, Shi et al.'s model, and the proposed models is performed according to EN 1990.

TI  - The Validation and Application of a Novel<i> CYP2C19</i> Genotyping Approach Based on Capillary Electrophoresis in Chinese Han population
T2  - CLINICAL LABORATORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms have been described to have an important influence on the drug me-tabolism observed in human populations. A series of PCR-based molecule detection methods are applied to identi-fy CYP2C19 genotype. The aim of the study is to validate the novel CYP2C19 genotyping approach with other methods and reveal the allele frequency distribution of CYP2C19 in Chinese Han population. Methods: We applied a novel genotyping approach for CYP2C19 gene which was combining direct PCR and capil-lary electrophoresis (CE) technique. A series of fluorescent labeled primers were designed to amplify the particu-lar DNA fragments which indicated the wild type of CYP2C19 genotype. The variants consist of CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3 and CYP2C19*17 alleles. Both the novel PCR-based CE method and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) method were used to identify the CYP2C19 genotypes in 324 whole blood samples originated from Chinese Han population. According to the different criterions for judgement of two methods, we can obtain the CYP2C19 alleles and genotypes of the same participants. Kappa statistics was used to evaluate the consistency of the two re-sults and the frequencies of CYP2C19 alleles. The genotypes in Chinese Han population were calculated using EXCEL. Furthermore, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the CYP2C19 genotypes obtained by using the novel ap-proach, Sanger sequencing was conducted to validate the CYP2C19 genotypes *1/*17 and *2/*3. Results: Among the 324 specimens, 111 were *1/*1, 141 were *1/*2, 10 were *1/*3, 4 were *1/*17, 46 were *2/*2, 10 were *2*/3, 1 was *2/*17, and 1 was *3/*17. Allele distributions for CYP2C19 were *1, *2, *3, and *17 at 58.18%, 37.65%, 3.24%, and 0.93%, respectively. Both PCR-based CE method and RT-qPCR methods had good consistency in the genotypes of CYP2C19 polymorphism (Kappa value = 1.000, p < 0.05). The DNA sequences of CYP2C19 genotype *1/*17 were composed of c.681 G/G, c.636 G/G, and c.-806 C > T. In the same way, the DNA sequences of CYP2C19 genotype *2/*3 were composed of c.681 G > A, c.636 G > A, and c.-806 C/C. Conclusions: The variants including the CYP2C19*2 allele were the most common mutations in Chinese Han unrelated individuals. Both PCR-based CE method and RT-qPCR method had good consistency in the genotypes of CYP2C19 polymorphism. Nevertheless, because of more convenience and higher throughput, the novel PCR-based capillary electrophoresis approach showed to be more suitable for clinical gene screening. (Clin.

TI  - Application of a novel cascade-routing and reinfiltration concept with a Voronoi unstructured grid in MODFLOW 6, for an assessment of surface-water/groundwater interactions in a hard-rock catchment (Sardon, Spain)
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated hydrological modelling (IHM) can reliably characterize surface-water/groundwater interactions in complex hydrological systems such as hard-rock systems (HRS), located in water-limited environments (WLE). Such HRS-WLE conditions are represented by Sardon catchment (similar to 80 km(2)) in Spain, where the MODFLOW 6 modelling environment was tested, applying the following improvements as compared to previous works in that catchment: a new conceptual model, driving forces redefined based on remote sensing data, an unstructured Voronoi grid, and, most importantly, a novel cascade-routing and reinfiltration (CRR) concept. In the standard MODFLOW 6, rejected infiltration and groundwater exfiltration have always been considered as sinks (evaporation). However, in reality, that water can not only evaporate but also reinfiltrate back to the subsurface or move as runoff towards drainage water bodies. The CRR improves surface-unsaturated-zone interactions and also surface-water/groundwater interactions. The standard and new capacities of MODFLOW 6 are presented in the transient model of the Sardon catchment, calibrated using 7 years of daily groundwater heads and streamflows. The results showed: the large spatio-temporal variability of the groundwater fluxes, the substantial role of groundwater exfiltration, the low catchment storage, the fast reaction of the water table and streams to rainfall, and the mosaic character of the net recharge. These characteristics are typical for HRS-WLEs with a shallow water table. MODFLOW 6 has many improvements compared to previous MODFLOW versions, so with the proposed CRR concept (still can be improved), the single-environment MODFLOW 6 has modelling capacity comparable with multienvironment IHMs, while being more flexible and more efficient.

TI  - Assessing the current water clarity status of ∼100,000 lakes across southern Canada: A remote sensing approach
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Canada has more lakes than any other country, making comprehensive monitoring a huge challenge. As more and more satellite data become readily available, and as faster data processing systems make massive satellite data operations possible, new opportunities exist to use remote sensing to develop comprehensive assessments of water quality at very large spatial scales. In this study, we use a published empirical algorithm to estimate Secchi depth from Landsat 8 reflectance data in order to estimate water clarity in lakes across southern Canada. Combined with ancillary information on lake morphological, hydrological, and watershed geological and landuse characteristics, we were able to assess broad spatial patterns in water clarity for the first time. Ecological zones, underlying geological substrate, and lake depth had particularly strong influences on clarity across the whole country. Lakes in western mountain ecozones had significantly clearer waters than those in the prairies and plains, while lakes in sedimentary rock formations tended to have lower clarity than lakes in intrusive rock. Deep lakes were significantly clearer than shallow lakes over most of the country. Water clarity was also significantly influenced by human impact (urbanization, agriculture, and industry) in the watershed, with most lakes in high impact areas having low clarity or very low clarity. Finally, we used in situ measured data to help interpret the underlying optical water column constituents influencing clarity across Canada, and found that chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids, and color dissolved organic matter all had strong but varying underlying effects on water clarity across different ecozones. This research provides an important step towards further research on the relationship between water column optical properties and the health and vulnerability status of lakes across the country.

TI  - Deterioration of air quality associated with the 2020 US wildfires
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The wildfires of August and September 2020 in the western part of the United States were characterized by an unparalleled duration and wide geographical coverage. A particular consequence of massive wildfires includes serious health effects due to short and long-term exposure to poor air quality. Using a variety of data sources including aerosol optical depth (AOD) and ultraviolet aerosol index (UVAI), obtained with the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) and Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), combined with meteorological information from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and other supporting data, the impact of wildfires on air quality is examined in the three western US states, California, Oregon, and Washington, and areas to the east. The results show that smoke aerosols not only led to a significant deterioration in air quality in these states but also affected all other states, Canada, and surrounding ocean areas. The wildfires increased the average daily surface concentration of PM2.5 posing significant health risks, especially for vulnerable populations. Large amounts of black carbon (BC) aerosols were emitted into the atmosphere. AOD and UVAI exceeded 1 and 2 over most of the country. In parts of the three western states, those values reached 3.7 and 6.6, respectively. Moreover, a reanalysis based on MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) showed that the maximum values of BC surface mass concentration during the wildfires were about 370 mu g/m(3). These various indicators provide a better understanding of the extent of environmental and atmospheric degradation associated with these forest fires.

TI  - Elevated mercury and PCB concentrations in Dolly Varden (<i>Salvelinus malma</i>) collected near a formerly used defense site on Sivuqaq, Alaska
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental pollution causes adverse health effects in many organisms and contributes to health disparities for Arctic communities that depend on subsistence foods, including the Yupik residents of Sivuqaq (St. Lawrence Island), Alaska. Sivuqaq's proximity to Russia made it a strategic location for U.S. military defense sites during the Cold War. Two radar surveillance stations were installed on Sivuqaq, including at the Northeast Cape. High levels of persistent organic pollutants and toxic metals continue to leach from the Northeast Cape formerly used defense (FUD) site despite remediation efforts. We quantified total mercury (Hg) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations, and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures, in skin and muscle samples from Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma), an important subsistence species. We found that Hg and PCB concentrations significantly differed across locations, with the highest concentrations found in fish collected near the FUD site. We found that 89% of fish collected from near the FUD site had Hg concentrations that exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) unlimited Hg-contaminated fish consumption screening level for subsistence fishers (0.049 mu g/g). All fish sampled near the FUD site exceeded the EPA's PCB guidelines for cancer risk for unrestricted human consumption (0.0015 mu g/g ww). Both Hg and PCB concentrations had a significant negative correlation with 813C when sites receiving input from the FUD site were included in the analysis, but these relationships were insignificant when input sites were excluded. 815N had a significant negative correlation with Hg concentration, but not with PCB concentration. These results sug- gest that the Northeast Cape FUD site remains a point source of Hg and PCB pollution and contributes to higher con- centrations in resident fish, including subsistence species. Moreover, elevated Hg and PCB levels in fish near the FUD site may pose a health risk for Sivuqaq residents.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic is exerting a significant influence on global energy markets, and continuing to hinder the growth of core technology for the implementation of renewable forms of energy. With an unprecedented effect, the new coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV2, has succeeded to seize the control of most cities of the world and led to their closure. The newly-emerged virus has also resulted in environmental changes. The present study was conducted to show the indirect positive effects of COVID-19 on the reduction of air pollution, particularly in countries such as Italy, France, and India. Our research proved the existence of meaningful relationships between probable actions, air quality improvement, and increased energy generation by photovoltaic systems (PVs). Newly-obtained data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite illustrate that some cities have experienced a 45 to 50% reduction in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration compared to the same period in the past year. This reduction has provided two important and unexpected benefits, namely the reduction in environmental pollution (specifically air pollution) and, as a consequence, an increase in the amount of energy generated by PVs.

TI  - Validity evaluation of a machine-learning model for chlorophyll a retrieval using Sentinel-2 from inland and coastal waters
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) on-board Sentinel-2 provides satellite images at spatiotemporal resolutions suitable for chlorophyll a (Chla) retrieval from inland and coastal waters. Machine-learning (ML) algorithms including light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) were employed for Chl a retrieval from MSI. The study area encompasses 78 lakes and estuaries located across four major river watersheds in South Korea. Matchup data between MSI overpass and near-concurrent in situ Chl a measurements from December 2018 to April 2021 were included. The remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) values of six single spectral bands and four two-band ratios were used as the input features. Despite the difficulty in Chla estimation in optically complex waters, ML algorithms showed overall reasonable accuracy. Among the ML algorithms, LGBM exhibited the best performance (R2 = 0.75, bias =-0.15, slope = 0.73, RMSE = 15.15 mg & BULL;m-3, MAE = 9.49 mg & BULL;m-3) over a wide range of trophic states. Post-hoc interpretations of the best performing LGBM using Shapley additive explanations indicated that Rrs(7 0 4)/Rrs(6 6 5) was the most important feature, while Rrs(7 3 9)/Rrs(7 0 4) and Rrs(4 9 2)/Rrs(5 6 0) played auxiliary roles in Chl a retrieval through interaction with Rrs(7 0 4)/Rrs(6 6 5). Among-lake spatial variations of Chla were explained by percent forest and agricultural area within the buffer zone at multiple scales (buffer widths of 50 m and 500 m). The associations between the modeled Chla and buffer land cover types, that is, increase in Chla concentration with increase in percent forest and decrease in percent agricultural area, were consistent with the established ecological knowledge. Overall, the model interpretations and spatial variations in Chla within and among lakes confirmed the validity of LGBM for retrieving MSI-derived Chla from lakes and estuaries. Our study can serve as the reference for evaluating the validity of complex ML models for inland water remote sensing.

TI  - Overestimation and adjustment of Antarctic ice flow velocity fields reconstructed from historical satellite imagery
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctic ice velocity maps describe the ice flow dynamics of the ice sheet and are one of the primary components used to estimate the Antarctic mass balance and contribution to global sea level changes. In comparison to velocity maps derived from recent satellite images of monthly to weekly time spans, historical maps, from before the 1990s, generally cover longer time spans, e.g., over 10 years, due to the scarce spatial and temporal coverage of earlier satellite image data. We found velocity overestimations (OEs) in such long-span maps that can be mainly attributed to velocity gradients and time span of the images used. In general, they are less significant in slow-flowing grounded regions with low spatial accelerations. Instead, they take effect in places of high ice dynamics, for example, near grounding lines and often in ice shelf fronts. Velocities in these areas are important for estimating ice sheet mass balance and analyzing ice shelf instability. We propose an innovative Lagrangian velocity-based method for OE correction without the use of field observations or additional image data. The method is validated by using a set of ground truth velocity maps for the Totten Glacier and Pine Island Glacier which are produced from high-quality Landsat 8 images from 2013 to 2020. Subsequently, the validated method is applied to a historical velocity map of the David Glacier region from images from 1972-1989 acquired during Landsat 1, 4, and 5 satellite missions. It is demonstrated that velocity overestimations of up to 39 m a(-1) for David Glacier and 195 m a(-1) for Pine Island Glacier can be effectively corrected. Furthermore, temporal acceleration information, e.g., on basal melting and calving activities, is preserved in the corrected velocity maps and can be used for long-term ice flow dynamics analysis. Our ex periment results in the Pine Island Glacier (PIG) show that OEs of a 15-year span can reach up to 1300 m a(-1) along the grounding line and cause an overestimated grounding line (GL) flux of 11.5 Gt a(-1) if not corrected. The magnitudes of the OEs contained in both velocity and mass balance estimates are significant. When used alongside recent velocity maps of 1990s-2010s, they may lead to underestimated long-term changes for assessment and forecast modeling of the global climate change impact on the Antarctic ice sheet. Therefore, the OEs in the long-span historical maps must be seriously examined and corrected. We recommend that overestimations of more than the velocity mapping uncertainty (1 sigma) be corrected. This velocity overestimation correction method can be applied to the production of regional and icesheet-wide historical velocity maps from long-term satellite images.

TI  - Rapid assessment of plant diversity using MODIS biophysical proxies
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral information derived from satellite data provides important inputs for assessing plant diversity. If a suitable satellite-derived biophysical proxy is applicable to assess and monitor plant diversity of different biogeographic regions will be of interest to policy makers and conservationists. We selected four biogeographic regions of India, i.e., semi-arid, Eastern Ghats, Western Ghats, and Northeast as the test sites on the basis of variations in moisture availability. The flora data collected for the study sites are the extract of the national biodiversity project 'Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level'. The available Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived biophysical proxies at high temporal frequencies was considered to compare the biophysical proxies: surface reflectance-red and near-infrared, normalized difference vegetation index-NDVI, enhanced vegetation index-EVI, leaf area index-LAI, and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation-FAPAR at different temporal scales (monthly, post-monsoon, seasonal, annual) in each selected biogeographic regions of India. Generalized linear model (GLM) and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) were utilized to evaluate the relationship between plant diversity and MODIS-derived biophysical proxies. MARS summarized the suitable biophysical proxies at monthly scale in descending order for the total forest area in semi-arid was red, NDVI, and FAPAR; for Eastern Ghats was EVI, FAPAR, and LAI; for Western Ghats was EVI, LAI, and FAPAR; and for Northeast was NDVI, near-infrared, and red. Furthermore, monthly FAPAR commonly found to be the suitable proxy to large scale monitoring of plant diversity in the moisture varied biogeographic regions of India, except Northeast. Using artificial neural network, the relationship of plant diversity and monthly FAPAR/NDVI were modeled. The correlation between the predicted and reference plant diversity was found to be r = 0.56 for semi-arid, r = 0.52 for Eastern Ghats, r = 0.52 for Western Ghats and r = 0.61 for Northeast at p-value < 0.001. The study affirms that FAPAR is potentially an essential biodiversity variable (EBV) for carrying out rapid/indicative assessment of plant diversity in different biogeographic regions, and thereby, meeting various international commitments dealing with conservation and management measures for biodiversity.

TI  - Comparative study of spatiotemporal variation in the urban heat island core in coastal and inland basin cities
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Using satellite data, it is possible to precisely observe the micro-scale structure of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and its change over time. A new approach for clustering complex heat islands patterns was proposed using a combination of the operational method and the Jenks natural breaks method. Through this, we defined the spatial range of heat island and the core with the higher temperature in it and also applied for Busan, a coastal city, and Daegu, an inland basin city in the Korean peninsula. SUHI existed in one of the following three types: single-core heat island with one core, multi-core heat island with two or more cores, and acentric heat island (AHI) without a core. Busan and Daegu had different spatiotemporal SUHI variations. Variation of the SUHI pattern in Busan was markedly different according to seasonal changes, and in Daegu, the difference between day and night was more pronounced than seasonal changes. In Busan, SUHIs bordered by mountains in the inner-city area tended to move closer to the sea in winter. Several SUHIs formed in the shape of basin during the daytime were merged into one large heat island in the downtown of the city at nighttime in Daegu. These spatiotemporal changes of SUHI were also consistent with the variation of near-surface temperature (NST). In addition, the study case had a high correlation with the distribution and intensity of SUHI averaged over 5 years. Although there are several cores in SUHIs did not appear in the 5-year average data, which was associated with its inter-annual variation, the distribution of SUHIs was agreed well with the 5-year average NST pattern.

TI  - Continuous mapping of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) air quality in East Asia at daily 6 x 6 km<SUP>2</SUP> resolution by application of a random forest algorithm to 2011-2019 GOCI geostationary satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We use 2011-2019 aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) instrument over East Asia to infer 24 h daily surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations at a continuous 6 x 6 km(2) resolution over eastern China, South Korea, and Japan. This is done with a random forest (RF) algorithm applied to the gap-filled GOCI AODs and other data, including information encoded in GOCI AOD retrieval failure and trained with PM2.5 observations from the three national networks. The predicted 24 h GOCI PM2.5 concentrations for sites entirely withheld from training in a 10-fold cross-validation procedure correlate highly with network observations (R-2 = 0.89) with a single-value precision of 26 %32 %, depending on the country. Prediction of the annual mean values has R-2 = 0.96 and a single-value precision of 12 %. GOCI PM2.5 is only moderately successful for diagnosing local exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) because these exceedances are typically within the single-value precisions of the RF and also because of RF smoothing of extreme PM2.5 concentrations. The area-weighted and population-weighted trends of GOCI PM2.5 concentrations for eastern China, South Korea, and Japan show steady 2015-2019 declines consistent with surface networks, but the surface networks in eastern China and South Korea underestimate population exposure. Further examination of GOCI PM2.5 fields for South Korea identifies hot spots where surface network sites were initially lacking and shows 2015-2019 PM2.5 decreases across the country, except for flat concentrations in the Seoul metropolitan area. Inspection of the monthly PM2.5 time series in Beijing, Seoul, and Tokyo shows that the RF algorithm successfully captures observed seasonal variations in PM2.5, even though AOD and PM2.5 often have opposite seasonalities. The application of the RF algorithm to urban pollution episodes in Seoul and Beijing demonstrates high skill in reproducing the observed day-to-day variations in air quality and spatial patterns on the 6 km scale. A comparison to a Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) simulation for the Korean peninsula demonstrates the value of the continuous GOCI PM2.5 fields for testing air quality models, including over North Korea, where they offer a unique resource.

T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Raw soil core physical data used in machine learning algorithms with corresponding spatial remotely sensed data is an emerging science. Using data derived from soil core samples previously collected in Universal Transverse Mercator zone 50 (Western Australia) and remotely sensed data, a model that predicted ground movement (GM) was developed specific to Australian Standards manual AS 1726-2017. This is the first approach for Australian soils and first in the world for soils older than 200 million yr. The model developed reliably predicted GM with 91.1% accuracy. The error obtained from the prediction is within acceptable limits currently used by engineers in calculations concerning soil classification for engineering purposes. Concerning the remotely sensed data analyzed, accuracy of the Atterberg limits method might be improved if additional information about soil structure (layering and horizon) or other variables (seasonal data) are built into this model. This model can be used to save on construction material costs, reduce the potential for human error associated with data collection and sample manipulation, but also fast-track (by up to 6 wk based on current wait times) building approvals while ensuring compliance to the relevant legislation. This platform also reduces the environmental effects of invasive drilling techniques. A requirement within principles of sustainable building practices, and associated with current standards commonly used by structural engineers who may seek better understanding of soil properties in Australia as a software service (with application potential in North America).

T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND INTERCULTURAL COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - While colonial worldviews and practices continue to cast a long shadow, indigenous efforts to reflect and protect their humanature relationships mark a striking form of political resistance within modern legal contexts. One particularly revealing case is that of Aotearoa New Zealand during the Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River) Settlement Bill in 2017, where Maori parliamentarians successfully advocated-after decades of struggle-for the granting of rights to a natural entity through nuanced code switching strategies between English and Te Reo Maori (the Maori language). Drawing on cultural discourse analysis (CuDA), we showcase how their code-switching practices highlighted cultural differences, built identities, and advocated for kaitiakitanga (the Maori worldview of guardianship). By looking at code-switching through CuDA's discursive hubs, we found that speakers relayed complex humanature worldviews and navigated the linguistic, colonial, political, and environmental struggles experienced within them. Speakers performed culturally distinct practices counter to Western derived hegemony, with regard not only to its depictions of the environment, but across its designations of what a culture should encompass regarding humanature relations within an intercultural setting such as Parliament.

TI  - Three-year follow-up of de-escalated axillary treatment after neoadjuvant systemic therapy in clinically node-positive breast cancer: the MARI-protocol
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose In clinically node-positive (cN+) breast cancer patients, evidence supporting response-guided treatment after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) instead of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is increasing, but follow-up results are lacking. We assessed three-year axillary recurrence-free interval (aRFI) in cN+ patients with response-adjusted axillary treatment according to the 'Marking Axillary lymph nodes with Radioactive Iodine seeds' (MARI)-protocol. Methods We retrospectively assessed all stage II-III cytologically proven cN+ breast cancer patients who underwent the MARI-protocol between July 2014 and November 2018. Pre-NST axillary staging with FDG-PET/CT (less- or more than four suspicious axillary nodes; cALN < 4 or cALN >= 4) and post-NST pathological axillary response measured in the pre-NST largest tumor-positive axillary lymph node marked with an iodine seed (MARI-node; ypMARI-neg or ypMARI-pos) determined axillary treatment: no further treatment (cALN < 4, ypMARI-neg), axillary radiotherapy (ART) (cALN < 4, ypMARI-pos and cALN >= 4, ypMARI-neg) or ALND plus ART (cALN >= 4, ypMARI-pos). Results Of 272 women included, the MARI-node was tumor-negative in 56 (32%) of 174 cALN < 4 patients and 43 (44%) of 98 cALN >= 4 patients. According to protocol, 56 (21%) patients received no further axillary treatment, 161 (59%) received ART and 55 (20%) received ALND plus ART. Median follow-up was 3.0 years (IQR 1.9-4.1). Five patients (one no further treatment, four ART) had axillary metastases. Three-year aRFI was 98% (95% CI 96-100). The overall recurrence risk remained highest for patients with ALND (HR 4.36; 95% CI 0.95-20.04, p = 0.059). Conclusions De-escalation of axillary treatment according to the MARI-protocol prevented ALND in 80% of cN+ patients with an excellent three-year aRFI of 98%.

TI  - Does ultrasound evaluation of the axilla increase the rate of axillary lymph node dissection in early stage clinically node negative breast cancer patients?
T2  - BMC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Management and axillary staging of breast cancer has become less invasive and more conservative, over the decades. Considering Z011, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be avoided in T1-2 N0-1 breast cancers with one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), if they are candidates for breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to recognize if pre-operative axillary US evaluation in early-stage breast cancer could lead to more ALND in post Z011 era. Method 463 breast cancer patients were evaluated. 368 early-stage breast cancer patients (T1-2 N0) were included. We did not perform axillary US in early stage clinically node negative patients; however, 97 patients had axillary US prior to our visit. If axillary US could detect more than two suspicious LNs, US guided biopsy was performed. The remaining clinically node negative patients underwent upfront SLNB. ALND was performed if more than two SLNs were metastatic, or US-guided ALN biopsy proved metastatic involvement. Results 97 patients had axillary US evaluation before the surgery. 67 patients (69.2%) did not have any suspicious US detected axillary LNs, 17 patients (17.5%) had one, 7 patients (7.2%) had two, and 6 patients (6.2%) had more than two suspicious LNs according to their axillary US evaluation. Those with more than two suspicious LNs underwent ALN US-guided biopsy. Metastatic involvement of the LNs was proved in all of them and they underwent upfront ALND. ALND revealed more than 2 metastatic LNs in 2/6 patients (33.3%). 91 patients who were evaluated by axillary US, had less than two US detected suspicious LNs and underwent SLNB. Amongst 24 patients with one or two US detected suspicious LNs, 1/24 patient had more than two positive SLNs and underwent ALND. In this group 15.6% underwent ALND and 5.2% of them were unnecessary according to the recent guidelines. Axillary US had a false positive rate of 36.6%. The sensitivity of axillary US in distinguishing patients with more than two suspicious LNs in clinically node negative patients was 25%. In the second group (without pre-operative axillary US evaluation), SLNB was performed. 204/272 patients (75%) did not have LN metastasis. 54/272 patients (19.9%) had one or two metastatic SLNs and according to Z011, ALND was omitted. 5.1% had more than two metastatic SLNs and underwent ALND. Conclusion US evaluation of the axilla in early stage, clinically node negative breast cancer patients, is not sensitive enough to recognize more than two metastatic ALNs. It leads to more unnecessary ALND. Despite the small number of patients in this study, these results question the rationale of axillary US guided biopsy in low burden (less than two) suspicious LNs. looking for an imaging modality with a higher sensitivity in detecting the Burdon of axillary metastatic involvement is mandatory.

TI  - Socioeconomic development role in hospitalization related to air pollution and meteorology: A study case in southern Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is one of the foremost environmental threats to human health. However, the meteorological and social factors that lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we use Principal Component Analysis and Generalized Linear Model (PCA-GLM) to investigate the combined effect of socioeconomic development and air pollution on cardiorespiratory hospitalization in southern Brazil. This region has the highest rates of hospitalization by cardiorespiratory diseases in the country. We analyze three main sources of data: (i) air pollutants density from TROPOMI/Sentinel-5p satellite; (ii) temperature, humidity, and planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) modeled with the Weather Research Forecast model; and (iii) hospitalization by cardiorespiratory diseases obtained from the Brazilian National Health System. We estimate the Relative Risk (RR) using the PCA-GLMcoefficients and interquartile variations of air pollutants density and meteorological parameters. Our results show that the population living in colder and drier municipalities is more prone to cardiorespiratory hospitalization. Regarding respiratory hospitalization, municipalities with lower socioeconomic development are more sensitive to meteorology and pollution variability than highly developed ones. In less developed municipalities, we observe the highest rates of cardiorespiratory hospitalization even if air pollution is low, whichwe interpret in terms of higher vulnerability. The RR analysis suggests that air pollution is an important environmental risk to cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases is more sensitive to air pollution and meteorology than cardiovascular ones. Our findings corroborate the mounting evidence that social vulnerability is a significant factor affecting the increase of cardiorespiratory hospitalization in the world.

TI  - Machine learning-based retrieval of day and night cloud macrophysical parameters over East Asia using Himawari-8 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds play a significant role in the climate system, which affects the radiation balance and modulates the global hydrological cycle. However, the existing cloud property products have poor spatiotemporal continuity with only daytime cloud property retrieval results, which makes it challenging for us to carry out researches related to clouds at night. In this study, the effect of parallax error between the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and Himawari-8 data is corrected based on parallax correction algorithm by referring to cloud parameters extracted from the CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) cloud property product. Due to the different sensitivity of different channels to clouds, this study treats the CALIOP data with cloud optical depth greater than 0.2 as clouds, otherwise as clear sky. Cloud property retrieval model based on the XGBoost machine learning (ML) algorithm is developed for the advanced Himawari imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8 satellite. The ML model can achieve unified cloud mask, cloud top temperature (CTT), and cloud top height (CTH) retrieval for both daytime and nighttime with high spatial (0.02) and temporal (10 min) resolutions using the AHI thermal data. The retrieval results are extensively evaluated over study regions (80E ~ 135E, 18N ~ 55N) by comparisons with cloud property products of JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) AHI, MODIS, and CALIOP data. The ML algorithm has higher cloud detection accuracy with cloudy sky (clear sky) hit rate (CHR) and false alarm rate (FAR) of 90.79% (88.35%) and 5.74% (4.67%) compared with the JAXA AHI (CHR = 92.81% (60.64%) and FAR = 19.66% (3.61%)) and MODIS (CHR = 88.50% (72.32%) and FAR = 13.10% (6.06%)) cloud products, and the ML algorithm also performs well for thin clouds over bright surfaces. The CTH and CTT retrieved by the ML algorithm (RMSE = 1.83 km and 12.29 K) are in good agreement with the CALIOP cloud property product, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of CTH and CTT is reduced by 33.70% (18.67%) and 35.28% (16.45%) on average, respectively, compared with the JAXA AHI (MODIS) cloud product with RMSE of 2.76 km (2.25 km) and 18.99 K (14.71 K). In addition, the ML algorithm can obtain higher cloud property retrieval accuracy at night compared with the results during the day.

TI  - Contributions to Satellite-Based Land Cover Classification, Vegetation Quantification and Grassland Monitoring in Central Asian Highlands Using Sentinel-2 and MODIS Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The peripheral setting of cold drylands in Asian mountains makes remote sensing tools essential for respective monitoring. However, low vegetation cover and a lack of meteorological stations lead to uncertainties in vegetation modeling, and obstruct uncovering of driving degradation factors. We therefore analyzed the importance of promising variables, including soil-adjusted indices and high-resolution snow metrics, for vegetation quantification and classification in Afghanistan's Wakhan region using Sentinel-2 and field data with a random forest algorithm. To increase insights on remotely derived climate proxies, we incorporated a temporal correlation analysis of MODIS snow data (NDSI) compared to field measured vegetation and MODIS-NDVI anomalies. Repeated spatial cross-validation showed good performance of the classification (80-81% overall accuracy) and foliar vegetation model (R-2 0.77-0.8, RMSE 11.23-12.85). Omitting the spatial cross-validation approach led to a positive evaluation bias of 0.1 in the overall accuracy of the classification and 25% in RMSE of the cover models, demonstrating that studies not considering the spatial structure of environmental data must be treated with caution. The 500-repeated Boruta-algorithm highlighted MSACRI, MSAVI, NDVI and the short-wave infrared Band-12 as the most important variables. This indicates that, complementary to traditional indices, soil-adjusted variables and the short-wave infrared region are essential for vegetation modeling in cold grasslands. Snow variables also showed high importance but they did not improve the overall performance of the models. Single-variable models, which were restricted to areas with very low vegetation cover (<20%), resulted in poor performance of NDVI for cover prediction and better performance of snow variables. Our temporal analysis provides evidence that snow variables are important climate proxies by showing highly significant correlations of spring snow data with MODIS-NDVI during 2001-2020 (Pearson's r 0.68) and field measured vegetation during 2006, 2007, 2016 and 2018 (R 0.3). Strong spatial differences were visible with higher correlations in alpine grasslands (MODIS NDVI: 0.72, field data: 0.74) compared to other regions and lowest correlations in riparian grasslands. We thereby show new monitoring approaches to grassland dynamics that enable the development of sustainable management strategies, and the mitigation of threats affecting cold grasslands of Central Asia.

TI  - GreyWolfLSM: an accurate oil spill detection method based on level set method from synthetic aperture radar imagery
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill detection (OSD) in marine areas is an application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to protect aquatic life. In this paper, a new oil spill detection algorithm based on level set method (LSM) is presented. Dark spot detection, feature extraction, and classification are the main steps in the proposed method. In the first step, a new dark spot detection method in SAR images is presented, which introduces a combination of multi-objective grey wolf optimization (MOGWO) and K-means clustering to find the best threshold level for image segmentation. This method overcomes the K-means clustering by choosing optimal number of clusters and centers. In the feature extraction step, a vector consisting of 45 arrays of calculated Legendre moments in the main, gradient and radon transform of the image is used. The oil-suspicious areas are also discriminated by the supported vector machine (SVM) classifier, and their boundaries are applied as an initial contour to a new hierarchical region-based level-set method (HRLSM). Experiments are performed on the images acquired by Envisat, UAVSAR, TerraSAR-X, and Sentinel1 satellites. The results showed the reliability and robustness of the proposed method with high accuracy, even for noisy images with heterogeneous and weak boundaries.

TI  - Trends in Deforestation as a Response to Management Regimes and Policy Intervention in the Hindu Kush Himalaya of Pakistan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the annual rate of deforestation as a forest conservation outcome, this study evaluated how effective is the existing forest management regime in controlling deforestation in the study area. Remote sensing data were used to measure the rate of deforestation. Furthermore, the existing forest management regime in the study area, as well as in other regions of the Himalayan and Karakoram ranges of Pakistan and the Himalayan temperate biome of India, China, Nepal, and Bhutan, was reviewed to compare deforestation. The results showed that, with regional-wise management regimes, the overall annual rate of deforestation was recorded much higher in the study area (0.8 yr(-1)) compared to the Himalayan and Karakoram ranges of Azad Kashmir (0.13% yr(-1)), Punjab (0.20% yr(-1)), and Gilgit Baltistan (0.31% yr(-1)). The cross-national and site-regional findings highlighted that lowest deforestation was associated with management regimes characterized by effective monitoring and law enforcement with the inclusion of conservation and community. Deforestation was higher in forest management regimes that aimed to maximize economic growth, unstable rights, weak law enforcement, and exclusion of conservation and community-based management/use. In conclusion, the best forest conservation outcomes are associated with management regimes that include conservation and community and stable and secure rights supported by high-ranking monitoring and law enforcement. Therefore, the inclusion of community and conservation supplemented with stable rights and high-rank monitoring and law enforcement into the existing management regimes is suggested.

TI  - The Brain Selectively Tunes to Unfamiliar Voices during Sleep
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The brain continues to respond selectively to environmental stimuli during sleep. However, the functional role of such responses, and whether they reflect information processing or rather sensory inhibition, is not fully understood. Here, we present 17 human sleepers (14 females) with their own name and two unfamiliar first names, spoken by either a familiar voice (FV) or an unfamiliar voice (UFV), while recording polysomnography during a full night of sleep. We detect K-complexes, sleep spindles, and microarousals, and assess event-related and frequency responses as well as intertrial phase synchronization to the different stimuli presented during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. We show that UFVs evoke more K-complexes and microarousals than FVs. When both stimuli evoke a K-complex, we observe larger evoked potentials, more precise time-locking of brain responses in the delta band (1-4 Hz), and stronger activity in the high frequency (>16 Hz) range, in response to UFVs relative to FVs. Crucially, these differences in brain responses disappear completely when no K-complexes are evoked by the auditory stimuli. Our findings highlight discrepancies in brain responses to auditory stimuli based on their relevance to the sleeper and propose a key role for K-complexes in the modulation of sensory processing during sleep. We argue that such content-specific, dynamic reactivity to external sensory information enables the brain to enter a sentinel processing mode in which it engages in the important internal processes that are ongoing during sleep while still maintaining the ability to process vital external sensory information.

TI  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the A/H5N8 subtype, clade 2.3.4.4b, caused outbreaks in Kazakhstan in 2020
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Large poultry die-offs happened in Kazakhstan during autumn of 2020. The birds' disease appeared to be avian influenza. Northern Kazakhstan was hit first and then the disease propagated across the country affecting eleven provinces. This study reports the results of full-genome sequencing of viruses collected during the outbreaks and investigation of their relationship to avian influenza virus isolates in the contemporary circulation in Eurasia. Methods. Samples were collected from diseased birds during the 2020 outbreaks in Kazakhstan. Initial virus detection and subtyping was done using RT-PCR. Ten samples collected during expeditions to Northern and Southern Kazakhstan were used for full-genome sequencing of avian influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analysis was used to compare viruses from Kazakhstan to viral isolates from other world regions. Results. Phylogenetic trees for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase show that viruses from Kazakhstan belong to the A/H5N8 subtype and to the hemagglutinin H5 clade 2.3.4.4b. Deduced hemagglutinin amino acid sequences in all Kazakhstan's viruses in this study contain the polybasic cleavage site (KRRKR-G) indicative of the highly pathogenic phenotype. Building phylogenetic trees with the Bayesian phylogenetics results in higher statistical support for clusters than using distance methods. The Kazakhstan's viruses cluster with isolates from Southern Russia, the Russian Caucasus, the Ural region, and southwestern Siberia. Other closely related prototypes are from Eastern Europe. The Central Asia Migratory Flyway passes over Kazakhstan and birds have intermediate stops in Northern Kazakhstan. It is postulated that the A/H5N8 subtype was introduced with migrating birds. Conclusion. The findings confirm the introduction of the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the A/Goose/Guangdong/96 (Gs/GD) H5 lineage in Kazakhstan. This virus poses a tangible threat to public health. Considering the results of this study, it looks justifiable to undertake measures in preparation, such as install sentinel surveillance for human cases of avian influenza in the largest pulmonary units, develop a human A/H5N8 vaccine and human diagnostics capable of HPAI discrimination.

TI  - Southern ocean sea level anomaly in the sea ice-covered sector from multimission satellite observations
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Despite its central role in the global climate, the Southern Ocean circulation is still one of the least understood ocean circulation systems of the planet. One major constraint to our understanding of this region is the challenge of observing ocean circulation in the seasonally sea ice sector of the Southern Ocean. Here, we present a new Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) product, focusing on the subpolar Southern Ocean and including its sea ice covered parts from 2013 to 2019. Combining observations from multiple satellites, including Cryosat-2, Sentinel-3A, and SARAL/AltiKa, processed with state-of-the-art algorithms, allows an improvement in spatial and temporal resolution compared with previous products. Validation is made by comparing our estimate with existing SLA products, cross-comparing estimates from individual satellites in the sea ice zones, and comparing the time series of the product with a Bottom Pressure Recorder in the Drake Passage.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Growing evidence suggest that sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in endometrial cancer accurately detects lymph node metastasis. However, prospective randomized trials addressing the oncological outcomes of SLN biopsy in endometrial cancer without lymphadenectomy are lacking.Primary Objectives The present study aims to confirm that SLN biopsy without systematic node dissection does not negatively impact oncological outcomes.Study Hypothesis We hypothesized that there is no survival benefit in adding systematic lymphadenectomy to sentinel node mapping for endometrial cancer staging. Additionally, we aim to evaluate morbidity and impact in quality of life (GoL) after forgoing systematic lymphadenectomy.Trial Design This is a collaborative, multicenter, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized trial. After total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and SLN biopsy, patients will be randomized (1:1) into: (a) no further lymph node dissection or (b) systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy.Major Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria are patients with high-grade histologies (endometrioid G3, serous, clear cell, and carcinosarcoma), endometrioid G1 or G2 with imaging concerning for myometrial invasion of >= 50% or cervical invasion, clinically suitable to undergo systematic lymphadenectomy.Primary Endpoint(s) The primary objective is to compare 3-year disease-free survival and the secondary objectives are 5-year overall survival, morbidity, incidence of lower limb lymphedema, and QoL after SLN mapping +/- systematic lymphadenectomy in high-intermediate and high-risk endometrial cancer.Sample size 178 participants will be randomized in this study with an estimated date for completing accrual of December 2024 and presenting results in 2027.

TI  - Effects of lidar coverage and field plot data numerosity on forest growing stock volume estimation
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest parameter estimation is required to support the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. Currently, forest resource assessment is increasingly linked to auxiliary information obtained from remote sensing (RS) technologies. In forest parameter estimation, airborne laser scanning (ALS) data have been demonstrated to be an invaluable source of information. However, ALS data are often not available for the entire forest area, whereas images from multiple satellite systems offer new opportunities for large-scale forest surveys. This study aims to assess and estimate the contribution of field plot data and ALS data along with Landsat data to the precision of growing stock volume (GSV) estimates. We compared different approaches for model-assisted estimation of mean forest GSV per unit area using different proportions of field sample data, ALS cover data, and wall-to-wall Landsat data. Model-assisted estimators were used with NFI sample data in an Italian study area using 10 RS predictors, specifically the seven Landsat 7 ETM+ bands and three fine-resolution metrics based on ALS-derived canopy height. We found that relative to the standard simple expansion estimator, the model-assisted estimators produced relative efficiency of 1.16 when using only Landsat data and relative efficiencies as great as 1.33 when using increasing levels of ALS coverage.

TI  - Will extreme weather events influence the toxic impacts of caffeine in coastal systems? Comparison between two widely used bioindicator species
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent years, marine heatwaves (MHWs) have caused devastating impacts on marine life. The understanding of the combined effects of these extreme events and anthropogenic pollution is a vital challenge. In particular, the combined effect of MHWs on the toxicity of pharmaceuticals to aquatic life remains unclear. To contribute to these issues, the main goal of the present investigation was to evaluate how MHWs may increase caffeine (CAF) toxicity on the clam Ruditapes philippinarum and the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Bioaccumulation levels and changes on oxidative stress, metabolic capacity and neurotoxic status related biomarkers were investigated. The obtained results revealed the absence of CAF accumulation in both species. However, the used contaminant generated in both bivalve species alteration on neurotransmission, detoxification mechanisms induction as well as cellular damage. The increase of antioxidant defence mechanisms was complemented by an increase of metabolic activity and decrease of energy reserves. The obtained results seemed magnified under a simulated MHWs, suggesting to a climate-induced toxicant sensitivities' response. On this perspective, understanding of how toxicological mechanisms interact with climate-induced stressors will provide a solid platform to improve effect assessments for both humans and wildlife.

TI  - Estimation of soil lead content based on GF-5 hyperspectral images, considering the influence of soil environmental factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Heavy metal pollution is an increasingly serious problem. The accumulation of heavy metals in soil is a threat to ecological balance and human health, and therefore, it is very important to monitor heavy metal concentrations efficiently and accurately over large areas. Hyperspectral remote sensing (HRS) images are beneficial for such large-scale monitoring, but the process of image acquisition is inevitably affected by soil environmental factors. In this study, we proposed a method to construct a mechanistic model by considering the influence of soil environmental factors. Materials and methods Fifty-one soil samples were collected in Xiong and Anxin counties of Xiong'an New Area in Hebei Province. First, a direct standardization (DS) algorithm was applied to eliminate the influence of soil environmental factors on Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite image spectra. Then, the DS-corrected image spectra were jointly modeled with the corresponding laboratory spectra to increase the sample size. Due to the strong sorption and retention of lead (Pb) on iron oxide particles in soil, the characteristic bands associated with iron oxide were extracted for model calibration. Then, the trained model was applied to GF-5 image spectra to obtain the Pb distribution in the arable area. Results The model validation accuracy (R-2) without DS correction was 0.30, while the R-2 value without extracting the characteristic iron oxide band was 0.58. The R-2 value of the method in this paper could reach 0.77. The Pb distribution map made according to this study was consistent with the actual distribution pattern and the results of previous studies, which confirms that the method used in this study is reliable. Conclusion The DS algorithm eliminated the influence of soil environmental factors and greatly improved the estimation ability of the model. And the use of the iron oxide characteristic band improved the accuracy of the estimation of Pb concentration.

T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Y Statin-induced necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (SINAM) is a rare side effect in people who are taking a class of drugs called statins. Patients with SINAM will present with subacute severe symmetric proximal muscle weakness. In contrast to more common myopathies, SINAM may not spontaneously resolve with statin discontinuation. These patients may require long-term immunotherapy to limit further disease progression. In this case study, we report a 74-year-old female with SINAM who presented for radical excision of a right upper back melanoma and sentinel lymph node biopsy at an outpatient facility. An anesthetic plan was crafted with the use of a supraglottic airway device without neuromuscular blockade.

TI  - Application of the profile method for the estimation of urban sensible heat flux using roadside weather monitoring data and satellite imagery
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the possibility of estimation of the sensible surface heat flux using satellite derived surface temperature and road pavement temperature together with in-situ wind and air temperature measurements by the profile method. A 10-year series of data from the roadside weather observation network was used. This dataset contained wind (measured at 5.8-9.5 m above ground) and air temperature (measured at 2.6-4.8 m) together with road surface temperature. Another dataset consisted of 254 simultaneous MODIS observations. A high correlation (0.94) of the surface temperature measured by both methods was noted despite coarse pixel size. We considered satellite-derived surface temperature to determine the sensible heat flux by the profile method; these results were compared to the values obtained using road temperature measured by pavement-mounted sensors. While the overall correlation is relatively strong (0.70) and considerable systematic differences exist, the values of heat flux calculated at different locations show a high spatial coherence either when using the in situ pavement temperature (correlation ranging from 0.84 to 0.94 for daytime and 0.63-0.84 for nighttime) or the satellite derived temperature (correlation coefficient 0.72). In most cases, differences between the two flux estimates can be linked to local factors such as the land use structure.

TI  - Kinematics of the ∼1000 km Haiyuan fault system in northeastern Tibet from high-resolution Sentinel-1 InSAR velocities: Fault architecture, slip rates, and partitioning
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 1000-km-long Haiyuan fault system on the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau contributes to accommodating the deformation in response to the India/Asia collision. In spite of its importance, the kinematics of the fault including the geometry and along-strike slip rate have not been completely defined. In this study, we use synthetic aperture radar data acquired between 2014 and 2021 by Sentinel 1 satellites to investigate the present-day strain accumulation on the Haiyuan fault system. We produce a high-resolution velocity map for the similar to 300,000 km(2) Haiyuan region using the Small BAseline Subset method. Our new velocity fields reveal deformation patterns dominated by the eastward motion of Tibet relative to Alaxan and localised strain accumulation along the Haiyuan, Gulang and XiangshanTianjingshan faults. The western similar to 300-km-long section of the Haiyuan fault, which was previously unmapped, seems to follow Tuolaishan and terminate at Halahu. We compute the along-strike slip rate using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo inversion approach, and find that the overall strike-slip rate along the Haiyuan fault system gradually increases from the western end (1.8 +/- 0.3 mm/yr close to Halahu) to the east (6.4 +/- 0.5 mm/yr before entering Liupanshan), and further east, it decreases from 6.4 +/- 0.5 mm/yr to 1.3 +/- 0.7 mm/yr. The Haiyuan fault absorbs most of the left-lateral strike-slip motion with a rate of -4.2 +/- 0.4 mm/yr, and the Gulang and Xiangshan-Tianjingshan faults take up a fraction of 2.2 +/- 0.6 mm/yr. We re-map the previously identified shallow creeping zone on the Laohushan segment for a length of 45 km, slightly larger than the previous estimate of 35 km. The average shallow creep rate, 3 mm/yr between 2014-2021, is consistent with the rate before 2007 (2-3 mm/yr), implying that the shallow creep is a steady behaviour. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Coppice loss and persistence in Germany
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coppicing is an ancient form of forest and woodland management. Coppice harbours important biodiversity and has a high cultural value, but has been transformed into high forest, neglected and abandoned over vast areas of Central Europe during the past century. Hotspots of remaining, active coppice systems are often under the radar of national and international forest and conservation authorities, because they are managed as socio-ecological systems by close-knit village communities. A better spatial overview of active and neglected coppice, and a quantification of trends in coppice management are important to allocate restoration and conservation priorities and identify potential areas for future coppice restoration.& nbsp;I quantified trends in coppice area across Germany, a country with a historically large proportion of coppice, over the past century. I studied temporal and spatial patterns in management and transformation in a remaining hotspot of coppice without standards ('simple coppice') harnessing the Landsat archive and very high resolution, publicly available satellite images. I supplemented the remote sensing analysis by a review of published and unpublished, grey literature.& nbsp;Across Germany, the area of active coppice with standards declined by 98.7% between 1927 and 2020, from ca. 400,000 ha to ca. 5,000 ha. The area of simple coppice declined from an estimated 680,000 ha to ca. 6,400 ha in the same period, i.e. by 99.1%. The area of overage (> 35 years uncut) and abandoned coppice is difficult to define and quantify, but it likely exceeds 100,000 ha across Germany. Active coppice, dominated by oak (Quercus spp.) and birch (Betula spp.), is now found only in three regions. However, only in the federal state of Hesse, intact coppice landscapes have survived, comprising an area of ca. 2,000 ha. Here, traditional coppice management with relatively short rotation cycles and large coupes is maintained, with a stable area cut annually since 1986 and no coppice transformation to high forest since the 1970s. There was statistical evidence that the heating oil price influences the area that was cut annually, suggesting some potential for coppice restoration in the coming years, given rising energy prices.& nbsp;As a conclusion, intact coppice systems have virtually disappeared in Germany, and with them their unique biodiversity and cultural heritage. There is an urgent need to safeguard the remaining socio-ecological systems, to develop incentives to maintain current active coppice and to develop integrative approaches to restore abandoned coppice, as a small-scale alternative to commercial forestry and close-to-nature silviculture.

TI  - Visualization of Sentinel Lymph Nodes with Mannosylated Fluorescent Nanodiamonds
T2  - ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study focuses on the development of a sensitive and specific approach for the visualization of sentinel lymph nodes draining the tumor using ultrabright 200-nm fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) equipped with a designed targeting surface architecture. The FNDs with a narrow size distribution are isolated by differential centrifugation, colloidally stabilized with alkyne-functionalized poly(glycerol) and modified with a polyvalent array of mannose (FND-p-Man). In vitro experiments demonstrate an outstanding increase of the particle internalization by the mannose receptor CD206 (MR) and no significant toxicity. MR involvement is confirmed by blocking ligand binding with mannan and a 15.2 mAb (specific anti-MR) in J774A.1 mouse macrophage cell line. In vivo mouse experiments confirm increased retention of FND-p-Man in sentinel lymph nodes of both healthy and B16 melanoma bearing animals. These results suggest that FND-p-Man has potential as a tracer for lymph node visualization in locoregional perioperative cancer diagnostics and as a tool for endoscopic/robotic fluorescence-guided surgery.

TI  - Application of Machine Learning to Investigation of Arcing on Geosynchronous Satellites
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASTRONAUTICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The harsh space environment at geosynchronous orbit (GEO) induces differential charging of spacecraft surfaces due to fluxes of high energy electrons onto and through them. Thus, satellite surfaces can charge thousands of volts with respect to each other whereas entire satellites can charge tens of thousands of volts negative of their surrounding space plasma. The ensuing electric fields can cause local discharges (arcs), endangering the normal operation of the satellite. Remote detection of spacecraft arcing is important for the satellite operators in order to properly respond to anomalies caused by spacecraft charging due to the space weather conditions. However, analysis of satellite data is laborious due to the amount of data generated. In this work, we explored the application of machine learning for analysis of GEO satellite arcing behavior using the radio frequency observations by the Arecibo 305 m telescope.

TI  - Cultural Keystone Places and the Chumash Landscapes of Kumqaq', Point Conception, California
T2  - AMERICAN ANTIQUITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The places in which people live and spend time are steeped in history, memory, and meaning from the intersection of daily life, environmental interactions, cultural practices, and ritual. Geologic features, plants, animals, and ecosystems merge with these cultural histories, forming critical parts of the landscape and areas of "high cultural salience," or "cultural keystone places" (CKPs). We identify Kumqaq' (Point Conception) and the surrounding area in California as a Chumash CKP. Ethnohistoric accounts and contemporary Chumash community members have long demonstrated the importance of Point Conception in Chumash worldview and identity, whereas biologists, ecologists, and conservationists reference the area's rich biodiversity and significance as a biogeographical boundary. Recent archaeological survey of the coastline surrounding Kumqaq' highlights these connections, identifying over 50 archaeological sites-including shell middens, villages, lithic scatters, and rock art-with at least 9,000 years of occupation. Ongoing collaborations among archaeologists, the Nature Conservancy, and Chumash community members help document and understand the long-term linkages between cultural and biological diversity and how integrating these perspectives can help ensure the resilience of this nexus of human and natural history in the Anthropocene future.

TI  - Detecting land use and land cover change on Barbuda before and after the Hurricane Irma with respect to potential land grabbing: A combined volunteered geographic information and multi sensor approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Two months after the hurricanes Irma and Maria hit Barbuda, the construction of a new international airport led to accusations of degrading the Codrington Lagoon National Park and contravening the conventions of the Ramsar Program. Scientists have analyzed the aftermath with respect to historical legacies, disaster capitalism, manifestation of climate injustices and green gentrification. The main objective of this study was to quantify and allocate land use and land cover change (LULCC) in Barbuda before and after the 2017 Hurricane disasters. Remote sensing data and volunteered geographic information were analyzed to detect the potential changes in natural LULC so that human activities and the emergence of artificial surfaces could be detected. Human-induced LULCC occurred at different sites on the island, with decreased activities in Codrington, but increased and continued activities at Coco and Palmetto Points. With an accuracy of 97.1 %, we estimated a total increase of vegetated areas by 6.56 km(2), and a simultaneous slight increase in roads and buildings with a total length of 249.67 km and a total area of 1.43 km(2). The vegetation condition itself depict a steady decrease since 2017. New hotspots of human activity emerged on the island in the Codrington Lagoon National Park.

TI  - A Quasi-Fideist Approach to QAnon
T2  - SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - QAnon, the view that Donald Trump is the last line of defense against a secret group of Satanic child traffickers, has garnered a great deal of traction and attention. A growing number of people describe themselves as having lost friends and relatives to QAnon, and many of us are unsure of how to interact with QAnon adherents. Intuitively, QAnon is a conspiracy theory. This might suggest that the right strategy is to debunk QAnon, because conspiracy theories are generally considered epistemically flawed views. However, this perspective may leave us ill-prepared to appreciate just how committed QAnon adherents are. To interact with them, we must find a way to take QAnon seriously, rather than dismissively. In this spirit, I argue for an alternative framework: we should treat QAnon as a religion. I first show that QAnon can reasonably be thought of as a religion. This opens the door to using tools from philosophy of religion to understand the epistemology of QAnon adherents. I use a quasi-fideist account of religious epistemology to explain why QAnon is a particularly recalcitrant worldview, and to develop an account of how one might 'convert' a QAnon adherent to a different worldview.

TI  - Is Elective Inguinal or External Iliac Irradiation During Neoadjuvant (Chemo)radiotherapy Necessary for Locally Advanced Lower Rectal Cancer With Anal Sphincter Invasion?
T2  - PRACTICAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To investigate the impact of excluding irradiation of inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs) and external iliac lymph nodes (ELNs) during neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy in a locally advanced lower rectal cancer (LALRC) with anal sphincter invasion.Methods and Materials: A total of 214 LALRC patients with anal sphincter invasion according to pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging who underwent neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy followed by surgery between September 2010 and May 2019 were enrolled. ILNs and ELNs were clinically negative pre-treatment and were excluded from irradiation. Failure rates and patterns of ILNs and ELNs and survival were analyzed. Nomograms for predicting ILN and ELN failure risk were also constructed.Results: The median follow-up was 53.3 months. The 3-year failure rates were 3.7% for ILNs and 3.3% for ELNs. Only 1 patient developed isolated ILN failure, and no patient experienced isolated ELN failure. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that lower edge of tumors invaded or located below the dentate line (odds ratio [OR], 7.513; P = .013), high histological grade (OR, 6.892; P = .017), and perineural invasion (OR, 7.111; P = .023) were significantly related to ILN failure. Both perineural invasion (OR, 8.923; P = .011) and high histological grade (OR, 8.129; P = .011) showed a strong correlation with ELN failure. The concordance index of nomograms for predicting ILN and ELN failure risk were 0.842 and 0.880, respectively. The 3-year local recurrence free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 94.6% (95% confi- dence interval [CI], 91.3%-97.9%), 77.7% (95% CI, 71.8%-83.6%), and 91.9% (95% CI, 87.8%-96.0%), respectively, for the whole cohort.Conclusions: Excluding ILNs and ELNs from irradiation was associated with an acceptably low failure risk for LALRC invading the anal sphincter. These findings help to refine existing guidelines for clinical target volume delineation of ILNs and ELNs during neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy in rectal cancer. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Regulation of the immune response to contact sensitizers by Nrf2
T2  - CONTACT DERMATITIS
M3  - Review
AB  - The skin is frequently exposed to chemical stress by organic chemicals or metal ions that can directly or indirectly challenge its immune components and may lead to T-cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. The disruption of the skin's homeostasis by exposure to contact sensitizers (CSs) can trigger an inflammatory immune response that results in eczema and allergic contact dermatitis. The recognition of these chemicals depends on the expression of pattern recognition receptors on sentinel skin cells, mainly the innate resident immune cells orchestrating the skin's immune response and involving both oxidative and inflammatory pathways. The main driver of these both pathways is the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, a major ubiquitous regulator of cellular oxidative and electrophilic stress, activated in various innate immune cells of the skin, including keratinocytes and epidermal Langerhans cells in the epidermis and dermal dendritic cells in the dermis. Nrf2 also shows a strong protective capacity by downregulating inflammatory pathways. In this review, the important role of Nrf2 in the regulation of the immune response to CSs will be discussed and highlighted.

TI  - Development of remote sensing algorithm for total phosphorus concentration in eutrophic lakes: Conventional or machine learning?
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Phosphorus is a limiting nutrient in freshwater ecosystems. Therefore, the estimation of total phosphorus (TP) concentration in eutrophic water using remote sensing technology is of great significance for lake environmental management. However, there is no TP remote sensing model for lake groups, and thus far, specific models have been used for specific lakes. To address this issue, this study proposes a framework for TP estimation. First, three algorithm development frameworks were compared and applied to the development of an algorithm for Lake Taihu, which has complex water environment characteristics and is a representative of eutrophic lakes. An Extremely Gradient Boosting (BST) machine learning framework was proposed for developing the Taihu TP algorithm. The machine learning algorithm could mine the relationship between FAI and TP in Lake Taihu, where the optical properties of the water body are dominated by phytoplankton. The algorithm exhibited robust performance with an R-2 value of 0.6 (RMSE = 0.07 mg/L, MRE = 43.33%). Then, a general TP algorithm (R-2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.06 mg/L, MRE = 34.13%) was developed using the proposed framework and tested in seven other lakes using synchronous image data. The algorithm accuracy was found to be affected by aquatic vegetation and enclosure aquaculture. Third, compared with field investigations in other studies on Lake Taihu, the Taihu TP algorithm showed good performance for long-term TP estimation. Therefore, the machine learning framework developed in this study has application potential in large-scale spatio-temporal TP estimation in eutrophic lakes.

TI  - Improved identification of cotton cultivated areas by applying instance-based transfer learning on the time series of MODIS NDVI
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotton is an important cash crop and strategic material in the world, as the main source of natural and renewable fiber for textiles. Accurate and timely cotton distribution maps are crucial for monitoring and managing cotton cultivation system. Remotely sensed data have been widely used in cropland mapping, whereas relatively less attention has been paid specifically to cotton mapping partly due to the difficulty in obtaining the training samples over large regions. To resolve this issue, this study introduced the instance-based transfer learning to identify the cotton cultivated areas using the remotely sensed images. The annual time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images was adopted as input features. The random forest (RF) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms integrated with the Transfer AdaBoost (TrAdaBoost) algorithm were adopted to generate the RF-based and LSTM-based TrAdaBoost approaches, respectively. The experiments were conducted in Arkansas State of the United States, where the cropland data layer (CDL) was available and utilized as a source of auxiliary data. The results showed that both the RF-based and LSTM-based TrAdaBoost performed better than the original RF and LSTM under the condition that the training samples in the target domain were limited. The advantages of transfer learning were much greater when the percentage of training samples from the source domain equals 80%. The two transfer learning approaches were then applied to identify the cotton cultivated areas in Uzbekistan. The cotton areas detected by MODIS images in 2018 were agreed well with the statistics at the sub-national level, with the R-2 values of 0.57 and 0.64, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of the RF-based and LSTM-based TrAdaBoost approaches in generating the cotton distribution maps when there are few samples in the target domain.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Oral Biopsies, Sample Types, and Detection Techniques Applied in Relation to Oral Cancer Detection
T2  - BIOTECH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Early identification of the stage of oral cancer development can lead to better treatment outcomes and avoid malignant transformation. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview that describes the development of standardized procedures for oral sample collection, characterization, and molecular risk assessment. This can help investigators to choose the appropriate sampling method and downstream analyses for different purposes. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Using both PubMed and Web of Science databases, four independent authors conducted a literature search between 15 and 21 June 2021. We used key search terms to broaden the search for studies. Non-conforming articles were removed using an EndNote-based and manual approach. Reviewers used a designed form to extract data. Results: This review included a total of 3574 records, after eliminating duplicate articles and excluding papers that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Finally, 202 articles were included in this review. We summarized the sampling methods, biopsy samples, and downstream analysis. The biopsy techniques were classified into tissue and liquid biopsy. The common sequential analysis of tissue biopsy includes histopathological examination such as H & E or IHC to identify various pathogenic features. Meanwhile, liquid samples such as saliva, blood, and urine are analyzed for the purpose of screening to detect mutations in cancer. Commonly used technologies are PCR, RT-PCR, high-throughput sequencing, and metabolomic analysis. Conclusions: Currently, tissue biopsies provide increased diagnostic value compared to liquid biopsy. However, the minimal invasiveness and convenience of liquid biopsy make it a suitable method for mass screening and eventual clinical adoption. The analysis of samples includes histological and molecular analysis. Metabolite analysis is rising but remains scarce.

We have also located the urban heat island (UHI) and calculated the UHI intensity. Support vector machine (SVM) for land cover classification and mono-window algorithm (MWA) for LST estimation were applied to Landsat images of years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020. Validation of classification and temperature was also done by various statistical parameters giving credible results. The findings reveal that in Chittagong, between 1990 and 2020, the urban area has raised by almost 12%, whereas vegetative areas have decreased by about 14%. With the rise of the urban area, the temperature has also shifted from 19.8 degrees C to 23.7 degrees C. Moreover, the UHI intensity has also raised from 1 degrees C to 2.3 degrees C, which is the indication of an unplanned and unsustainable urban development. Evidently, the whole city can turn into a UHI if proper steps are not taken immediately.

TI  - Land Cover Map for Multifunctional Landscapes of Taita Taveta County, Kenya, Based on Sentinel-1 Radar, Sentinel-2 Optical, and Topoclimatic Data
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Taita Taveta County (TTC) is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots in the highlands with some of the world's megafaunas in the lowlands. Detailed mapping of the terrestrial ecosystem of the whole county is of global significance for biodiversity conservation. Here, we present a land cover map for 2020 based on satellite observations, a machine learning algorithm, and a reference database for accuracy assessment. For the land cover map production processing chain, temporal metrics from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (such as median, quantiles, and interquartile range), vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 (normalized difference vegetation index, tasseled cap greenness, and tasseled cap wetness), topographic metrics (elevation, slope, and aspect), and mean annual rainfall were used as predictors in the gradient tree boost classification model. Reference sample points which were collected in the field were used to guide the collection of additional reference sample points based on high spatial resolution imagery for training and validation of the model. The accuracy of the land cover map and uncertainty of area estimates at 95% confidence interval were assessed using sample-based statistical inference. The land cover map has an overall accuracy of 81 +/- 2.3% and it is freely accessible for land use planners, conservation managers, and researchers.

TI  - Monitoring of Soil Salinization in the Keriya Oasis Based on Deep Learning with PALSAR-2 and Landsat-8 Datasets
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, soil salinization is one of the main forms of land degradation and desertification. Soil salinization not only seriously restricts the development of agriculture and the economy, but also poses a threat to the ecological environment. The main purpose of this study is to map soil salinity in Keriya Oasis, northwestern China using the PALSAR-2 fully polarized synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) L-band data and Landsat-8-OLI (OLI) optical data combined with deep learning (DL) methods. A field survey is conducted, and soil samples are collected from 20 April 2015 to 1 May 2015. To mine the hidden information in the PALSAR-2 data, multiple polarimetric decomposition methods are implemented, and a wide range of polarimetric parameters and synthetic aperture radar discriminators are derived. The radar vegetation index (RVI) is calculated using PALSAR-2 data, while the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and salinity index (SI) are calculated using OLI data. The random forest (RF)-integrated learning algorithm is used to select the optimal feature subset composed of eight polarimetric elements. The RF, support vector machine, and DL methods are used to extract different degrees of salinized soil. The results show that the OLI+PALSAR-2 image classification result of the DL classification was relatively good, having the highest overall accuracy of 91.86% and a kappa coefficient of 0.90. This method is helpful to understand and monitor the spatial distribution of soil salinity more effectively to achieve sustainable agricultural development and ecological stability.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Virus Co-Infection Cases Identified through ILI/SARI Sentinel Surveillance: A Pan-India Report
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - SARS-CoV-2/influenza virus co-infection studies have focused on hospitalized patients who usually had grave sequelae. Here, we report SARS-CoV-2/influenza virus co-infection cases from both community and hospital settings reported through integrated ILI/SARI (Influenza Like Illness/Severe Acute Respiratory Infection) sentinel surveillance established by the Indian Council of Medical Research. We describe the disease progression and outcomes in these cases. Out of 13,467 samples tested from 4 July 2021-31 January 2022, only 5 (0.04%) were of SARS-CoV-2/influenza virus co-infection from 3 different sites in distinct geographic regions. Of these, three patients with extremes of age required hospital admission, but none required ICU admission or mechanical ventilation. No mortality was reported. The other two co-infection cases from community settings were managed at home. This is the first report on SARS-CoV-2/Influenza virus co-infection from community as well as hospital settings in India and shows that influenza viruses are circulating in the community even during COVID-19. The results emphasize the need for continuous surveillance for multiple respiratory pathogens for effective public health management of ILI/SARI cases in line with the WHO (World Health Organization) recommendations.

TI  - Use of satellite indicators to monitor the proximity of agro-industrial crops to urban and rural educational establishments over large areas
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - The American continent is the largest producer of genetically modified crops worldwide, characterized by the massive use of pesticides and agrochemicals, of which numerous scientific studies and reports show risks to human health. The child-youth population living in these regions constitutes an age group with its own characteristics that make it more vulnerable to possible exposure to pesticide use. The use of satellite information on cloud platforms can facilitate the measurement and creation of exploratory indicators over large study areas to assess the degree of exposure in educational establishments. The objective of this research is to create and evaluate exploratory indicators of the proximity of intensive crops to educational establishments in central Argentina, using satellite spatial-temporal analysis methodologies. The study was conducted in the province of Cordoba (Argentina). A total of 2263 public and private sector educational institutions were selected, both urban and rural. Perimeter rings were created in each establishment, at different distances up to 2000 m from the periphery. Satellite data of active summer crops in the period 2016-2019 were calculated using the Google Earth Engine. Proximity indicators and crop coverage areas were created. Ninety-two per cent of the educational establishments analyzed have at least one crop field nearby within a radius of 2000 m. More than half of these have fields that are 500 m or less away. The peripheral occupation of crops in more than half of the educational establishments varies between 25 and 100% (in the entire ring). The establishments in dispersed rural areas would be the most exposed, with an average proximity to the first field of less than 180 m. Kindergartens and primary schools are closer and have a higher percentage of peripheral crops than the secondary and special education schools. Our research reveals a worrying panorama that combines the proximity of educational establishments to fields cultivated with GM crops; research that shows a higher degree of exposure to agricultural pesticide pollution and adverse health effects for this age group, and local regulations that allow their application close to educational establishments and cities where they carry out their main activities.

TI  - Groundwater Level Modeling with Machine Learning: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a vital source of freshwater, supporting the livelihood of over two billion people worldwide. The quantitative assessment of groundwater resources is critical for sustainable management of this strained resource, particularly as climate warming, population growth, and socioeconomic development further press the water resources. Rapid growth in the availability of a plethora of in-situ and remotely sensed data alongside advancements in data-driven methods and machine learning offer immense opportunities for an improved assessment of groundwater resources at the local to global levels. This systematic review documents the advancements in this field and evaluates the accuracy of various models, following the protocol developed by the Center for Evidence-Based Conservation. A total of 197 original peer-reviewed articles from 2010-2020 and from 28 countries that employ regression machine learning algorithms for groundwater monitoring or prediction are analyzed and their results are aggregated through a meta-analysis. Our analysis points to the capability of machine learning models to monitor/predict different characteristics of groundwater resources effectively and efficiently. Modeling the groundwater level is the most popular application of machine learning models, and the groundwater level in previous time steps is the most employed input data. The feed-forward artificial neural network is the most employed and accurate model, although the model performance does not exhibit a striking dependence on the model choice, but rather the information content of the input variables. Around 10-12 years of data are required to develop an acceptable machine learning model with a monthly temporal resolution. Finally, advances in machine and deep learning algorithms and computational advancements to merge them with physics-based models offer unprecedented opportunities to employ new information, e.g., InSAR data, for increased spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy of groundwater monitoring and prediction.

TI  - Kernel Ridge Regression Hybrid Method for Wheat Yield Prediction with Satellite-Derived Predictors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat dominates the Australian grain production market and accounts for 10-15% of the world's 100 million tonnes annual global wheat trade. Accurate wheat yield prediction is critical to satisfying local consumption and increasing exports regionally and globally to meet human food security. This paper incorporates remote satellite-based information in a wheat-growing region in South Australia to estimate the yield by integrating the kernel ridge regression (KRR) method coupled with complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and the grey wolf optimisation (GWO). The hybrid model, 'GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR,' employing an initial pool of 23 different satellite-based predictors, is seen to outperform all the benchmark models and all the feature selection (ant colony, atom search, and particle swarm optimisation) methods that are implemented using a set of carefully screened satellite variables and a feature decomposition or CEEMDAN approach. A suite of statistical metrics and infographics comparing the predicted and measured yield shows a model prediction error that can be reduced by ~20% by employing the proposed GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR model. With the metrics verifying the accuracy of simulations, we also show that it is possible to optimise the wheat yield to achieve agricultural profits by quantifying and including the effects of satellite variables on potential yield. With further improvements in the proposed methodology, the GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR model can be adopted in agricultural yield simulation that requires remote sensing data to establish the relationships between crop health, yield, and other productivity features to support precision agriculture.

TI  - Coastal Bathymetry Estimation from Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery: Comparing Deep Learning and Physics-Based Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to monitor the evolution of the coastal zone over time is an important factor in coastal knowledge, development, planning, risk mitigation, and overall coastal zone management. While traditional bathymetry surveys using echo-sounding techniques are expensive and time consuming, remote sensing tools have recently emerged as reliable and inexpensive data sources that can be used to estimate bathymetry using depth inversion models. Deep learning is a growing field of artificial intelligence that allows for the automatic construction of models from data and has been successfully used for various Earth observation and model inversion applications. In this work, we make use of publicly available Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and multiple bathymetry surveys to train a deep learning-based bathymetry estimation model. We explore for the first time two complementary approaches, based on color information but also wave kinematics, as inputs to the deep learning model. This offers the possibility to derive bathymetry not only in clear waters as previously done with deep learning models but also at common turbid coastal zones. We show competitive results with a state-of-the-art physical inversion method for satellite-derived bathymetry, Satellite to Shores (S2Shores), demonstrating a promising direction for worldwide applicability of deep learning models to inverse bathymetry from satellite imagery and a novel use of deep learning models in Earth observation.

TI  - Evaluating the Impact of the Influx of Syrian Refugees on Land Use/Land Cover Change in Irbid District, Northwestern Jordan
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The refugee movement creates urban and environmental pressures at their destination locations. This pressure often presents in the form of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) change. This study seeks to understand the impact of the Syrian refugees' influence on changing the urban and agricultural land dynamics in Irbid district in northwestern Jordan from 1985 to 2021, including the period of the civil war in Syria, using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images for the years 1985 and 2004, and the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) for the years 2013 and 2021. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was used to conduct all image processing and perform calculations and classification analysis using the Random Forest (RF) approach. The study of the classified images compared LULC before and during the Syrian crisis using images from 1985, 2004, 2013, and 2021. The results show that the urban area increased. In parallel, agricultural land increased. During the Syrian refugee crisis, agriculture became a significant livelihood activity for Syrian refugees. In summary, the movement of the refugees to Irbid district caused an increased demand for land and housing, which accelerated the building and construction process.

TI  - Prophetism in African Christianity and Biblical Traditions <i>A Study of Selected Works of J. Kwabena Asamoah-Gyadu and the Gospel of Luke</i>
T2  - PNEUMA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the portrayal of prophetism in the works of J. Kwabena Asamoah-Gyadu and compares it with the depiction of prophetism by the author of the gospel of Luke. Prophetism is a recurrent religious phenomenon in the Christian faith, particularly in Africa. Many scholars have undertaken seminal works on the subject, depending on the popularity and effect of the experience on contemporary Christianity. Many Christian denominations have suffered schism due to the erupting of prophetic ministry and have also benefitted from the phenomenon by negotiating for religious innovations that resonate with the worldview of members of the congregation. Often, the questions asked are whether these strands of prophetism are aligned with the biblical philosophy of prophetism and which genre of the Bible contemporary prophetism reflects. This study engages the narrative research method to discuss critically how Asamoah-Gyadu writes about prophetism in contemporary African Christianity and how the author of Luke portrays it and draws lessons for scholars, contemporary prophets, and Christian denominations in which the experience is not common.

TI  - Application of Multispectral Remote Sensing for Mapping Flood-Affected Zones in the Brumadinho Mining District (Minas Gerais, Brasil)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The collapse of the tailing "Dam B1" of the Corrego do Feijao Mine (Brumadinho, Brasil) that occurred in January 2019 is considered a large socio-environmental flood-disaster where numerous people died and the local flora and fauna were seriously affected, including agricultural areas of the Paraopeba River. This study aims to map the land area affected by the flood by using multispectral satellite images. To pursue this aim, Level-2A multispectral images from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 sensor were acquired before and after the tailing dam collapse in the period 2019-2021. The pre- and post-failure event analysis allowed us to evidence drastic changes in the vegetation rate, as well as in the nature of soils and surficial waters. The spectral signatures of the minerals composing the mining products allowed us to highlight the effective area covered by the flood and to investigate the evolution of land properties after the disaster. This technique opens the possibility for quickly classifying areas involved in floods, as well as obtaining significant information potentially useful for monitoring and planning the reclamation and restoration activities in similar cases worldwide, representing an additional tool for evaluating the environmental issues related to mining operations in large areas at high temporal resolution.

TI  - Recent land cover trends in the transition region of Tiaret, Algeria
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The transition zone between the Tellian and Saharan Atlas of the Tiaret region in Algeria is believed to be undergoing land degradation processes because of the increase in population needs, which causes a weakening of the biological potential and generates ecological and socio-economic imbalances. The lack of periodically acquired data on land cover is a major handicap to understand and diagnose the state of this transition zone. The goal of our work was to reconstruct past annual land cover changes in order to assess the best monitoring tools for the current and future situations. We used an annual series of Landsat images, acquired between 1984 and 2017 via the Google Earth Engine platform. We then classified relevant land covers by applying a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification algorithm to this multi-spectral data set. We also integrated other derived data such as vegetation, water and color indices, texture measures and TC transformationsin order to improve classification accuracy. The resulting 34 high-resolution land cover maps for the 1984-2017 period precisely characterize the recent dynamics and status of the transition zone of the Tellian and Saharan Atlas in the steppe region of Tiaret, and allow to explore land cover and climatic trends.

TI  - Spatial Difference between Temperature and Snowfall Driven Spring Phenology of Alpine Grassland Land Surface Based on Process-Based Modeling on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a sensitive indicator for climate change, the spring phenology of alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has received extensive concern over past decade. It has been demonstrated that temperature and precipitation/snowfall play an important role in driving the green-up in alpine grassland. However, the spatial differences in the temperature and snowfall driven mechanism of alpine grassland green-up onset are still not clear. This manuscript establishes a set of process-based models to investigate the climate variables driving spring phenology and their spatial differences. Specifically, using 500 m three-day composite MODIS NDVI datasets from 2000 to 2015, we first estimated the land surface green-up onset (LSGO) of alpine grassland in the QTP. Further, combining with daily air temperature and precipitation datasets from 2000 to 2015, we built up process-based models for LSGO in 86 meteorological stations in the QTP. The optimum models of the stations separating climate drivers spatially suggest that LSGO in grassland is: (1) controlled by temperature in the north, west and south of the QTP, where the precipitation during late winter and spring is less than 20 mm; (2) driven by the combination of temperature and precipitation in the middle, east and southwest regions with higher precipitation and (3) more likely controlled by both temperature and precipitation in snowfall dominant regions, since the snow-melting process has negative effects on the air temperature. The result dictates that snowfall and rainfall should be concerned separately in the improvement of the spring phenology model of the alpine grassland ecosystem.

TI  - Novel Hendra Virus Variant Detected by Sentinel Surveillance of Horses in Australia
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - We identified and isolated a novel Hendra virus (HeV) variant not detected by routine testing from a horse in Queensland, Australia, that died from acute illness with signs consistent with HeV infection. Using whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we determined the variant had similar to 83% nt identity with prototypic HeV. In silico and in vitro comparisons of the receptor-binding protein with prototypic HeV support that the human monoclonal antibody m102.4 used for postexposure prophylaxis and current equine vaccine will be effective against this variant. An updated quantitative PCR developed for routine surveillance resulted in subsequent case detection. Genetic sequence consistency with virus detected in grey-headed flying foxes suggests the variant circulates at least among this species. Studies are needed to determine infection kinetics, pathogenicity, reservoir-species associations, viral-host coevolution, and spillover dynamics for this virus. Surveillance and biosecurity practices should be updated to acknowledge HeV spillover risk across all regions frequented by flying foxes.

TI  - Land Vulnerability, Risk Zoning, and Ecological Protection in the Protection Forest of Pagaibamba (Peru)
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The protection of natural areas is considered an essential strategy for environment conservation. The objective of this work was to determine the level of vulnerability, considering the characterization and identification of the risk zones and ecological protection of the Pagaibamba Protection Forest (PPF, Peru). To determine the vulnerable areas, Landsat ETM satellite images, topographic, geological, ecological, and vegetation cover maps were used. Geological, physiographic, edaphological, vegetation cover, and land use potential characteristics, were analyzed. Three Ecological Protection and Risk Zones were identified, with the largest extension of the PPF corresponding to lands of very high and high vulnerability and high ecological risk, which include >85% of Protected Natural Areas (PNA) and 54% of the Buffer Zone (BZ). Moderate risk areas represent 30% of the Buffer Zone (BZ) and 13% of the PNA, and the low-risk areas (represent 15% of the BZ and 2% of the PNA). Biogeographically, the PPF was related to the Cloudy Montane Forests Ecoregion of the Andes Mountains, standing out the Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (TMCF) and the Tropical Lower Montane Cloud Forest (TLMCF). These forests are a global conservation priority due to their great biodiversity, high level of endemicity of flora and fauna, and the crucial hydrological function they fulfill.

TI  - Flood Hazard and Risk Mapping by Applying an Explainable Machine Learning Framework Using Satellite Imagery and GIS Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the most destructive natural phenomena that happen worldwide, leading to the damage of property and infrastructure or even the loss of lives. The escalation in the intensity and number of flooding events as a result of the combination of climate change and anthropogenic factors motivates the need to adopt real-time solutions for mapping flood hazards and risks. In this study, a methodological framework is proposed that enables the assessment of flood hazard and risk levels of severity dynamically by fusing optical remote sensing (Sentinel-1) and GIS-based data from the region of the Trieste, Monfalcone and Muggia Municipalities. Explainable machine learning techniques were utilised, aiming to interpret the results for the assessment of flood hazard. The flood inventory was randomly divided into 70%, used for training, and 30%, employed for testing. Various combinations of the models were evaluated for the assessment of flood hazard. The results revealed that the Random Forest model achieved the highest F1-score (approx. 0.99), among others utilised for generating flood hazard maps. Furthermore, the estimation of the flood risk was achieved by a combination of a rule-based approach to estimate the exposure and vulnerability with the dynamic assessment of flood hazard.

TI  - Monitoring of crop growth stages using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data br
T2  - Agriculture and Natural Resources
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance of the work: Given the ever-increasing scientific and practical interest in the implementation of satellite data from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors in agriculture, it may be useful for successful crop monitoring to investigate the effects on the total backscatter signal of the biophysical characteristics of the vegetation, such as crop density, stem height and leaf arrangement.Objectives: To monitor rice, maize, cassava and sugarcane for physical growth characteristics to develop an efficient production process based on capability evaluation of Sentinel-1 products using the mean change of backscatter of polarization, such as VV, VH, VV/VH and the radar vegetation index (RVI).Materials & Methods: Sigma nought values were customized from the start of cultivation until harvest due to their sensitivity to soil moisture, leaf canopy and stem elongation. Time-series data were used from Sentinel-1 between January 2019 and August 2020. The level-1 ground range detection product resolutions were 20 m x 22 m (range by azimuth) with 10 m x 10 m pixel spacing. Sampling (100 points per crop) was used to establish the research area field boundary. Coverage was in Nakhon Ratchasima (15 degrees N,102 degrees E) and Khonkaen (16 degrees N,102 degrees E) provinces, Thailand.Results: Statistical analysis using the t test identified the same crop growth stages of cassava, sugarcane and maize using VH polarization. The VV polarization was optimized for rice and cassava, while VV/VH was suitable for rice and maize. RVI could be applied to rice, maize and sugarcane. Finally, VV/VH for rice and VV/VH and RVI for maize could identify the different growth stages, while cassava and sugarcane had no identifiable polarization.Main finding: The average sigma nought (in decibels) values of polarization from SAR sensors are appropriate to monitor and detect the physical growth of some economic crops in Thailand.

TI  - Data Fusion in Agriculture: Resolving Ambiguities and Closing Data Gaps
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Acquiring useful data from agricultural areas has always been somewhat of a challenge, as these are often expansive, remote, and vulnerable to weather events. Despite these challenges, as technologies evolve and prices drop, a surge of new data are being collected. Although a wealth of data are being collected at different scales (i.e., proximal, aerial, satellite, ancillary data), this has been geographically unequal, causing certain areas to be virtually devoid of useful data to help face their specific challenges. However, even in areas with available resources and good infrastructure, data and knowledge gaps are still prevalent, because agricultural environments are mostly uncontrolled and there are vast numbers of factors that need to be taken into account and properly measured for a full characterization of a given area. As a result, data from a single sensor type are frequently unable to provide unambiguous answers, even with very effective algorithms, and even if the problem at hand is well defined and limited in scope. Fusing the information contained in different sensors and in data from different types is one possible solution that has been explored for some decades. The idea behind data fusion involves exploring complementarities and synergies of different kinds of data in order to extract more reliable and useful information about the areas being analyzed. While some success has been achieved, there are still many challenges that prevent a more widespread adoption of this type of approach. This is particularly true for the highly complex environments found in agricultural areas. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview on the data fusion applied to agricultural problems; we present the main successes, highlight the main challenges that remain, and suggest possible directions for future research.

TI  - NDVI Threshold-Based Urban Green Space Mapping from Sentinel-2A at the Local Governmental Area (LGA) Level of Victoria, Australia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining accurate, precise and timely spatial information on the distribution and dynamics of urban green space is crucial in understanding livability of the cities and urban dwellers. Inspired from the importance of spatial information in planning urban lives, and availability of state-of-the-art remote sensing data and technologies in open access forms, in this work, we develop a simple three-level hierarchical mapping of urban green space with multiple usability to various stakeholders. We utilize the established Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) threshold on Sentinel-2A Earth Observation image data to classify the urban vegetation of each Victorian Local Government Area (LGA). Firstly, we categorize each LGA region into two broad classes as vegetation and non-vegetation; secondly, we further categorize the vegetation regions of each LGA into two subclasses as shrub (including grassland) and trees; thirdly, for both shrub and trees classes, we further classify them as stressed and healthy. We not only map the urban vegetation in hierarchy but also develop Urban Green Space Index (UGSI) and Per Capita Green Space (PCGS) for the Victorian Local Government Areas (LGAs) to provide insights on the association of demography with urban green infrastructure using urban spatial analytics. To show the efficacy of the applied method, we evaluate our results using a Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform across different NDVI threshold ranges. The evaluation result shows that our method produces excellent performance metrics such as mean precision, recall, f-score and accuracy. In addition to this, we also prepare a recent Sentinel-2A dataset and derived products of urban green space coverage of the Victorian LGAs that are useful for multiple stakeholders ranging from bushfire modellers to biodiversity conservationists in contributing to sustainable and resilient urban lives.

TI  - Indocyanine-based near-infrared lymphography for real-time detection of lymphatics in a cat with multiple mast cell tumours
T2  - JOURNAL OF FELINE MEDICINE AND SURGERY OPEN REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Case summary An 11-year-old female domestic shorthair cat was presented with cutaneous mast cell tumours (MCTs) localised at the right temporal region, the left buccal region and on the third digit of the right thoracic limb. Staging was negative and locoregional lymph nodes appeared normal, based on clinical findings. During surgery, real-time indocyanine green (ICG)-based lymphography was performed to detect the cutaneous draining pattern of all the primary MCTs. ICG was injected intracutaneously in four quadrants around each tumour, and a clear lymphogram was visible shortly after injection. Using near-infrared lymphography (NIR-L) for guidance, all lymphadenectomies were performed in 12mins or less, with a maximal incision length of 3.5cm. The smallest resected node was 0.9cm in diameter. All MCTs were classified as low-grade cutaneous MCT. All four ICG-positive lymph nodes were considered premetastatic or metastatic. The only ICG-negative resected node was also negative for tumour cells. No complications related to NIR-L were recorded.Relevance and novel information This is the first description of NIR-L in a cat with MCT. Application was straightforward and ICG enrichment only occurred in the metastatic nodes, suggesting correct identification of lymphatic draining patterns. Of note, as previously described in dogs, we did detect nodal metastasis, despite low-grade primary tumours. The clinical relevance should be evaluated in future studies.

TI  - Satellite based impact assessment of temperature and rainfall variability on drought indices in Southern Pakistan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of temperature and rainfall on drought indices were derived from satellites by using remote sensing techniques over the southern areas of Pakistan from 2000 to 2018. Rainfall from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and temperature from Climate Prediction Center (CPC) are the best performing satellite and observational gridded datasets for studying drought in the region. These two datasets were used to calculate drought indices i.e. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), and Rainfall Deciles (DI) on a 6-month time scale characterized by the concept of the hydrological year starting from October to March and April to September. Five drought years (2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2018) were identified based on the consensus of three drought indices namely SPI, RDI, and DI. The results of these indices are compared with MODIS products of 16 days Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and 8 days Land Surface Temperature (LST) composites to evaluate the impact of rainfall and temperature. Results show that the Sindh province remains moderately dry from October-March, while the failure of monsoon further intensifies the situation of droughts as observed in 2004. Winter or early spring rainfalls turn out beneficial for Sindh as they reduce the severity of emerging drought. The meteorological drought of October-March may lead to agricultural drought in April-September due to the deficit of summer monsoon having a direct impact on vegetation. Similarly, Balochistan province faces moderate to severe drought conditions due to increased evapotranspiration losses from the surface. RDI based on potential evapotranspiration is more suitable for studying drought as compared to SPI. In addition, EVI is categorized as a more suitable index to monitor drought conditions in Sindh.

TI  - An Application of Improved MODIS-Based Potential Evapotranspiration Estimates in a Humid Tropic Brantas Watershed-Implications for Agricultural Water Management
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The reliance on native MODIS-16 PET potential evapotranspiration (PET) in scarce-data-driven areas is growing in support among ecohydrological studies, yet information about its performance is limited or unknown as validation studies are mostly concentrated in developed countries. This study aimed to assess its performance at the monthly level using four ground measurements in a tropical watershed system with complex topography, applying a machine learning artificial neural network (ANN) to improve the estimates, and using the ANN-adjusted MODIS-16 PET to characterize the spatio-temporal patterns of PET in the Brantas watershed, as well as to understand the monthly patterns of water deficiency in areas under eight different vegetation covers. The results showed that the native MODIS-16 PET experienced overestimation with an RMSE of 37-66 mm/month and NRSME of up to 33%. The performance decreased in drier periods. The ANN-based adjustment using only one variable showed improved estimates with a reduction of RSME to only 14 mm and lower than 10% NRMSE. Sari-temporal patterns of PET in the Brantas watershed showed that the PET characteristics were not uniform. The southern part of the Brantas watershed has areas with relatively lower PET that are, thus, more prone to water deficiency. Complex topography and climate gradients within the watershed apparently became the multi-controllers of PET variations. The difference in vegetation cover also influenced the magnitudes of water deficiency.

TI  - Politics and Pentecostalism in Australia <i>Prime Minister Morrison as the "Miracle Man"</i>
T2  - PNEUMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Pentecostalism and politics are, for better or worse, no strangers. In 2018, Scott Morrison became the first pen tecostal prime minister in the history of Australia and, possibly, in the English-speaking world. He then led the Liberal Party to a resounding election victory in 2019. As a result, Morrison was dubbed the "Miracle Man" after his acceptance speech referred to divine intervention in the electoral results. Since then, there has been regular, negative speculation on links between Morrison's pentecostal faith and policy positions. This article provides a counterposition that several elements of the pentecostal worldview have the potential for positive impact in politics and may explain aspects of Morrison's electoral success. We argue that Morrison effectively leveraged his pentecostal experience and convictions to advantage through strong leadership, practical pragmatism, marketing acumen, and a narrative of hope. Here, in a morass of indecision and "policy-free" political elites, was someone who believed in something.

T2  - REVISTA UNIVERSIDAD Y SOCIEDAD
M3  - Article
AB  - The active penetration of Eastern poetry in Europe began in the XVIII century, although works such as the German translation of Saadi's Bustan were known then. For two centuries, the West has been getting acquainted with the masterpieces of Rudaki, Nizami, Firdowsi, Khayyam, Hafiz and other Eastern poets; the Russian cultural environment was no exception. Thus, the Eastern philosophical and religious systems became at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries the basis for the works of such Russian poets as I. Bunin, V. Bryusov, V. Khlebnikov, K. Balmont and many others. Each one took various facets of Eastern poetry, and with their own styles, developed original means of expression, which enriched the national poetic environment. Taking this into consideration, the aim of this article is to analyze the reflection of the worldview of the classics of Eastern poetry in the work of Russian poets.

TI  - Data-Driven Artificial Intelligence Model of Meteorological Elements Influence on Vegetation Coverage in North China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on remote sensing data of vegetation coverage, observation data of basic meteorological elements, and support vector machine (SVM) method, this study develops an analysis model of meteorological elements influence on vegetation coverage (MEVC). The variations for the vegetation coverage changes are identified utilizing five meteorological elements (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, sunshine hour, and ground temperature) in the SVM model. The performance of the SVM model is also evaluated on simulating vegetation coverage anomaly change by comparing with statistical model multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least squares (PLS)-based models. The symbol agreement rates (SAR) of simulations produced by MLR, PLS, and SVM models are 55%, 57%, and 66%, respectively. The SVM model shows obviously better performance than PLS and MLR models in simulating meteorological elements-related interannual variation of vegetation coverage in North China. Therefore, the introduction of the intelligent analysis method in term of SVM in model development has certain advantages in studying the internal impact of meteorological elements on regional vegetation coverage. It can also be further applied to predict the future vegetation anomaly change.

TI  - Near-infrared fluorescence imaging with intraoperative administration of indocyanine green for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: Is it a useful weapon for pelvic lymph node dissection?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green has emerging applications in urologic surgery. This technology is strongly used in robotic surgery for several ablative and reconstructive procedures. On the contrary, it is not used at all in the urological laparoscopic surgery. To date, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection represents the most accurate and reliable staging procedure for the detection of lymph node invasion in prostate cancer and bladder cancer. However, it is not devoid of complications. In this field, indocyanine green fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node identification is an emerging technique, as accurate staging of urologic cancer could be enhanced by an intraoperative lymphatic mapping. Our goal was to show a high spatial resolution, real-time intraoperative imaging technique to recognize the main lymphatic drainage networks, avoiding at same time lymphatic vessel damage. Furthermore, the use of such an imaging system represents an absolute novelty in the field of urological laparoscopy.

TI  - Pathologic Evaluation of Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer: Contemporary Approaches and Clinical Implications.
T2  - Surgical pathology clinics
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - The presence of detected metastases in locoregional lymph nodes of women with breast cancer is an important prognostic variable for cancer staging, prognosis, and treatment planning. Systematic and standardized lymph node evaluation with gross and microscopic protocols designed to detect all macrometastases larger than 2.0 mm is the appropriate objective based on clinical outcomes evidence. Pathologists will detect smaller micrometastases and isolated tumor cell clusters (ITCs) by random chance but will also leave similar sized metastases undetected in paraffin blocks. Although these smaller metastases have prognostic significance, they are not predictive of recurrence for chemotherapy naive patients. Thus, protocols to reliably detect metastases smaller than 2.0 mm are not required or recommended by guidelines. Women with T1-T2 breast cancer with a clinically negative axilla but with 1 or 2 pathologically positive sentinel nodes now have alternative options including observation and axillary irradiation and do not require completion axillary dissection.

TI  - The Political Theology of Binationalism: Judah Leib Magnes and Martin Buber
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECUMENICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Judah Leib Magnes and Martin Buber collaborated to promote the binational cause in Palestine, driven by their religious worldviews. Buber was committed to a propheticmoral solution to the conflict in Palestine, which coincided with his understanding of Zionism as the political realization of the covenant among God, the land, and the people. He perceived the "Arab Question" as the moral acid test of Zionism, yet there was an apparent lack of conviction in his relation to the binational cause. For Magnes, the binational program was a political-theological platform. It was the outcome of an American belief in the power of political structures and covenants to enforce political equality and the centrality of Reform ethical monotheism in his religious worldview.

TI  - Uncovering Vegetation Changes in the Urban-Rural Interface through Semi-Automatic Methods
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are considered by Portuguese civil protection as one of the most serious natural disasters due to their frequency and extent. To address the problem, the Fire Forest Defense System establishes the implementation of fuel management bands to aid firefighting. The aim of this study was to develop a model capable of identifying vegetation removal in the urban-rural interface defined by law for fuel management actions. The model uses normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) of Sentinel-2 images time series and is based on the Welch t-test to find statistically significant differences between (i) the value of the NDVI in the pixel; (ii) the mean of the NDVI in the pixels of the same land cover type in a radius of 500 m; and (iii) their difference. The model identifies a change when the t-test points for a significant difference of the NDVI value in the 'pixel' as comparted to the 'difference' but not the 'mean'. We use a moving window limited to 60 days before and after the analysed date to reduce the phenological variations of vegetation. The model was applied in five municipalities of Portugal and the results are promising to identify the places where the management of fuel bands was not carried out. This indicates which model could be used to assist in the verification of the annual management of the fuel bands defined in the law.

TI  - The Potential of Using Radarsat-2 Satellite Image for Modeling and Mapping Wheat Yield in a Semiarid Environment
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of cereal productions, mainly through yield estimations, has played an important role in providing reliable information to decision makers in order to ensure the proper management of agricultural markets. In this context, remote sensing, which allows the coverage of large areas, is an important source of information that complements those obtained by other methods. In this study, we aim to estimate the wheat yield at an early growth stage (spring season) using only one Radarsat-2 (RS-2) polarimetric image. We propose an empirical statistical relationship between the yield measured in situ and polarimetric parameters extracted from the RS-2 image. The RS-2 image was acquired at the flowering stage as it is proved to be the most appropriate moment for yield prediction. We selected the region of Boussalem in the northwest of Tunisia as the study area. For experimental validation, the yield was determined in situ at the end of the wheat season. Results showed that the polarization ratios are more correlated than the polarimetric parameters with the grain yield with a significant correlation of the HH/VV ratio (r = 0.76) and the HV/VV ratio (r = -0.75), while the most correlated polarimetric parameter was Alpha (r = -0.51). Finally, the multiple regression has led to the development of a three-variable model (HH/VV, HV/HH, and alpha) as the best predictor of the wheat grain yields. Validation results revealed a great potential with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.58 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.89 t/ha.

TI  - Evaluating alloy-718 machinability values modelling by using response surface methodology
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of the manufacturing industry, machining parameters and material processing efficiency are important due to cost, sustainability, and other parameters, which are determining factors for usage width, material choice, and production rate. Machinability and optimization are among the scientists' and industry workers' timely objectives, guiding the manufacturing industries. Thus, the study and analysis of parameters such as surface roughness, tool wear, and force application in superalloy machining would be beneficial in various fields of the manufacturing industry. In this work, RSM (surface response method) modelling and analysis of relationship Fx, Fy, Fz forces between surface roughness of Inconel-718 material, which is a very unique alloy in terms of corrosion resistance, high-temperature elevation, and fatigue values, is examined. From this work, it was found that an experimental design was prepared using the Taguchi method, and the required number of measurements and parameter values were determined with a small number of experiments. Then, the most ideal values were determined using the Response Surface Methodology and ANOVA method to determine the best parameter levels after the surface roughness and cutting forces measurements.

TI  - Rapeseed Morpho-Physio-Biochemical Responses to Drought Stress Induced by PEG-6000
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapeseed is a valuable oil crop due to its high nutritious value and ample oil content. The current study provides a comparative analysis of 24 cultivars to better understand the performance and predict the adaptative mechanisms of drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive cultivars based on germination and morphophysiological traits during the early seedling stage using PEG-6000 simulated drought conditions. JYZ 158 and FY 520 (tolerant cultivars) and YG 2009 and NZ 1838 (sensitive cultivars) were selected to further explore the role of osmolytes and enzymatic activity in improving drought tolerance. This investigation illustrated that drought stress negatively influenced all studied cultivars; however, the degree of influence was different for each cultivar, suggesting their different potential for drought tolerance. Moreover, enzymatic and osmoregulatory mechanisms were highly efficient in tolerant cultivars compared to sensitive cultivars. Additionally, tolerant cultivars showed higher chlorophyll and lower malondialdehyde (MDA) contents versus sensitive cultivars under drought stress conditions. Higher drought tolerance coincided with higher enzymatic activity and osmolyte content. This work showed that JYZ 158 and FY 520 cultivars had higher drought tolerance, and might be a significant germplasm resource for breeding programs developing drought-tolerant rapeseed.

T2  - ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Carolyn Merchant's book The Death of Nature, first published in 1980, has been seminal for feminist research on the relationships between gender, knowledge production, and human-nature relations. In her historical reconstruction of the transition from the organic to a mechanical worldview during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, she points to the coincidence of colonialism, resource exploitation and the establishment of the scientific methods for understanding nature's laws. Merchant's first book launched a productive debate among historians of science and feminist researchers on epistemology. With its thoughtprovoking approaches the book is still inspiring critical thinking about social relationships to nature. The article gives an overview on the academic persona of Carolyn Merchant and the vivid discussions The Death of Nature has sparked.

TI  - A Methodological Approach to Use Contextual Factors for Epidemiological Studies on Chronic Exposure to Air Pollution and COVID-19 in Italy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The large availability of both air pollution and COVID-19 data, and the simplicity to make geographical correlations between them, led to a proliferation of ecological studies relating the levels of pollution in administrative areas to COVID-19 incidence, mortality or lethality rates. However, the major drawback of these studies is the ecological fallacy that can lead to spurious associations. In this frame, an increasing concern has been addressed to clarify the possible role of contextual variables such as municipalities' characteristics (including urban, rural, semi-rural settings), those of the resident communities, the network of social relations, the mobility of people, and the responsiveness of the National Health Service (NHS), to better clarify the dynamics of the phenomenon. The objective of this paper is to identify and collect the municipalities' and community contextual factors and to synthesize their information content to produce suitable indicators in national environmental epidemiological studies, with specific emphasis on assessing the possible role of air pollution on the incidence and severity of the COVID-19 disease. A first step was to synthesize the content of spatial information, available at the municipal level, in a smaller set of "summary indexes" that can be more easily viewed and analyzed. For the 7903 Italian municipalities (1 January 2020-ISTAT), 44 variables were identified, collected, and grouped into five information dimensions a priori defined: (i) geographic characteristics of the municipality, (ii) demographic and anthropogenic characteristics, (iii) mobility, (iv) socio-economic-health area, and (v) healthcare offer (source: ISTAT, EUROSTAT or Ministry of Health, and further ad hoc elaborations (e.g., OpenStreetMaps)). Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out for the five identified dimensions, with the aim of reducing the large number of initial variables into a smaller number of components, limiting as much as possible the loss of information content (variability). We also included in the analysis PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 population weighted exposure (PWE) values obtained using a four-stage approach based on the machine learning method, "random forest", which uses space-time predictors, satellite data, and air quality monitoring data estimated at the national level. Overall, the PCA made it possible to extract twelve components: three for the territorial characteristics dimension of the municipality (variance explained 72%), two for the demographic and anthropogenic characteristics dimension (variance explained 62%), three for the mobility dimension (variance explained 83%), two for the socio-economic-health sector (variance explained 58%) and two for the health offer dimension (variance explained 72%). All the components of the different dimensions are only marginally correlated with each other, demonstrating their potential ability to grasp different aspects of the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 pathology. This work provides a national repository of contextual variables at the municipality level collapsed into twelve informative factors suitable to be used in studies on the association between chronic exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 pathology, as well as for investigations on the role of air pollution on the health of the Italian population.

TI  - Improved <i>k</i>-NN Mapping of Forest Attributes in Northern Canada Using Spaceborne L-Band SAR, Multispectral and LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite forest inventories are the only feasible way to map Canada's vast, remote forest regions, such as those in the Northwest Territories (NWT). A method used to create such inventories is the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm, which spatially extends information from forest inventory (FI) plots to the entire forest land base using wall-to-wall features typically derived from Landsat data. However, the benefits of integrating L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, strongly correlated to forest biomass, have not been assessed for Canadian northern boreal forests. Here we describe an optimized multivariate k-NN implementation of a 151,700 km(2) area in southern NWT that included ca. 2007 Landsat and dual-polarized Phased Array type L-band SAR (PALSAR) data on board the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). Five forest attributes were mapped at 30 m cells: stand height, crown closure, stand/total volume and aboveground biomass (AGB). We assessed accuracy gains compared to Landsat-based maps. To circumvent the scarcity of FI plots, we used 3600 footprints from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) as surrogate FI plots, where forest attributes were estimated using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) metrics as predictors. After optimization, k-NN predicted forest attribute values for each pixel as the average of the 4 nearest (k = 4) surrogate FI plots within the Euclidian space of 9 best features (selected among 6 PALSAR, 10 Landsat, and 6 environmental features). Accuracy comparisons were based on 31 National Forest Inventory ground plots and over 1 million airborne LiDAR plots. Maps that included PALSAR HV backscatter resulted in forest attribute predictions with higher goodness of fit (adj. R-2), lower percent mean error (ME%), and percent root mean square error (RMSE%), and lower underestimation for larger attribute values. Predictions were most accurate for conifer stand height (RMSE% = 32.1%, adj. R-2 = 0.58) and AGB (RMSE% = 47.8%, adj. R-2 = 0.74), which is much more abundant in the area than mixedwood or broadleaf. Our study demonstrates that optimizing k-NN parameters and feature space, including PALSAR, Landsat, and environmental variables, is a viable approach for inventory mapping of the northern boreal forest regions of Canada.

TI  - The Kantian account of mechanical explanation of natural ends in eighteenth and nineteenth century biology
T2  - HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF THE LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The rise of the mechanistic worldview in the seventeenth century had a major impact on views of biological generation. Many seventeenth century naturalists rejected the old animist thesis. However, the alternative view of gradual mechanistic formation in embryology didn't convince either. How to articulate the peculiarity of life? Researchers in the seventeenth century proposed both "animist" and mechanistic theories of life. In the eighteenth century again a controversy in biology arose regarding the explanation of generation. Some adhered to the view that life is a physical property of matter (e.g. Buffon), others saw living entities as the result of the development of pre-existing germs (e.g. Bonnet). Naturalists, lacked a convincing account that could guide their research. In interaction with leading naturalists of his time Immanuel Kant articulated an approach to explaining generation. Kant's account, delineated in his Kritik der Urteilskraft (Critique of the power of judgment) (1790), is a combination of Newtonian non-reductionist mechanism in explanation, and a concept of natural end comparable to Stahl's formal conception of organic bodies. It consists of two claims: a) in biology only mechanical explanation is explanatory, and b) living entities contain some original organisation, which is mechanically unexplainable. In the nineteenth century this approach influenced naturalists as Muller, Virchow, and Von Baer, in their physiological research. Dissatisfied with a sheer mechanistic or, on the other hand, a sheer teleological approach, they appreciated the Kantian account of mechanical explanation of natural ends. In Germany, in the second halve of the nineteenth century, Ernst Haeckel reopened the debate about abiogenesis, which still continuous.

TI  - WEST NILE VIRUS AND EASTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS HIGH PROBABILITY HABITAT IDENTIFICATION FOR THE SELECTION OF SENTINEL CHICKEN SURVEILLANCE SITES IN FLORIDA
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To mitigate the effects of West Nile virus (WNV) and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), the state of Florida conducts a serosurveillance program that uses sentinel chickens operated by mosquito control programs at numerous locations throughout the state. Coop locations were initially established to detect St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), and coop placement was determined based on the location of human SLEV infections that occurred between 1959 and 1977. Since the introduction of WNV into Florida in 2001, WNV has surpassed SLEV as the primary arbovirus in Florida. Identifying high probability locations for WNV and EEEV transmission and relocating coops to areas of higher arbovirus activity would improve the sensitivity of the sentinel chicken surveillance program. Using 2 existing models, this study conducted an overlay analysis to identify areas with high probability habitats for both WNV and EEEV activity. This analysis identified approximately 7,800 km2 (about 4.5% of the state) as high probability habitat for supporting both WNV and EEEV transmission. Mosquito control programs can use the map resulting from this analysis to improve their sentinel chicken surveillance programs, increase the probability of virus detection, reduce operational costs, and allow for a faster, targeted response to virus detection.

TI  - Quantification of Off-Channel Inundated Habitat for Pacific Chinook Salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>) along the Sacramento River, California, Using Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Off-channel areas are one of the most impacted aquatic habitats by humans globally, as extensive agricultural and urban development has limited them to roughly 10% of historical extent. This is also true for California's Sacramento River Valley, where historically frequent widespread inundation has been reduced to a few off-channel water bodies along the mid-Sacramento River. This remaining shallow-water habitat provides crucial ecological benefits to multiple avian and fish species, but especially to floodplain-adapted species such as Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Characterizing spatiotemporal off-channel dynamics, including inundation extent and residence time, is fundamental to better understanding the intrinsic value of such habitats and their potential to support recovery actions. Remote sensing techniques have been increasingly used to map surface water at regional and local scales, with improved resolutions. As such, this study maps off-channel inundation areas and describes their temporal dynamics by analyzing pixel-based time- series of multiple water indices, modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI) and the Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI), generated from LandSat-8 and Sentinel-2 data between 2013-2021. Quantified off-channel area was similar with each water index and method used, but improved performance was associated with Sentinel-2 products and AWEI index to identify wetted areas under lower mainstem discharges. Results indicate an uneven distribution of off-channel habitat in the study area, with limited inundated areas in upstream reaches (<16% of total off-channel area for greater flows). In addition, much less habitat exists for flows under 400 m(3)/s, an important migration cue for endangered winter-run Chinook salmon, limiting juvenile access to areas with enhanced rearing conditions. Off-channel habitat residence times averaged between 7 and 16 days, primarily defined by the rate of receding flows, with rapid flow recession providing marginal off-channel habitat. This study shows reasonable performance of moderate resolution LandSat-8 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery to characterize shallow-water inundated habitat in higher-order rivers, and as a method to inform restoration and native fish recovery efforts.

TI  - Modelling river flow in cold and ungauged regions: a review of the purposes, methods, and challenges
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - River flow forecasting models assist in the understanding, predicting, monitoring, and managing of issues related to surface-water resources, such as water quality deterioration and flooding, or developing adaptation strategies to cope with climate change and increasing water demand. This review presents an overview of the current research status and progress in river-flow forecasting, focusing on cold climates and ungauged locations. River-flow forecasting in cold regions represents a challenge because the natural processes that occur within catchments vary greatly both seasonally and annually. This variability, which highly depends on climatic and topo-geomorphological characteristics within a basin, translates into increased model uncertainty and a substantial limitation when attempting to forecast river flow in cold regions, which are often poorly gauged or ungauged. To address this limitation, the "Predictions in Ungauged Basins" initiative offers a variety of studies to improve forecasting performance by adopting regionalization, spatial calibration, interpolation, and regression approaches. Process-based models demonstrate significant improvement by including remote-sensing data to replicate and derive complex hydrological processes. Empirical models, which utilize observed data to formulate a graphical solution, unlike mathematical models that require formulating the relationships between the processes, are also implemented with the most recent developments in machine learning, showing exceptional forecasting accuracy. Although process-based models provide a wide understanding of a watershed hydrology, data are often unavailable, expensive, and time-consuming to collect. They also generate numerous calibration parameters, resulting in complex and computationally demanding methods to operate. River-flow forecasting using empirical models reduces the number of calibration parameters but could produce biased results when insufficient variables are available to explain the physical mechanisms of a watershed's hydrology. Moreover, empirical models could be potentially sensitive to calibration and validation dataset selection. In this review, Canadian studies are primarily selected to highlight some of the efforts that may be necessary in other similar cold and ungauged regions, including: (i) coping with limited data availability through regionalization methods; (ii) providing user-friendly interfaces; (iii) advancing model structure; (iv) developing a universal method for transferring regionalization parameters; (v) standardizing calibration and validation dataset selection; (vi) integrating process-based and empirical models.

TI  - Calibration and Validation of SWAT Model by Using Hydrological Remote Sensing Observables in the Lake Chad Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Model calibration and validation are challenging in poorly gauged basins. We developed and applied a new approach to calibrate hydrological models using distributed geospatial remote sensing data. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was calibrated using only twelve months of remote sensing data on actual evapotranspiration (ETa) geospatially distributed in the 37 sub-basins of the Lake Chad Basin in Africa. Global sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify influential model parameters by applying the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Algorithm-version 2 (SUFI-2), included in the SWAT-Calibration and Uncertainty Program (SWAT-CUP). This procedure is designed to deal with spatially variable parameters and estimates either multiplicative or additive corrections applicable to the entire model domain, which limits the number of unknowns while preserving spatial variability. The sensitivity analysis led us to identify fifteen influential parameters, which were selected for calibration. The optimized parameters gave the best model performance on the basis of the high Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and determination coefficient (R-2). Four sets of remote sensing ETa data products were applied in model calibration, i.e., ETMonitor, GLEAM, SSEBop, and WaPOR. Overall, the new approach of using remote sensing ETa for a limited period of time was robust and gave a very good performance, with R-2 > 0.9, NSE > 0.8, and KGE > 0.75 applying to the SWAT ETa vs. the ETMonitor ETa and GLEAM ETa. The ETMonitor ETa was finally adopted for further model applications. The calibrated SWAT model was then validated during 2010-2015 against remote sensing data on total water storage change (TWSC) with acceptable performance, i.e., R-2 = 0.57 and NSE = 0.55, and remote sensing soil moisture data with R-2 and NSE greater than 0.85.

TI  - Processing of VENμS Images of High Mountains: A Case Study for Cryospheric and Hydro-Climatic Applications in the Everest Region (Nepal)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Central Himalayas, glaciers and snowmelt play an important hydrological role, as they ensure the availability of surface water outside the monsoon period. To compensate for the lack of field measurements in glaciology and hydrology, high temporal and spatial resolution optical remotely sensed data are necessary. The French-Israeli VEN mu S Earth observation mission has been able to complement field measurements since 2017. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the performance of different reflectance products over the Everest region for constraining the energy balance of glaciers and for cloud and snow cover mapping applied to hydrology. Firstly, the results indicate that a complete radiometric correction of slope effects such as the Gamma one (direct and diffuse illumination) provides better temporal and statistical metrics (R-2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 0.11) versus ground albedo datasets than a single cosine correction, even processed under a fine-resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Secondly, a mixed spectral-textural approach on the VEN mu S images strongly improves the cloud mapping by 15% compared with a spectral mask thresholding process. These findings will improve the accuracy of snow cover mapping over the watershed areas downstream of the Everest region.

TI  - CHANNEL MORPHODYNAMICS OF THE MOUTH SECTION OF THE OLHA RIVER OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD
T2  - GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the analysis of channel morphodynamics of the mouth section of the Olha River during 2009-2018 within the Shelekhovsky district of Irkutsk region (52 degrees 21'64.2 '' N; 104 degrees 13'65.8 '' E). The channel morphodynamics of the most developed small rivers has practically not been studied at the moment in the East Siberian region. Analysis of field and cartographic material, literature sources, as well as remote sensing data and satellite images made it possible to identify seven areas with three types of channel processes (Fig. 1), among which the following areas turned out to be the most dynamic . artificially straightened section of the channel in Olha village area, drained oxbow complex in Energetik garden partnership area, periodically drained section of the channel in the area of lake-like extension with degrading channel and oxbow lakes. The following floodplain-channel types were identified: a wide-floodplain meandering type of channel with free meandering bends, a meandering with adapted bends, as well as an adapted relatively straight type of channel. The climatic, geological-geomorphological and anthropogenic factors have the greatest impact on the dynamics of channel processes; the latter has made significant changes in the structure and type of the floodplain of the Olha mouth section during the study period. Additional calculations of the main morphometric parameters made it possible to determine the degree of bends development and the ratio of length to deflection arrow (see table). Calculations showed that for 2009-2018 there was a decrease in the degree of river meandering, a general decrease in the channel tortuosity and frequency of floodplain flooding, especially in areas of free meandering with a high degree of anthropogenic transformation. The analysis of the graphs of average daily flow rate and water level, flow rate of suspended and bed load sediment, as well as turbidity of the Olha River (Figs. 2 and 3) showed that the main increase in water flow in the river falls on the periods of spring floods and flash floods (May and August ). The disturbance in phenomena sequence was revealed: the first maximum of water level falls on March, while the first maximum of water discharges in May. The maximum water turbidity is observed in May, which is associated with passage of spring flood; the minimum falls on June. These values are correlated with the schedule of suspended and bed loads, passing the same maximums and minimums. Human economic activity led to decrease in frequency of floodplain flooding within the floodplain of the Olha River, which affected the area and number of oxbow lakes (Fig. 4). The process of floodplain type changing is observed from segmented-ridged type to segmented flat type.

TI  - Prediction of Field-Scale Wheat Yield Using Machine Learning Method and Multi-Spectral UAV Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate prediction of food crop yield is of great significance for global food security and regional trade stability. Since remote sensing data collected from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms have the features of flexibility and high resolution, these data can be used as samples to develop regional regression models for accurate prediction of crop yield at a field scale. The primary objective of this study was to construct regional prediction models for winter wheat yield based on multi-spectral UAV data and machine learning methods. Six machine learning methods including Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR) were used for the construction of the yield prediction models. Ten vegetation indices (VIs) extracted from canopy spectral images of winter wheat acquired from a multi-spectral UAV at five key growth stages in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, China in 2021 were selected as the variables of the models. In addition, in situ measurements of wheat yield were obtained in a destructive sampling manner for prediction algorithm modeling and validation. Prediction results of single growth stages showed that the optimal model was GPR constructed from extremely strong correlated VIs (ESCVIs) at the filling stage (R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 49.22 g/m(2), MAE = 42.74 g/m(2)). The results of multiple stages showed GPR achieved the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 49.18 g/m(2), MAE = 42.57 g/m(2)) when the ESCVIs of the flowering and filling stages were used. Larger sampling plots were adopted to verify the accuracy of yield prediction; the results indicated that the GPR model has strong adaptability at different scales. These findings suggest that using machine learning methods and multi-spectral UAV data can accurately predict crop yield at the field scale and deliver a valuable application reference for farm-scale field crop management.

TI  - Contemplating Stars and Solving Mysteries: Rationality in Mark Haddon's <i>the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime</i>
T2  - EXPLICATOR
M3  - Article
AB  - The passage discussed in this essay comes from a moment in Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time when the protagonist-narrator Christopher's entire worldview is threatened. He has been trying to solve a mystery of who killed the neighbor's dog, and he has just learned that his father is the killer and that his mother, whom he thought dead (because that's what his father told him), is living in London with her lover. As Christopher looks at the stars, he explains to the reader why this is a good way to cope with "difficult things" in life. Through a close reading of the passage, I show how Christopher positions rationality in order to discuss disorder and violence, while insulating himself from it. I go on to argue that his use of the whodunit as his genre of choice serves a similar purpose. In both cases, however, the novel shows the limitations of rationality. It may be a helpful coping mechanism, but personal growth requires engaging in the emotional complexity and human messiness.

TI  - Ecocritical Comprehension of the Chornobyl Accident in Non-Fiction Works by Y. Shcherbak and R. P. Gale
T2  - FORUM FOR WORLD LITERATURE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with a representation of the Chornobyl accident in non-fiction prose by the Ukrainian and American authors from the perspectives of ecocriticism. The literary devices of ecocritical discourse such as the frame of idyll, paratextual forms, the key metaphors are defined and analyzed in a documentary narrative "Chornobyl" (1987) by Yuriy Shcherbak and a not-fiction story "Chernobyl: The Final Warning" (1988, second ed. 2020) by Robert Peter Gale and Thomas Hauser. A depiction of environmental problems, relations between a man and nature, the elements of ecological consciousness etc. are studied in the documentary works about the Chornobyl tragedy, which were written by the Ukrainian and American authors shortly after the accident. Their texts represent the axiology of two different social systems-socialism and capitalism. It was also proved that a development the ecological consciousness and a liberation from colonial dependence are interrelated processes. A methodological basis of the research were the works from the field of ecocriticism (H. Fromm, D. Haraway, P.D. Murphy and other scholars). We came to the conclusion that in texts by Shcherbak and Gale, a key metaphor of ecological problems is an image of the final warning. The authors reveal its essence with the help of an idyllic worldview in a context of pastoral landscapes. In both texts an importance of understanding the interdependency between man and nature for the sake of avoiding further catastrophes was proved.

TI  - Infantile discourse in the prose of Dmitri Gorchev
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The work of Dmitri Gorchev is regarded as a phenomenon genetically related to "electronic literature." This paper deals with his two books: Zhizn' bez Karlo: Muzyka dlya ekzal'tirovannykh startsev (Life without Carlo: Music for exalted elders) (2010) and Ya ne lyublyu Pushkina: Iz Zhivogo Zhurnala (I don't love Pushkin: From the LiveJournal) (2013), both based on the author's blog in the Live Journal. Both books reveal a plot unity, defined by an infantile worldview of an autobiographical hero, whose reception is indistinguishable from the author's. The central image of the first book, Pinocchio, becomes the embodiment of freedom and childhood for the author. The image of Pushkin in the second book is associated with the adult world. The Soviet childhood evokes ambivalent feelings in the protagonist: nostalgia and traumatic experience. The unity and artistic originality of Gorchev's books are ensured by the childish, infantile view of the world of the autobiographical protagonist and his life-creating strategies of escapism, as well as by the density of the allusive layer dating back to the children's reading and animation. The childish, naive view of the author defines his poetics that is close to primitivism. Nowadays, the Internet has become a breeding ground for the emerging phenomena of primitive art, combining folklore/mythological images with the images of mass culture and high culture. The images of Pinocchio and other characters of children's books and cartoons used by Gorchev have become archetypes of the new mythology of the "mass"/post-Soviet person.

TI  - Glacier Ice Surface Properties in South-West Greenland Ice Sheet: First Estimates From PRISMA Imaging Spectroscopy Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow and ice melt processes on the Greenland Ice Sheet are a key in Earth's energy balance and are acutely sensitive to climate change. Melting dynamics are directly related to a decrease in surface albedo, amongst others caused by the accumulation of light-absorbing particles (LAPs). Featuring unique spectral patterns, these accumulations can be mapped and quantified by imaging spectroscopy. We present first results for the retrieval of glacier ice properties from the spaceborne PRISMA imaging spectrometer by applying a recently developed simultaneous inversion of atmospheric and surface state using optimal estimation. The image analyzed in this study was acquired over the South-West margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet in late August 2020. The area is characterized by patterns of both clean and dark ice associated with a high amount of LAPs deposited on the surface. We present retrieval maps and uncertainties for grain size, liquid water, and algae concentration, as well as estimated reflectance spectra for different surface properties. We then show the feasibility of using imaging spectroscopy to interpret multiband sensor data to achieve high accuracy, frequently repeated observations of changing snow and ice conditions. For example, the impurity index calculated from multiband Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument measurements is dependent on dust particles, but we show that algae concentration alone can be predicted from this data with less than 20% uncertainty. Our study evidences that present and upcoming orbital imaging spectroscopy missions such as PRISMA, Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program, Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission, and the Surface Biology and Geology designated observable, can significantly support research of melting ice sheets.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel-3 and MODIS Vegetation Indices with ERA-5 Agro-Meteorological Indicators for Operational Crop Yield Forecasting
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely crop yield forecasts at a national level are substantial to support food policies, to assess agricultural production, and to subsidize regions affected by food shortage. This study presents an operational crop yield forecasting system for Poland that employs freely available satellite and agro-meteorological products provided by the Copernicus programme. The crop yield predictors consist of: (1) Vegetation condition indicators provided daily by Sentinel-3 OLCI (optical) and SLSTR (thermal) imagery, (2) a backward extension of Sentinel-3 data (before 2018) derived from cross-calibrated MODIS data, and (3) air temperature, total precipitation, surface radiation, and soil moisture derived from ERA-5 climate reanalysis generated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The crop yield forecasting algorithm is based on thermal time (growing degree days derived from ERA-5 data) to better follow the crop development stage. The recursive feature elimination is used to derive an optimal set of predictors for each administrative unit, which are ultimately employed by the Extreme Gradient Boosting regressor to forecast yields using official yield statistics as a reference. According to intensive leave-one-year-out cross validation for the 2000-2019 period, the relative RMSE for voivodships (NUTS-2) are: 8% for winter wheat, and 13% for winter rapeseed and maize. Respectively, for municipalities (LAU) it equals 14% for winter wheat, 19% for winter rapeseed, and 27% for maize. The system is designed to be easily applicable in other regions and to be easily adaptable to cloud computing environments such as Data and Information Access Services (DIAS) or Amazon AWS, where data sets from the Copernicus programme are directly accessible.

TI  - Assessing Land Cover Transformation for Urban Environmental Sustainability through Satellite Sensing
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization in Pakistan is triggering regulated and unregulated land cover changes in planned and semiplanned urban areas. The key objective of this study is to assess the spatial-temporal fluctuations in the land use/land cover (LULC) transformations in planned (Islamabad) and semiplanned (Rawalpindi) urban areas over the last forty years (1976-2016). The study focuses on the orientation of LULC modifications and analyzes concomitant impacts on urban environmental sustainability. Therefore, remotely sensed data were retrieved and processed through Google Earth Engine (GEE) by applying supervised classifier algorithms on each of the five chosen Landsat images. The trajectory of LULC changes for each of the four periods 1976-1988, 1988-1995, 1995-2006 and 2006-2016 was critically scrutinized. The observations revealed massive physical expansions and LULC convergences during these timeframes. The proportionate share of built-up surfaces in this contextual setting substantially stretched from 0.83% in 1976 to 23.23% in 2016, while the shares of cropland and shrubberies significantly reduced. The orientation and magnitude of such changes were observed asymmetrically in the adjoining urban settlements. The assessments formulate that availability of land for urban growth, urban planning and regulatory control significantly determines the speed, scale and orientation of urbanization in planned and semiplanned areas. The study substantiates the notions that the efficient use of cost-effective remotely sensed data offers a pragmatic and reliable tool for assessing, evaluating and monitoring urban land resources. The inferences and insights are relevant for urban and regional planners as well as for other scientific communities.

TI  - An Idealized 11/2-Layer Isentropic Model with Convection and Precipitation for Satellite Data Assimilation Research. Part II: Model Derivation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this Part II paper we present a fully consistent analytical derivation of the "dry" isentropic 11/2-layer shallow-water model described and used in Part I of this study, with no convection and precipitation. The mathematical derivation presented here is based on a combined asymptotic and slaved Hamiltonian analysis, which is used to resolve an apparent inconsistency arising from the application of a rigid-lid approximation to an isentropic two-layer shallow-water model. Real observations based on radiosonde data are used to justify the scaling assumptions used throughout the paper, as well as in Part I. Eventually, a fully consistent isentropic 11/2-layer model emerges from imposing fluid at rest (v(1) = 0) and zero Montgomery potential (M-1 = 0) in the upper layer of an isentropic two-layer model.

TI  - <i>Brown</i> and Red: Defending Jim Crow in Cold War America
T2  - STANFORD LAW REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - It would be difficult to overstate the centrality of Brown v. Board of Education to American law and life. Legal scholars from across the ideological spectrum have lavished more attention on that Supreme Court decision than any other issued during the last century. In recent decades, the standard account of Brown has placed that most-scrutinized opinion in a geopolitical context. Brown, the standard account maintains, must be viewed as a product of the Cold War era. By the 1950s, the persistence of laws codifying racial subordination had become an embarrassment for the United States on the global stage. The U.S. effort to defeat communism around the world thus rendered the recognition of civil rights for Black Americans a Cold War imperative.This Article complicates and challenges that account by exploring the central role that anticommunism played in segregationists' opposition to Brown and civil rights. Throughout most of the twentieth century, a broad array of Americans contended that preserving Jim Crow was a Cold War imperative in its own right. For this group, anticommunism and segregation were not just compatible, but inextricably intertwined. Their ranks included northerners and southerners alike: politicians, jurists, columnists, and ordinary citizens. White supremacists did not invoke anticommunism merely as a disingenuous ploy to combat Brown. Both long before and long after 1954, anticommunism helped to shape the contours of segregationist thought. The defenders of Jim Crow assailed integration as a product of communistic central government authority. They insisted that racial equality would create discord within the United States, just as the Soviets desired, and that civil rights activists were tainted by communist affiliations. Many segregationists viewed themselves as committed Cold Warriors, undertaking closely connected fights against both a foreign ideological threat and a domestic social one. As such, the Cold War represented not only a divide between the United States and the Soviet Union; it also reflected a debate within the United States over the relationship between racial justice, national security, and foreign policy.Understanding that segregationists viewed their cause as a Cold War imperative recasts dominant views within legal academia, where this essential component of Brown's geopolitical context remains underappreciated. While it is tempting to dismiss every segregationist invocation of anticommunism as the product of either irrationality or opportunism, it would be a mistake to do so. Linking segregation with anticommunism transformed the defense of Jim Crow from a regional priority into a national one. Anticommunism also helped resolve a core tension in the segregationist belief that Black citizens did not actually want integration, allowing civil rights lawsuits to be attributed to communist agitation. Reckoning with this significant element of the civil rights era, this Article thus illuminates the logic of a racist worldview. In so doing, it provides a fuller, more accurate portrait of a critical period in constitutional history, of the complex dynamics undergirding legal change, and of the malleable, tenacious character of racism in modern America.

TI  - The Ratio of the Land Consumption Rate to the Population Growth Rate: A Framework for the Achievement of the Spatiotemporal Pattern in Poland and Lithuania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Indicator 11.3. 1 of the 2030 sustainable development goals (SDG) 11, i.e., the ratio of the land use to the population growth rate, is currently classified by the United Nations as a Tier II indicator, as there is a globally-accepted methodology for its calculation, but the data are not available, nor are not regularly updated. Recently, the increased availability of remotely sensed data and products allows not only for the calculation of the SDG 11.3. 1, but also for its monitoring at different levels of detail. That is why this study aims to address the interrelationships between population development and land use changes in Poland and Lithuania, two neighboring countries in Central and Eastern Europe, using the publicly available remotely sensed products, CORINE land cover and GHS-POP. The paper introduces a map modelling process that starts with data transformation through GIS analyses and results in the geovisualisation of the LCRPGR (land use efficiency), the PGR (population growth rate), and the LCR (land use rate). We investigated the spatial patterns of the index values by utilizing hotspot analyses, autocorrelations, and outlier analyses. The results show how the indicators' values were concentrated in both countries; the average value of SDG 11.3. 1, from 2000 to 2018 in Poland amounted to 0.115 and, in Lithuania, to -0.054. The average population growth ratio (PGR) in Poland equaled 0.0132, and in Lithuania, it was -0.0067, while the average land consumption ratios (LCRs) were 0.0462 and 0.0067, respectively. Areas with an increase in built-up areas were concentrated mainly on the outskirts of large cities, whereas outliers of the LCRPGR index were mainly caused by the uncertainty of the source data and the way the indicator is interpreted.

TI  - The Transition from MODIS to VIIRS for Global Volcano Thermal Monitoring
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is one of the most-used sensors for monitoring volcanoes and has been providing time series of Volcanic Radiative Power (VRP) on a global scale for two decades now. In this work, we analyzed the data provided by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) by using the Middle Infrared Observation of Volcanic Activity (MIROVA) algorithm, originally developed to analyze MODIS data. The resulting VRP is compared with both the MIROVA(MODIS) data as well as with the Fire Radiative Power (FRP), distributed by the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS). The analysis on 9 active volcanoes reveals that VIIRS data analyzed with the MIROVA algorithm allows detecting ~60% more alerts than MODIS, due to a greater number of overpasses (+30%) and improved quality of VIIRS radiance data. Furthermore, the comparison with the nighttime FIRMS database indicates greater effectiveness of the MIROVA algorithm in detecting low-intensity (<10 MW) thermal anomalies (up to 90% more alerts than FIRMS). These results confirm the great potential of VIIRS to complement, replace and improve MODIS capabilities for global volcano thermal monitoring, because of the future end of Terra and Aqua Earth-observing satellite mission of National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA).

TI  - Assessing the Performance of Irrigation Systems in Large Scale Urban Parks: Application to the Case of Valdebebas, Madrid (Spain)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to assess spatial and temporal irrigation performance in urban parks and can assist park manager/operator decisions in irrigation management. First, irrigation needs are estimated by traditional irrigation scheduling and the irrigation zones with similar water needs that share the same electric valve (hydrozones) are identified. Then, irrigation performance is calculated using the relative water supply (RWS) indicator and mapped (GIS software). This approach can be adapted to various spatial and temporal scales. In this study, it was applied to the Valdebebas urban development VBB (Madrid) between the 2017 and 2019 irrigation seasons. The results for the VBB parks showed high spatio-temporal variation in irrigation performance among plant typologies within an irrigation season, which can be explained by the landscape coefficient K-L variation across the parks. Likewise, this variation was also observed among the three evaluated seasons; explained among other factors by differences in irrigation management. For each hydrozone, the estimation of the NDVI index by Sentinel-2A satellite images in 2019 showed a threshold on irrigation performance. Thus, the remote sensing data together with the proposed approach can be a valuable tool for helping park managers/technicians adopt better decisions on irrigation practices.

TI  - Integration of Genotoxic Biomarkers in Environmental Biomonitoring Analysis Using a Multi-Biomarker Approach in Three-Spined Stickleback (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i> Linnaeus, 1758)
T2  - TOXICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is impacted by a variety of increasing pressures, such as contaminants, including genotoxic pollutants. The proposed multi-biomarker approach at a sub-individual level gives a complementary indicator to the chemical and ecological parameters of the Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000/60/EC). By integrating biomarkers of genotoxicity and erythrocyte necrosis in the sentinel fish species the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) through active biomonitoring of six stations of the Artois-Picardie watershed, north France, our work aimed to improve the already existing biomarker approach. Even if fish in all stations had high levels of DNA strand breaks, the multivariate analysis (PCA), followed by hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC), improved discrimination among stations by detecting an increase of nuclear DNA content variation (Etaing, St Remy du Nord, Artres and Biache-St-Vaast) and erythrocyte necrosis (Etaing, St Remy du Nord). The present work highlighted that the integration of these biomarkers of genotoxicity in a multibiomarker approach is appropriate to expand physiological parameters which allow the targeting of new potential effects of contaminants.

TI  - An Idealized 11/2-Layer Isentropic Model with Convection and Precipitation for Satellite Data Assimilation Research. Part I: Model Dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An isentropic 11/2-layer model based on modified shallow-water equations is presented, including terms mimicking convection and precipitation. This model is an updated version of the isopycnal single-layer modified rotating shallow water (modRSW) model. The clearer link between fluid temperature and model variables together with a double-layer structure make this revised, isentropic model a more suitable tool to achieve our future goal: to conduct idealized experiments for investigating satellite data assimilation. The numerical model implementation is verified against an analytical solution for stationary waves in a rotating fluid, based on Shrira's methodology for the isopycnal case. Recovery of the equivalent isopycnal model is also verified, both analytically and numerically. With convection and precipitation added, we show how complex model dynamics can be achieved exploiting rotation and relaxation to a meridional jet in a periodic domain. This solution represents a useful reference simulation or "truth" in conducting future (satellite) data assimilation experiments, with additional atmospheric conditions and data. A formal analytical derivation of the isentropic 11/2-layer model from an isentropic two-layer model without convection and precipitation is shown in a companion paper (Part II).

TI  - Robust Beamforming Based on Graph Attention Networks for IRS-Assisted Satellite IoT Communications
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite communication is expected to play a vital role in realizing Internet of Remote Things (IoRT) applications. This article considers an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted downlink low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication network, where IRS provides additional reflective links to enhance the intended signal power. We aim to maximize the sum-rate of all the terrestrial users by jointly optimizing the satellite's precoding matrix and IRS's phase shifts. However, it is difficult to directly acquire the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and optimal phase shifts of IRS due to the high mobility of LEO and the passive nature of reflective elements. Moreover, most conventional solution algorithms suffer from high computational complexity and are not applicable to these dynamic scenarios. A robust beamforming design based on graph attention networks (RBF-GAT) is proposed to establish a direct mapping from the received pilots and dynamic network topology to the satellite and IRS's beamforming, which is trained offline using the unsupervised learning approach. The simulation results corroborate that the proposed RBF-GAT approach can achieve more than 95% of the performance provided by the upper bound with low complexity.

TI  - The Multisource Vegetation Inventory (MVI): A Satellite-Based Forest Inventory for the Northwest Territories Taiga Plains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable forest management requires information on the spatial distribution, composition, and structure of forests. However, jurisdictions with large tracts of noncommercial forest, such as the Northwest Territories (NWT) of Canada, often lack detailed forest information across their land base. The goal of the Multisource Vegetation Inventory (MVI) project was to create a large area forest inventory (FI) map that could support strategic forest management in the NWT using optical, radar, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) satellite remote sensing anchored on limited field plots and airborne LiDAR data. A new landcover map based on Landsat imagery was the first step to stratify forestland into broad forest types. A modelling chain linking FI plots to airborne and spaceborne LiDAR was then developed to circumvent the scarcity of field data in the region. The developed models allowed the estimation of forest attributes in thousands of surrogate FI plots corresponding to spaceborne LiDAR footprints distributed across the project area. The surrogate plots were used as a reference dataset for estimating each forest attribute in each 30 m forest cell within the project area. The estimation was based on the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm, where the selection of the four most similar surrogate FI plots to each cell was based on satellite, topographic, and climatic data. Wall-to-wall 30 m raster maps of broad forest type, stand height, crown closure, stand volume, total volume, aboveground biomass, and stand age were created for a similar to 400,000 km(2) area, validated with independent data, and generalized into a polygon GIS layer resembling a traditional FI map. The MVI project showed that a reasonably accurate FI map for large, remote, predominantly non-inventoried boreal regions can be obtained at a low cost by combining limited field data with remote sensing data from multiple sources.

TI  - Retrieval of Crop Variables from Proximal Multispectral UAV Image Data Using PROSAIL in Maize Canopy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping crop variables at different growth stages is crucial to inform farmers and plant breeders about the crop status. For mapping purposes, inversion of canopy radiative transfer models (RTMs) is a viable alternative to parametric and non-parametric regression models, which often lack transferability in time and space. Due to the physical nature of RTMs, inversion outputs can be delivered in sound physical units that reflect the underlying processes in the canopy. In this study, we explored the capabilities of the coupled leaf-canopy RTM PROSAIL applied to high-spatial-resolution (0.015 m) multispectral unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data to retrieve the leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) of sweet and silage maize throughout one growing season. Two different retrieval methods were tested: (i) applying the RTM inversion scheme to mean reflectance data derived from single breeding plots (mean reflectance approach) and (ii) applying the same inversion scheme to an orthomosaic to separately retrieve the target variables for each pixel of the breeding plots (pixel-based approach). For LCC retrieval, soil and shaded pixels were removed by applying simple vegetation index thresholding. Retrieval of LCC from UAV data yielded promising results compared to ground measurements (sweet maize RMSE = 4.92 mu g/m(2), silage maize RMSE = 3.74 mu g/m(2)) when using the mean reflectance approach. LAI retrieval was more challenging due to the blending of sunlit and shaded pixels present in the UAV data, but worked well at the early developmental stages (sweet maize RMSE = 0.70 m2/m(2), silage RMSE = 0.61 m(2)/m(2) across all dates). CCC retrieval significantly benefited from the pixel-based approach compared to the mean reflectance approach (RMSEs decreased from 45.6 to 33.1 mu g/m(2)). We argue that high-resolution UAV imagery is well suited for LCC retrieval, as shadows and background soil can be precisely removed, leaving only green plant pixels for the analysis. As for retrieving LAI, it proved to be challenging for two distinct varieties of maize that were characterized by contrasting canopy geometry.

TI  - Evaluation and Global-Scale Observation of Nitrous Oxide from IASI on Metop-A
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas difficult to estimate by satellite because of its weak spectral signature in the infra-red band and its low variability in the troposphere. Nevertheless, this study presents the evaluation of new tropospheric N2O observations from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI) on Metop-A using the Toulouse N2O Retrieval Version 2.0 tool. This tool is based on the Radiative Transfer for Tiros Operational Vertical sounder (RTTOV) model version 12.3 coupled to the Levenberg-Marquardt optimal estimation method enabling the simultaneous retrieval of methane, water vapour, temperature profiles together with surface temperature and emissivity within the 1240-1350 cm-1 window. In this study, we focused on the upper troposphere (300 hPa) where the sensitivity of IASI is significant. The IASI N2O data has been evaluated using aircraft N2O observations from the High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) campaigns in 2009, 2010, and 2011 and from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network (GGGRN) in 2011. In addition, we evaluated the IASI N2O using ground-based N2O measurements from 9 stations belonging to the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). We found a total random error of similar to 2 ppbv (0.6%) for one single retrieval at 300 hPa. Under favorable conditions, this error is also found in the vertical level pressure range 300-500 hPa. It decreases rapidly to similar to 0.4 ppbv (0.1%) when we average on a 1 degrees x 1 degrees box. In addition, independent observations allows the estimation of bias with the IASI TN2OR v2.0 N2O. The bias between IASI and aircraft N2O data at 300 hPa is similar to 1.0 ppbv (similar to 0.3%). We found an estimated random error of similar to 2.3 ppbv (similar to 0.75%). This study also shows relatively high correlations between IASI data and aircraft in situ profiles but more varying correlations over the year 2011 depending on the location between IASI and NDACC remote sensing data. Finally, we present daily, monthly, and seasonal IASI N2O horizontal distributions in the upper troposphere as well as cross sections for different seasons that exhibit maxima in the Tropical band especially over Africa and South America.

TI  - Online Nonlinear Bias Correction in Ensemble Kalman Filter to Assimilate GOES-R All-Sky Radiances for the Analysis and Prediction of Rapidly Developing Supercells
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study introduces the online non-linear bias correction for the assimilation of all-sky GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) channel 9 (6.9 mu m) radiances in a rapidly cycled EnKF for convective scale data assimilation (DA). This study is the first to explore the use of the radar reflectivity as the anchoring observation for ABI all sky radiance assimilation. The online and offline nonlinear bias correction methods are compared and evaluated for a case of rapidly developing supercells over Oklahoma and Texas. The analysis and background of the online bias correction perform better than the offline approach during the suppression of spurious clouds and the establishment of non-precipitating and precipitating regions when the supercell storms are observed to develop. The online approach not only improves the analysis and background over the radar anchored region but also the unanchored non-precipitating regions compared to the offline approach. Both quantitative and subjective verification of the deterministic forecasts showed consistent superior performance from the online bias correction over the offline approach. Diagnostics reveal that the online bias correction retains useful information in the innovation, which in turn improves subsequent analysis, background and background ensemble spread for both the thermodynamic and dynamic fields. The effect is accumulated during the DA cycling that is responsible for the superior analysis and forecast of the supercells.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility assessment using AHP model and multi resolution DEMs along a highway in Manipur, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides have been a great threat to the economy as well as human lives in the north-eastern border state, Manipur, India. Highways serve as the main lifelines of the state where hundreds of goods carrying heavy vehicles are transporting every day. However, during the rainy seasons, these highways are often collapsed due to landslides. This study aims to analyze the effect of multi-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) on landslide susceptibility mapping along a major highway in Manipur, India. Nine-landslide conditioning factors including Land Use Land Cover (LULC), slope, aspect, curvature, elevation, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), distance to roads, distance to streams, and distance to faults were selected. The topographic factors were extracted from three different DEM sources-CARTOSAT 10 m, ASTER 30 m and SRTM 90 m. The Analytical Hierarchy Process approach is employed to assign appropriate weights to the conditioning factors, and the weighted factors are integrated to produce the landslide susceptibility maps. The assessment of the model accuracies showed that LSM1 (10 m) procured a success accuracy of 83.78% and prediction accuracy of 81.45%, while LSM2 (30 m) resolution procured a success accuracy of 72.8% and prediction accuracy of 70.45%, and LSM3 (90 m) resolution procured a success accuracy of only 58% and prediction accuracy of 55.87%, respectively. In this particular study, the main aim is to analyse the effect of resolution in Landslide Susceptibility mapping along a major highway in Manipur, India, which has been witnessing landslides every year. The study also aims to select the optimal DEM resolution. The selection for optimal DEM resolution is dependent on scale and the topographic setting of the region under consideration. The susceptibility mapping results of this study indicates that CARTOSAT 10 m resolution DEM produced better accuracy as compared to other DEMs for this particular site. Policy makers can use the resulting map in planning purposes and risk management.

TI  - Estimation of Total Suspended Matter Concentration of Ha Long Bay, Vietnam, from Formosat-5 Image
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes the use of spatial high-resolution Formosat-5 (FS5) images for estimating total suspended matter (TSM) concentrations in a coastal region. Although many atmospheric correction methods are available, none of them are proposed to apply to FS5. Therefore, to remove the atmospheric effect, we performed a linear regression between the digital number (DN) of an FS5 image and the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) level-2 remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) by using 160 samples of five ground targets. The ground targets, namely roof material, asphalt, water, vegetation, and other materials (sand and soil), were assumed to have negligible differences within 24 h. The results show that the linear model used for computing FS5 reflectance exhibited good coefficients of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.87 to 0.96 for blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands. Next, in situ TSM measurements were not collected during the FS5 overpassing in Ha Long Bay, Vietnam, so we used two existing algorithms with a red band to estimate the TSM concentration. These algorithms developed for different coastal waters exhibited satisfactory agreement between derived field data and observed TSM concentrations with R-2 ranging from 0.86 to 0.95. We also cross-checked the accuracy of the FS5-derived TSM concentration through comparison with an OLI-derived TSM image. The OLI-derived TSM image was validated and discussed for Vietnamese coastal waters, including Ha Long Bay. Lastly, based on comparisons between FS5- and OLI-derived TSM images in terms of spatial distribution, histograms, and root mean square error, we indicated the FS5 images after the removal of atmospheric effects could be totally used for estimating TSM in coastal water regions.

TI  - Spatio-temporal distribution of aerosol direct radiative forcing over mid-latitude regions in north hemisphere estimated from satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An empirical method is used to estimate the aerosol direct radiative forcing (ADRF) over 20 degrees N - 40 degrees N regions from March 2000 to March 2019. The ADRF is calculated as the difference between the cloud-free sky and cleansky (non-aerosol) radiative fluxes, which are fitted to an exponential function of the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The regional averaged ADRFs are negative (cooling effect) at the surface (SUR) and the top of atmosphere (TOA) and positive (warming effect) in the atmosphere (ATM). The spatial and temporal distributions of ADRF are closely linked to the spatio-temporal distributions of AOD. Higher AOD and stronger ADRF are found in spring (March to May) and summer (June to August). ADRFs are larger in regions with frequent sandstorm outbreaks and rapid economic growth since 2000 than other regions. The uncertainty of ADRF due to data source is 1.12 W/m(2) at the surface and 0.91 W/m(2) at the TOA according to the stochastic error propagation function. The ADRFs in our study regions show statistically significant but different changes of -0.074 W/m(2)/year and 0.1 W/m(2) /year at the surface during 2000 to 2009 and 2010 to 2019, respectively. Recent trend analysis also shows that the reduced aerosol contributes to the increasing short-wave flux about 0.32 W/m(2) under the background of the global warming during the period from 2000 to 2019 in our study area, which indicates that it may alter the pattern of atmospheric circulation or enhance the global warming effect.

TI  - How Can We Understand the Past from Now On? Three-Dimensional Modelling and Landscape Reconstruction of the Shuanghuaishu Site in the Central Plains of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Shuanghuaishu (SHS) site in China is one of the 100 most important archaeological discoveries over the past 100 years; its historical heritage can be traced directly back 5300 years. Understanding the early landscape of the site would provide important information about the origin of Chinese civilization. The SHS site is buried and surface traces are difficult to see; therefore, we attempted to reconstruct the early landscape of the site based on a current surface landscape model and environmental archaeological analysis. We created a modern three-dimensional (3D) landscape model of the study area from high spatial resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial photographs and analysed the distance change between the Yellow River and SHS site in the past 60 years from CORONA and Landsat images. By combining environmental archaeological survey results, archaeological excavation data, relevant papers, and field measurements, we reconstructed the paleotopography of the SHS site during the Yangshao period (7000-5000 aBP). On this basis, 3D natural and human landscapes during the Yangshao period were rebuilt. The results show that (1) Satellite images acquired at different resolutions can provide multiscale spatial information about the site, and high-precision models of current conditions can be quickly generated from UAV aerial photography. (2) From 1960 to 2020, the shortest distance between the SHS site and the Yellow River was approximately 512 m. The location of bedrock on Mang Mountain can be used to infer the early extent of the northern terrace at the site. (3) Environmental archaeology provided information about the palaeoenvironment of the site area. By incorporating spatial information technology and 3D visualization, we can better restore the early landscape of the SHS site. Our work integrates environmental archaeology, field archaeology, and spatial technology, enabling data and modelling support for the visual interpretation of the SHS site.

TI  - Improved Prediction of Forest Fire Risk in Central and Northern China by a Time-Decaying Precipitation Model
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increase in extreme climate events, forest fires burn in much larger areas. Therefore, it is important to accurately predict forest fire frequencies. Precipitation is an important factor that affects the probability of future forest fires. Previous models used average precipitation values, but the attenuation of precipitation was not considered. In this study, a time-decaying precipitation algorithm was used to calculate the comprehensive precipitation index. This method can better represent the effect of precipitation in predicting the occurrence of forest fires. Moreover, observed fire spots were converted into a continuous density of fire spots. The structure of the prediction model is more realistic, which is conducive to obtaining higher-precision prediction results. Additionally, the support vector machine (SVM) regression model was used to construct a forest fire warning model. When the comprehensive precipitation index was compared with the average precipitation value, the accuracy of the four forest areas in central and northern China in the test set was improved by approximately 10%. The findings are relevant to forest ecologists and managers for future mitigation of forest fires, and also for successful prediction of other fire-prone areas.

TI  - On-Orbit Geometric Calibration and Accuracy Validation for Laser Footprint Cameras of GF-7 Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gaofen-7 (GF-7) satellite uses a two-beam laser altimetry system in which each beam is equipped with a laser footprint camera (LFC) to provide geometric processing of the laser footprint images that assist in optical image stereo mapping. Because of the violent vibrations during launch and the difference in the environment before and after entering orbit, the key parameters for geometric processing of the laser footprint images may change, which will cause large geolocation errors. Therefore, it is essential to carry out on-orbit calibration and validation for the laser footprint cameras. This study first constructs a rigorous geometric positioning model for the LFC of the GF-7 satellite and analyses various error sources that affect the geometric positioning accuracy of laser footprint images. Then, a comprehensive calibration method, which effectively eliminates the distortion of the LFC optical system, and the positioning error caused by the long-period jitter of the satellite platform, is proposed based on the multi-scene images combined with image simulation. The proposed method can effectively eliminate various errors that affect the geometric positioning accuracy of the GF-7 laser footprint image. The internal geometric positioning accuracy of the calibrated LFC is better than 0.7 pixels, and the absolute geometric positioning accuracy is within 6.0 m after using precise post-processing orbital and attitude data. Our study will contribute to the processing and application of laser altimetry data from the GF-7 satellite.

TI  - Changes of surface recovery at coseismic landslides and their driving factors in the Wenchuan earthquake-affected area
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - A major earthquake can trigger numerous landslides, which exert severe impacts on regional vegetation coverage. In some years following an earthquake, rainstorms can easily reactivate coseismic deposits and unstable hillslopes. Vegetation can improve the post-seismic slope instability by the root reinforcement effect, and it is significant to investigate the changes of surface recovery at coseismic landslides for a long-term assessment of post-earthquake geohazards. However, due to limited earth observations, it remains elusive that how long the surface vegetation of coseismic landslides caused by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake will recover to the pre earthquake level. We studied the long-term evolution of surface recovery in coseismic landslide-affected areas using multi-temporal Landsat images from 2000 to 2020. We calculated the vegetation recovery rates in different periods, which were used to quantify the rate of vegetation regrowth and landslide activity intensity. We found that 71.34% of the affected areas have been properly revegetated, and the area percentage of landslides in high activity, middle activity, low activity and dormant were 17.6%, 12.4%, 17.7% and 52.3%, respectively in 2020. To examine the factors controlling the surface recovery at coseismic landslides, we further analyzed the relationships between landslide recovery and eighteen influencing factors, and we found that elevation, peak ground acceleration, rainfall, lithology and gully density are the key factors that control landslide surface recovery over all others. Overall the trend of surface recovery at coseismic landslides suggests that the impact of the Wenchuan earthquake on the activities of shallow landslides almost ceases within 17 years in the Wenchuan earthquake-affected areas.

TI  - ASTER and GF-5 Satellite Data for Mapping Hydrothermal Alteration Minerals in the Longtoushan Pb-Zn Deposit, SW China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrothermal alteration minerals are an effective prospecting indicator. Advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) satellite data are some of the most commonly adopted multispectral data for the mapping of hydrothermal alteration minerals. Compared to multispectral data, hyperspectral data have stronger ground object recognition ability. Chinese Gaofen-5 (GF-5) is the first hyperspectral satellite independently developed by China that has the advantages of both wide-width and high-spectral-resolution technology. However, the mapping ability of GF5 data for hydrothermal alteration minerals requires further study. In this study, ASTER and GF-5 satellite data were implemented to map hydrothermal alteration minerals in the Longtoushan Pb-Zn deposit, SW China. Selective principal component analysis (SPCA) technology was employed to map iron oxide/hydroxides, argillic, quartz, and carbonate minerals at the pixel level using ASTER data, and the mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF) method was implemented for the extracted hematite, kaolinite, calcite, and dolomite at the sub-pixel level using GF-5 data. When mapping the hydrothermal alteration minerals, the distribution features of the hydrothermal alteration minerals from the Longtoushan Pb-Zn deposit were systematically revealed. A comprehensive field investigation and petrographic study were conducted to verify the extraction accuracy of the hydrothermal alteration minerals. The results showed that the overall accuracies for the ASTER and GF-5 data were 82.6 and 92.9 and that the kappa coefficients were 0.78 and 0.90, respectively. This indicates that the GF-5 data are able to map hydrothermal alteration minerals well and that they can be promoted as a hyperspectral data source for mapping systematic hydrothermal alteration minerals in the future.

TI  - Spatial-temporal variation of suspended sediment in the Pearl River Estuary retrieved from GF-4 satellite data
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - Lingdingyang of the Pearl River Estuary is one of the most important bays in China. The suspended sediment concentration (SSC) there is significantly affected by the tidal processes in the dry season, which makes it an ideal area for studying the influence of tides on SSC variation. The Gaofen-4 (GF-4) satellite is the first geosynchronous orbit satellite with ultra-high spatial and temporal resolution in China. The spatial resolution of visible light bands is 50 m, and the maximum temporal resolution can reach 20 s. It has unique advantages in studying the variation of SSC within one day. In this study, we retrieved the surface SSC of Lingdingyang from the GF-4 satellite L1A data and in-situ data in January 2020, and then analyzed the spatial distribution of SSC in different stages of a tidal cycle. The results showed that the SSC in Lingdingyang was higher nearshore than offshore, and higher in the west than in the east. At flood tide, there were four high SSC areas. The average SSC showed a decreasing trend, and the suspended sediment was transported to the bay. During the initial, middle and last stages of flood tide, the decreased SSC became gradually more significant. At ebb tide, there were seven high SSC areas. The average SSC showed an increasing trend, and the suspended sediment moved toward the sea. During the initial, middle and last stages of ebb tide, the SSC increased significantly first, and then slowed down; it finally showed a negative growth trend. The variation of SSC was jointly affected by sediment transport in the horizontal direction, resuspension process in the vertical direction, and topography.

TI  - The Effects of Tidal Flat Reclamation on the Stability of the Coastal Area in the Jiangsu Province, China, from the Perspective of Landscape Structure
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most important wetland systems, coastal wetlands play an important role in conserving water, regulating the climate and protecting biodiversity. However, due to large-scale and long-term tidal flat reclamations, the landscape structure and function of the coastal wetlands have been greatly affected. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the spatio-temporal characteristics of the impact of tidal flat reclamation on regional ecology and to quantitatively assess the relationships between them. In this study based on long-term, multiperiod remote sensing data, the main spatiotemporal variation characteristics of stability, and the relationship between stability and tidal flat reclamation were analyzed with regard to the influence scope of tidal flat reclamation. The results showed that a substantial decrease in natural wetlands in 1980, mainly caused by tidal flat reclamation, was discovered in the Jiangsu coastal area, and the influence scope of tidal flat reclamation on regional landscape ecology was roughly 30 km. In the affected area, the overall stability had a tendency to improve, but the stability change characteristics between reclamation area and non-reclamation area varied greatly. Especially in the reclamation area, the stability of construction wetlands and non-wetlands deteriorated. Spatially, the stability outside the reclamation area had the characteristics of first deteriorating and then improving as the distance from the reclamation area increased. Under the influence of tidal flat reclamation, the influence of different use types of TFR on stability was not completely consistent, and the influence of the same uses type of tidal flat reclamation on different landscapes was also different.

TI  - Kilometer-level glyoxal retrieval via satellite for anthropogenic volatile organic compound emission source and secondary organic aerosol formation identification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are key precursors of PM2.5 and ozone. Glyoxal can be utilized as an indicator of VOC emission sources and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. In this study, the high-resolution satellite observations of glyoxal were utilized to identify anthropogenic VOC sources, which can be utilized to formulate pollution control policies. Glyoxal vertical column densities were firstly retrieved by the TROPO-spheric monitoring instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. Glyoxal retrieval is sensitive to wavelength; therefore, four different areas were studied, and the optimum wavelength range of 435-462 nm was determined and applied in the wavelength sensitivity test. Glyoxal slant column density was corrected by utilizing the daily stripe-correction in the Sahara region which reduces the error by approximately 2.2 x 10(14) molec/cm(2). Glyoxal vertical column densities computed using TROPOMI were vali-dated via multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy measurements obtained at three sites; the daily normalized mean bias and standard deviation for the three sites were-27.5 % +/- 6.5%, 1.8% +/- 7.5%, and-6.6 % +/- 17.3%, respectively. Monthly averaged data shows good correlation with Pearson correlation coefficients (R) of 0.90, 0.78 and 0.92, at three MAX-DOSA sites, respectively. The global spatial distribution of glyoxal showed large areas of high-concentration glyoxal distributed over tropical rainforests near the equator, which were attributed to biomass combustion and biogenic processes. Numerous urban hotspots were identified to be mainly concentrated in developing countries, especially those in East Asia and the Middle East. The highest glyoxal vertical column densities were observed over eastern China, and the high-glyoxal concentration areas were mainly located over urban and industrial areas, indicating a significant anthropogenic glyoxal source. Kilometer-level TROPOMI can identify factory emission sources that are undetectable by Ozone Monitoring Instrument due to the higher resolution of TROPOMI.

TI  - Observation and Analysis of a Haze Pollution Event in Beijing by Spaceborne and Ground-based Lidars
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking the continuous haze pollution process that occurred on January 11-17, 2015 in Beijing as an example, the vertical distribution characteristics of aerosols were obtained by inversion using joint observations of ground based and space borne lidar. The pollution sources and transport paths were derived from MODIS satellite remote sensing data and HYSPLIT backward trajectory model analysis, after which the causes of this pollution were revealed by combining ground-based air quality and meteorological observation data. The results show that the near-surface aerosol extinction coefficients inferred from lidar data are generally consistent with the variation of PM2.5 concentrations on the ground, while the planetary boundary layer height shows an opposite trend to PM2.5 concentrations, and the lowest boundary layer height is 500 m. During the pollution period, it is light wind and high humidity, and the average wind speed and relative humidity are 1.35 m/s and 66%, respectively. The presence of the inversion layer for several days inhibited the diffusion and transport of pollutants in the vertical space, and the intensity of the inversion was as high as 5 degrees C. These two factors led to the continuous accumulation of pollutants, and finally, the PM2.5 concentration reached 448 mu g/m(3) in the early morning of the January 16th, and the pollution was finally disappeared because of the southerly wind on the January 16th, and the PM2.5 concentration decreased at a rate of 82 mu g/(m(3) . h). During the observation period, the correlation coefficients of PM2.5 with NO2 and CO were 0.766 and 0.901, respectively, showing a significant positive correlation, which shows that secondary aerosols from the transformation of gaseous precursor pollutants such as NO2 are an important source of haze. Comprehensive analysis shows that this pollution is dominated by haze, which is caused by the superposition and accumulation of aerosols from regional transmission and local emissions. Pollutants from southern Hebei, Henan and Shanxi are transmitted to Beijing with high-altitude air masses and mixed with locally emitted pollution aerosols, leading to increased pollution.

TI  - Effectiveness of Monovalent Rotavirus Vaccine in Mozambique, a Country with a High Burden of Chronic Malnutrition
T2  - VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mozambique introduced monovalent rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix (R)) in September 2015. We evaluated the effectiveness of Rotarix (R) under conditions of routine use in Mozambican children hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis (AGE). A test negative case-control analysis was performed on data collected during 2017-2019 from children <5 years old, admitted with AGE in seven sentinel hospital sites in Mozambique. Adjusted VE was calculated for >= 1 dose of vaccine vs. zero doses using unconditional logistic regression, where VE = (1 - aOR) x 100%. VE estimates were stratified by age group, AGE severity, malnutrition, and genotype. Among 689 children eligible for analysis, 23.7% were rotavirus positive (cases) and 76.3% were negative (controls). The adjusted VE of >= 1 dose in children aged 6-11 months was 52.0% (95% CI, -11, 79), and -24.0% (95% CI, -459, 62) among children aged 12-23 months. Estimated VE was lower in stunted than non-stunted children (14% (95% CI, -138, 66) vs. 59% (95% CI, -125, 91)). Rotavirus vaccination appeared moderately effective against rotavirus gastroenteritis hospitalization in young Mozambican children. VE point estimates were lower in older and stunted children, although confidence intervals were wide and overlapped across strata. These findings provide additional evidence for other high-mortality countries considering rotavirus vaccine introduction.

T2  - SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - A spatial distributional analysis of the population of Phase II research projects funded by the US SBIR program in FY 2020 shows differences across states in projects focused on artificial intelligence (AI). AI is a relatively new research field, and this paper contributes to a better understanding of government support for such research. We find that AI projects are concentrated in states with complementary AI research resources available from universities nationally ranked in terms of their own AI research. To achieve a more diverse spatial distribution of AI-related technology development, the availability of complementary AI research resources must be expanded. We suggest that the National Science Foundation's National AI Research Institutes represents an important step in this direction.

TI  - Assessing and Simulating Impacts of Land Use Land Cover Changes on Land Surface Temperature in Mymensingh City, Bangladesh
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban developments in the cities of Bangladesh are causing the depletion of natural land covers over the past several decades. One of the significant implications of the developments is a change in Land Surface Temperature (LST). Through LST distribution in different Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and a statistical association among LST and biophysical indices, i.e., Urban Index (UI), Bare Soil Index (BI), Normalized Difference Builtup Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), this paper studied the implications of LULC change on the LST in Mymensingh city. Landsat TM and OLI/TIRS satellite images were used to study LULC through the maximum likelihood classification method and LSTs for 1989, 2004, and 2019. The accuracy of LULC classifications was 84.50, 89.50, and 91.00 for three sampling years, respectively. From 1989 to 2019, the area and average LST of the built-up category has been increased by 24.99% and 7.6oC, respectively. Compared to vegetation and water bodies, built-up and barren soil regions have a greater LST each year. A different machine learning method was applied to simulate LULC and LST in 2034. A remarkable change in both LULC and LST was found through this simulation. If the current changing rate of LULC continues, the built-up area will be 59.42% of the total area, and LST will be 30.05oC on average in 2034. The LST in 2034 will be more than 29oC and 31oC in 59.64% and 23.55% areas of the city, respectively.

TI  - Different Ground Subsidence Contributions Revealed by Integrated Discussion of Sentinel-1 Datasets, Well Discharge, Stratigraphical and Geomorphological Data: The Case of the Gioia Tauro Coastal Plain (Southern Italy)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is the main water supply for agricultural and industrial needs in many coastal plains worldwide. Groundwater depletion often triggers land subsidence, which threatens manmade infrastructure and activities and aggravates other geohazards. We applied a multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique to Sentinel-1 datasets to detect ground motion in the Gioia Tauro plain (Calabria, Southern Italy) from 2018 to 2021. The InSAR data were analysed through the integrated use of groundwater head, stratigraphical and geomorphological data, and land use information to distinguish the potential subsidence divers. The results show that subsiding areas, with a mean rate of about 10 mm/yr, are in the middle of the plain, and their location is influenced by the spatial distribution of compressible sediments included in the shallow aquifer. Furthermore, the subsidence arrangement is spatially accordant with the main groundwater depression area, which can be ascribed to the ongoing and increasing water pumping for predominantly agricultural usage. We also observed that subsidence (up to 10 mm/yr) affects the western dock of the Gioia Tauro harbour, in front of which, in very shallow water, are two submarine canyon heads already affected by slides in the past.

TI  - How community forest management performs when REDD plus payments fail
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The reduced emissions in deforestation and degradation (REDD+) initiative uses payments for ecosystem services as incentives for developing countries to manage and protect their forests. REDD+ initiatives also prioritize social (and environmental) co-benefits aimed at improving the livelihoods of communities that are dependent on forests. Despite the incorporation of co-benefits into REDD+ goals, carbon sequestration remains the primary metric for which countries can receive payments from REDD+, but after more than 10 years of REDD+, many site-specific programs have failed to complete the carbon verification process. Here, we examine whether the REDD+ social co-benefits alone are sufficient to have slowed deforestation in the absence of carbon payments on Pemba, Tanzania. Using satellite imagery (Landsat archive), we quantified forest cover change for the period before (2001-2010) and after (2010-2018) the launch in 2010-2011 of Pemba island's REDD+ readiness project. We then compared rates of forest cover change between shehia (administrative units) that were part of REDD+ readiness intervention and those that were not, adjusting for confounding variables and the non-random selection of REDD+ shehia with a statistical matching procedure. Despite considerable variation in forest outcomes among shehia, the associated co-benefits with the Pemba REDD+ project had no discernible effect on forest cover change. Likewise, we did not detect an effect of socioecological covariates on forest cover change across all shehia, though island-wide human population growth since 2012 may have played a role. These findings are unsurprising given the failure to secure carbon payments on Pemba and indicate that co-benefits alone are insufficient to reduce deforestation. We conclude that better oversight of all-involved parties is needed to ensure that REDD+ interventions satisfactorily conclude the process of securing a mechanism for carbon payments, if slowing deforestation is to be achieved.

TI  - Flood Monitoring Using Enhanced Resolution Passive Microwave Data: A Test Case over Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring floods is a major issue in water resources management and risk mitigation, especially in the Global South. Optical and radar observations, even providing a fine spatial resolution, are still limited by cloud cover interaction or insufficient temporal resolution. On the other hand, passive microwave (PMW) sensors collect information on a daily frequency with minor cloud cover interaction, but they have been historically limited in terms of spatial resolution. Here, we evaluate the capability of an enhanced spatial resolution PMW dataset (3.125 km) in monitoring spatio-temporal evolution of flood events, focusing on a major flood event that occurred in October 2005 in Bangladesh. We apply an algorithm aimed to remove the seasonal variability of surface temperature from the PMW timeseries, exploiting the difference in emissivity between dry and water-covered pixels. We assess the capability of the algorithm in capturing flood evolution and extension through the comparison with quantities obtained from optical data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and water level measurements. We also compare the enhanced product with the historical coarser resolution dataset by means of a variogram-based analysis to evaluate the improvements in terms of spatial representation. Finally, we evaluate the possibility to extract the water fraction within a single pixel by using an Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) emissivity dataset and compare the estimates with MODIS-derived water fractions. Our results show that the enhanced PMW product outperforms the coarser one when compared to flood mapped from optical data based on information content, indicating that it is possible to integrate such a product into the mapping of floods at a global scale on a daily basis.

TI  - Monitoring the Storage Volume of Water Reservoirs Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the satellite images have been used in remote sensing allowing observations with high temporal and spatial distribution. The use of water indices has proved to be an effective methodology in the monitoring of surface water resources. However, precise or automatic methodologies using satellite imagery to determine reservoir volumes are lacking. To fulfill that gap, this methodology proposes three stages: use Google Earth Engine to select images; automatically calculate flooded surface areas applying water indices; determine the volume stored in reservoirs over those years based on the relation between the flooded area and the stored volume. The method was applied in four reservoirs and contemplate Landsat 4 and 5 ETM and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager. For the calculation of the flooded area the Normalized Difference Water Index Indexes (Gao, 1996, https://doi.org/10.1016/s0034-4257(96)00067-3; McFeeters, 1996, https://doi.org/10.1080/01431169608948714) and the MNDWI index (Xu, 2006, https:// doi.org/10.1080/01431160600589179) were applied and tested. The estimation of stored volume of water was made based on the area indices and a cross-check between real stored volume and calculated volume was made. Finally, an analysis on the selection of the best-fit water indices was made. The results of every case studies herein displayed showed a quantifiable proficiency and reliability for quite a varied natural conditions. As a conclusion, this methodology could be seen as a tool for water resources management in developing countries, not only, to measure automatically trends of stored volumes and its relation with the precipitation, and could eventually be extended to other types of surface water bodies, as lakes and coastal lagoons.

TI  - The Suitability of PlanetScope Imagery for Mapping Rubber Plantations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quickly and accurately understanding the spatial distribution of regional rubber resources is of great practical significance. Using the unique phenological characteristics of rubber trees derived from remotely sensed data is a common effective method for monitoring rubber trees. However, due to the lack of high-quality images available during the key phenological period, it is still very difficult to apply this method in practical applications. PlanetScope data with high temporal (daily) resolution have great advantages in acquiring high-quality images, but these images have not been previously used to monitor rubber plantations. In this paper, multitemporal PlanetScope images were used as data sources, and the spectral features, index features, first principal components, and textural features of the images were comprehensively utilized. Four classification methods, including a pixel-based random forest (RF) approach, pixel-based support vector machine (SVM) approach, object-oriented RF approach and object-oriented SVM approach, were utilized to discuss the feasibility of using PlanetScope data to monitor rubber forests. The results showed that the optimal time window for monitoring rubber forests in the study area spanned from the 49th day to the 65th day of 2019 according to the MODIS-NDVI analysis. The contribution rate of the difference in the modified simple ratio (dMSR) feature was largest among all considered features for all pixel-based and object-oriented methods. The object-oriented RF/SVM classification method achieved the best classification results with an overall accuracy of 93.87% and a Kappa index of agreement (KIA) of 0.92. The highest producer's accuracy and user's accuracy obtained with this method were 95.18% for rubber plantations. The results of this study show that it is feasible to use PlanetScope data to perform rubber monitoring, thus effectively solving the problem of missing images in the optimal rubber monitoring period; additionally, this method can be extended to other real-life applications.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Change and Their Driving Factors in the Yellow River Basin of Shandong Province Based on Google Earth Engine from 2000 to 2020
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As the convenient outlet to the Bo Sea and the major region of economic development in the Yellow River Basin, Shandong Province in China has undergone large changes in land use/land cover (LULC) in the past two decades with rapid urbanization and population growth. The analysis of the LULC change patterns and its driving factors in the Shandong section of the Yellow River Basin can provide a scientific basis for rational planning and ecological protection of land resources in the Shandong section of the Yellow River Basin. In this manuscript, we analyzed the spatial pattern of LULC and its spatial and temporal changes in the Shandong section of the Yellow River Basin in 2000, 2010, and 2020 by using the random forest classification algorithm with the Google Earth Engine platform and multi-temporal Landsat TM/OLI data. The driving factors of LULC changes were also quantified by the factor detector and interaction detector in the geodetector. Results show that in the past two decades, the LULC types in the study area are mainly farmland and construction land, among which the proportion of farmland area has decreased and the proportion of construction land area has increased from 19.4% to 29.7%. Based on the results of factor detector, it can be concluded that elevation, slope, and soil type are the key factors affecting LULC change in the study area. The interaction between elevation and slope, slope and soil type, and temperature and precipitation has strong explanatory power for the spatial variation of LULC change in the study area. The research results can provide data support for ecological environmental protection, sustainable, and high-quality development of the Shandong section of the Yellow River Basin, and help local governments take corresponding measures to achieve coordinated and sustainable socioeconomic and environmental development.

TI  - The Role of Plasma Membrane Pleiotropic Drug Resistance Transporters in the Killer Activity of <i>Debaryomyces hansenii</i> and <i>Wickerhamomyces anomalus</i> Toxins
T2  - TOXINS
M3  - Article
AB  - The killer strains of Debaryomyces hansenii and Wickerhamomyces anomalus species secrete antimicrobial proteins called killer toxins which are active against selected fungal phytopathogens. In our research, we attempted to investigate the role of plasma membrane pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) transporters (Pdr5p and Snq2p) in the mechanism of defense against killer toxins. Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strains with strengthened or weakened pleiotropic drug resistance due to increased or reduced number of mentioned PDR efflux pumps were tested for killer toxin susceptibility. The present study demonstrates the influence of the Snq2p efflux pump in immunity to W. anomalus BS91 killer toxin. It was also shown that the activity of killer toxins of D. hansenii AII4b, KI2a, MI1a and CBS767 strains is regulated by other transporters than those influencing W. anomalus killer toxin activity. In turn, this might be related to the functioning of the Pdr5p transporter and a complex cross-talk between several regulatory multidrug resistance networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that reports the involvement of PDR transporters in the cell membrane of susceptible microorganisms in resistance to killer yeasts' toxins.

TI  - Deep Internal Learning for Inpainting of Cloud-Affected Regions in Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud cover remains a significant limitation to a broad range of applications relying on optical remote sensing imagery, including crop identification/yield prediction, climate monitoring, and land cover classification. A common approach to cloud removal treats the problem as an inpainting task and imputes optical data in the cloud-affected regions employing either mosaicing historical data or making use of sensing modalities not impacted by cloud obstructions, such as SAR. Recently, deep learning approaches have been explored in these applications; however, the majority of reported solutions rely on external learning practices, i.e., models trained on fixed datasets. Although these models perform well within the context of a particular dataset, a significant risk of spatial and temporal overfitting exists when applied in different locations or at different times. Here, cloud removal was implemented within an internal learning regime through an inpainting technique based on the deep image prior. The approach was evaluated on both a synthetic dataset with an exact ground truth, as well as real samples. The ability to inpaint the cloud-affected regions for varying weather conditions across a whole year with no prior training was demonstrated, and the performance of the approach was characterised.

TI  - Serological survey of anti-<i>Leptospira</i> spp. antibodies in individuals with animal hoarding disorder and their dogs in a major city of Southern Brazil
T2  - VETERINARY MEDICINE AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Individuals with hoarding disorder (HD) presented a persistent difficulty in detaching from objects and/or animals. Unhealthy conditions, frequently found in cases of animal HD (AHD), may favour environmental contamination and the spread of zoonotic pathogens. Despite that, only one study of zoonotic diseases in individuals with AHD and their companion animals has been conducted to date.Objectives: This study aimed to assess the seroprevalence of anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies in individuals with AHD and their dogs in a major city of Southern Brazil.Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 264 dogs (21 households) and 19 individuals with AHD (11 households) and tested by microscopic agglutination test.Results: All human samples were seronegative. Seropositivity was found in 16/264 (6.1%; CI 95% 3.3-9.6%) dogs from 11/21 (52.38%) households, with titres ranging from 100 up to 400, and Copenhageni (10/16; 62.5%) was the most frequent serovar. Surprisingly, seropositivity of hoarded dogs found herein was among the lowest reportedly observed in other dog populations of Brazil. Two epidemiological variables were significantly associated with seropositivity in dogs: the presence of cat hoarding (p = 0.004) and the report of flood occurrence in the household (p = 0.031).Conclusions: No individuals with AHD were seropositive, and besides the lower seroprevalence of dogs, they probably had contact with Leptospira spp. at some point in their life. Since dogs can be considered potential sentinels in leptospirosis, public health programs must become aware of the risk of leptospirosis cases in households of individuals with AHD and nearby communities.

TI  - Signals of Surface Deformation Areas in Central Chile, Related to Seismic Activity-Using the Persistent Scatterer Method and GIS
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar is an effective means of measuring changes in the altitude of the Earth's surface. In this research, the areas of surface deformation associated with low- and medium-intensity seismic events in Central Chile were analyzed using SENTINEL 1 satellite radar interferograms and geographical information system (GIS) tools. The persistent scatterer method was used to reduce noise from conventional InSAR methods. The results revealed that the coastal zone of Central Chile has a high density of daily earthquakes with a prevalence (93.03%) of low- and medium-intensity earthquakes. Monthly deformation maps were developed for the coast of the Biobio region in Central Chile. A clear deformation pattern is defined along the coast, being greater in the Arauco, Lota and Lebu areas. It was also shown that there was a slight upward trend in the north and northeast zone (i.e., delta up ~3 mm/year), while there was an obvious accentuated upward trend (i.e., delta up ~24 mm/year) in the southern part. This movement increases as latitude increases. This pattern is related to the daily seismic activity, the product of the movement between plates, and the geological faults located in the area. The deformation and trend maps provide certainty in terms of where hotspots are located, e.g., the most hazardous areas in the study zone, which can be applied to urban planning and/or safety assessment.

TI  - Potential of Convolutional Neural Networks for Forest Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Interferometric Short Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of land cover and land use patterns is pivotal in the joint effort to fight deforestation in the Amazon and study its relation to climate change effects with respect to anthropogenic activities. Most of the region, typically monitored with optical sensors, is hidden by a persistent cloud cover for most of the wet season. The necessity for a consistent and reliable deforestation warning system based on cloud-independent radar data is therefore of particular interest. In this paper, we investigated the potential of combining deep learning with Sentinel-1 (S-1) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) short time series (STS), covering only 24 d of acquisitions, to map endangered areas in the Amazon Basin. To this end, we implemented a U-Net-like convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-layer semantic segmentation, trained from scratch with different sets of input features to evaluate the viability of the proposed approach for different operating conditions. As input features, we relied on both multi-temporal backscatter and interferometric coherences at different temporal baselines. We provide a detailed performance benchmark of the different configurations, also considering the current state-of-the-art approaches based on S-1 STS and shallow learners. Our findings showed that, by exploiting the powerful learning capabilities of CNNs, we outperformed the STS-based approaches published in the literature and significantly reduced the computational load. Indeed, when considering the entire stack of Sentinel-1 data at a 6 d revisit time, we were able to maintain the overall accuracy and F-1-score well above 90% and reduce the computational time by more than 50% with respect to state-of-the-art approaches, by avoiding the generation of handcrafted feature maps. Moreover, we achieved satisfactory results even when only S-1 InSAR acquisitions with a revisit time of 12 d or more were used, setting the groundwork for an effective and fast monitoring of tropical forests at a global scale.

TI  - Impacts of Soil and Water Conservation Practice on Soil Moisture in Debre Mewi and Sholit Watersheds, Abbay Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil and water conservation (SWC) practices have been widely implemented to reduce surface runoff in the Debre Mewi watershed. However, studies on the issue have disproportionately focused on the lost or preserved soils, expressed in tons per hectare, while the impacts on the lost or preserved moisture were inadequately addressed. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of soil and water conservation practice on soil moisture in the Debre Mewi and Sholit watersheds, Abbay basin, Ethiopia. We compared soil moisture between the treated (Debre Mewi) and the untreated (Sholit) watersheds with SWCs, based on Sentinel-1A data and the field-measured soil moisture, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and water cloud model (WCM). Field-measurement was based on satellite-synchronized 63 soil moisture samples, systematically collected from the two treatment slope positions, two treatment positions, and two depths. We employed ANOVA to compare samples and discern patterns along space and time. The result indicated that the LAI, a predictor of crop yield, was higher in the SWC treated watershed, demonstrating the potential of conserving moisture for boosting crop production. In addition, the results reveal that the higher soil moisture was recorded on the grasslands of the treated watershed at a depth of 15-30 cm, while the lowest was from croplands and eucalyptus trees at 0-15 cm depth. A higher correlation was observed between the measured and estimated soil moisture across three stages of crop development. The soil moisture estimation using WCM from the Sentinel-1 satellite data gives promising results with good correlation (R-2 = 0.69, 0.43 and 0.75, RMSE = 0.16, 2.24 and 0.02, and in Sholit (0.7539, 0.933, and 0.3673 and the RMSEs are 0.17%, 0.02%, and 1.02%) for different dates: August, September, and November 2020, respectively. We conclude that in the face of climate change-induced rainfall variability in tropical countries, predicted to elongate the dry spell during the cropping season, the accurate measurement of soil moistures with the mix of satellite and in-situ data could support rain-fed agriculture planning and assist in fine-tuning the climate adaptation measures at the local and regional scales.

TI  - Climate change impact on cryosphere and streamflow in the Upper Jhelum River Basin (UJRB) of north-western Himalayas
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The critical significance of keeping the current information about the extent and dynamics of the cryosphere in the Himalayas cannot be understated. The climate of the Himalayas is vulnerable and interlinked with global-scale climate changes, and the hydrology of the region mainly depends on the cryosphere. This is the first study that has created glacier and glacier lake inventory that links the impact of cryosphere on streamflow to land system dynamic changes under the changing climate of the Upper Jhelum River Basin (UJRB) of the Kashmir Himalayan region. This study uses a series of satellite data (1980-2016) to assess the depletion of snow cover area (SCA), deglaciation, and dynamics of glacial lakes. Moreover, observational long-term hydrometeorological data were used to understand the variability in temperature, precipitation, and track changes of land system dynamics under depletion of streamflow. The results suggested an overall rise in temperature (T-Max = 0.05 oC a(-1); T-Min = 0.02 oC a(-1); T-avg = 0.06 oC a(-1)) and a decrease in precipitation (2.9 mm a(-1)) between 1980 and 2016 with a significant increase in annual average temperature and decrease in annual precipitation at stations located at higher altitudes. The SCA showed a significantly decreasing (p < 0.01) trend in the glacierized sub-basins with an annual rate of decrease of -0.78% a(-1), -0.15% a(-1), -0.03% a(-1) -0.90% a(-1) for Lidder, Sindh, Vishow, and Rambiara sub-basins, respectively. The findings of this study reveal the high occurrence of glacier disintegration and deglaciation. During the period 2010-2016, a rapid rate of deglaciation was observed (18.34 +/- 0.14 km(2)), followed by 1992-2000 (15.61 +/- 0.13 km(2)). The average rate of retreat was observed to be 6.81 +/- 1.5 m a(-1) with a total retreat of 267 +/- 80 m during 1980-2016, which is higher than reported from surrounding mountain ranges in the Himalayas. The mapped 244 glacial and high-altitude lake inventory covers a total surface area of around 15 km(2), with 5.87 km(2) (40%) covered by 25 bedrock-dammed lakes. The glacial expansion and creation of new lakes are observed to be because of increasing glacier and snow melting between 1980 and 2016, which increases the risk of GLOF events in the future. The annual average discharge in UJRB significantly increased from 1991 to 1998 and was observed to be higher than the annual average of the respected gauge stations but shows significant depletion from 1998 onwards. The streamflow depletion under climate change is one of the reasons for land system dynamics in UJRB. The area under agriculture has decreased up to 63% with a massive expansion of built-up (399%), aquatic vegetation (523%), and plantation (765%) between 1992 and 2015.

TI  - Shifting cultivation induced burn area dynamics using ensemble approach in Northeast India
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying shifting cultivation areas and assessing their spatio-temporal dynamics are essential in framing climate-adaptive policies for efficient forest management and agriculture practices for the benefit of people. The current study attempts to develop an alternative approach to classify the shifting cultivation areas using an ensemble technique, integrating multiple spectral indices in three states of northeast India (NEI), such as Assam, Manipur, and Meghalaya. The adopted approach integrates green cover and leaf water content changes during shifting cultivation land preparation in Landsat imagery. The deforested burned area patches were identified based on threshold values using Landsat data-derived indices on vegetation, burned area and leaf water, and digital elevation model (DEM). The ensemble approach provided shifting cultivation maps with good overall accuracy (> 83%). The maximum shifting cultivation area was observed in Assam (126.87 km(2)), followed by Meghalaya (51.53 km(2)) and Manipur (46.04 km(2)) in 2016. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and NDVI difference performed better than other vegetation indices. The ensemble approach can be applied in other regions with minor modifications in threshold values, thus having the potential for accounting to shifting cultivation dynamics on an operational basis. Future research may include blending local traditional knowledge and modern scientific solutions for improved forest and land resources planning for the benefit of inhabitants and the mountain environment under the climate change scenarios.

TI  - Prediction of Soil Organic Carbon at Field Scale by Regression Kriging and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines Using Geophysical Covariates
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) is of crucial importance for improving crop productivity and assessing the effect of agronomic management strategies on crop response and soil quality. Incorporating secondary variables correlated to SOC allows using information often available at finer spatial resolution, such as proximal and remote sensing data, and improving prediction accuracy. In this study, two nonstationary interpolation methods were used to predict SOC, namely, regression kriging (RK) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), using as secondary variables electromagnetic induction (EMI) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data. Two GPR covariates, representing two soil layers at different depths, and X geographical coordinates were selected by both methods with similar variable importance. Unlike the linear model of RK, the MARS model also selected one EMI covariate. This result can be attributed to the intrinsic capability of MARS to intercept the interactions among variables and highlight nonlinear features underlying the data. The results indicated a larger contribution of GPR than of EMI data due to the different resolution of EMI from that of GPR. Thus, MARS coupled with geophysical data is recommended for prediction of SOC, pointing out the need to improve soil management to guarantee agricultural land sustainability.

TI  - <i>Anastrepha striata</i><SUP>1</SUP> Parasitic Wasps in Guava Crops at Fragmented Landscapes of Nayarit, Mexico
T2  - SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological control using native parasitoids is a sustainable alternative to control tephritid flies. We tested whether landscape attributes surrounding guava trees might affect incidence of fruit flies and their parasitoids. From July to September 2019, we collected guava fruit at six locations at Nayarit, Mexico. Pupae obtained from the fruit collected were reared in a laboratory until emergence of adult flies and parasitoids. We combined in situ georeferenced information with 2019 SPOT-7 satellite images to characterize the landscape in circular 500-m buffers. Spearman-rank tests were used to analyze correlation between abundance of Anastrepha striata and parasitoids with the proportion of each soil coverage. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate the influence of management intensity with abundance of the fruit fly and parasitoids. We collected 15.7 kg of guava fruit from six localities. Anastrepha striata was at all localities sampled. Infestation of fruit was 9.4%, ranging from 0.5 to 35.2 larvae per kilogram. The four parasitic wasp species attacking A. striata were Doryctobracon areolatus, Trichopria drosophilae, Aceratoneuromyia indica, and Leptopilina boulardi and are new records of interactions in the State of Nayarit. The wasps attacked 7.5% of the fruit fly pupae.

TI  - Adverse Events of Interest Following Influenza Vaccination in the First Season of Adjuvanted Trivalent Immunization: Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Vaccination is the most effective form of prevention of seasonal influenza; the United Kingdom has a national influenza vaccination program to cover targeted population groups. Influenza vaccines are known to be associated with some common minor adverse events of interest (AEIs), but it is not known if the adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV), first offered in the 2018/2019 season, would be associated with more AEIs than other types of vaccines. Objective: We aim to compare the incidence of AEIs associated with different types of seasonal influenza vaccines offered in the 2018/2019 season. Methods: We carried out a retrospective cohort study using computerized medical record data from the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre sentinel network database. We extracted data on vaccine exposure and consultations for European Medicines Agency-specified AEIs for the 2018/2019 influenza season. We used a self-controlled case series design; computed relative incidence (RI) of AEIs following vaccination; and compared the incidence of AEIs associated with aTIV, the quadrivalent influenza vaccine, and the live attenuated influenza vaccine. We also compared the incidence of AEIs for vaccinations that took place in a practice with those that took place elsewhere. Results: A total of 1,024,160 individuals received a seasonal influenza vaccine, of which 165,723 individuals reported a total of 283,355 compatible symptoms in the 2018/2019 season. Most AEIs occurred within 7 days following vaccination, with a seasonal effect observed. Using aTIV as the reference group, the quadrivalent influenza vaccine was associated with a higher incidence of AEIs (RI 1.46, 95% CI 1.41-1.52), whereas the live attenuated influenza vaccine was associated with a lower incidence of AEIs (RI 0.79, 95% CI 0.73-0.83). No effect of vaccination setting on the incidence of AEIs was observed. Conclusions: Routine sentinel network data offer an opportunity to make comparisons between safety profiles of different vaccines. Evidence that supports the safety of newer types of vaccines may be reassuring for patients and could help improve uptake in the future.

TI  - Remotely sensed trends in vegetation productivity and phenology during population decline of the Bathurst caribou (<i>Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus</i>) herd
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bathurst caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus ( Borowski, 1780)) herd declined from similar to 349 000 animals in 1996 to similar to 8200 in 2018. Climate-driven changes to tundra and boreal vegetation is one hypothesis for the decline. We modelled and mapped annual productivity and phenology across the herd's range using enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data derived from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series spanning 2000 -2017. Maximum annual EVI, growing season length, and time-integrated EVI increased significantly on 16%, 18%, and 49% of the core annual range, respectively. Trends toward longer growing seasons were driven entirely by earlier spring green-up and, along with time-integrated EVI, were most prevalent in tundra regions. Trends in forested regions were overwhelmingly related to the influence of forest fires, which burned more than half of the range below the forest -tundra ecotone since 1965. These trends suggest that climate-driven changes in production and phenology have occurred in the tundra and forest - tundra portions of the range and could have contributed to the recent herd decline. However, the trends may also be a result of herd decline itself, given the loss of this large herbivore from the landscape. Elucidating cause and effect will require comprehensive analysis of interactions between climatic variables, herd dynamics, and vegetation change, complemented by targeted field investigations.

TI  - A Computationally Efficient Method for Updating Fuel Inputs for Wildfire Behavior Models Using Sentinel Imagery and Random Forest Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbance events can happen at a temporal scale much faster than wildland fire fuel data updates. When used as input for wildland fire behavior models, outdated fuel datasets can contribute to misleading forecasts, which have implications for operational firefighting, mitigation, and wildland fire research. Remote sensing and machine learning methods can provide a solution for on-demand fuel estimation. Here, we show a proof of concept using C-band synthetic aperture radar and multispectral imagery, land cover classes, and tree mortality surveys to train a random forest classifier to estimate wildland fire fuel data in the East Troublesome Fire (Colorado) domain. The algorithm classified over 80% of the test dataset correctly, and the resulting wildland fire fuel data was used to simulate the East Troublesome Fire using the coupled atmosphere-wildland fire behavior model, WRF-Fire. The simulation using the modified fuel inputs, where 43% of original fuels are replaced with fuels representing dead trees, improved the burn area forecast by 38%. This study demonstrates the need for up-to-date fuel maps available in real time to provide accurate prediction of wildland fire spread, and outlines the methodology based on high-resolution satellite observations and machine learning that can accomplish this task.

TI  - The Status of the Riparian Forests in the Naryn Valley of Kyrgyzstan: Conservation and Sustainable Development
T2  - Grassroots Journal of Natural Resources
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation and restoration of riparian forests are important for strengthening river banks and preserving biodiversity as well as for mitigating impacts of climate change. Increasing temperature and climate variability, flooding and drought, alteration of the intensity of precipitation and melting glaciers in high mountain areas affect the physical condition of natural resources as well as natural hazards. Climate change might cause larger and potentially hazardous summer floods. The temporary storage of floodwaters in the floodplain areas reduces the flood risk downstream. In this paper, the current state of natural resources and the benefits of mountain floodplain forests is investigated. The satellite imagery was used to study the landscape changes for mapping the investigation areas. The assessment of changes is necessary for the further development of restorative plan for floodplain rivers. The results provide information on options for management and provide assistance to the local authorities engaged in the integrated management of natural resources.

TI  - Farmland Shelterbelt Age Mapping Using Landsat Time Series Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The age of a shelterbelt is not only an important parameter for determining the function of a shelterbelt, it is also strongly related to the biomass and carbon flux of shelterbelt ecosystems. Therefore, timely and accurate identifications of shelterbelt ages are key for shelterbelt monitoring and management. This study developed a method for estimating shelterbelt age (i.e., years after planting) from a time series of remote sensing images. Firstly, the shelterbelts were divided into three states based on a single remote sensing image of each. Then, a three-stage growth process was established by analysis. Finally, the shelterbelt ages were determined based on time series remote sensing images over a two-year monitoring period in the study area. The actual shelterbelt ages based on field measurements were used to analyze the accuracy of the results. The total number of samples was 243. The results showed that the age identification accuracy was 68.7%. The main factors affecting the identification accuracy were missing images, cloud cover, and the length of the monitoring period. Despite some uncertainties, the proposed method may be used to obtain critical data for shelterbelt management and conducting quick surveys of current shelterbelt conditions over a large area.

TI  - Permanent Laser Scanner and Synthetic Aperture Radar Data: Correlation Characterisation at a Sandy Beach
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, our knowledge of coastal environments has been enriched by remotely sensed data. In this research, we co-analyse two sensor systems: Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). To successfully extract information from a combination of different sensors systems, it should be understood how these interact with the common environment. TLS provides high-spatiotemporal-resolution information, but it has high economic costs and limited field of view. SAR systems, despite their lower resolution, provide complete, repeated, and frequent coverage. Moreover, Sentinel-1 SAR images are freely available. In the present work, Permanent terrestrial Laser Scanning (PLS) data, collected in Noordwijk (The Netherlands), are compared with simultaneous Sentinel-1 SAR images to investigate their combined use on coastal environments: knowing the relationship between SAR and PLS data, the SAR dataset could be correlated to beach characteristics. Meteorological and surface roughness have also been taken into consideration in the evaluation of the correlation between PLS and SAR data. A generally positive linear correlation factor up to 0.5 exists between PLS and SAR data. This correlation occurs for low- or moderate-wind-speed conditions, whilst no particular correlation has been highlighted for high wind intensity. Furthermore, a dependence of the linear correlation on the wind direction has been detected.

T2  - Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To examine the clinical effect of acellular bovine pericardium patch in implant based immediate breast reconstruction. Methods: The clinicopathological information of 141 breast cancer patients, who admitted to Department of Breast Reconstruction and Oncoplastic Surgery, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital, underwent immediate mammoplasty with implants combined with acellular bovine pericardium patches were analyzed from June 2016 to October 2019. All patients were female, with the age of (38.8±8.5) years (range: 13 to 60 years). The body mass index was (21.9±2.5) kg/m2 (range: 16.0 to 32.3 kg/m2). There were 39 cases of duct carcinoma in situ, 46 cases of stage Ⅰ, 40 cases of stage Ⅱ and 16 cases of stage Ⅲ. All patients received nipple-areola-sparing mastectomy or skin-sparing mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection, and prosthesis implantation with sub-pectoralis combined with breast patch. The correlation of clinicopathological characters and complications was assessed by t test, chi2 test, Fisher's exact probability method and Logistic regression. Pre-and post-operative aesthetic, quality of life scores were recorded. Results: The operation time (M(IQR)) was 3.6(1.5) hours (range: 3.0 to 6.5 hours). The early postoperative complication rate was 22.0% (31/141), prosthesis removal was the main postoperative complication, accounting for 64.5% (20/31) of the total complications, of which 15 cases occurred in the first 30 patients. The follow-up time was 28(8) months (range: 20 to 53 months), The most frequent long-term complications were capsular contracture and implant displacement, with the incidence of 11.2% (14/125) and 10.4% (13/125), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that prosthesis volume ≥300 ml (OR=8.173, 95%CI: 1.302 to 51.315, P=0.021) and peri-areolar incision (OR=7.809, 95%CI: 2.162 to 28.211, P<0.01) were independent relative factors for the occurrence of short-term postoperative local complications. After 2 years of operation, the score of breast appearance satisfaction was 71.7±15.5, postoperative effect satisfaction was 90.4±9.5, psychological satisfaction was 90.7±17.1, sexual satisfaction was 70.1±25.1. The immediate postoperative satisfaction rate at discharge was 95.4% (134/141), and 17.6% (22/125) of patients had the intention to received revision surgery. Conclusions: Prosthesis volume ≥300 ml and peri-areolar incision were independent realtive factors for short-term local complications after bovine pericardium patch combined with prosthesis implantation in the immediate breast reconstruction. After completing the learning curve, the postoperative complications of the procedure could be decreased.

TI  - Greenup dates change across a temperate forest-grassland ecotone in northeastern China driven by spring temperature and tree cover
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in climate and land cover are potential drivers of land surface phenology changes. Here, we investigate whether subpixel percent tree cover (PTC) change is an important driver of trends in satellite derived vegetation spring greenup date (GUD) across the Hulunbuir temperate forest-grassland ecotone in northeastern China. GUD was estimated using the MODIS-derived enhanced vegetation index time series during 2001-2020 with a spatial resolution of 500 m. To understand the influential mechanisms of PTC on GUD, we examined relationships between the spatial variations in GUD and PTC at multiple spatio-temporal extents. Forested pixels with greater PTC were found to have generally earlier GUDs for all forest types. The GUD of forests was also generally earlier than that of grassland. On the other hand, we observed approximately 23.7% and 1.2% significantly earlier and later trends in GUD across the region, respectively. Meanwhile, widespread increases in preseason land surface temperature (LST) and PTC were detected. Both increases in LST and PTC contributed to the earlier GUD in the forested region. Specifically, we found negative correlations (Spearman correlation coefficient-0.17 to-0.55) between the change slopes of GUD and PTC in every forest and grassland type. The results highlight the important impacts of subpixel PTC on GUD variations, and improve the understanding of ecosystem changes under the effects of climate and human activities (e.g., afforestation) over the Hulunbuir temperate forest grassland ecotone.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the process of target push-broom imaging by a temporally and spatially modulated spatial heterodyne interference imaging spectrometer (TS-SHIS), the push-broom error and positioning error of the pointing mirror and the satellite platform vibration can deviate the actual imaging position (x', y') of a target from its ideal position y). This results in spectral mixing between adjacent targets, affecting the interference data reconstruction and reducing the accuracy of recovery spectra. In light of the mechanism of TS-SHIS, this paper discussed the linear mixing of target spectra caused by motion errors and the influence of surface reflectance difference on the accuracy of recovery spectra. On this basis, the interference function of mixed targets was established with the mixing ratio of adjacent targets and the surface reflectance difference as variables. Further, we analyzed the surface reflectance differences of different spatial resolutions in China based on MODIS satellite payload data. Taking the relative spectral quadratic error as an evaluation function, we explored the effects of attitude parameters of a typical high-orbit platform on the accuracy of target recovery spectra with different spatial resolutions. This research provides a technical basis for the next generation of high-orbit greenhouse gas detection technology with high spatial and temporal resolutions.

TI  - Canopy gap characteristics and regeneration patterns in the Bialowieza forest based on remote sensing data and field measurements
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest dynamics is driven by the formation of gaps, especially in temperate forests. A potentially useful tool for identifying canopy gaps at different spatial scales is remote sensing. Our study used two types of data: (1) high spatial resolution Canopy Height Model (CHM) to detect canopy gaps in the forest and (2) field data to quantify natural and artificial regeneration within the gaps. The study aimed to: (i) measure the characteristics of canopy gaps; (ii) identify the regeneration patterns within gaps; (iii) identify the factors influencing tree species regeneration within gaps. We analysed 313 tree canopy gaps in the Polish part of Bialowieza Forest (ca. 620 km(2)), east Poland. Variability in the mean gap area was very high, ranging from 20.2 to 8693.8 m(2). The number of gaps with an area > 1000 m(2) was the largest. The total area of gaps was highest in coniferous stands, where the biggest median area was also found. Gap size did not affect regeneration density in the Bialowieza Forest, except for birch and hornbeam. The density of less light-demanding tree species in the gaps was greater than light demanding ones. Birch regenerated in all gap sizes, and its density increased with gap area. Oak seedlings dominated in small gaps but conditions in the 'matrix of small gaps' was sufficient for short oak saplings. Hornbeam regeneration was highest in the gaps surveyed, especially the density of short saplings. Seedlings of hornbeam were present in 32% of gaps, but saplings were present in as many as 56% of gaps. Spruce regeneration was less numerous than hornbeam regeneration. Birch regeneration was the most numerous in short sapling stage. We analyzed 31 variables from different categories to identify the factors influencing tree species regeneration within gaps. The most essential variables for the birch and hornbeam regeneration were those containing supporting information, especially the percentage of the specific tree species covering the land around the gap. The variables based on gap geometry (size, shape, direction, elongation) were less important than variables from other categories. We found the positive influence of browsing on the density of hornbeam saplings. However, the high density of ungulates and their browsing pressure hinder birch regeneration. Intensive browsing by ungulates seems to be the most important factor in changing species composition and forest regeneration structure in gaps.

TI  - Temporal Analysis of GNSS-Based Precipitable Water Vapor during Rainy Days over the Philippines from 2015 to 2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is a parameter used to estimate water vapor content in the atmosphere. In this study, estimates of PWV from PIMO, PLEG and PPPC global navigation satellite system (GNSS) stations are evaluated regarding the PWV obtained from its collocated radiosonde (RS) stations. GNSS PWV were highly correlated with RS PWV (R - 0.97). Mean bias error (MBE) between -0.18 mm and -13.39 mm, and root mean square error (RMSE) between 1.86 mm and 2.29 mm showed a good agreement between GNSS PWV and RS PWV. The variations of PWV are presented. Daily variations of PWV conformed to the daily data of rainfall which agrees to the climate types of Quezon City (Type I), Legaspi (Type II), and Puerto Princesa (Type III) based on the Coronas climate classification. Moreover, PWV monthly variation at all sites is high from May to October (similar to 62 mm) and low from November to April (similar to 57 mm). The relationship between PWV and rainfall at all stations showed positive correlation coefficients between +0.49 to +0.83. Meanwhile, it is observed that when PWV is high (low), its variability is low (high). This study shows the potential of GNSS to study water vapor and its contribution to weather analysis.

TI  - Quantitative Identification of Rural Functions Based on Big Data: A Case Study of Dujiangyan Irrigation District in Chengdu
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization increases the scales of urban spaces and the sizes of their populations, causing the functions in cities and towns to be in short supply. This study carries out functional space identification on the Dujiangyan elite irrigation area based on remote sensing data and point of interest (POI) data from Open Street Map (OSM), enabling the use of POI data to analyze rural functional spaces. Research and development and big data can greatly improve the accuracy of spatial function recognition, but research on rural spaces has limitations regarding the amount of available data. The Dujiangyan Irrigation District has low spatial aggregation levels for functions, scattered functions and linear distributions along roads. The mixing degrees of regional functions are low, the connections between functional elements are insufficient, and the comprehensive functional quality is low. The features of various functional elements in the region are significant, mostly in the discrete distribution mode, and functional compounding has become a trend. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate spatial resources and improve the centrality of cities and towns to realize the optimal allocation of resources and enable the development of surrounding cities and towns.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns of Cultivated Land Quality Integrated with Multi-Source Remote Sensing: A Case Study of Guangzhou, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientifically revealing the spatiotemporal patterns of cultivated land quality (CLQ) is crucial for increasing food production and achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger. Although studies on the evaluation of CLQ have been conducted, an effective evaluation system that is suitable for the macro-regional scale has not yet been developed. In this study, we first defined the CLQ from four aspects: soil fertility, natural conditions, construction level, and cultivated land productivity. Then, eight indicators were selected by integrating multi-source remote sensing data to create a new CLQ evaluation system. We assessed the spatiotemporal patterns of CLQ in Guangzhou, China, from 2010 to 2018. In addition, we identified the main factors affecting the improvement of CLQ. The results showed that the CLQ continuously improved in Guangzhou from 2010 to 2018. The area of high-quality cultivated land increased by 13.7%, which was mainly distributed in the traditional agricultural areas in the northern and eastern regions of Guangzhou. The areas of medium- and low-quality cultivated land decreased by 8.1% and 5.6%, respectively, which were scattered throughout the whole study area. The soil fertility and high productivity capacity were the main obstacle factors that affected the improvement of CLQ. Simultaneously, the obstacle degree of stable productivity capacity gradually increased during the study period. Therefore, the targeted improvement measures could be put forward by applying biofertilizers, strengthening crop management and constructing well-facilitated farmland. The new CLQ evaluation system we proposed is particularly practical at the macro-regional scale, and the results provided targeted guidance for decision makers to improve CLQ and promote food security.

TI  - The influence of contrasting fire management practice on bush encroachment: Lessons from Bwabwata National Park, Namibia
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions Bush encroachment, (i.e. disproportionate woody vegetation increase at the cost of grassland) has negative impacts for biodiversity conservation and tourism by homogenising habitat structure and decreasing grazing and game-viewing. While herbivory, rainfall, and CO2 all influence changes in woody vegetation cover, fire has the best potential for vegetation management. Changes in fire management can either encourage or suppress bush encroachment and a better understanding of how changes in fire regime affect vegetation structure is needed. Therefore, this study addressed three questions: (a) how has woody cover changed over two decades (1999-2019); (b) what is the role of land use, rainfall, and fire in influencing woody cover change; and (c) what are the management implications? Location Bwabwata National Park (BNP), Namibia. Methods The study used a novel combination of repeat ground photography and satellite-based remote-sensing products to explore the change in woody vegetation in relation to rainfall, land use, and fire seasonality. Results Woody vegetation has increased by 13% since 1999 in BNP. Change in vegetation structure differed in the east and west of the park. Early-season burns in the east of the park were associated with an increase in trees over 3 m tall consisting primarily of Dialium englerianum, Terminalia sericea and Burkea africana. Repetitive late dry-season fires in the west of the park were associated with an increase in shrubs under 3 m dominated by Baphia massaiensis and Terminalia sericea. Conclusions Both early- and late-season fires are of value in management of bush encroachment. Early dry-season fires appear to reduce the rate of bush encroachment and contribute to maintaining a heterogeneous vegetation structure. This fire management strategy reduces wildfire risk, conserves biodiversity, and promotes tourism and is, therefore, recommended for the park.

TI  - Impact of Rainfall Variability and Land Use Change on River Discharge in South Cameroon
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change, variability and anthropogenic forcings such as land use change are the main forcings of river discharge variability. However, an understanding of their simultaneous impacts on river discharge remains limited in some parts of the world. To shed light on this issue, the objective of this article is to investigate the effects of rainfall variability and land use change on river discharge in the Nyong basin (at Olama and Mbalmayo gauging stations) and some of its sub-basins (So'o and Mefou) over the long period 1950-2018. To achieve this goal, hydro-meteorological data of the Nyong basin and sub-basins were analyzed using the Pettitt test. Likewise, land use changes in the basin and sub-basins were also analyzed using supervised classifications of Landsat satellite images of the basins at different periods (1973, 2000 and 2018). On the annual scale, rainfall has decreased statistically over the studied basins. In the large basins (Olama and Mbalmayo), this decrease in rainfall is synchronous with that of discharges, while it is concomitant with an increase in the Mefou (small basin). After the ruptures within time series identified in the annual modules, the extreme discharges (maximum and minimum) decreased in Olama; in Mbalmayo, the maximum discharges remained stable while the minimum discharges decreased. On the other hand, the maximum and minimum discharges have significantly increased in the Mefou. The stability of maximum discharges at Mbalmayo and the increase in extremes on the Mefou in a context where the precipitation that generates the discharge has decreased can be attributed to land use change. These changes are essentially marked by an increase in impervious areas and a reduction in forest cover. On the seasonal scale, the impact of precipitation in the dry season is visible on the flows of the rainy seasons that follow them on the large basins (Olama and Mbalmayo). Between the decades 1970-1990 and 2000-2010, there was respectively a significant increase, then a decrease in summer precipitation, which impacted the autumn discharges in the same direction. Conversely, between the same intervals, there was a significant decrease, then a slight increase in winter precipitation. The impact of winter precipitation on the spring discharge is more visible during the first period only (1970-1990). During the second period, winter precipitation seems to have more of an impact on the runoff for the same season. In the Mefou sub-basin, the precipitation plays an essentially amplifying role in the increase in discharge in the seasons during which they occur. Those having experienced an increase, or a maintenance of precipitation (summer and spring) recorded the most significant increases in discharges. These results could be useful for long-term planning on the demand and use of water, as well as flood management in the basins

TI  - Mapping Forest Aboveground Biomass Using Multisource Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The majority of the aboveground biomass on the Earth's land surface is stored in forests. Thus, forest biomass plays a critical role in the global carbon cycle. Yet accurate estimate of forest aboveground biomass (FAGB) remains elusive. This study proposed a new conceptual model to map FAGB using remotely sensed data from multiple sensors. The conceptual model, which provides guidance for selecting remotely sensed data, is based on the principle of estimating FAGB on the ground using allometry, which needs species, diameter at breast height (DBH), and tree height as inputs. Based on the conceptual model, we used multiseasonal Landsat images to provide information about species composition for the forests in the study area, LiDAR data for canopy height, and the image texture and image texture ratio at two spatial resolutions for tree crown size, which is related to DBH. Moreover, we added RaDAR data to provide canopy volume information to the model. All the data layers were fed to a Random Forest (RF) regression model. The study was carried out in eastern North Carolina. We used biomass from the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis plots to train and test the model performance. The best model achieved an R-2 of 0.625 with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 18.8 Mg/ha (47.6%) with the "out-of-bag" samples at 30 x 30 m spatial resolution. The top five most important variables include the 95th, 85th, 75th, and 50th percentile heights of the LiDAR points and their standard deviations of 85th heights. Numerous features from multiseasonal Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR, multiseasonal Landsat 8 imagery along with image texture features from very high-resolution imagery were selected. But the importance of the height metrics dwarfed all other variables. More tests of the conceptual model in places with a broader range of biomass and more diverse species composition are needed to evaluate the importance of other input variables.

TI  - Irrigation Mapping on Two Contrasted Climatic Contexts Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to propose an operational approach to map irrigated areas based on the synergy of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data. An application is proposed at two study sites in Europe-in Spain and in Italy-with two climatic contexts (semiarid and humid, respectively), with the objective of proving the essential role of multi-site training for a robust application of the proposed methodologies. Several classifiers are proposed to separate irrigated and rainfed areas. They are based on statistical variables from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series data at the agricultural field scale, as well as on the contrasted behavior between the field scale and the 5 km surroundings. The support vector machine (SVM) classification approach was tested with different options to evaluate the robustness of the proposed methodologies. The optimal number of metrics found is five. These metrics illustrate the importance of optical/radar synergy and the consideration of multi-scale spatial information. The highest accuracy of the classifications, approximately equal to 85%, is based on training dataset with mixed reference fields from the two study sites. In addition, the accuracy is consistent at the two study sites. These results confirm the potential of the proposed approaches towards the most general use on sites with different climatic and agricultural contexts.

TI  - Assessment of Climate-Driven Variations in Malaria Transmission in Senegal Using the VECTRI Model
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, are sensitive to climate and weather conditions. When unusual conditions prevail, for example, during periods of heavy rainfall, mosquito populations can multiply and trigger epidemics. This study, which consists of better understanding the link between malaria transmission and climate factors at a national level, aims to validate the VECTRI model (VECtor borne disease community model of ICTP, TRIeste) in Senegal. The VECTRI model is a grid-distributed dynamical model that couples a biological model for the vector and parasite life cycles to a simple compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) representation of the disease progression in the human host. In this study, a VECTRI model driven by reanalysis data (ERA-5) was used to simulate malaria parameters, such as the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) in Senegal. In addition to the ERA5-Land daily reanalysis rainfall, other daily rainfall data come from different meteorological products, including the CPC Global Unified Gauge-Based Analysis of Daily Precipitation (CPC for Climate Prediction Center), satellite data from the African Rainfall Climatology 2.0 (ARC2), and the Climate Hazards InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). Observed malaria data from the National Malaria Control Program in Senegal (PNLP/Programme National de Lutte contre le Paludisme au Senegal) and outputs from the climate data used in this study were compared. The findings highlight the unimodal shape of temporal malaria occurrence, and the seasonal malaria transmission contrast is closely linked to the latitudinal variation of the rainfall, showing a south-north gradient over Senegal. This study showed that the peak of malaria takes place from September to October, with a lag of about one month from the peak of rainfall in Senegal. There is an agreement between observations and simulations about decreasing malaria cases on time. These results indicate that the southern area of Senegal is at the highest risk of malaria spread outbreaks. The findings in the paper are expected to guide community-based early-warning systems and adaptation strategies in Senegal, which will feed into the national malaria prevention, response, and care strategies adapted to the needs of local communities.

TI  - Combining Object-Based Machine Learning with Long-Term Time-Series Analysis for Informal Settlement Identification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Informal settlement mapping is essential for planning, as well as resource and utility management. Developing efficient ways of determining the properties of informal settlements (when, where, and who) is critical for upgrading services and planning. Remote sensing data are increasingly used to understand built environments. In this study, we combine two sources of data, very-high-resolution imagery and time-series Landsat data, to identify and describe informal settlements. The indicators characterising informal settlements were grouped into four different spatial and temporal levels: environment, settlement, object and time. These indicators were then used in an object-based machine learning (ML) workflow to identify informal settlements. The proposed method had a 95% overall accuracy at mapping informal settlements. Among the spatial and temporal levels examined, the contribution of the settlement level indicators was most significant in the ML model, followed by the object-level indicators. Whilst the temporal level did not contribute greatly to the classification of informal settlements, it provided a way of understanding when the settlements were formed. The adaptation of this method would allow the combination of a wide-ranging and diverse group of indicators in a comprehensive ML framework.

TI  - Evaluation of vegetation indices and imaging spectroscopy to estimate foliar nitrogen across disparate biomes
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The nitrogen content in plant foliar tissues (foliar N) regulates photosynthetic capacity and has a major impact on global biogeochemical cycles. Despite its importance, a robust, time, and cost-effective methodology to estimate variation in foliar N concentration across globally represented terrestrial systems does not exist. Although advances in remote sensing data have enabled landscape-scale foliar N predictions, improved accuracy is needed to effectively capture variation in foliar N across ecosystems. Airborne remote sensing imagery was analyzed in conjunction with ground-sampled foliar chemistry data (n = 692), provided by the NEON, to predict foliar N at sites across the United States covering a variety of plant communities and climate types. We developed indices from novel two-band combinations that predicted foliar N more accurately than existing indices (approximate to 8% improvement across all sites and a 45% improvement in arid sites). Compared with two-band indices, we increased accuracy and decreased bias of foliar N predictions by using full-spectrum reflectance information and partial least squares regression (PLSR) models (R-2 = 0.638; root mean square error = 0.440). Significant wavelengths included red edge (720-765 nm), near infrared (NIR) reflectance at 1125 nm, and shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance at 2050 and 2095 nm, which are regions indicative of foliar traits such as growth type (e.g., leaf area index with NIR) and photosynthetic parameters (e.g., chlorophyll and Rubisco with red and SWIR reflectance, respectively). With the confluence of rapid increases in computing power, several forthcoming or recently launched hyperspectral missions, and the development of large-scale environmental research observatories worldwide, we have an exciting opportunity to estimate foliar N across larger spatial areas covering more diverse biomes than ever before. We anticipate that these predictions will prove to be invaluable in helping to constrain biogeochemical model uncertainties across a global range of terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Assessment of Soil Organic Carbon Change Using Machine-Learning in Arid Regions
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an essential property of soil, and understanding its spatial patterns is critical to understanding vegetation management, soil degradation, and environmental issues. This study applies a framework using remote sensing data and digital soil mapping techniques to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOC for the Yazd-Ardakan Plain, Iran, from 1986 to 2016. Here, a conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method was used to select 201 sampling sites. A set of 37 environmental predictors were obtained from Landsat imagery taken in 1986, 1999, 2010 and 2016. Here, SOC was modeled for 2016 using the Random Forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural networks (ANN) machine-learners by correlating environmental predictors with soil data. The results showed that RF yielded the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.53), compared to the other two learners. By performing a variable importance analysis of the RF model, normalized difference vegetation index, modified vegetation index, and ground-adjusted vegetation index were determined to be the most important environmental predictors. By applying the model calibrated from 2016 data to 1986, 1999 and 2010, the results showed a substantial decrease in SOC; these decreases in SOC were mainly attributed to land use changes and agricultural activities.

TI  - A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for the Bias Correction of SST Numerical Forecast Products Using Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) has important practical value in ocean related fields. Numerical prediction is a common method for forecasting SST at present. However, the forecast results produced by the numerical forecast models often deviate from the actual observation data, so it is necessary to correct the bias of the numerical forecast products. In this paper, an SST correction approach based on the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network with multiple attention mechanisms is proposed, which considers the spatio-temporal relations in SST data. The proposed model is appropriate for correcting SST numerical forecast products by using satellite remote sensing data. The approach is tested in the region of the South China Sea and reduces the root mean squared error (RMSE) to 0.35 degrees C. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach is significantly better than existing models, including traditional statistical methods, machine learning based methods, and deep learning methods.

TI  - OC4-SO: A New Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Algorithm for the Western Antarctic Peninsula Using Multi-Sensor Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) underestimation by global satellite algorithms in the Southern Ocean has long been reported, reducing their accuracy, and limiting the potential for evaluating phytoplankton biomass. As a result, several regional Chl-a algorithms have been proposed. The present work aims at assessing the performance of both global and regional satellite algorithms that are currently available for the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and investigate which factors are contributing to the underestimation of Chl-a. Our study indicates that a global algorithm, on average, underestimates in-situ Chl-a by ~59%, although underestimation was only observed for waters with Chl-a > 0.5 mg m(-3). In high Chl-a waters (>1 mg m(-3)), Chl-a underestimation rose to nearly 80%. Contrary to previous studies, no clear link was found between Chl-a underestimation and the pigment packaging effect, nor with the phytoplankton community composition and sea ice contamination. Based on multi-sensor satellite data and the most comprehensive in-situ dataset ever collected from the WAP, a new, more accurate satellite Chl-a algorithm is proposed: the OC4-SO. The OC4-SO has great potential to become an important tool not only for the ocean colour community, but also for an effective monitoring of the phytoplankton communities in a climatically sensitive region where in-situ data are scarce.

TI  - Integrating GEDI and Landsat: Spaceborne Lidar and Four Decades of Optical Imagery for the Analysis of Forest Disturbances and Biomass Changes in Italy
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a prominent role in the battle against climate change, as they absorb a relevant part of human carbon emissions. However, precisely because of climate change, forest disturbances are expected to increase and alter forests' capacity to absorb carbon. In this context, forest monitoring using all available sources of information is crucial. We combined optical (Landsat) and photonic (GEDI) data to monitor four decades (1985-2019) of disturbances in Italian forests (11 Mha). Landsat data were confirmed as a relevant source of information for forest disturbance mapping, as forest harvestings in Tuscany were predicted with omission errors estimated between 29% (in 2012) and 65% (in 2001). GEDI was assessed using Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data available for about 6 Mha of Italian forests. A good correlation (r(2) = 0.75) between Above Ground Biomass Density GEDI estimates (AGBD) and canopy height ALS estimates was reported. GEDI data provided complementary information to Landsat. The Landsat mission is capable of mapping disturbances, but not retrieving the three-dimensional structure of forests, while our results indicate that GEDI is capable of capturing forest biomass changes due to disturbances. GEDI acquires useful information not only for biomass trend quantification in disturbance regimes but also for forest disturbance discrimination and characterization, which is crucial to further understanding the effect of climate change on forest ecosystems.

TI  - Outbreak Response Capacity Assessments and Improvements Among Public Health Department Health Care-Associated Infection Programs-United States, 2015-2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded $85 million to health care-associated infection and antibiotic resistance (HAI/AR) programs in March 2015 as part of Infection Control Assessment and Response (ICAR) activities in the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity cooperative agreement Domestic Ebola Supplement. Program: One goal of this funding was to assess and improve program capacity to respond to potential health care outbreaks (eg, HAI clusters). All 55 funded programs (in 49 state and 6 local health departments) participated. Implementation: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed guidance and tools for HAI/AR programs to document relevant response capacities, assess policies, and measure progress. HAI/AR programs completed an interim assessment in 2016 and a final progress report in 2017. Evaluation: During the project period, 78% (n = 43) of the programs developed new investigation tools, 85% (n = 47) trained staff on outbreak response, and 96% (n = 53) of the programs reported hiring staff to assist with outbreak response activities. Staffing and expertise to support HAI outbreak response increased substantially among awardees reporting staffing limitations on the interim assessment, including in domains such as on-site infection control assessment (n = 20; 83%), laboratory capacity (n = 20; 91%), and data management/analytics (n = 14; 67%). By 2017, reporting requirements in 100% of the programs addressed possible HAI/AR outbreaks; 93% (n = 51) also addressed sentinel events such as identification of novel AR threats. More than 90% (n = 50) of programs enhanced capacities for tracking response activities; in 2016, these systems captured 6665 events (range, 3-1379; median = 46). Health departments also reported wide-ranging efforts to engage regulatory, public health, and health care partners to improve HAI/AR outbreak reporting and investigation. Discussion: Broad capacity for responding to HAI/AR outbreaks was enhanced using Ebola ICAR supplemental funding. As response activities expand, health department programs will be challenged to continue building expertise, reporting infrastructure, investigation resources, and effective relations with health care partners.

TI  - Comparison of Daily and Monthly Intra-urban Thermal Reactions Based on LCZ Classification Using Surface and Air Temperature Data
T2  - GEOGRAPHICA PANNONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban air (T-a) and surface (T-s) temperature patterns depend mainly on the surface cover conditions. WUDAPT methodology was used to create the local climate zone (LCZ) map of Szeged (Hungary) providing detailed information about the structure of the urban area. The seasonal and monthly variations of simultaneous measurements of T-a (urban network) and T-s (MODIS) in different LCZs were analysed for a four-year period. The results show that the largest differences between T-s and T-a values occur in late spring and summer. During the day, the monthly mean T-s was much higher than the mean T-a, while at night, the T-a exceeded the T-s in all LCZs. Linear statistical relationship was also analysed, which concluded that diurnal and nocturnal T-a and T(s )are strongly correlated in all LCZs in Szeged.

TI  - Mapping of Rill Erosion of the Middle Volga (Russia) Region Using Deep Neural Network
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion worldwide is an intense, poorly controlled process. In many respects, this is a consequence of the lack of up-to-date high-resolution erosion maps. All over the world, the problem of insufficient information is solved in different ways, mainly on a point-by-point basis, within local areas. Extrapolation of the results obtained locally to a more extensive territory produces inevitable uncertainties and errors. For the anthropogenic-developed part of Russia, this problem is especially urgent because the assessment of the intensity of erosion processes, even with the use of erosion models, does not reach the necessary scale due to the lack of all the required global large-scale remote sensing data and the complexity of considering regional features of erosion processes over such vast areas. This study aims to propose a new methodology for large-scale automated mapping of rill erosion networks based on Sentinel-2 data. A LinkNet deep neural network with a DenseNet encoder was used to solve the problem of automated rill erosion mapping. The recognition results for the study area of more than 345,000 sq. km were summarized to a grid of 3037 basins and analyzed to assess the relationship with the main natural-anthropogenic factors. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to model the dependency of rill erosion density to explore complex relationships. A complex nonlinear relationship between erosion processes and topographic, meteorological, geomorphological, and anthropogenic factors was shown.

TI  - Effects of Climate and Anthropogenic Drivers on Surface Water Area in the Southeastern United States
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water is the most readily accessible water resource and provides an array of ecosystem services, but its availability and access are stressed by changes in climate, land cover, and population size. Understanding drivers of surface water dynamics in space and time is key to better managing our water resources. However, few studies estimating changes in surface water account for climate and anthropogenic drivers both independently and together. We used 19 years (2000-2018) of the newly developed Dynamic Surface Water Extent Landsat Science Product in concert with time series of precipitation, temperature, land cover, and population size to statistically model maximum seasonal percent surface water area as a function of climate and anthropogenic drivers in the southeastern United States. We fitted three statistical models (linear mixed effects, random forests, and mixed effects random forests) and three groups of explanatory variables (climate, anthropogenic, and their combination) to assess the accuracy of estimating percent surface water area at the watershed scale with different drivers. We found that anthropogenic drivers accounted for approximately 37% more of the variance in the percent surface water area than the climate variables. The combination of variables in the mixed effects random forest model produced the smallest mean percent errors (mean -0.17%) and the highest explained variance (R-2 0.99). Our results indicate that anthropogenic drivers have greater influence when estimating percent surface water area than climate drivers, suggesting that water management practices and land-use policies can be highly effective tools in controlling surface water variations in the Southeast.

TI  - Classification of Geomorphic Units and Their Relevance for Nutrient Retention or Export of a Large Lowland Padma River, Bangladesh: A NDVI Based Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geomorphic classification of large rivers identifies morphological patterns, as a foundation for estimating biogeochemical and ecological processes. In order to support the modelling of in-channel nutrient retention or export, the classification of geomorphic units (GUs) was done in the Padma River, Bangladesh, a large and geomorphically-complex lowland river. GUs were classified using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) four times over a year, so as to cover the seasonal variation of water flows. GUs were categorized as primary and secondary channels (C & S); longitudinal bar (L); transverse bar (T); side bar (SB); unvegetated bank (EK); dry channel (ED); island (VI); and water depression (WD). All types of GUs were observed over the four distinct annual seasons, except ED, which was absent during the high flow, monsoon season. Seasonal variation of the surface area of GUs and discharge showed an inverse relation between discharge and exposed surface areas of VI, L, T, and SB. Nutrients mainly enter the river system through water and sediments, and during monsoon, the maximum portion of emergent GUs were submerged. Based on the assumption that nutrient retention is enhanced in the seasonally inundated portions of GUs, nutrient retention-/export-relevant geomorphic units (NREGUs) were identified. Seasonal variation in the area of NREGUs was similar to that of GUs. The mean NDVI values of the main identified NREGUs were different. The variation of NDVI values among seasons in these NREGUs resulted from changes of vegetation cover and type. The variation also occurred due to alteration of the surface area of GUs in different seasons. The changes of vegetation cover indicated by NDVI values across seasons are likely important drivers for biogeochemical and ecological processes.

TI  - Early Detection of <i>Dendroctonus valens</i> Infestation with Machine Learning Algorithms Based on Hyperspectral Reflectance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The red turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus valens LeConte) has caused severe ecological and economic losses since its invasion into China. It gradually spreads northeast, resulting in many Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis Carr.) deaths. Early detection of D. valens infestation (i.e., at the green attack stage) is the basis of control measures to prevent its outbreak and spread. This study examined the changes in spectral reflectance after initial attacking of D. valens. We also explored the possibility of detecting early D. valens infestation based on spectral vegetation indices and machine learning algorithms. The spectral reflectance of infested trees was significantly different from healthy trees (p < 0.05), and there was an obvious decrease in the near-infrared region (760-1386 nm; p < 0.01). Spectral vegetation indices were input into three machine learning classifiers; the classification accuracy was 72.5-80%, while the sensitivity was 65-85%. Several spectral vegetation indices (DID, CUR, TBSI, DDn(2), D-735, SR1, NSMI, R-NIR center dot CRI550 and RVSI) were sensitive indicators for the early detection of D. valens damage. Our results demonstrate that remote sensing technology could be successfully applied to early detect D. valens infestation and clarify the sensitive spectral regions and vegetation indices, which has important implications for early detection based on unmanned airborne vehicle and satellite data.

TI  - Reclassification of <i>Enterobacter</i> sp. FY-07 as <i>Kosakonia oryzendophytica</i> FY-07 and Its Potential to Promote Plant Growth
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise classification of bacteria facilitates prediction of their ecological niche. The genus Enterobacter includes pathogens of plants and animals but also beneficial bacteria that may require reclassification. Here, we propose reclassification of Enterobacter FY-07 (FY-07), a strain that has many plant-growth-promoting traits and produces bacterial cellulose (BC), to the Kosakonia genera. To re-examine the taxonomic position of FY-07, a polyphasic approach including 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, ATP synthase beta subunit (atpD) gene sequence analysis, DNA gyrase (gyrB) gene sequence analysis, initiation translation factor 2 (infB) gene sequence analysis, RNA polymerase beta subunit (rpoB) gene sequence analysis, determination of DNA G + C content, average nucleotide identity based on BLAST, in silico DNA-DNA hybridization and analysis of phenotypic features was applied. This polyphasic analysis suggested that Enterobacter sp. FY-07 should be reclassified as Kosakonia oryzendophytica FY-07. In addition, the potential of FY-07 to promote plant growth was also investigated by detecting related traits and the colonization of FY-07 in rice roots.

TI  - Coseismic and Postseismic Fault Kinematics of the July 22, 2020, Nima (Tibet) Ms6.6 Earthquake: Implications of the Forming Mechanism of the Active N-S-Trending Grabens in Qiangtang, Tibet
T2  - TECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The N-S-trending grabens, the most prominent active structures in the Tibetan plateau, contain important information about the evolution and deformation mechanism of the plateau. The Ms6.6 earthquake that occurred in Nima, Qiangtang on July 22, 2020, provides an opportunity to investigate the kinematics of the grabens. Here, we use field survey and interferometric synthetic aperture radar to study the structural style, coseismic and postseismic deformation, fault slip, and stress changes of the Nima earthquake. The N-S-trending Qomo Ri graben (QRG) and the normal faults on the east and west sides are kinematically correlated with the NE-trending sinistral Jiangaizangbu River and West Yibug Caka faults. The QRG is characterized by an extensional strike-slip duplex and negative flower structure. The maximum coseismic deformation of the Nima earthquake is 29.4 cm in the line-of-sight direction observed by Sentinel-1 ascending images. The coseismic slip model demonstrates that the NE20-30 degrees-striking fault caused the Nima earthquake has a maximum slip of 1.39 m and a main slip area at 4-12 km depth. The seismological fault may transit from a moderately dipping normal fault near the surface to a steeper strike-slip fault at depth. Obvious postseismic deformation was observed in the stress-enhancement area. The afterslip model shows that the mainshock fault is correlated with parallel normal faults to its west. We infer that the QRG was formed by local E-W-trending extension at the joints of the left-stepping sinistral fault system, and the active normal faulting in the Qiangtang block favors stress localization.

TI  - Assessing Ecological Quality Based on Remote Sensing Images in Wugong Mountain
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study takes multitemporal Landsat images as data source to explore the changes of Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) and ecological quality (EQ) of the Wugong Mountain (WGM). The regression model obtained from MODIS NDVI data was used to correct the temporal difference of Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data in 2019, and the Remote Sensing based Ecological Index (RSEI) was calculated to assess the change of FVC and EQ in WGM. Results showed that, in the past 25 yr, the mean value of FVC has increased from 0.795 in 1994 to 0.890 in 2019, which consequently improved EQ from 0.746 to 0.773 respectively. The relationship among topographic factors, FVC and EQ was analyzed by using elevation, slope, and aspect. The effect of topographic factor on FVC and EQ in WGM was in the order of slope, aspect, and elevation. The value of FVC and RSEI increased first and then decreased with increment of elevation and slope. In detail, the favorable terrain of FVC and EQ was the area with an elevation of 500-1,400 m and a slope of 8 degrees-35 degrees. The value of FVC and RSEI in semi-sunny and sunny slopes were higher than that of shady slopes. The unfavorable terrain of FVC and EQ was the area of the meadow with an elevation greater than 1,700 m. This work highlights the importance of FVC and EQ which can provide scientific decision-making for the sustainability of WGM, and coordinate development of ecological environment protection and economic construction.

AB  - Recent decades have shown that the relationship between religion and modernity has gone beyond classical theses in the West. In this article I argue that the link between these two constructs is one of complex coexistence, particularly in Catholicism. Through internal transformations, the institution has built a field from which to continue influencing the management of politics and law. Since the 1980s, Christian-inspired collectives have been articulated at the global level and among civil society, making use of their participants' dual condition of laypersons and believing citizens, to influence the normative ordering of societies from a deprivatizing perspective. Based on the theoretical apparatus proposed by Jose Casanova, I argue that this deprivatization movement is a strategy in the face of the growing process of societal secularization and the tension of the privatization/deprivatization dichotomy through contemporary dynamics of political mobilization. In order to understand this movement through the laity, the article focuses on the study of Christian-inspired discourses from members of Spanish Neo-conservative collectives. The fieldwork was carried out between 2017 and 2018 in Madrid, Bilbao and Pamplona, three of the most active cities in Christian-inspired mobilizations. Based on the discourse analysis of interviews, of non-participant observations of such mobilizations, and of Vatican documents and deprivatization collectives, the article allows us to understand how this institution has stimulated the laity to mobilize in the public space in defence of Catholic worldview as a form of political repositioning.

TI  - Romantic Love, Gender Imbalance and Feminist Readings in Iris Murdoch's <i>The Sea, The Sea</i>
T2  - CRITICAL SURVEY
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though Iris Murdoch's novels depict a profoundly patriarchal society, most scholars have generally failed to identify any feminist aspirations in her work. This article aims to reassess her legacy as a writer by analysing from a feminist perspective one of her most acclaimed novels, The Sea, The Sea (1978). The tension between the androcentric approach of a self-deluded male narrator and a female author whose worldview is strongly influenced by her gender results in a feminist critique which is not based on the recovery of a female voice, but on the exploration of patriarchy within the novel and the production of a feminist epistemology derived from a dialogue between Murdoch's fiction and philosophy.

TI  - Detection of Fake Remote-Sensing Data
T2  - OPTICAL MEMORY AND NEURAL NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with the detection of counterfeit remote-sensing data. A remote sensing data detector is considered that uses the neural-net identification of spectral artifacts typical of adversarial generators. The detector is employed to spot the remote-sensing image inpainting produced by an edge-generator-aided generative adversarial neural nets. Not only images with solid inpainted regions, but also images with separate inpainted areas are processed. In the process we use different types of remote-sensing images of various resolutions, inpainting portions being of different sizes and shapes. The experiment proved that the spectral neural-net detector is an effective tool for detecting fake remote-sensing data.

TI  - Satellite Multi-Sensor Data Fusion for Soil Clay Mapping Based on the Spectral Index and Spectral Bands Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating satellite data at different resolutions (i.e., spatial, spectral, and temporal) can be a helpful technique for acquiring soil information from a synoptic point of view. This study aimed to evaluate the advantage of using satellite mono- and multi-sensor image fusion based on either spectral indices or entire spectra to predict the topsoil clay content. To this end, multispectral satellite images acquired by various sensors (i.e., Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and Sentinel2-MultiSpectral Instrument (S2-MSI)) have been used to assess their potential in identifying bare soil pixels over an area in northeastern Tunisia, the Lebna and Chiba catchments. A spectral index image and a spectral bands image are generated for each satellite sensor (i.e., TM, OLI, ASTER, and S2-MSI). Then, two multi-sensor satellite image fusions are generated, one from the spectral index images and the other from spectral bands. The resulting spectral index and spectral band images based on mono-and multi-sensor satellites are compared through their spectral patterns and ability to predict the topsoil clay content using the Multilayer Perceptron with backpropagation learning algorithm (MLP-BP) method. The results suggest that for clay content prediction: (i) the spectral bands' images outperformed the spectral index images regardless of the used satellite sensor; (ii) the fused images derived from the spectral index or bands provided the best performances, with a 10% increase in the prediction accuracy; and (iii) the bare soil images obtained by the fusion of many multispectral sensor satellite images can be more beneficial than using mono-sensor images. Soil maps elaborated via satellite multi-sensor data fusion might become a valuable tool for soil survey, land planning, management, and precision agriculture.

TI  - A Geospatial Approach for Analysis of Drought Impacts on Vegetation Cover and Land Surface Temperature in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a common event in Iraq's climate, and the country has severely suffered from drought episodes in the last two decades. The Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) is geographically situated in the semi-arid zone in Iraq, whose water resources have been limited in the last decades and mostly shared with other neighboring countries. To analyze drought impacts on the vegetation cover and the land surface temperature in the KRI for a span of 20 years from 1998 to 2017, remote sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) have been adopted in this study. For this study, 120 Landsat satellite images were downloaded and utilized, whereas six images covering the entire study area were used for each year of the study period. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surfaces Temperature Index (LST) were applied to produce multi-temporal classified drought maps. Changes in the area and values of the classified NDVI and LST were calculated and mapped. Mann-Kendall and Sen's Slope statistical tests were used to assess the variability of drought indices variation in 60 locations in the study area. The results revealed increases in severity and frequency of drought over the study period, particularly in the years 2000 and 2008, which were characterized by an increase in land surface temperatures, a decrease in vegetation area cover, and a lack of precipitation averages. Climate conditions affect the increase/decrease of the vegetated cover area, and geographical variability is also one factor that significantly influences the distribution of vegetation. It can be concluded that the southeast and southwestern parts of the KRI were subjected to the most severe droughts over the past 20 years.

TI  - Effects of land use and land cover change on ecosystem services in an arid desert-oasis ecotone along the Yellow River of China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem service changes associated with land use and land cover change (LULC) will provide an important indicator and an early warning of ecological changes. However, there have been few attempts to estimate the effects of LULC on ecosystem services in desert-oasis ecotones, which are recognized as critical ecological barriers and buffers that prevent deserts from expanding into oases. Here, we used Landsat image-based LULC maps (1988-2018) and a modified benefit transfer method to estimate the changes in ecosystem service value (ESV) in response to LULC in Dengkou County along the Yellow River, China. Our results showed that the most significant feature of LULC in Dengkou County was a large area expansion of cropland and a reduction in the area of desert. The total estimated ESV was nearly US $400 million year(-1), of which 76% was derived from cropland, water bodies and rangelands. LULC resulted in a net increase in the total ESV by US$ 43.7 million during 1988-2018. Cropland expansion accounted for approximately 72% of the increase in the total ESV, thereby outweighing the huge decrease in ESV due to the expense of woodlands, rangelands and water bodies. Many low ESV clustering areas appeared in the central part of the county, resulting in ESV loss of approximately US $13.4 million, all of which was due to the conversion of water bodies to bare land and rangelands. Our results provide powerful evidence to make informed land use decisions for relevant managers and help fill the gap between the supply of ecosystem services and the societal demands for these services.

TI  - Generating Hourly Continuous Evapotranspiration Using Fengyun-2F Geostationary Satellite Data
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in water and energy exchange between the atmosphere and the land surface. ET at regional scale is of great importance in hydrology, meteorology, and agriculture. The remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST)-based two-source energy balance (TSEB) model is widely used to monitor ET. However, due to the influence of clouds, the quality of remotely sensed LST products is declined and there are also many gaps in the LST products, which make it very difficult to estimate spatio-temporally continuous ET based on remote sensing data. In this study, we proposed a method to generate hourly continuous ET using Fengyun-2F geostationary images. First, the hourly continuous real LST are obtained using a clear-sky LST reconstruction algorithm and radiometric correction algorithm, and then the reconstructed real LST is used to the estimation of latent heat flux using the TSEB model. The results in the Heihe River Basin show that the proposed method can successfully generate hourly continuous ET compared with three eddy covariance sites with different underlying surface. The estimated ET achieves acceptable performance with RMSE = 81.88 W/m(2) and R-2 = 0.67 at hourly scale and with RMSE = 1.48 mm/d and R-2 = 0.65 at daily scale. We believe this can help the community to better understand the water and energy exchange between the atmosphere and the land surface at fine spatio-temporal scale, especially on the hourly scale.

TI  - A Landscape-Based Habitat Suitability Model (LHS Model) for Oriental Migratory Locust Area Extraction at Large Scales: A Case Study along the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yellow River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Oriental migratory locust is a destructive agricultural pest in China. Large-scale locust area (the area possessing suitable breeding habitat for locusts and has locust infestation) extraction and its evolution analysis are essential for locust ecological control. Existing methods seldom consider the spatial differences in the locust development and habitat landscape structures in large areas. To analyze these effects, our study proposed a landscape-based habitat suitability model (LHS model) for large-scale locust area extraction based on remote sensing data, taking the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River (MLYR) as an example. Firstly, the DD model was used to simulate locust development and obtain habitat factors of the corresponding dates; secondly, the patch distribution of different land cover classes and their adjacent landscape characteristics were analyzed to determine the landscape-based factors memberships; finally, the habitat suitability index was calculated by combining the factors memberships and weights to extract the locust area. Compared with the patch-based model using moving windows (patch based-analytic hierarchy process model, R-2 = 0.77), the LHS model accuracy improved significantly (R-2 = 0.83). Our results showed that the LHS model has a better application prospect in large-scale locust area extraction. By analyzing the locust areas evolution along the MLYR extracted using the LHS model, we found human activities were the main factors affecting the locust areas evolution from 2016 to 2020, including: (1) planting the plants that locusts do not like and urbanization caused the decrease of the locust area; (2) the wetland protection policies may cause the increase of the locust area. The model and research results help locust control and prevention to realize the sustainable development of agriculture.

TI  - The Flash Flood Guidance System Implementation Worldwide A Successful Multidecadal Research-to-Operations Effort
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - At the beginning of the twenty-first century a research-to-operations program was initiated to design and develop operational systems to support local forecasters in their challenging task to provide advance warning for flash floods worldwide. Twenty-some years later, the Flash Flood Guidance System with global coverage provides real-time assessment and guidance products to more than 60 countries, serving nearly 3 billion people. The implementation domains cover a wide range of hydroclimatological, geomorphological, and land-use regimes worldwide. This flexible and evolving system combines meteorology and hydrology data and concepts as well as supports product utility for flash flood disaster mitigation on very large scales with high spatial and temporal resolution. Through quality control procedures, it integrates remotely sensed data of land surface precipitation and of land surface properties from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite platforms, reflectivity data from a variety of weather radar systems, and asynchronous precipitation data from ground-based automated precipitation gauges in order to produce assessments and short-term forecasts that support forecasters and disaster managers in real time. For each region, it also integrates mesoscale meteorological model forecasts with land surface model response to produce longer-term guidance products. It contains components and interfaces that allow real-time forecaster adjustments to products based on local last-minute field information and relevant forecaster experience. Assessments of utility for flash flood warning operations by national forecasting agencies worldwide are positive. The article exemplifies the process of realization and evolution of the Flash Flood Guidance System (FFGS) from research in interdisciplinary fields to operations in diverse environments, and discusses lessons learned.

TI  - Evaluation of Macrophyte Community Dynamics (2015-2020) in Southern Lake Garda (Italy) from Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application The improvement of effective remote sensing-based approaches to map macrophyte features can provide a baseline of adequate spatiotemporal resolution for 21st century monitoring applications equipped to play a prominent role in the context of medium-large-scale management programs of ecological conservation and scientific research. Macrophytes are of fundamental importance to the functioning of lake ecosystems. They provide structure, habitat, and a food source and are a required component in monitoring programs of lake ecological quality. The key aim of this study is to document the variation in spatial extent and density of macrophytes seasonally between 2015 and 2020 of the Sirmione Peninsula (Lake Garda, Italy), using Sentinel-2 imagery. In addition to this, our results were compared to previous data from imaging spectrometry; individual parameters affecting macrophyte communities were tested, and the possible effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on macrophyte colonization was evaluated. Satellite images allowed the mapping of the spatiotemporal dynamics of submerged rooted macrophytes in order to support monitoring of the shallow water ecosystem under study. Substantial changes were found in both spatial extent and density over the period from 2015 to 2020, particularly in 2019 when there was almost a complete absence of dense macrophytes. Variables found to influence the amount of macrophytes included transparency, chlorophyll-a, water level, winter wave height, and grazing by herbivores. A separate analysis focusing on areas associated with boat transit found a recovery in macrophyte coverage during the period of COVID-19 lockdown. The outcome of the study highlights a decline in the density of the macrophytes and a shift towards deeper areas compared to the situation in 1997. The area examined is part of an internationally important site containing the highest abundance and diversity of overwintering water birds in Italy. Exploiting satellite data at high frequency provided an insight to understand the dynamic changes and interactions with herbivorous birds, environmental factors, and anthropogenic pressures, revealing a delicately balanced and threatened ecosystem.

TI  - Assessment of groundwater potential zone using MCDA and AHP techniques: case study from a tropical river basin of India
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shortage of potable water is a global problem, and this problem can be met by searching new areas where groundwater is available. GIS is an effective and necessary tool to identify groundwater potential zones in an area. In the present study, groundwater potential zones (GWPZs) were identified in the Kangsabati River basin of east India having an area of about 6488 km(2) using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The criteria like geology, geomorphology, elevation, slope, drainage, lineament, curvature, topographic wetness, land use/land cover, and soil were extracted from satellite data and the weights for each parameter and its sub-parameters were assigned through analytical hierarchy process based on their respective relevance as influencing factors for groundwater recharge. Very low, low, moderate, high, and very high groundwater potentiality represent 28.93%, 30.56%, 19.75%, 14.62%, and 6.11% area, respectively. The low-lying flat plains of the southeastern section, as well as the centrally located dam, are ideal for groundwater recharge, while the upland plain of the northwestern part, with its hard rock terrain, is less so. This outcome has been verified using pre-monsoon and post-monsoon groundwater depth data, indicating that the strategy is most appropriate for this region. Thus, the groundwater potential zone maps remain very useful for conducting extensive ground-based hydrogeological studies that facilitate the identification of suitable bore well/dug well sites.

TI  - Meteorological Analysis of the 2021 Extreme Wildfires in Greece: Lessons Learned and Implications for Early Warning of the Potential for Pyroconvection
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2021 fire season in Greece was the worst of the past 13 years, resulting in more than 130,000 ha of burnt area, with about 70% consumed by five wildfires that ignited and spread in early August. Common to these wildfires was the occurrence of violent pyroconvection. This work presents a meteorological analysis of this outbreak of extreme pyroconvective wildfires. Our analysis shows that dry and warm antecedent weather preconditioned fuels in the fire-affected areas, creating a fire environment that alone could effectively support intense wildfire activity. Analysis of surface conditions revealed that the ignition and the most active spread of all wildfires coincided with the most adverse fire weather since the beginning of the fire season. Further, the atmospheric environment was conducive to violent pyroconvection, as atmospheric instability gradually increased amid the breakdown of an upper-air ridge ahead of an approaching long-wave trough. In summary, we highlight that the severity and extent of the 2021 Greek wildfires were not surprising considering the fire weather potential for the period when they ignited. Continuous monitoring of the large- and local-scale conditions that promote extreme fire behavior is imperative for improving Greece's capacity for managing extreme wildfires.

TI  - The National Institute of Health and the Italian Poison Centers Network: results of a collaborative study for the surveillance of exposures to chemicals
T2  - ANNALI DI IGIENE MEDICINA PREVENTIVA E DI COMUNITA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The Public Health Surveillance Systems are essential to improve and protect public health, as highlighted by the World Health Organization. According with this consideration, a systematic collaboration between the National Institute of Health and the Poison Centers of Northern, Central and Southern Italy was established. Its aim was to improve the national network for the surveillance of dangerous exposures to chemicals. The developed network provided harmonized data essential for evidence-based interventions and significantly ameliorated the data flow between the Poison Centers and the Central Health Institutions.Methods. The improvement of the system was obtained through several actions, such as the development of the "Online Surveillance Card" for the detection of sentinel events in real time and the harmonization of the data collection flow, including the product categorization according to the European Product Categorization System. Data analysis was carried out by Microsoft's IBM SPSS Statistics version 26, Access and Excel.Results. Important information was obtained, regarding also exposures to chemicals and their management in pediatric populations. The surveillance network was proved effective not only under "normal" conditions but also to promptly monitor changes during exceptional health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 2020 lockdown the surveillance system registered a significant increase in the frequency of exposures to disinfectants (p-value=0.002), an evidence that highlighted the need of tailored intervention.Conclusions. This Italian Project model proves to be reliable and suitable to be transferred to other European countries, in order to realize an European Poison Centers' Network, able to overcome unsolved health problems and to globally improve the "evidence-based" prevention of exposures to chemicals.

AB  - This article presents the evaluation of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) operational terrestrial products corresponding to the green instantaneous Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) and its associated rectified channels. These products are estimated using OLCI spectral measurements acquired at the top of the atmosphere by a physically-based approach and are available operationally at full (300 m) and reduced (1.2 km) spatial resolution daily. The evaluation of the quality of the FAPAR OLCI values was based on the availability of data acquired over several years by Sentinel-3A (S3A) and Sentinel 3B (S3B). The evaluation exercise consisted of several stages: first, an overall comparison of the two S3 platform products was carried out during the tandem phase; second, comparison with an FAPAR climatology derived from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) provided information on the seasonality of various types of land cover. Then, direct comparisons were made with the same type of FAPAR products retrieved from two sensors, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Sentinel-2 (S2) Multispectral Instrument (MSI), and with several ground-based estimates. In addition, an analysis of the efficiency of the retrieval algorithm with 3D radiative transfer simulations was performed. The results indicated that the consistency between daily and monthly S3A and S3B on a global scale was very good during the tandem phase (RMSD = 0.01 and a correlation R-2 of 0.99 with a bias of 0.003); we found an agreement with a correlation of 0.95 and 0.93 (RMSD = 0.07 and 0.09) with JRC FAPAR S2 and JRC FAPAR MODIS, respectively. Compatibility with the ground-based data was between 0.056 and 0.24 in term of RMSD depending on the type of vegetation with an overall R-2 of 0.89. Immler diagrams demonstrate that their variances were lower than the total uncertainties. The quality assurance using 3D radiative transfer model has shown that the apparent performance of the algorithm depends strongly on the type of in-situ measurement and canopy type.

TI  - Synchronous contralateral axillary lymph node metastasis in a recurrent breast cancer following previous axillary clearance
T2  - BMJ CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ipsilateral axillary lymph node metastasis is common, while contralateral axillary lymph node metastasis (CAM) is uncommon. This report is of a patient that presented with a recurrence of left breast cancer and synchronous CAM, with a distant history of left breast conserving surgery and axillary dissection for invasive carcinoma. The CAM was confirmed following a non-routine lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. This highlights the possibility of CAM representing as locoregional disease rather than advanced stage IV disease.

TI  - Comparison of Different Mosquito Traps for Zoonotic Arbovirus Vectors in Papua New Guinea
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vector surveillance is important to control mosquito-borne diseases. We compared the efficacies of three mosquito-trapping devices: the CDC light trap with incandescent light (CDC_I), the CDC light trap with ultraviolet light (CDC_UV), and the Biogents-sentinel (BG) trap, to identify a suitable and cost-effective surveillance tool for key vectors of neglected zoonotic arboviral diseases in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Of 13,788 female mosquitoes, CDC_I caught 7.9%, BG caught 14.5%, and CDC_UV caught 77.6%. Culex was the most predominant genus caught in all the traps. Centers for Disease Control light trap with ultraviolet light trap captured the highest abundance, highest species richness of mosquitoes and exhibited the highest overall Culex mosquito capture rates compared with BG and CDC_I. This study represents the first assessment of trapping devices for zoonotic arbovirus vectors in PNG. We recommend the CDC_UV trap for future monitoring and surveillance of infectious arboviral vector programs in PNG.

TI  - New data infrastructures for environmental monitoring in Myanmar: Is digital transparency good for governance?
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The design and use of environmental data infrastructures, including software platforms, sensors, satellite data, mobile phone apps, and digitally generated visual representations, is increasingly inseparable from contemporary environmental governance. Such technologies are often intended to enable data transparency, which in turn is assumed to promote expanded participation in democratic governance. In this article, we investigate how environmental monitoring, as performed through domestic and globalized infrastructures that seek to make digital environmental data open and transparent, is playing out in Myanmar's forest sector. New data infrastructures are inseparable from the proliferation of non-state actors involved in environmental governance amid the country's transition from military surveillance state toward more liberal and democratic rule, yet participation is not universal. We argue that actors engage new platforms and tools based on different understandings of the role of increased data transparency in environmental governance, which in turn are structured by historical relations with and within the legacy of the surveillance state.

TI  - Sentinel-2 images to assess soil surface characteristics over a rainfed Mediterranean cropping system
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil surface characteristics (SSCs) are of high importance for water infiltration processes in crop fields. As SSCs present strong spatiotemporal variability influenced by climatic conditions and agricultural practices, their monitor has already been explored by using UAV images and multispectral remote sensing. However, each technique has encountered difficulties characterizing this spatiotemporal variability. The objective of this work was to explore the potential of Sentinel-2 images to assess three SSCs - the green vegetation fraction, dry vegetation fraction and physical soil surface structure - at several dates. This work explored two approaches for classifying these three SSCs from five Sentinel-2 images acquired from August to November 2016. In the "single-date" approach, a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) model was trained to classify one SSCj from a dataset extracted from one Sentinel-2 image i (model noted RF sd(i,SSCj)). In the "multi-date" approach, a RFC model was trained to classify one SSCj from a dataset extracted from the five Sentinel-2 images (noted RF md(SSCj)). The classification analysis showed that i) the RF sd(i,sscj) and RF md(SSCj )models provided accurate performances (overall accuracy > 0.79) regardless of the studied SSCj and the tested Sentinel-2 image, ii) the RF_sd(i,SSCj) model did not allow the classification of SSC classes that were not observed on the studied date, and iii) the RF_md(SSCj) model allowed the classification of all SSC classes observed in the five Sentinel-2 images. This indicated that several Sentinel-2 images can favourably be used to increase knowledge of spatiotemporal representation of SSCs by extending results of infrequent, localized and cumbersome field work.

TI  - Estimating the Soil Erosion Response to Land-Use Land-Cover Change Using GIS-Based RUSLE and Remote Sensing: A Case Study of Miyun Reservoir, North China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion by water is a major cause of land degradation. Agricultural practices and many other ecological environmental problems contribute to land degradation worldwide, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Miyun County, which is located in a mountainous region of North China, is an important natural ecological zone and surface source of drinking water for Beijing and is very vulnerable to soil erosion due to its thin soil layer and human activities. Landsat images from 2003 and 2013 were used to analyze the land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) over this period. The revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model integrated with Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to quantify soil loss and to map erosion risk. In addition, the response of soil erosion to LULCC was evaluated. The results showed that the areas under cropland, forest, and water bodies increased over the study period by 66.03, 243.44, and 9.01 km(2), respectively. The increase in forested land indicated that the improved ground vegetation cover was due to the implementation of active ecological measures. Between 2003 and 2013, light soil erosion increased by 587.46 km(2), and extremely severe soil erosion increased by 9.57 km(2). The extents of slight, moderate, severe, and very severe soil erosion, however, decreased by 8.02, 445.21, 142.69, and 1.11 km(2), respectively. A total of 57.5% of land with moderate soil erosion has been converted to light soil erosion, which could be highly beneficial for the improvement of vegetation control of soil and water losses. In terms of area, forestland exhibited the greatest increase, while moderate soil erosion exhibited the greatest decrease over the study period. Land-use change led to an alteration in the intensity of soil erosion due to changes or loss of vegetation. The conversion from high intensity soil erosion to low intensity was attributed to the implementation of ecological environmental protection. The results generated from this study may be useful for planners and land-use managers to make appropriate decisions for soil conservation.

TI  - Seroepidemiology of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever among cattle in Cameroon: Implications from a One Health perspective
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundCrimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne viral zoonotic disease distributed across several continents and recognized as an ongoing health threat. In humans, the infection can progress to a severe disease with high fatality, raising public health concerns due to the limited prophylactic and therapeutic options available. Animal species, clinically unaffected by the virus, serve as viral reservoirs and amplifier hosts, and can be a valuable tool for surveillance. Little is known about the occurrence and prevalence of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) in Cameroon. Knowledge on CCHFV exposure and the factors associated with its presence in sentinel species are a valuable resource to better understand transmission dynamics and assess local risks for zoonotic disease emergence. Methods and findingsWe conducted a CCHFV serological survey and risk factor analysis for animal level seropositivity in pastoral and dairy cattle in the North West Region (NWR) and the Vina Division (VD) of the Adamawa Region in Cameroon. Seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for sampling design-effects and test performance. In addition, explanatory multivariable logistic regression mixed-effects models were fit to estimate the effect of animal characteristics, husbandry practices, risk contacts and ecological features on the serological status of pastoral cattle. The overall seroprevalence was 56.0% (95% CI 53.5-58.6) and 6.7% (95% CI 2.6-16.1) among pastoral and dairy cattle, respectively. Animals going on transhumance had twice the odds of being seropositive (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.8), indicating that animal movements could be implicated in disease expansion. From an ecological perspective, absolute humidity (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9) and shrub density (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.2) were associated with seropositivity, which suggests an underlying viral dynamic connecting vertebrate host and ticks in a complex transmission network. ConclusionsThis study demonstrated high seroprevalence levels of CCHFV antibodies in cattle in Cameroon indicating a potential risk to human populations. However, current understanding of the underlying dynamics of CCHFV locally and the real risk for human populations is incomplete. Further studies designed using a One Health approach are required to improve local knowledge of the disease, host interactions and environmental risk factors. This information is crucial to better project the risks for human populations located in CCHFV-suitable ecological niches.Author summaryCrimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever poses an important threat for public health, particularly in endemic locations in Eurasia and parts of Africa. Despite its long-standing recognition, CCHF is considered a neglected disease, with sporadic official case reports and evidence of serological circulation in remote rural areas and less frequently, in peri-urban settings in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the drivers associated with its emergence and the spatial-temporal patterns linked to its circulation and spread are not well-understood. In this study, we identified a high proportion of cattle with CCHFV antibodies suggestive of high levels of viral circulation in the North West and the Adamawa Regions in Cameroon. In pastoral cattle, there was a positive relationship between going on transhumance, older age, higher shrub density and lower absolute humidity and CCHFV individual seropositivity. In contrast, non-indigenous breeds reported a lower risk of being seropositive. These results can be interpreted in connection to the underlying dynamics of CCHFV cycle and underline potential mechanisms linked to disease expansion. From a public health perspective, high levels of exposure to CCHFV in cattle highlight the possibility of unrecognized human infection and therefore, emphasize on the need to remain vigilant to possible disease risks for local groups involved in pastoralism and to dairy smallholders across the region.

TI  - RiwiSAR-SWH: A data-driven method for estimating significant wave height using Sentinel-3 SAR altimetry
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 600 million people (about 10% of the world's population) live in coastal areas that are less than 10 m above sea level. Despite the urgent need to monitor coastal waters, in situ measuring stations including wave buoys around the world do not provide sufficient insight into coastal water level variations, and in particular, they cannot provide sufficient information on one of the essential properties of water surfaces, namely the Significant Wave Height (SWH). Satellite altimetry plays an increasingly important role, especially after operating in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode. However, due to the complexity of the coastal water surfaces, the performance of the satellite altimeters over the coastal area falls behind the open ocean surfaces. In addition, the well-known direct relationship between waveform rise time and SWH does not hold for SAR waveforms due to a different processing scheme. This study proposes a data-driven method to determine SWH using the Sentinel-3 data for both oceanic and coastal zones. For this purpose, we propose a method based on the rise time (delta r) and the width of a waveform, called RiwiSAR-SWH (rise time width model for SAR-SWH), which is free from the complexity of the SAR physical model and estimates SWH over the coastal area and open ocean in a relatively straightforward manner. We have employed our method over different regions in the coastal zone of the North Sea. The results are validated against in situ buoy data and compared with SWH estimates from SAMOSA+, SAMOSA++ and the Sentinel-3 Ocean retracker. The validation shows that the proposed method can determine SWH with accuracy ranging from 0.25 m to 0.91 m for different locations in the North Sea. Moreover, we obtain reliable SWH to within 1 km from the coast, which is an improvement of more than 40% compared to existing methodologies. (C) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Trends in axillary surgery and clinical outcomes among breast cancer patients with sentinel node metastasis
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is a lack of studies examining the long-term trend and survival of axillary surgery for breast cancer patients with sentinel node metastasis, especially for the patients with 3-5 node metastases. Methods: Breast cancer patients with 1-5 sentinel node metastases from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2000 to 2016. Our study presented the trend of axillary surgery and assessed the long-term survival of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone vs axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for those patients. Results: Of the 41,996 patients diagnosed with T1-2 breast cancer after lumpectomy and radiation included, 34,940 had 1-2 sentinel node metastases and 7056 had 3-5 sentinel node metastases. The percentage of patients undergoing SLNB alone increased from 22.4% in 2000 to 81.0% in 2016 for patients with 1-2 sentinel node metastases, and quadrupled from 5.2% in 2009 to 20.6% in 2016 for those with 3-5 sentinel node metastases. Completion of ALND did not benefit the long-term survival of 1-2 sentinel node metastasis patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.02, P = 0.539), but improved the long-term survival of 3-5 node metastasis patients (HR = 0.73, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated the inferiority of SLNB to ALND in all subgroups of 3-5 sentinel node metastases. Conclusion: For patients with T1-2 breast cancer after lumpectomy and radiation, SLNB alone was an efficient and safe surgical choice for 1-2 sentinel node metastases but not for 3-5 sentinel node metastases. It is worth noting that for patients with 3-5 node metastasis, the proportion of omitted ALND quadrupled after 2009.

TI  - Assessment of Aerosol Optical Depth over Indian Subcontinent during COVID-19 lockdown (March-May 2020)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has created a major threat to human beings and huge losses over the globe. In order to control the pandemic spread, almost all parts of the world imposed lockdown. The imposed lockdown drastically impacted on reduction in the atmospheric pollutions and also resulted in net decrease in aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the atmosphere. In this study, the reduction in the AOD during the COVID-19 lockdown over the Indian subcontinent is being assessed using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data available in Giovanni version 4.34 developed by NASA. The long-term mean analysis is computed considering 20 years (i.e., 2000-2019) data on Terra platform with a temporal resolution of daily and monthly and spatial resolution of 1 degree. The dataset of AOD with a temporal resolution of monthly was used for investigation of AOD anomaly for March, April and May 2020, and the seasonal variation (March to May 2020) is also assessed. Similarly, the daily scale dataset was used to investigate the percentage change in AOD during pre-lockdown and lockdown period with respect to long-term mean. The key findings in the present study show that reduction in AOD level over Indian subcontinent is approximately 14.75% during the lockdown period with spatial variation in the magnitude from region to region. The level of AOD is greatly reduced in the northern part of India (similar to 22.53%), whereas changes in the southern part of India are much less (similar to -0.31%); this may be due to ongoing anthropogenic activities during the lockdown period in this region. Furthermore, a positive AOD anomaly was observed in the eastern and central regions of India (i.e., over the states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Part of Maharashtra and Karnataka). However, negative AOD anomaly was observed in the north and northwest regions of India, whereas not much change in the AOD anomaly in other parts of the country. The overall assessment of the AOD level shows a net decrease over the Indian subcontinent during the lockdown period, i.e., March to May 2020. This kind of assessment study will surely help the government for the sustainable policy decisions for atmospheric pollution control by implementing proper lockdown procedures over various parts of the country.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Land Use Changes on Net Primary Productivity in Wuhan, China
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2000, major changes have taken place in Wuhan city. Land use and land cover (LuLe) has changed significantly, characterized by increased construction land, reducing farmland, grassland, and forest land due to the rapid urbanization process. Taking advantage ((LUC data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Net Primary Production (mom NPP) data from 2000 to 2020, we analyze the impact of LUC type transformation on ATP, reveal the relationship between LULC type and NPP, and quantify the impact of urban expansion on NPP by taking Wuhan, China as a study case. The results showed that: 1) the transformation from farmland and grassland to construction land was a dominant LULC change type in Wuhan during the investigated period; 2) there exists a significant negative correlation between NPP and changes in farmland, woodland, and grassland area; 3) the distance from the city center has a significant positive correlation with NPP, and the dynamics of NPP vary in different regions; 4) there is a significant positive correlation between NPP and night light data. The results of this study provide scientific references for the formation of greening construction and sustainable development strategies in Wuhan.

T2  - International Journal of Mosquito Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Tests on the efficacy of pyrethroid insecticides in fogging were conducted. These were done in two approaches: 1. A laboratory-based series of the WHO susceptibility tests on F1- generation female adult Aedes mosquitoes, and 2. A series of actual field thermal fogging using caged sentinel F1-generation Aedes mosquitoes. Based on the 98% WHO susceptibility test criterion, strains of Ae. Aegypti have shown to have incipient resistance to pyrethroids, making them less susceptible to laboratory and field tests. Ae. Albopictus was found susceptible to pyrethroids, but it requires further confirmatory tests based on field test results. The study recommends molecular tests on mechanisms involved, nationwide surveillance of susceptibility/resistance of dengue vector mosquitoes, and a review of the chemical control strategies used by authorities.

Quantifying erosion rates over various temporal and spatial scales is thus crucial for understanding the topographic evolution in active orogenic belts. This work focused on the decadal catchment-basin erosion rate and its controlling factors in the northern Chinese Tian Shan. Nine mountainous catchment basins were selected to quantify the decadal-scale erosion rates from hydrological data measured during the years 1964-2011. The contributions of the suspended load, bed load, and solute load in the river sediment load were first determined. The erosion rate was then calculated for each analyzed catchment basin. The results show that the average rate of catchment-basin erosion is similar to 0.15 mm yr (-1), whereas the rate varies from one catchment basin to the next (the minimum rate of 0.05 mm yr(-1) in the Urumqi and the maximum rate of 0.30 mm yr? 1 in the Manas). In order to explore the possible effects of climate, topography, lithology, vegetation, and tectonics on catchment-basin erosion, correlation analyses were conducted between these factors and the erosion rate. The results indicate that the catchment-basin erosion rate is more closely correlated with topographic factors (basin area and basin relief) and climatic variables (discharge, run off, run off depth, and mean temperature), indicative of the main controlling of topography and climate on catchment-basin erosion. The erosion rates reported in this work are approximately consistent with the paleo-erosion rate of < 0.5 mm yr (-1) over the last 1.5 Myr derived from in situ produced cosmogenic 10Be concentrations in the Kuitun catchment basin in the west part of the range. Such a consistency is likely to imply relatively stable erosion during the late Quaternary in the northern Chinese Tian Shan.

TI  - Sentinel: A Hyper-Heuristic for the Generation of Mutant Reduction Strategies
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mutation testing is an effective approach to evaluate and strengthen software test suites, but its adoption is currently limited by the mutants' execution computational cost. Several strategies have been proposed to reduce this cost (a.k.a. mutation cost reduction strategies), however none of them has proven to be effective for all scenarios since they often need an ad-hoc manual selection and configuration depending on the software under test (SUT). In this paper, we propose a novel multi-objective evolutionary hyper-heuristic approach, dubbed Sentinel, to automate the generation of optimal cost reduction strategies for every new SUT. We evaluate Sentinel by carrying out a thorough empirical study involving 40 releases of 10 open-source real-world software systems and both baseline and state-of-the-art strategies as a benchmark. We execute a total of 4,800 experiments, and evaluate their results with both quality indicators and statistical significance tests, following the most recent best practice in the literature. The results show that strategies generated by Sentinel outperform the baseline strategies in 95 percent of the cases always with large effect sizes. They also obtain statistically significantly better results than state-of-the-art strategies in 88 percent of the cases, with large effect sizes for 95 percent of them. Also, our study reveals that the mutation strategies generated by Sentinel for a given software version can be used without any loss in quality for subsequently developed versions in 95 percent of the cases. These results show that Sentinel is able to automatically generate mutation strategies that reduce mutation testing cost without affecting its testing effectiveness (i.e., mutation score), thus taking off from the tester's shoulders the burden of manually selecting and configuring strategies for each SUT.

TI  - Investigation of shoreline change rates using the digital shoreline analysis system in Lake Bey?ehi?r, Turkey
T2  - BULLETIN OF GEOPHYSICS AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was aimed to investigate the temporal and geometric shoreline change rates in Lake Bey??ehir, which is the largest freshwater lake in Turkey, using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System and remote sensing techniques. Therefore, the multitemporal Landsat satellite images for 1984, 1990, 1996, 2000, 2006, 2014, and 2018 were used. The shoreline maps of the study area were produced from the obtained satellite images, and the shoreline change rates for the previous years were calculated using two different methods. As a result of the study, according to the end point rate and linear regression rate statistics, the highest average coastal erosion rate was determined to be-12.03 m/yr with shoreline withdrawal of 409.06 m in a 35-year period, and the highest average coastal accretion rate was determined to be 5.86 m/yr with shoreline advance of 178.36 m. In addition, trend and drought analyses were applied to the annual average meteorological data (temperature and precipitation) from 1970 to 2018, which were obtained from the Bey??ehir Meteorological Observation Station located in the study area. The results of these analyses were used to determine whether the temperature and rainfall changes over the years have had an effect on the temporal and geometric coastline changes in Lake Bey??ehir.

TI  - Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Trends and Mechanisms in Different Ecosystems in Northeastern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), when used as a proxy for plant photosynthesis, can provide an indication of the photosynthesis rate and has the potential to improve our understanding of carbon exchange mechanisms within an ecosystem. However, the relationships between SIF and vegetation indices (VIs) operating within different ecological contexts and the effect of other environmental factors on SIF remain unclear. This study focused on three ecosystems (cropland, forest, and grassland), with different ecological characteristics, located in Northeast China. These areas provide case studies where numerous relationships can be explored, including the correlations between the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF and MODIS products, meteorological factors, and the differences in the relationships between the three different ecosystems. Some interesting results and conclusions were obtained. First, in different ecosystems, the relationships between SIF and MODIS products show different correlations, whereby the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) has a close relationship with SIF in all the three ecosystems of forest, cropland, and grassland. Second, forest-type ecosystems appear to be sensitive to changes in daily temperature, whereas cropland and grassland areas respond more closely to changes in previous 16-day daily minimum temperature. Compared with forest and cropland areas, grasslands were more sensitive to precipitation (although the R-2 value was small). Third, different ecosystems have different mechanisms of photosynthesis. Hence, we suggest that it is better to use SIF in areas exhibiting different ecological characteristics, and different models should be employed while simulating SIF.

TI  - Identification of Crop Type Based on C-AENN Using Time Series Sentinel-1A SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type identification is the initial stage and an important part of the agricultural monitoring system. It is well known that synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1A imagery provides a reliable data source for crop type identification. However, a single-temporal SAR image does not contain enough features, and the unique physical characteristics of radar images are relatively lacking, which limits its potential in crop mapping. In addition, current methods may not be applicable for time-series SAR data. To address the above issues, a new crop type identification method was proposed. Specifically, a farmland mask was firstly generated by the object Markov random field (OMRF) model to remove the interference of non-farmland factors. Then, the features of the standard backscatter coefficient, Sigma-naught (sigma(0)), and the normalized backscatter coefficient by the incident angle, Gamma-naught (gamma(0)), were extracted for each type of crop, and the optimal feature combination was found from time-series SAR images by means of Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance analysis. Finally, to make efficient utilization of optimal multi-temporal feature combination, a new network, the convolutional-autoencoder neural network (C-AENN), was developed for the crop type identification task. In order to prove the effectiveness of the method, several classical machine learning methods such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), etc., and deep learning methods such as one dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and stacked auto-encoder (SAE), etc., were used for comparison. In terms of quantitative assessment, the proposed method achieved the highest accuracy, with a macro-F1 score of 0.9825, an overall accuracy (OA) score of 0.9794, and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) score of 0.9705. In terms of qualitative assessment, four typical regions were chosen for intuitive comparison with the sample maps, and the identification result covering the study area was compared with a contemporaneous optical image, which indicated the high accuracy of the proposed method. In short, this study enables the effective identification of crop types, which demonstrates the importance of multi-temporal radar images in feature combination and the necessity of deep learning networks to extract complex features.

TI  - Limited role of soil texture in mediating natural vegetation response to rainfall anomalies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence suggests that the response of rainfed crops to dry or wet years is modulated by soil texture. This is a central tenet for certain agronomic operations in water-limited regions that rely on spatial distribution of soil texture for guiding precision agriculture. In contrast, natural vegetation in climatic equilibrium evolves to form a dynamic assemblage of traits and species adapted to local climatic conditions, primarily precipitation in water-limited regions. For undisturbed landscapes, we hypothesize that natural vegetation responds to rainfall anomalies irrespectively of local soil texture whereas rainfed crops are expected to respond to texture-mediated plant available water. Earth system models (ESMs) often quantify vegetation response to drought and water stress based on traditional agronomic concepts despite fundamental differences in composition and traits of natural vegetation and crops. We seek to test the hypothesis above at local and regional scales to differentiate natural vegetation and rainfed crops response to rainfall anomalies across soil types and better link them to water and carbon cycles. We employed field observations and remote sensing data to systematically examine the response of natural and rainfed cropped vegetation across biomes and scales. At local scales (field to similar to 0.1 km), we used crop yields from literature data and natural vegetation productivity as gross primary productivity (GPP) from adjacent FLUXNET sites. At regional scales (similar to 10(2) km), we rely exclusively on remote-sensing-based GPP. Results confirm a lack of response of natural vegetation productivity to soil texture across biomes and rainfall anomalies at all scales. In contrast, crop yields at field scale exhibit correlation with soil texture in dry years (in agreement with conventional agronomic practices). These results support the hypothesis that natural vegetation is decoupled from soil texture, whereas rainfed crops retain dependency on soil texture in dry years. However, the observed correlation of crops with soil texture becomes obscured at larger scales by spatial variation of topography, rainfall, and uncertainty in soil texture and GPP values. The study provides new insights into what natural vegetation's climatic equilibrium might mean and reveals the role of scale in expressing such sensitivities in ESMs.

TI  - The Influence of Burn Severity on Post-Fire Spectral Recovery of Three Fires in the Southern Rocky Mountains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased wildfire activity and altered post-fire climate in the Southern Rocky Mountains has the potential to influence forest resilience. The Southern Rocky Mountains are a leading edge of climate change and have experienced record-breaking fires in recent years. The change in post-fire regeneration and forest resilience could potentially include future ecological trajectories. In this paper, we examined patterns of post-fire spectral recovery using Landsat time series. Additionally, we utilized random forest models to analyze the impact of climate and burn severity on three fire events in the Southern Rocky Mountains. Fifteen years following the fires, none of the burned stands fully recovered to their pre-fire spectral states. The results suggested that burn severity significantly impacted post-fire spectral recovery, but that influence may decrease as time since fire increases. The biggest difference in forest recovery was among fire events, indicating that post-fire climate may be influential in post-fire recovery. The mean and minimum growing-season temperatures were more significant to post-fire recovery than the variability in precipitation, which is consistent with field-based analysis. The present study indicated that, as warming continues, there may be changes in forest density where forests are not regenerating to their pre-fire spectral states. Additionally, this study emphasizes how high-elevation forests continue to regenerate after fires, but that regeneration is markedly affected by post-fire climate.

TI  - A system to determine advisory speed limits for horizontal curves based on mental workload and available sight distance
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a framework that accounts for mental workload and available sight distances to estimate advisory speed limits on horizontal curves. To achieve this goal, automated scripts were used to extract data on horizontal curve elements (i.e., the degree of curvature and the deflection angle), to detect crest vertical curves, and to compute the available sight distance from remote sensing data collected on highways in Alberta, Canada. Mental workload ratings were then assigned to each horizontal curve to calculate the perception-reaction time needed by drivers to maintain control of their vehicles while negotiating these curves. Finally, a curve advisory speed was calculated based on the available sight distance and the mental workload perception-reaction time needed to ensure a safe driving environment. This study presents a unique approach that incorporates human factors, including the responses of drivers based on their perception of the driving environment, in the development of speed advisory systems.

TI  - The Capabilities of Dedicated Small Satellite Infrared Missions for the Quantitative Characterization of Wildfires
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this paper was to demonstrate the capability of dedicated small satellite infrared sensors with cooled quantum detectors, such as those successfully utilized three times in Germany's pioneering BIRD and FireBIRD small satellite infrared missions, in the quantitative characterization of high-temperature events such as wildfires. The Bi-spectral Infrared Detection (BIRD) mission was launched in October 2001. The space segment of FireBIRD consists of the small satellites Technologie Erprobungs-Trager (TET-1), launched in July 2012, and Bi-spectral InfraRed Optical System (BIROS), launched in June 2016. These missions also significantly improved the scientific understanding of space-borne fire monitoring with regard to climate change. The selected examples compare the evaluation of quantitative characteristics using data from BIRD or FireBIRD and from the operational polar orbiting IR sensor systems MODIS, SLSTR and VIIRS. Data from the geostationary satellite "Himawari-8" were compared with FireBIRD data, obtained simultaneously. The geostationary Meteosat Third Generation-Imager (MTG-I) is foreseen to be launched at the end of 2022. In its application to fire, the MTG-I's Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) will provide related spectral bands at ground sampling distances (GSD) of 3.8 mu m and 10.5 mu m at the sub-satellite point (SSP) of 1 km or 2 km, depending on the used FCI imaging mode. BIRD wildfire data, obtained over Africa and Portugal, were used to simulate the fire detection and monitoring capability of MTG-I/FCI. A new quality of fire monitoring is predicted, if the 1 km resolution wildfire data from MTG-1/FCI are used together with the co-located fire data acquired by the polar orbiting Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and possibly prospective FireBIRD-type compact IR sensors flying on several small satellites in various low Earth orbits (LEOs).

TI  - CALIOP-Based Quantification of Central Asian Dust Transport
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Asia is one of the most important sources of mineral saline dust worldwide. A comprehensive understanding of Central Asian dust transport is essential for evaluating its impacts on human health, ecological safety, weather and climate. This study first puts forward an observation-based climatology of Central Asian dust transport flux by using the 3-D dust detection of Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). The seasonal difference of transport flux and downstream contribution are evaluated and compared with those of the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). Central Asian dust can be transported not only southward in summer under the effect of the South Asian summer monsoon, but also eastward in other seasons under the control of the westerly jet. Additionally, the transport of Central Asian dust across the Pamir Plateau to the Tibetan Plateau is also non-negligible, especially during spring (with a transport flux rate of 150 kg m(-1) day(-1)). The annual CALIOP-based downstream contribution of Central Asian dust to South Asian (164.01 Tg) is 2.1 times that to East Asia (78.36 Tg). This can be attributed to the blocking effect of the higher terrain between Central and East Asia. Additionally, the downstream contributions to South and East Asia from MERRA-2 are only 0.36 and 0.84 times that of CALIOP, respectively. This difference implies the overestimation of the wet and dry depositions of the model, especially in the low latitude zone. The quantification of the Central Asian dust transport allows a better understanding of the Central Asian dust cycle, and supports the calibration/validation of aerosol-related modules of regional and global climate models.

TI  - Global land use extent and dispersion within natural land cover using Landsat data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion of natural land cover into human-dominated land use systems has significant impacts on the environment. Global mapping and monitoring of human-dominated land use extent via satellites provides an empirical basis for assessing land use pressures. Here, we present a novel 2019 global land cover, land use, and ecozone map derived from Landsat satellite imagery and topographical data using derived image feature spaces and algorithms suited per theme. From the map, we estimate the spatial extent and dispersion of land use disaggregated by climate domain and ecozone, where dispersion is the mean distance of land use to all land within a subregion. We find that percent of area under land use and distance to land use follow a power law that depicts an increasingly random spatial distribution of land use as it extends across lands of comparable development potential. For highly developed climate/ecozones, such as temperate and sub-tropical terra firma vegetation on low slopes, area under land use is contiguous and remnant natural land cover have low areal extent and high fragmentation. The tropics generally have the greatest potential for land use expansion, particularly in South America. An exception is Asian humid tropical terra firma vegetated lowland, which has land use intensities comparable to that of temperate breadbaskets such as the United States' corn belt. Wetland extent is inversely proportional to land use extent within climate domains, indicating historical wetland loss for temperate, sub-tropical, and dry tropical biomes. Results highlight the need for planning efforts to preserve natural systems and associated ecosystem services. The demonstrated methods will be implemented operationally in quantifying global land change, enabling a monitoring framework for systematic assessments of the appropriation and restoration of natural land cover.

TI  - A Two-Source Normalized Soil Thermal Inertia Model for Estimating Field-Scale Soil Moisture from MODIS and ASTER Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a crucial component for understanding, modeling, and forecasting terrestrial water cycles and energy budgets. However, estimating field-scale SM based on thermal infrared remote-sensing data is still a challenging task. In this study, an improved Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method based on land-surface Diurnal Temperature Cycle (DTC) model (DFSDAF) was proposed to fuse Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advance Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) land-surface temperature (LST) data to generate ASTER-like LST during the night. The reconstructed diurnal LST data at a high spatial resolution (90 m) was then utilized to drive a two-source normalized soil thermal inertia model (TNSTI) for the vegetated surfaces to estimate field-scale SM. The results of the proposed methods were validated at different observation depths (2, 4, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 100 cm) over the Zhangye oasis in the middle region of the Heihe River basin in the northwest of China and were compared with the SM estimates from the TNSTI model and other SM products, including AMSR2/AMSR-E, GLDAS-Noah, and ERA5-land. The results showed the following: (1) The DFSDAF method increased the accuracy of LST prediction, with the determination coefficient (R-2) increasing from 0.71 to 0.77, and root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing from 2.17 to 1.89 K. (2) the estimated SMs had the best correlation with the observations at the 10 cm depth (with R-2 of 0.657; RMSE of 0.069 m(3)/m(3)), but the worst correlation with observations at the 40 cm depth (with R-2 of 0.262; RMSE of 0.092 m(3)/m(3)); meanwhile, the modeled SMs were significantly underestimated above 40 cm (2, 4, 10, and 20 cm) and slightly overestimated below 40 cm (60 and 100 cm); in addition, the field-scale SM series at high spatial resolution (90 m) showed significant spatiotemporal variation. (3) The SM estimates based on the TNSTI for the vegetated surfaces are more capable of characterizing the SM status in the root zone (~80 cm) or even deeper, while the SMs from AMSR2/AMSR-E, GLDAS-Noah, or ERA5-land products are closer to the SM in the surface layer (the depth is less than 5 cm). The TNSTI provided favorable data supports for hydrological model simulations and showed potential advantages for agricultural refinement managements and smart agriculture.

TI  - "Weaving a Mat That We Can All Sit On": Qualitative Research Approaches for Productive Dialogue in the Intercultural Space
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Research remains a site of struggle for First Nations peoples globally. Biomedical research often reinforces existing power structures, perpetuating ongoing colonisation by dominating research priorities, resource allocation, policies, and services. Addressing systemic health inequities requires decolonising methodologies to facilitate new understandings and approaches. These methodologies promote a creative tension and productive intercultural dialogue between First Nations and Western epistemologies. Concurrently, the potential of critical theory, social science, and community participatory action research approaches to effectively prioritise First Nations peoples' lived experience within the biomedical worldview is increasingly recognised. This article describes learnings regarding research methods that enable a better understanding of the lived experience of rheumatic heart disease-an intractable, potent marker of health inequity for First Nations Australians, requiring long-term engagement in the troubled intersection between Indigenist and biomedical worldviews. Working with YolLATIN SMALL LETTER ENGu (Aboriginal) co-researchers from remote Northern Territory (Australia), the concept of ganma (turbulent co-mingling of salt and fresh water) was foundational for understanding and applying relationality (gurrutu), deep listening (nhina, nhama ga LATIN SMALL LETTER ENGama), and the use of metaphors-approaches that strengthen productive dialogue, described by YolLATIN SMALL LETTER ENGu co-researchers as weaving a 'mat we can all sit on'. The research results are reported in a subsequent article.

TI  - Low Cloud Detection in Multilayer Scenes Using Satellite Imagery with Machine Learning Methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of multilayer clouds in the atmosphere can be particularly challenging from passive visible and infrared imaging radiometers since cloud boundary information is limited primarily to the topmost cloud layer. Yet detection of low clouds in the atmosphere is important for a number of applications, including aviation nowcasting and general weather forecasting. In this work, we develop pixel-based machine learning-based methods of detecting low clouds, with a focus on improving detection in multilayer cloud situations and specific attention given to improving the Cloud Cover Layers (CCL) product, which assigns cloudiness in a scene into vertical bins. The random forest (RF) and neural network (NN) implementations use inputs from a variety of sources, including GOES Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) visible radiances, infrared brightness temperatures, auxiliary information about the underlying surface, and relative humidity (which holds some utility as a cloud proxy). Training and independent validation enlists near-global, actively sensed cloud boundaries from the radar and lidar systems on board the CloudSat and CALIPSO satellites. We find that the RF and NN models have similar performances. The probability of detection (PoD) of low cloud increases from 0.685 to 0.815 when using the RF technique instead of the CCL methodology, while the false alarm ratio decreases. The improved PoD of low cloud is particularly notable for scenes that appear to be cirrus from an ABI perspective, increasing from 0.183 to 0.686. Various extensions of the model are discussed, including a nighttime-only algorithm and expansion to other satellite sensors.

TI  - Assessment of Proglacial Lakes in Sikkim Himalaya, India for Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) Risk Analysis using HEC-RAS and Geospatial Techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Existence and expansion of glacial lakes from Sikkim Himalaya enhances the susceptibility of the region to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) causing destruction of infrastructures and loss of life in the downstream region. Apart from the expanding glacial lake, various topographic factors play important role in its susceptibility to GLOF. This study aims to find out the GLOF susceptibility of a relatively stable lake, Shako Cho in terms of areal expansion using different topographic parameters. The lake volume has been estimated using area-based scaling method. Using Sentinel-2A satellite imagery and ALOS- PALSAR digital elevation model, probable avalanche pathway, steep lakefront area (SLA) have been mapped. Estimating the potential lake lowering height from the digital elevation model, potential flood volume (PFV) has been quantified. A band-ratio method has been employed to extract the debris-cover around the glacial lake. This lake has a PFV of 45.478*10(6) m(3) water. Sikkim being a hilly terrain, some of its glacial lakes are located in highly avalanche prone zone. Excessive snowfall often causes snow avalanche in those region. Thus a snow-avalanche triggered GLOF simulation in HEC-RAS 5.0.6, using 2D dam breach scenario has been performed to evaluate its impact on the downstream region.

TI  - Evaluation of carbon emissions associated with land use and cover change in Zhengzhou City of China
T2  - REGIONAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on carbon emissions associated with land use and cover change (LUCC) are key to understanding the impact of human activities on regional sustainability. In this study, we analyzed the temporal and spatial changes in carbon emissions associated with LUCC for production, living, and ecological spaces in Zhengzhou City of China. Landsat remote sensing images were used to classify the land use and land cover (LULC) types in Zhengzhou City in 1988, 2001, 2009, and 2015. Carbon emissions associated with LUCC were evaluated using a spatial gradient model and the niche mechanism. It was found that during 1988-2015, carbon emissions associated with LUCC in Zhengzhou City increased by 17.1 x 106 t, while the carbon sink resulted from cultivated land, forests, water bodies, and unused land decreased significantly. Most of the increase in carbon emissions associated with LUCC occurred in the center of the city. The peak carbon emissions were located in the northeastern, southeastern, northwestern, and southwestern regions of Zhengzhou City, and carbon emissions varied considerably in the different spatial gradient rings over time. Among the three spaces, carbon emissions associated with LUCC were mainly affected by the living space. The population size and population urbanization rate were negatively correlated with the ecological space and positively correlated with the production and living spaces. Our results highlight that Zhengzhou City should take the new urbanization path of urban transformation development and ecological civilization construction to ensure the realization of the promised carbon emission reduction targets.

TI  - Intraoperative near-infrared fluorescence imaging can identify pelvic nerves in patients with cervical cancer in real time during radical hysterectomy
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Radical hysterectomy combined with pelvic lymphadenectomy is the standard treatment for early-stage cervical cancer, but unrecognized pelvic nerves are vulnerable to irreversible damage during surgery. This early clinical trial investigated the feasibility and safety of intraoperative near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging (NIR-FI) with indocyanine green (ICG) for identifying pelvic nerves during radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer.Methods Sixty-six adults with cervical cancer were enrolled in this prospective, open-label, single-arm, single-center clinical trial. NIR-FI was performed in vivo to identify genitofemoral (GN), obturator (ON), and hypogastric (HN) nerves intraoperatively. The primary endpoint was the presence of fluorescence in pelvic nerves. Secondary endpoints were the ICG distribution in a nerve specimen and potential underlying causes of fluorescence emission in pelvic nerves.Results In total, 63 patients were analyzed. The ON was visualized bilaterally in 100% (63/63) of patients, with a mean fluorescence signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of 5.3 +/- 2.1. The GN was identified bilaterally in 93.7% (59/63) of patients and unilaterally in the remaining 4 patients, with a mean SBR of 4.1 +/- 1.9. The HN was identified bilaterally in 81.0% (51/63) of patients and unilaterally in 7.9% (5/63) of patients, with a mean SBR of 3.5 +/- 1.3. ICG fluorescence was detected in frozen sections of a nerve specimen, and was mainly distributed in axons. No ICG-related complications were observed.Conclusion This early clinical trial demonstrated the feasibility and safety of NIR-FI to visualize pelvic nerves intraoperatively. Thus, NIR-FI may help surgeons adjust surgical decision-making, avoid nerve damage, and improve surgical outcomes.

TI  - Surface Reflectance Spectral Characteristic Model of Desert Calibration Site Network in Northwest China
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ten typical radiometric calibration sites are selected for radiometric calibration and instrument performance tracking in northwest China. Simultaneous observation of reflectivity spectrum is realized by ground hand-held spectrometer and low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) during satellite transit. The reflectance spectral differences of multiple sites are compared systematically, and the spectral characteristic analysis and parameter modeling of multiple sites are carried out. The spectral shape of the same site varies little at different time in one day, and the spectral angle is less than 5 degrees. The variation of spectral amplitude is mainly affected by solar zenith angle and atmospheric conditions, and the spectral amplitude varies little at the same time in different days. The spectral shapes and amplitudes of different sites are quite different. The spectral curves of the same site at different observation scales are basically the same. Through the analysis, it is found that when the wavelength is less than 1100 nm, the spectral curves of all desert sites are similar to the curves of triangular arctangent function. Based on the arctangent function, the surface reflectance spectral modeling is carried out. The root mean square error of the measured and simulated spectra of each site is within 0.6%, and the correlation coefficient is above 0.99. The results show that the four-parameter spectral model can accurately describe the reflectance spectra of desert sites. The surface reflectance calculated by the model is used to calibrate the FY-3D medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI) site instead of the measured surface reflectance, it is found that compared with the results calculated based on the measured spectra, the relative deviation of each band of MERSI obtained by the model is less than 3%, indicating that the desert four-parameter reflectance spectral model can be well applied to the calibration of MERSI.

TI  - Land Cover and Land Use Mapping of the East Asian Summer Monsoon Region from 1982 to 2015
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the recent intensification of the East Asian summer monsoon, the frequency of floods and dry spells, which commonly affect more than one billion people, is continuously increasing. Thus, understanding the causes of changes in the EASM is paramount. Land cover and land use change can perturb a regional climate system through biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes. However, due to the scarcity of temporally continuous land cover and land use maps, the impact of land cover and land use change on the EASM is still not thoroughly explored. In the present study, this limitation was addressed via the production of annual land cover and land use maps of the East Asian summer monsoon region covering a period of 34 years (1982-2015). This was achieved through a random forest classification of phenological information derived from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies Normalized Difference Vegetation Index dataset and terrain information from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3D-30 m Digital Surface Model data. Nine ecological zones were involved in the random forest classification and the classified map in 2015 was validated using very high-resolution images obtained from Google Earth. The overall accuracy (73%) of the classification map surpasses the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Global Land Surface Satellite land cover products for the same year by similar to 7% and 4%, respectively. According to our classified maps, croplands and forests significantly increased in the East Asian summer monsoon region from 1982 to 2015. The dominant transition in these three decades was from croplands to forests.

TI  - Retrieval and Analysis of MERSI Polarization Radiation Characteristics Based on Ocean Scene
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The polarization sensitivity of the radiative transfer link will affect the accuracy and subsequent application of the remote sensing data of the medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI), so it is necessary to invert, analyze, and quantitatively remove the polarization sensitivity to improve the accuracy of radiometric calibration. Aiming at the MERSI in orbit, the region with large polarization degree of ocean scene is selected. Through the preprocessing of satellite observation data and environmental data, the sea surface radiation state is described based on the probability density model of ocean surface three\dimensional wave slope and Fresnel reflection law. 6SV radiative transfer simulation tool is used to analyze the influence of atmosphere on polarized radiation state. By coupling it with the sea surface radiation state, the atmospheric top polarized radiation state can be obtained, and the inversion of the polarized radiation characteristics of MERSI can be realized. The polarization radiation characteristics of MERSI in specific wave band are analyzed experimentally, and it is found that the polarization degree of MERSI is asymmetrically distributed with the change of satellite zenith angle, and the reflectivity error is stable with the change of satellite zenith angle and polarization degree. The variation law of polarization sensitivity of MERSI under different observation geometry and wind direction is analyzed.

TI  - Comparison of Simulated Offshore Wind Farm Wakes and SAR Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFSHORE AND POLAR ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Offshore wind farms are usually located remotely from meteorological stations, and access to wind measurements in the farms and immediate surroundings is therefore limited. Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a promising instru-ment for observation of wind farm wakes due to its high spatial resolution and large coverage. The wakes are manifested in the SAR backscattering intensity images as elongated areas with lower backscattering intensity. Good agreement between images from SAR and Doppler radar measurements has recently been reported for the wake of the Westermost Rough wind farm in cases without stable atmospheric stratification. Inspired by this first-of-its-kind comparison of ground-based Doppler radar and SAR images of wind farm wakes, in this work we compare SAR images and simulations of the two inter-acting wakes of the Sheringham Shoal and Dudgeon wind farms off the east coast of England. The wakes are simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) code, a state-of-the-art regional meteorological code that has a simple built -in wind farm model. The normalized radar cross section (NRCS) is estimated from the Sentinel-1 IW GRD products by averaging the intensity pixels to the output resolution of the model (i.e., 500 m). To study the impact of atmospheric stability on the agreement between 10-m wind speeds derived from SAR images and WRF simulations, we select two cases of land breeze and two cases of sea breeze. A sea breeze is characterized by a more stable marine atmospheric boundary layer, so the best agreement between SAR wind fields and simulated wind fields is expected for the land breeze cases, according to the comparative measurements from the Westermost Rough wind farm. All four selected cases have wind speeds above 10 m/s to promote clear wind farm wakes in the SAR images. For the wind industry, we expect relations between SAR images and hub height conditions to be of interest, and we make a first attempt to establish a robust relationship between the turbulence intensity at hub height and the SAR backscattering intensity in the centers of the wind farm wakes. In accor-dance with the reported results from Westermost Rough, we find better agreement between simulations and wind fields from SAR images for unstable than for stable atmospheric conditions. For stable atmospheric conditions, there appears to be no systematic relationship between SAR backscattering intensity and turbulence intensity at hub height in the wake region.

TI  - Present-Day Surface Deformation of Sicily Derived From Sentinel-1 InSAR Time-Series
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Quaternary geodynamics of the Central Mediterranean region is controlled by the migration of narrow orogenic belts within the slow Nubia-Eurasia plate convergence. As testified by the occurrence of major volcanic and seismic events, the Eastern Sicilian Margin is presently one of the most active regions. Using a Permanent-Scatterer approach, we process Sentinel-1 satellite images acquired from 2015 to 2020 to provide an island-wide quantification of surface displacements at a high spatiotemporal resolution. We then convert the calculated mean surface velocities along the ascending and descending satellite line of sight into the ITRF2014 reference frame by using GNSS velocity data derived from regional stations. The resulting pseudo-3D velocity field mainly highlights a general uplift of about 1.5 +/- 0.5 mm/yr of the Nebrodi-Peloritani range and its differential motion with respect to mainland Sicily along the Cefalu-Etna seismic zone. Permanent/Persistent-Scatterer (PS) vertical velocities in the Eastern Hyblean region reveal a long wavelength eastward downbending of the margin, including the inferred epicentral area of the 1693 Noto earthquake. Compared to Quaternary coastal uplift rates, these results confirm the relative low activity of Western Sicily, a potential slow uplift of South-Central Sicily and a significant discrepancy along the Eastern Hyblean margin were PS-derived vertical velocities that appear 2-3 mm/yr lower than the Quaternary rates. Over the 2015-2020 timespan, transient processes are also captured, notably on Mount Etna, showing both magmatic pressurization uplift and collapse of the eastern flank, but also all over Sicily where numerous gravitational mass movements and anthropogenic ground subsidence are detected.

TI  - Land-use change and landscape fragmentation in central Veracruz, Mexico (1989-2015)
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and fragmentation are considered threats to biodiversity. Both processes have negative effects on the function and dynamics of ecological systems at different spatial and temporal scales. Land-use change and landscape fragmentation in the central region of Veracruz, Mexico, were analyzed for the years 1989, 2003, and 2015. Cover classes were obtained from Landsat images, using supervised classification. Vegetation change and loss were quantified, and fragmentation was evaluated using landscape metrics. From 1989 to 2015, the vegetation area decreased 57%, with an annual rate of land cover change of-2.15%. Between 1989 and 2015, there was a decrease in mean fragment size, total core area, contrast index, and mean proximity. The number of fragments, the fragment density, and the total edge length decreased from 1989 to 2003 and subsequently increased in 2015. The study area shows a tendency towards landscape homogenization, where agricultural fragments and secondary vegetation occupy increasingly large areas. Recognizing the vegetation fragments most at risk to land use change is key to assessing their effect on the conservation of biodiversity and the environmental services they provide; it would also make it possible to define conservation policies that help promote sustainable agricultural and livestock practices in this region of Mexico.

TI  - Assessing the Ability to Quantify Bathymetric Change over Time Using Solely Satellite-Based Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal regions are undergoing rapid change, due to natural and anthropogenic forcings. A current constraint in understanding and modeling these changes is the lack of multi-temporal bathymetric data, or recursive observations. Often, it is difficult to obtain the repeat observations needed to quantify bathymetric change over time or events. However, the recent availability of ICESat-2 bathymetric lidar creates the option to map coastal bathymetry from solely space-based measurements via satellite-derived bathymetry with multispectral imagery (IS-2/SDB). This compositional space-based bathymetric mapping technique can assess temporal change along the coasts without other remote sensing or in situ data. However, questions exist as to the accuracy of the technique relative to both quantitative uncertainties and the ability to resolve the spatial patterns of erosion and deposition in the nearshore environment, indicative of geomorphologic change. This paper addresses the concept using data from the Florida panhandle (Northern Gulf of Mexico) collected by Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2 at two epochs to assess the feasibility of using IS-2/SDB for bathymetric change detection at scientifically relevant scales, spatial resolutions and accuracies. The comparison of the satellite-only result is compared to airborne data collected at similar epochs to reveal both quantitatively and qualitatively the utility of this technique.

AB  - The role of axillary surgery has evolved over the last three decades from routine axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) to sentinel lymph node biopsy to omission of axillary surgery altogether in select patients. This evolution has been achieved through the design and conduct of multiple clinical trials demonstrating that ALND does not impact survival and is not necessary for local control in patients with early-stage breast cancer and limited nodal involvement. Importantly, this practice-changing shift mirrored the trend towards earlier stage at diagnosis and the recognition of the interplay between local and systemic therapies in maintaining local control. There are numerous clinical scenarios today in which axillary staging can be safely avoided, including (1) DCIS treated with lumpectomy, (2) at the time of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, and (3) in elderly patients with early-stage, HR+/HER2-clinically node-negative (cN0) disease. Ongoing clinical trials seek to expand the cohorts in which surgical nodal staging can be omitted. These populations include a broader range of early-stage, cN0 patients undergoing upfront surgery, as seen in the SOUND, INSEMA, BOOG 2013-08, SOAPET and NAUTILUS trials. Omission of axillary surgery in cN0 patients with HER2+ or triple-negative disease treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is also being tested in the ASICS and EUBREAST-01 trials. Continued advances in imaging and the growing role of genomic assays in selecting patients for systemic therapy are likely to further minimize the need for axillary surgery; thereby further reducing the morbidity of local therapy for women with breast cancer.

TI  - Airborne Validation of ICESat-2 ATLAS Data over Crevassed Surfaces and Other Complex Glacial Environments: Results from Experiments of Laser Altimeter and Kinematic GPS Data Collection from a Helicopter over a Surging Arctic Glacier (Negribreen, Svalbard)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The topic of this paper is the airborne evaluation of ICESat-2 Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) measurement capabilities and surface-height-determination over crevassed glacial terrain, with a focus on the geodetical accuracy of geophysical data collected from a helicopter. To obtain surface heights over crevassed and otherwise complex ice surface, ICESat-2 data are analyzed using the density-dimension algorithm for ice surfaces (DDA-ice), which yields surface heights at the nominal 0.7 m along-track spacing of ATLAS data. As the result of an ongoing surge, Negribreen, Svalbard, provided an ideal situation for the validation objectives in 2018 and 2019, because many different crevasse types and morphologically complex ice surfaces existed in close proximity. Airborne geophysical data, including laser altimeter data (profilometer data at 905 nm frequency), differential Global Positioning System (GPS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data, on-board-time-lapse imagery and photographs, were collected during two campaigns in summers of 2018 and 2019. Airborne experiment setup, geodetical correction and data processing steps are described here. To date, there is relatively little knowledge of the geodetical accuracy that can be obtained from kinematic data collection from a helicopter. Our study finds that (1) Kinematic GPS data collection with correction in post-processing yields higher accuracies than Real-Time-Kinematic (RTK) data collection. (2) Processing of only the rover data using the Natural Resources Canada Spatial Reference System Precise Point Positioning (CSRS-PPP) software is sufficiently accurate for the sub-satellite validation purpose. (3) Distances between ICESat-2 ground tracks and airborne ground tracks were generally better than 25 m, while distance between predicted and actual ICESat-2 ground track was on the order of 9 m, which allows direct comparison of ice-surface heights and spatial statistical characteristics of crevasses from the satellite and airborne measurements. (4) The Lasertech Universal Laser System (ULS), operated at up to 300 m above ground level, yields full return frequency (400 Hz) and 0.06-0.08 m on-ice along-track spacing of height measurements. (5) Cross-over differences of airborne laser altimeter data are -0.172 +/- 2.564 m along straight paths, which implies a precision of approximately 2.6 m for ICESat-2 validation experiments in crevassed terrain. (6) In summary, the comparatively light-weight experiment setup of a suite of small survey equipment mounted on a Eurocopter (Helicopter AS-350) and kinematic GPS data analyzed in post-processing using CSRS-PPP leads to high accuracy repeats of the ICESat-2 tracks. The technical results (1)-(6) indicate that direct comparison of ice-surface heights and crevasse depths from the ICESat-2 and airborne laser altimeter data is warranted. Numerical evaluation of height comparisons utilizes spatial surface roughness measures. The final result of the validation is that ICESat-2 ATLAS data, analyzed with the DDA-ice, facilitate surface-height determination over crevassed terrain, in good agreement with airborne data, including spatial characteristics, such as surface roughness, crevasse spacing and depth, which are key informants on the deformation and dynamics of a glacier during surge.

TI  - Deep Eye Clouds in Tropical Cyclone Trami (2018) during T-PARCII Dropsonde Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The sporadic formation of short-lived convective clouds in the eye of Tropical Cyclone (TC) Trami (2018) is investigated using dropsonde data and simulation results from a coupled atmosphere-ocean model. According to the satellite data, top height of the convective clouds exceeds 9 km above mean sea level, considerably taller than that of typical hub clouds (2-3 km). These clouds are located 10-30 km away from the TC center. Hence, these convective clouds are called deep eye clouds (DECs) in this study. The dropsonde data reveal an increase in relative humidity in the eye region during the formation of DECs. Short-lived convective clouds are simulated up to the middle troposphere in the eye region in the coupled model. Investigation of thermodynamic conditions shows a weakened low-level warm core and associated favorable conditions for convection in the eye region during the formation of DECs. DECs are formed after the weakening and outward displacement of convective heating within the eyewall. To elucidate the influence of the changes in convective heating within the eyewall on the formation of DECs, we calculate secondary circulation and associated adiabatic warming induced by convective heating within the eyewall using the Sawyer-Eliassen equation. In the eye region, weakening of subsidence and associated vertical potential temperature advection is observed as DECs are formed. This suggests that the weakening and outward displacement of convective heating within the eyewall create favorable conditions for the sporadic formation of DECs.

T2  - CRITICAL SURVEY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - This general issue of Critical Survey ranges from mediaeval to modern literarepresentations of women that differ significantly from the mainstream of Petrarchan poetry. In the latter, women are feared for their power to infect with the plague of love. Popular ballads, however, register the presence of women 'searchers', charged with entering houses to locate plague, their findings printed in the weekly Bills of Mortality, and deploy such women as examples of rehabilitation and redemption. Macarena Garcia-Avello re-examines Iris Murdoch's fiction in search of feminist aspirations scholars have generally failed to find, and aims to reassess her legacy as a writer by analysing from a feminist perspective one of her most acclaimed novels, The Sea, The Sea (1978). The tension between the androcentric approach of a self-deluded male narrator and a female author whose worldview is strongly influenced by her gender results in a feminist critique which is not based on the recovery of a female voice, but on the exploration of patriarchy within the novel and the production of a feminist epistemology derived from a dialogue between Murdoch's fiction and philosophy. Alirezah Mahdipour, Hossein Pirnajmuddin and Pyeeam Abbasi revisit Chaucer's Canterbury Tales as a form of 'liturgy', defined as a communal means of social cohesion, but one which 'depicts the secularisation of liturgy and its appropriation for social control, and paradoxically, a carnivalesque celebration of the reversal of social hierarchy'. Paul Rapley reads Much Ado About Nothing as a play which exposes the rotten ness within an arbitrary system of government, but does not dare carry the plot to its logical conclusion. The responses to events by the dominant nobles, a prince and a count, are not merely foolish and damaging, but, in light of the guidance of, among others, Girolamo Muzio and Baldassare Castiglione, deeply dishonourable. Benefiting from a protected status they naturally wished to preserve, the playmakers create a historically credible set of characters, but do not make explicit any radical questioning of rank and degree. Percy Shelley's 'Ozymandias' (1818), familiar as an expression of the poet's hatred of tyranny, and argue, using the concept of urban decay and mytho

TI  - Cotton Cultivated Area Extraction Based on Multi-Feature Combination and CSSDI under Spatial Constraint
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotton is an important economic crop, but large-scale field extraction and estimation can be difficult, particularly in areas where cotton fields are small and discretely distributed. Moreover, cotton and soybean are cultivated together in some areas, further increasing the difficulty of cotton extraction. In this paper, an innovative method for cotton area estimation using Sentinel-2 images, land use status data (LUSD), and field survey data is proposed. Three areas in Hubei province (i.e., Jingzhou, Xiaogan, and Huanggang) were used as research sites to test the performance of the proposed extraction method. First, the Sentinel-2 images were spatially constrained using LUSD categories of irrigated land and dry land. Seven classification schemes were created based on spectral features, vegetation index (VI) features, and texture features, which were then used to generate the SVM classifier. To minimize misclassification between cotton and soybean fields, the cotton and soybean separation index (CSSDI) was introduced based on the red band and red-edge band of Sentinel-2. The configuration combining VI and spectral features yielded the best cotton extraction results, with F1 scores of 86.93%, 80.11%, and 71.58% for Jingzhou, Xiaogan, and Huanggang. When CSSDI was incorporated, the F1 score for Huanggang increased to 79.33%. An alternative approach using LUSD for non-target sample augmentation was also introduced. The method was used for Huangmei county, resulting in an F1 score of 78.69% and an area error of 7.01%. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to extract cotton cultivated areas, particularly in regions with smaller and scattered plots.

TI  - Genotyping of ABO and Duffy blood groups among malaria patients in Thailand.
T2  - Journal of parasitic diseases : official organ of the Indian Society for Parasitology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - ABO blood groups have been proposed to influence malaria parasite infection and disease severity in individuals residing in different geographical areas. In Thailand, genetic polymorphisms of blood groups and susceptibility to malaria infection have rarely been investigated. The aim of this study was to assess the genotype frequencies of ABO and Duffy blood groups and susceptibility to malaria infection in two populations residing in malaria-endemic areas of Thailand. 1100 malaria samples and an identical number of samples from healthy subjects were collected from Thai-Malaysian and Thai-Myanmar areas. Genotyping of ABO and Duffy blood groups was performed by sequence specific primer-polymerase chain reaction. The distribution of ABO and Duffy blood groups was similar in malaria-positive and negative subjects. Blood group O was prevalent in both populations followed by blood group B (BO genotype) and A (AO genotype), respectively. In Plasmodium falciparum infections, blood group A frequency was significantly higher in Thai-Malaysian samples (P=0.042) whereas blood group B frequency was significantly higher in Thai-Myanmar samples (P=0.022). FY*A/*A frequency was significantly higher in Plasmodium vivax infection (P=0.036) while FY*A/*B frequency was significantly higher in healthy subjects (P=0.005). The different ABO blood group frequencies in the two populations may contribute to susceptibility to P. falciparum infection and the high prevalence of FY*A/*A can confer a risk of P. vivax infection. Further research in various ethnic groups is needed to clarify the association between blood groups and pathogenesis of malaria.

TI  - Bathymetric and Capacity Relationships Based on Sentinel-3 Mission Data for Aswan High Dam Lake, Egypt
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Aswan High Dam Lake (AHDL) is one of the most relevant hot spots at both local and global levels after construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) was announced. The management of AHDL is a vital task, which requires the input of reliable information such as the lake bathymetry, water level, and the water surface area. Traditional, bathymetric methods are still very expensive and difficult to operate. Nowadays, satellite data and remote sensing techniques are easily accessible. In particular, datasets produced by operational missions are freely and globally available, and may provide efficient and inexpensive solutions for the retrieval of quantitative parameters concerning strategic water bodies, such as AHDL. This work identifies the performance of Sentinel-3A optical imagery data in the visible and NIR bands from the two optical instruments SLSTR and OLCI, and proposes the integration with Sentinel-3A radar altimetry from SRAL instrument applied to AHDL. This preliminary and first study investigated the relationship between the reflectance data and in situ data for water depth after a bathymetric campaign in the deep-water region using statistical regression models. These statistical models showed promising results in terms of correlation value (R-2 > 0.8) and normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE < 0.4). Also, Heron's formula was applied to combine optical imagery and Sentinel-3 altimetry water level datasets to estimate water storage variations in AHDL. In addition, equations governing the relationship between water level, water surface area, and water volume were analyzed. The work is very useful for all authorities and stakeholders dealing with large water bodies.

TI  - Comparison of the Vegetation Index of Reclamation Mining Areas Calculated by Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Following vegetation reclamation in mining areas, secondary damage may occur at any time, especially in locations that have been mined for decades or even hundreds of years. Effective monitoring strategies are required to accurately assess plant growth and to detect the ecological effects of reclamation. Single satellite monitoring is often difficult to ensure vegetation monitoring needs, therefore multi-source remote sensing is preferred. Different sensor parameters and variation in spectral bands can lead to differences in the type of data obtained, and subsequently, methods for evaluating these differences are required for simultaneous sensor/band use. In this study, NDVI was selected to characterize the vegetation growth of the Antaibao Open-pit Coal Mine Dump by analyzing the correlation between different types of sensors (Landsat 8, HJ, Sentinel-2) and vegetation greenness in order to facilitate satellites' replacement and supplement. Results show that: (1) Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite have a high relevance for monitoring the vegetation, but the correlation between these two sensors and HJ is relatively low, (2) the correlation between NDVI values varied by vegetation type, tree (R = 0.8698) > combined grass, shrub and tree (R = 0.7788) > grass (R = 0.7619) > shrub (R = 0.7282), and (3) the phenomenon of "Low value is high, high value is low" in the NDVI value with HJ satellite monitoring may have been caused by a weak signal strength and low sensitivity of the HJ sensor. Comparing the correlation of multi-source sensors to monitor the vegetation in the mining areas can be helpful to determine the alternative supplement of sensors through conversion formulas, which are helpful in realizing the long-term monitoring of dumps and detecting reclamation response in mining areas.

TI  - A Reconstructed Global Daily Seamless SIF Product at 0.05 Degree Resolution Based on TROPOMI, MODIS and ERA5 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been proven to be a valuable tool for monitoring vegetation's photosynthetic activity at regional or global scales. However, the coarse spatiotemporal resolution or discrete space coverage of most satellite SIF datasets hinders their full potential for studying carbon cycle and ecological processes at finer scales. Although the recent TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) partially addresses this issue, the SIF still has drawbacks in spatial insufficiency and spatiotemporal discontinuities when gridded at high spatiotemporal resolutions (e.g., 0.05 degrees, 1-day or 2-day) due to its nonuniform sampling sizes, swath gaps, and clouds contaminations. Here, we generated a new global SIF product with Seamless spatiotemporal coverage at Daily and 0.05 degrees resolutions (SDSIF) during 2018-2020, using the random forest (RF) approach together with TROPOMI SIF, MODIS reflectance and meteorological datasets. We investigated how the model accuracy was affected by selection of explanatory variables and model constraints. Eventually, models were trained and applied for specific continents and months given the similar response of SIF to environmental variables within closer space and time. This strategy achieved better accuracy (R-2 = 0.928, RMSE = 0.0597 mW/m(2)/nm/sr) than one universal model (R-2 = 0.913, RMSE = 0.0653 mW/m(2)/nm/sr) for testing samples. The SDSIF product can well preserve the temporal and spatial characteristics in original TROPOMI SIF with high temporal correlations (mean R-2 around 0.750) and low spatial residuals (less than +/- 0.081 mW/m(2)/nm/sr) between them two at most regions (80% of global pixels). Compared with the original SIF at five flux sites, SDSIF filled the temporal gaps and was better consistent with tower-based SIF at the daily scale (the mean R-2 increased from 0.467 to 0.744. Consequently, it provided more reliable 4-day SIF averages than the original ones from sparse daily observations (e.g., the R-2 at Daman site was raised from 0.614 to 0.837), which resulted in a better correlation with 4-day tower-based GPP. Additionally, the global coverage ratio and local spatial details had also been improved by the reconstructed seamless SIF. Our product has advantages in spatiotemporal continuities and details over the original TROPOMI SIF, which will benefit the application of satellite SIF for understanding carbon cycle and ecological processes at finer spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Observed and Modeled Urban Heat Island and Sea-Breeze Circulation Interactions: A Shanghai Case Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) and sea-land-breeze systems are well-known and important characteristics of the climate of coastal cities. To model these, the accurate estimation of the surface energy balance (SEB) is a key factor needed to improve local-scale simulations of thermodynamic and dynamic boundary circulations. The Weather Research and Forecasting Model with a single-layer urban canopy model (WRF/SLUCM), with parameters derived from MODIS and local GIS information, is used to investigate the UHI and sea-breeze circulations (SBC) in the megacity of Shanghai. The WRF/SLUCM can reproduce observed urban radiation and SEB fluxes, near-surface meteorological variables, and the evolution of the UHI and SBC. Simulations for an August period show the maximum UHI tends to drift northwest in the afternoon, driven by the prevailing southeast wind. The sea breeze lasts for about 4 h and is strongest between 1200 and 1400 local time (UTC + 8 h). The interaction between UHI and SBC is evident with low-level convergence, upward motion, and moisture transport from the sea and urban breezes simulated. An urban circulation (horizontal/vertical/time scales: similar to 20 km/similar to 1.5 km/similar to 3 h) with thermal vertical motions (similar to 1.5 m s(-1)) above the urban area and an SBC (horizontal/vertical/time scales: 6-7 km/similar to 1 km/2-3-h) above the northern coastal suburb occur. Combined the sea breeze and southerly winds form a low-level wind shear (convergence zone) similar to 5 km from the coast that penetrates similar to 20 km inland to the urban center. Using the WRF/SLUCM simulations we improve understanding of the complex spatial dynamics of summertime urban heating in coastal megacities, such as Shanghai.
