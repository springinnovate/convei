TI  - Does habitat fragmentation affect landscape-level temperatures? A global analysis
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Habitat fragmentation per se (habitat subdivision independent of habitat loss) is a major driver of biodiversity change, potentially due to its impacts on climate. Habitat fragmentation may make landscapes hotter by increasing the amount of habitat edges, but can reduce landscape-level temperatures due to the "vegetation breeze" phenomenon. The plausibility of these two alternative hypotheses is unclear, as no study analyzed the effects of habitat fragmentation per se on temperature. Objectives We quantify, for the first time, the impacts of habitat fragmentation on landscape-level temperature across the globe. Methods We analyzed satellite data on forest cover and three climatic variables: mean daily temperature, albedo and evapotranspiration. The analyses were performed separately for tropical, temperate, and boreal regions. We compared the climatic variables between pairs of landscapes with similar amount of forest, but different levels of forest fragmentation (number of patches). Results Habitat fragmentation reduced landscape-level temperature in all climatic regions. The magnitude of this cooling was stronger in the tropics and weaker in the boreal region due to different evapotranspiration rates. This landscape-scale cooling contradicts local-scale studies, which have indicated that edge effects rise local temperatures. However, habitat fragmentation may intensify vegetation breeze, resulting in final cooling at the landscape scale. Conclusions Habitat fragmentation leads to colder landscapes. We propose a new conceptual model to unify local (edge-induced) and landscape-level effects of habitat fragmentation on temperature, advancing the understanding of the consequences of habitat fragmentation on climate globally.

TI  - Morphological analysis and channel shifting of the Fulahar river in Malda district, West Bengal, India using remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study has been carried out to analyse and interpret the morphological changes and channel shifting along the Fulahar river in the Malda district. Fulahar river is one of the most hazardous river zones in the Malda district. The river meets the Ganga river near Manikchak Block and shifts towards the western part of the Malda district. The total length of the river is about 60 km. The study has considered the different parameters like Braiding Index, Sinuosity Index, Channel Index, Valley Index, Hydraulic Sinuosity Index, Topographic Sinuosity Index, Island areas, and river width of the Fulahar river. To detect the river course were used 45 years satellite images for the year of 1973, 1980, 1990, 2001, 2010 and 2018 from Landsat data of USGS. The study is generally based on remote sensing and Geographic Information System methods to elucidate the changes of the river channel and resulting hazard zones of the Malda district. Channel shifting and flooding are the main source of the river bank failure of the Malda district. For the completion of this study, 17 cross-sections were made for calculating the shifting of the total reach of the river from Mihaghat in Harischandrapur II to Paschim Narayanpur in Manikchak C.D. Block of Malda district. Due to the shift of the Fulahar river course, the people of Harischandrapur II, Ratua I, and Manikchak C.D. Block are faced with problems and displaced year by year. The study may help for future management of the area to reduce bank erosion and land loss.

TI  - Changes to the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity program mapping production procedures and data products
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) program has been providing the fire science community with large fire perimeter and burn severity data for the past 14 years. As of October 2019, 22 969 fires have been mapped by the MTBS program and are available on the MTBS website (). These data have been widely used by researchers to examine a variety of fire and climate science topics. However, MTBS has undergone significant changes to its fire mapping methodology, the remotely sensed imagery used to map fires, and the subsequent fire occurrence, burned boundary, and severity databases. To gather a better understanding of these changes and the potential impacts that they may have on the user community, we examined the changes to the MTBS burn mapping protocols and whether remapped burned area boundary and severity products differ significantly from the original MTBS products. Results As MTBS data have been used over the course of many years and for many disparate applications, users should be aware that the MTBS burned area and severity products have been actively reviewed and revised to benefit from more robust satellite image availability and to address any observed quality issues. In a sample of 123 remapped fires, we found no significant change in the burned area boundary products when compared to the original mapped fires; however, significant changes did exist in the distribution of unburned, low, and moderate burn severity pixels within the thematic product. Conclusions Analysis of these remapped fires provides a look into how the MTBS fire mapping methods have evolved over time. In the future, additional changes to the MTBS data record may impact data users' downstream applications. The MTBS program has an established continuous improvement approach to the MTBS methodology and products, and subsequently encourages users to confirm that they are using the most recent data.

TI  - Mapping and accuracy assessment of siltation of recharge dams using remote sensing technique
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates the use of ASTER data to map the siltation of the Al-Khod Dam constructed at the lower reaches of Samail Catchment area, north Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. In this study, the decorrelated image of spectral bands 6, 3, and 1 clearly discriminated the distribution of siltation. The occurrence of siltation is confirmed by the detection of minerals using the VNIR-SWIR bands by the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) method. In addition, the siltation of the dam is studied for the years 1987 to 2018 using Landsat satellite images. Interpretation of images showed a gradual increase of the siltation. Mapping accuracy for the occurrence of siltation is assessed by a confusion matrix which produced an overall accuracy of 97.88% and Kappa coefficient of 0.98 in the Maximum Likelihood method. Results of image analyses are verified in the field and confirmed through laboratory analyses. The study of spectral absorption characters of field samples using a Portable Infrared Mineral Analyzer (PIMA) showed the presence of OH molecule bearing minerals (clays, serpentines, etc.) and carbonate minerals (calcite and dolomite) in the silt deposits. The occurrence of these minerals is confirmed further by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analyses.

TI  - Active surveillance of acute paediatric hospitalisations demonstrates the impact of vaccination programmes and informs vaccine policy in Canada and Australia
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel surveillance of acute hospitalisations in response to infectious disease emergencies such as the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic is well described, but recognition of its potential to supplement routine public health surveillance and provide scalability for emergency responses has been limited. We summarise the achievements of two national paediatric hospital surveillance networks relevant to vaccine programmes and emerging infectious diseases in Canada (Canadian Immunization Monitoring Program Active; IMPACT from 1991) and Australia (Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance; PAEDS from 2007) and discuss opportunities and challenges in applying their model to other contexts. Both networks were established to enhance capacity to measure vaccine preventable disease burden, vaccine programme impact, and safety, with their scope occasionally being increased with emerging infectious diseases' surveillance. Their active surveillance has increased data accuracy and utility for syndromic conditions (e.g. encephalitis), pathogen-specific diseases (e.g. pertussis, rotavirus, influenza), and adverse events following immunisation (e.g. febrile seizure), enabled correlation of biological specimens with clinical context and supported responses to emerging infections (e.g. pandemic influenza, parechovirus, COVID-19). The demonstrated long-term value of continuous, rather than incident-related, operation of these networks in strengthening routine surveillance, bridging research gaps, and providing scalable public health response, supports their applicability to other countries.

TI  - Perylene-Fused, Aggregation-Free Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Solution-Processed Distributed Feedback Lasers
T2  - ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Perylene-fused, aggregation-free polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with partial zigzag periphery (ZY-01,ZY-02, andZY-03) were synthesized. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that there is no intermolecular pi-pi stacking in any of the three molecules, and as a result, they show moderate-to-high photoluminescence quantum yield in both solution and in the solid state. They also display the characteristic absorption and emission spectra of perylene dyes.ZY-01andZY-02with a nearly planar pi-conjugated skeleton exhibit amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) when dispersed in polystyrene thin films. Solution-processed distributed feedback lasers have been fabricated usingZY-01andZY-02as active gain materials, both showing narrow emission linewidth (<0.4 nm) at wavelengths around 515 and 570 nm, respectively. In contrast,ZY-03did not show ASE and lasing, presumably due to its highly twisted backbone, which facilitates nonradiative internal conversion and intersystem crossing.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine and prevalence of molecular markers associated with resistance, Guinea: an open-label two-arm randomised controlled trial
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAnti-malarial resistance is a threat to recent gains in malaria control. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in the management of uncomplicated malaria and to measure the prevalence of molecular markers of resistance of Plasmodium falciparum in sentinel sites in Maferinyah and Labe Health Districts in Guinea in 2016.MethodsThis was a two-arm randomised controlled trial of the efficacy of AL and ASAQ among children aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in two sites. Children were followed for 28 days to assess clinical and parasitological response. The primary outcome was the Kaplan-Meier estimate of Day 28 (D28) efficacy after correction by microsatellite-genotyping. Pre-treatment (D0) and day of failure samples were assayed for molecular markers of resistance in the pfk13 and pfmdr1 genes.ResultsA total of 421 participants were included with 211 participants in the Maferinyah site and 210 in Labe. No early treatment failure was observed in any study arms. However, 22 (5.3%) participants developed a late treatment failure (8 in the ASAQ arm and 14 in the AL arm), which were further classified as 2 recrudescences and 20 reinfections. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the corrected efficacy at D28 was 100% for both AL and ASAQ in Maferinyah site and 99% (95% Confidence Interval: 97.2-100%) for ASAQ and 99% (97.1-100%) for AL in Labe. The majority of successfully analysed D0 (98%, 380/389) and all day of failure (100%, 22/22) samples were wild type for pfk13. All 9 observed pfk13 mutations were polymorphisms not associated with artemisinin resistance. The NFD haplotype was the predominant haplotype in both D0 (197/362, 54%) and day of failure samples (11/18, 61%) successfully analysed for pfmdr1.ConclusionThis study observed high efficacy and safety of both ASAQ and AL in Guinea, providing evidence for their continued use to treat uncomplicated malaria. Continued monitoring of ACT efficacy and safety and molecular makers of resistance in Guinea is important to detect emergence of parasite resistance and to inform evidence-based malaria treatment policies.

TI  - Influenza-like illness in Australia: A comparison of general practice surveillance system with electronic medical records
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surveillance systems are fundamental to detect infectious disease outbreaks and guide public health responses. We compared influenza-like illness (ILI) rates for 2015-2017 using data from the Australian Sentinel Practice Research Network (ASPREN) and electronic medical records from 550 general practices across Australia (MedicineInsight). There was a high correlation between both sources (r = .84-.95) and a consistent higher ILI rate in 2017. Both sources also showed higher ILI rates among women and patients aged 20-49 years. The use of routinely collected electronic medical records like those in MedicineInsight could be used to complement active influenza surveillance systems in Australia.

TI  - Dose and duration of interferon γ pre-licensing interact with donor characteristics to influence the expression and function of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase in mesenchymal stromal cells
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a leading cell therapy candidate for the treatment of immune and inflammatory diseases due to their potent regulation of immune cells. MSC expression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) upon interferon gamma (IFN gamma) exposure has been proposed as both a sentinel marker and key mediator of MSC immunomodulatory potency. Rather than wait for in vivo exposure to cytokines, MSCs can be pre-licensed during manufacturing to enhance IDO expression. In this study, we systematically examine the relative role that the dose of IFN gamma, the duration of pre-licensing and the donor of origin play in dictating MSC production of functional IDO. We find that across three human MSC donors, MSCs increase their expression of IDO in response to both increased dose of IFN gamma and duration of pre-licensing. However, with extended pre-licensing, the expression of IDO no longer predicts MSCs ability to suppress activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, pre-licensing dose and duration are revealed to be minor modifiers of MSCs inherent potency, and thus cannot be manipulated to boost poor donors to the levels of high-performing donors. Thus, the dose and duration of pre-licensing should be tailored to optimize performance of specific donors and an emphasis on donor selection is needed to realize significant benefits of pre-licensing.

TI  - Spectral attenuation of ocean waves in pack ice and its application in calibrating viscoelastic wave-in-ice models
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate a case of ocean waves through a pack ice cover captured by Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on 12 October 2015 in the Beaufort Sea. The study domain is 400 km by 300 km, adjacent to a marginal ice zone (MIZ). The wave spectra in this domain were reported in a previous study (Stopa et al., 2018b). In that study, the authors divided the domain into two regions delineated by the first appearance of leads (FAL) and reported a clear change of wave attenuation of the total energy between the two regions. In the present study, we use the same dataset to study the spectral attenuation in the domain According to the quality of SAR-retrieved wave spectrum, we focus on a range of wave numbers corresponding to 9-15 s waves from the open-water dispersion relation. We first determine the apparent attenuation rates of each wave number by pairing the wave spectra from different locations. These attenuation rates slightly increase with increasing wave number before the FAL and become lower and more uniform against wave number in thicker ice after the FAL. The spectral attenuation due to the ice effect is then extracted from the measured apparent attenuation and used to calibrate two viscoelastic wave-in-ice models. For the Wang and Shen (2010b) model, the calibrated equivalent shear modulus and viscosity of the pack ice are roughly 1 order of magnitude greater than that in grease and pancake ice reported in Cheng et al. (2017). These parameters obtained for the extended Fox and Squire model are much greater, as found in Mosig et al. (2015) using data from the Antarctic MIZ. This study shows a promising way of using remote-sensing data with large spatial coverage to conduct model calibration for various types of ice cover.

TI  - Time-aggregated mobile phone mobility data are sufficient for modelling influenza spread: the case of Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human mobility plays a major role in the spatial dissemination of infectious diseases. We develop a spatio-temporal stochastic model for influenza-like disease spread based on estimates of human mobility. The model is informed by mobile phone mobility data collected in Bangladesh. We compare predictions of models informed by daily mobility data (reference) with that of models informed by time-averaged mobility data, and mobility model approximations. We find that the gravity model overestimates the spatial synchrony, while the radiation model underestimates the spatial synchrony. Using time-averaged mobility resulted in spatial spreading patterns comparable to the daily mobility model. We fit the model to 2014-2017 influenza data from sentinel hospitals in Bangladesh, using a sequential version of approximate Bayesian computation. We find a good agreement between our estimated model and the case data. We estimate transmissibility and regional spread of influenza in Bangladesh, which are useful for policy planning. Time-averaged mobility appears to be a good proxy for human mobility when modelling infectious diseases. This motivates a more general use of the time-averaged mobility, with important implications for future studies and outbreak control. Moreover, time-averaged mobility is subject to less privacy concerns than daily mobility, containing less temporal information on individual movements.

TI  - Lingual lymph nodes: Anatomy, clinical considerations, and oncological significance
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lingual lymph nodes are an inconstant group of in-transit nodes, which are located on the route of lymph drainage from the tongue mucosa to the regional nodes in neck levels I and II. There is growing academic data on the metastatic spread of oral cancer, particularly regarding the spreading of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma to lingual nodes. These nodes are not currently included in diagnostic and treatment protocols for oral tongue cancer. Combined information on surgical anatomy, clinical observations, means of detection, and prognostic value is presented. Anatomically obtained incidence of lingual nodes ranges from 8.6% to 30.2%. Incidence of lingual lymph node metastasis ranges from 1.3% to 17.1%. It is clear that lymph nodes that bear intervening tissues from the floor of the mouth should be removed to improve loco-regional control. Extended resection volume, which is required for the surgical treatment of lingual node metastasis, cannot be implied to every tongue cancer patient. As these lesions significantly influence prognosis, special efforts of their detection must be made. Reasonably, every tongue cancer patient must be investigated for the existence of lingual lymph node metastasis. Lymphographic tracing methods, which are currently implied for sentinel lymph node biopsies, may improve the detection of lingual lymph nodes.

TI  - High-Resolution Modeling of Uplift Landscapes can Inform Micrositing of Wind Turbines for Soaring Raptors
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Collision risk of soaring birds is partly associated with updrafts to which they are attracted. To identify the risk-enhancing landscape features, a micrositing tool was developed to model orographic and thermal updraft velocities from high-resolution remote sensing data. The tool was applied to the island of Hitra, and validated using GPS-tracked white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla). Resource selection functions predicted that eagles preferred ridges with high orographic uplift, especially at flight altitudes within the rotor-swept zone (40-110 m). Flight activity was negatively associated with the widely distributed areas with high thermal uplift at lower flight altitudes (<110 m). Both the existing wind-power plant and planned extension are placed at locations rendering maximum orographic updraft velocities around the minimum sink rate for white-tailed eagles (0.75 m/s) but slightly higher thermal updraft velocities. The tool can contribute to improve micrositing of wind turbines to reduce the environmental impacts, especially for soaring raptors.

TI  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - HAUTARZT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is one of the most common cancers of the Caucasian population and accounts for 20% of all skin tumours. An S3 guideline of the German Guideline Program in Oncology has been available since 2019. The diagnosis is based on the clinical examination. Excision and histological confirmation is required for all clinically suspicious lesions to allow prognostic assessment and correct treatment. The therapy of first choice is complete excision with histological control of the surgical margin. In cSCC with risk factors such as tumor thickness >6 & x202f;mm, sentinel lymph node biopsy may be discussed, but there is currently no clear evidence of its prognostic and therapeutic relevance. Adjuvant radiation therapy may be considered in cases of high risk of recurrence and should be tested in cases of inoperable tumors. The indication for electrochemotherapy should also be considered in the treatment of local or locoregional recurrence. The immune checkpoint inhibitor cemiplimab is approved for the treatment of inoperable or metastasized cSCC. In case of contraindications, chemotherapeutic agents, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors or palliative radiotherapy can be used. Since the evidence is low in these cases, a systemic therapy should be used preferentially within clinical studies. Follow-up care should be risk-adapted and includes a dermatological control, supplemented by ultrasound examinations in high-risk patients.

TI  - Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage of Deidentified Records Within a Public Health Surveillance System: Evaluation Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance (ACCESS) was established to monitor national testing and test outcomes for blood-borne viruses (BBVs) and sexually transmissible infections (STIs) in key populations. ACCESS extracts deidentified data from sentinel health services that include general practice, sexual health, and infectious disease clinics, as well as public and private laboratories that conduct a large volume of BBV/STI testing. An important attribute of ACCESS is the ability to accurately link individual-level records within and between the participating sites, as this enables the system to produce reliable epidemiological measures.Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of GRHANITE software in ACCESS to extract and link deidentified data from participating clinics and laboratories. GRHANITE generates irreversible hashed linkage keys based on patient-identifying data captured in the patient electronic medical records (EMRs) at the site. The algorithms to produce the data linkage keys use probabilistic linkage principles to account for variability and completeness of the underlying patient identifiers, producing up to four linkage key types per EMR. Errors in the linkage process can arise from imperfect or missing identifiers, impacting the system's integrity. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the quality of the linkages created and evaluate the outcome of the linkage for ongoing public health surveillance.Methods: Although ACCESS data are deidentified, we created two gold-standard datasets where the true match status could be confirmed in order to compare against record linkage results arising from different approaches of the GRHANITE Linkage Tool. We reported sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values where possible and estimated specificity by comparing a history of HIV and hepatitis C antibody results for linked EMRs.Results: Sensitivity ranged from 96% to 100%, and specificity was 100% when applying the GRHANITE Linkage Tool to a small gold-standard dataset of 3700 clinical medical records. Medical records in this dataset contained a very high level of data completeness by having the name, date of birth, post code, and Medicare number available for use in record linkage. In a larger gold-standard dataset containing 86,538 medical records across clinics and pathology services, with a lower level of data completeness, sensitivity ranged from 94% to 95% and estimated specificity ranged from 91% to 99% in 4 of the 6 different record linkage approaches.Conclusions: This study's findings suggest that the GRHANITE Linkage Tool can be used to link deidentified patient records accurately and can be confidently used for public health surveillance in systems such as ACCESS.

TI  - Development of Prediction Model Including MicroRNA Expression for Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in ER-Positive and HER2-Negative Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The aim of our study is to find microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with sentinel lymph node metastasis (SLNM) and to develop a prediction model for SLNM in ER-positive and HER2-negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer. Patients and Methods In the present study, only ER+/HER2- primary breast cancer was considered. The discovery set for SLNM-associated miRNAs included 10 tumors with and 10 tumors without SLNM. The training and validation sets both included 100 tumors. miRNA expression in tumors was examined comprehensively by miRNA microarray in the discovery set and by droplet digital PCR in the training and validation sets. Results In the discovery set, miR-98, miR-22, and miR-223 were found to be significantly (P < 0.001, fold-change > 2.5) associated with SLNM. In the training set, we constructed the prediction model for SLNM using miR-98, tumor size, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) with high accuracy (AUC, 0.877). The accuracy of this prediction model was confirmed in the validation set (AUC, 0.883), and it outperformed the conventional Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram. In situ hybridization revealed the localization of miR-98 expression in tumor cells. Conclusions We developed a prediction model consisting of miR-98, tumor size, and LVI for SLNM with high accuracy in ER+/HER2- breast cancer. This model might help decide the indication for SLN biopsy in this subtype.

TI  - Approaching climate change mitigation policymaking in South Africa: a view from critical complexity thinking
T2  - CLIMATE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - From a complexity thinking perspective, the world is understood as complex, systemic, and only partially knowable. The particular perspective we inhabit is determinant of what we can know. Perspective or 'approach' is therefore foregrounded by complexity thinkers as an active part of knowing and acting. We take a complexity view of climate change mitigation policymaking to argue that climate change mitigation policy communities have a dominant approach, which determines both our understanding of the climate change mitigation policy problem, and how we respond to it. To construct this argument, we first summarize and describe the existence of a hegemonic scientific and cultural worldview. We use multi-disciplinary literatures to demonstrate how this worldview operates in the approach of the international climate change mitigation policy community. Finally, we draw on empirical datasets to describe how the influence of this worldview characterizes the dominant approach of the South African climate change mitigation policy community. That climate change mitigation policy communities have a dominant approach means that, whilst aspects of the complex policy situation are illuminated by this approach, others are obscured. It is clear from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on 1.5 degrees C warming that policymakers are not yet responding adequately to the problem. If approach determines what we see and how we act, it follows that approach can be interrogated as an active site of the policy challenge. A complexity view, for instance, enables us to see differently, emphasizing perspective, impartial knowledge, non-linearities and emergence in complexity and complex systems. This in turn has implications for our policymaking. Key policy insights Policymakers should explore how an understanding of approach informs climate change mitigation policymaking. Climate change mitigation policy communities should critically examine the underlying assumptions and worldviews that influence both how we encounter climate change mitigation and how we act upon it. An appreciation of 'approach' demands skills not typically valued or taught to climate change mitigation policymakers, with implications for climate change mitigation policy curricula and the composition of policymaking teams Complexity thinking opens up spaces for policymaking currently obscured by the dominant climate change mitigation policy approaches.

TI  - The Dilemma After an Unforeseen Positive Sentinel Node in Primary Breast Cancer: Is Completion Axillary Dissection Necessary?
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In the majority of cases, the sentinel node is the only positive node in the axilla and completion ALND (cALND) is a futile procedure. However, refraining from cALND will lead to less accurate staging and, possibly, undertreatment. To help resolve this dilemma, we examined the clinical value of cALND in staging and determining adjuvant treatment. Methods In a retrospective cohort, all consecutive patients over a five-year period with primary breast cancer who received ALND were identified and grouped based on timing of ALND. Total nodal yield and positive lymph nodes were defined and factors with possible impact identified. In the case of cALND, N-status upstaging and possible impact on adjuvant treatment were studied in detail. Results A total of 280 patients were selected of whom 204 underwent primary ALND (pALND) and 76 cALND. pALND resulted in a significantly higher total nodal yield and more positive nodes when compared to cALND (p = 0.003, andp < 0.001, respectively). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) had no effect on total nodal yield (p = 0.413), but resulted in fewer positive nodes (p < 0.001). Due to the results of cALND, only 11 patients (14%) had upstaging of N-status. All these patients were advised more extensive adjuvant radiotherapy. Conclusion In the majority of patients, cALND does not lead to upstaging. cALND should be performed only after a careful discussion with the patient about the pros and cons of this procedure, and most probably only in the presence of multiple risk factors for axillary disease in the absence of systemic therapy.

TI  - Advanced Merkel cell carcinoma-A focus on medical drug therapy
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but aggressive non-melanoma skin cancer with significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment of choice for primary and locoregional MCC is complete surgical removal with sentinel lymphonodectomy and postsurgical radiotherapy of tumor basin and locoregional lymph nodes. In nonresectable and advanced tumors, drug therapy is indicated. While cytotoxic chemotherapy has resulted in higher response rates, overall survival remained nearly unaffected. With a better insight into tumor development and biology, new treatment s became available. Immune checkpoint inhibitors result in durable responses with a better safety profile that classical combined chemotherapy. Combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors with and without radiotherapy help to overcome acquired drug-resistance. New compounds for vaccination and oral use are on the horizon. Despite all progress, treatment of MCC remains a challenge that needs close interdisciplinary teamwork.

TI  - Comparison of Normalization Methods for Analysis of TempO-Seq Targeted RNA Sequencing Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data is a valuable tool to understand transcription at the genome scale. Targeted sequencing of RNA has emerged as a practical means of assessing the majority of the transcriptomic space with less reliance on large resources for consumables and bioinformatics. TempO-Seq is a templated, multiplexed RNA-Seq platform that interrogates a panel of sentinel genes representative of genome-wide transcription. Nuances of the technology require proper preprocessing of the data. Various methods have been proposed and compared for normalizing bulk RNA-Seq data, but there has been little to no investigation of how the methods perform on TempO-Seq data. We simulated count data into two groups (treated vs. untreated) at seven-fold change (FC) levels (including no change) using control samples from human HepaRG cells run on TempO-Seq and normalized the data using seven normalization methods. Upper Quartile (UQ) performed the best with regard to maintaining FC levels as detected by a limma contrast between treated vs. untreated groups. For all FC levels, specificity of the UQ normalization was greater than 0.84 and sensitivity greater than 0.90 except for the no change and +1.5 levels. Furthermore, K-means clustering of the simulated genes normalized by UQ agreed the most with the FC assignments [adjusted Rand index (ARI) = 0.67]. Despite having an assumption of the majority of genes being unchanged, the DESeq2 scaling factors normalization method performed reasonably well as did simple normalization procedures counts per million (CPM) and total counts (TCs). These results suggest that for two class comparisons of TempO-Seq data, UQ, CPM, TC, or DESeq2 normalization should provide reasonably reliable results at absolute FC levels >= 2.0. These findings will help guide researchers to normalize TempO-Seq gene expression data for more reliable results.

TI  - Chlorophyll-Based Near-Infrared Fluorescent Nanocomposites: Preparation and Optical Properties
T2  - ACS OMEGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence has attracted much attention in biomedical fields because it offers deep tissue penetration and high spatial resolution. Herein, a method is developed for the preparation of NIR fluorescent nanocomposites (NCs) by encapsulating natural chlorophyll (ChI) into the micelles of octylamine-modified poly(acrylic acid) (OPA). Both femtosecond transient absorption spectra and isothermal titration calorimetry thermogram reveal that the micelles of OPA provide a hydrophobic environment for the improved fluorescence efficiency. Hence the resulted ChI NCs possess unique properties such as ultrasmall size, outstanding photostability, good biocompatibility, and superbright NIR fluorescence emission. In vivo imaging of sentinel lymph node is achieved in nude mice, demonstrating the potential of ChI NCs in biomedical applications. This work provides a new strategy for the preparation of highly biocompatible NIR fluorescence labeling nanocomposites.

TI  - Symbolic rationality in the public sector
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The aim of this article is to describe work relations between leaders and counsellors in the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV). The study focuses on communication, control, work ethos, worldview and digital production management (DPM). Design/methodology/approach This article is based on two empirical studies from the same research project at the NAV in the south of Norway called "Leadership and client orientation in NAV". The research design led to a qualitative interview method being used to collect and analyse the opinions and experiences of the interviewees (Merriam, 2009). Findings The study found that (a) leaders use DPM to control employees, (b) communicative and regulative aspects of working in NAV, (c) contradictory simultaneous work demands on leaders and counsellors and (d) the symbolic rationality of work in NAV. The aspects (a) to (d) show a specific worldview in NAV. The study also found aspects of work ethos in NAV, such as a strong will to help and do well for the user and at the same time meet NAV's financial and administrative requirements (Lundquist, 1998; Byrkjeflot, 2008). It is fruitful to describe this situation using the concept of symbolic rationality. Originality/value Through symbolic rationality, the study has identified the possibility for further research on the hybrid professionalism of leadership and counsellorship, at three levels in the ambidextrous public sector. The first is the epistemological level, where the concept sets limits on how a social situation such as NAV can be spoken about and understood. A second level is the theoretical level, where categories and logics can be formed and that are seen as being applicable to work in NAV. The third and final level is the practical level, where the concept of symbolic rationality and the meanings connected with it shape leaders' and counsellors' professional practice in the public sector.

TI  - Landscape scale variation in the hydrologic niche of California coast redwood
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Topoclimatic diversity within forest landscapes can underlie variation in water availability, which may correspond to patterns in habitat suitability of tree species with differing hydrologic niches. However, the trade-off between the collection of data at a fine grain size over large spatial extents has limited comprehensive analyses of landscape scale variation in habitat suitability. We present a fine scale analysis of the roles of topographic gradients in moisture availability, soil water storage and fog frequency in the spatial pattern of habitat suitability for coast redwoodSequoia sempervirens, at 10 m resolution across 34 800 ha and three landscapes spanning approximately one-third of redwood's latitudinal range. A new 10 m resolution presence-absence map derived from airborne imaging spectroscopy was used to characterize current redwood distributions in three landscapes. Access to belowground moisture was assessed through four measures calculated from a high-resolution LiDAR digital elevation model, soil water storage was mapped from the USDA Soil Survey Geographic Database, and fog frequency was calculated from MODIS cloud cover data. Access to belowground moisture and fog predicted variation in suitability as redwood habitat from 22-75% and predicted redwood presence and absence at 10 m resolution with 63-74% accuracy. Across all three landscapes, redwood density consistently decreased with increasing interpolated height above a stream (IHAS), but the role of other predictors varied among the sites. Our results challenge previous assumptions that redwood habitat suitability within much coarser resolutions (800 m x 800 m) can be described by a single value. The elevated habitat suitability of sites close to streams suggests that these sites should be evaluated for their potential to become microrefugia within landscapes that may become climatically-unsuitable for redwoods at a regional scale.

TI  - Three-dimensional change in temperature sensitivity of northern vegetation phenology
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how the temperature sensitivity of phenology changes with three spatial dimensions (altitude, latitude, and longitude) is critical for the prediction of future phenological synchronization. Here we investigate the spatial pattern of temperature sensitivity of spring and autumn phenology with altitude, latitude, and longitude during 1982-2016 across mid- and high-latitude Northern Hemisphere (north of 30 degrees N). We find distinct spatial patterns of temperature sensitivity of spring phenology (hereafter "spring S-T") among altitudinal, latitudinal, and longitudinal gradient. Spring S(T)decreased with altitude mostly over eastern Europe, whereas the opposite occurs in eastern North America and the north China plain. Spring S(T)decreased with latitude mainly in the boreal regions of North America, temperate Eurasia, and the arid/semi-arid regions of Central Asia. This distribution may be related to the increased temperature variance, decreased precipitation, and radiation with latitude. Compared to spring S-T, the spatial pattern of temperature sensitivity of autumn phenology (hereafter "autumn S-T") is more heterogeneous, only showing a clear spatial pattern of autumn S(T)along the latitudinal gradient. Our results highlight the three-dimensional view to understand the phenological response to climate change and provide new metrics for evaluating phenological models. Accordingly, establishing a dense, high-quality three-dimensional observation system of phenology data is necessary for enhancing our ability to both predict phenological changes under changing climatic conditions and to facilitate sustainable management of ecosystems.

TI  - Persistent Scatterer Interferometry in the post-event monitoring of the Idukki Landslides
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of pre-failure movements and their evolution over time is necessary to assess the predisposing and triggering factors. This research focusses on assessing terrain displacements in the Idukki district (Kerala, India) over a year before the deadly disaster, which occurred in August 2018; this disaster was claimed to be a dreadful one as it took off hundreds of human lives and properties. The post-event Persistent Scatterers interferometric analysis on a stack of 20 Sentinel-1 images was performed to analyse the precursory deformations of the landslides. From the results obtained, the study region is estimated to have undergone a displacement of -26 to +19 mm/year, which indicates the instability of the terrain. Also it is evident that the occurrence of the landslides in August 2018, has been due to the effect of the torrential rainfall and the increase in the pore water inducing instability, thereby causing displacement in the region.

TI  - African Pentecostal spirituality as a mystical tradition: How regaining its roots could benefit Pentecostals
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Western academic theology do not succeed in accounting for the identity and faith culture of African Pentecostals for at least two reasons. In the first place, because as part of the Pentecostal movement it grew from the holiness, divine healing and revivalist movement that went back to Pietism and emphasised a holistic effective spirituality, and secondly, because it links with the holistic tradition of African traditional religions and worldview that share some aspects of the Old Testament realist way of thinking. African Pentecostalism needs another language to describe its unique way of doing theology in direct conjunction with spirituality. It is argued that the language of the time-honoured practice of mysticism is suitable for explaining its spirituality. Theology and spirituality should mutually inform and constitute each other, as emphasised in mystical theology, for Pentecostal theology to be a valid reflection and meditation on the experience of consciousness of the involvement of God. African Pentecostals will benefit by learning from this ancient tradition by using concepts of mystical theology to find words to state the unsayable. The article closes by asking what the language of mysticism would entail for Pentecostals. Several aspects that define Pentecostal spirituality demonstrate their relation with mystical theology, such as a separate experience of sanctification, an acknowledgement of affections in expressing religious sentiments, a different way of interpreting and participating in reality, ecstatic speech and a continual emphasis on a personal, experiential encounter with the Spirit of God.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aim Postoperative hemorrhage is a rare but potentially lethal complication of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgeries. This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the clinical outcome of patients with delayed postoperative hemorrhage and compare the results according to the surgical procedure. Methods Overall, 4220 patients underwent surgery for hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. Delayed postoperative hemorrhage (observed more than 24 h postoperatively) occurred in 62 patients. Of these, 61 underwent interventional radiology to achieve hemostasis. Patients' clinical data were analyzed retrospectively. The chi-squared or Fisher's exact test was used in data analysis. Results A total of 62 patients (1.5%) developed delayed postoperative hemorrhage; 61 (1.4%) of them underwent interventional radiology to achieve hemostasis. Median duration from surgery to interventional radiology was 19 days (range: 5-252 days). Sentinel bleeding was detected in 31 patients; Clinical success was achieved in 54 patients (88.5%) by interventional radiology. Overall mortality rate was 26.2%. Causes of 16 in-hospital deaths were uncontrollable hemorrhage (n = 4) and worsening of general condition after hemostasis (n = 12). Mortality rates were 50.0% (11/22) and 12.8% (5/39) after hepatobiliary surgery and pancreatic resection, respectively. Mortality rate was significantly higher after hepatobiliary surgery than after pancreatic surgery (P = 0.002). Conclusions Interventional radiology can be successfully performed to achieve hemostasis for delayed hemorrhage after hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgeries. Because successful interventional radiology does not necessarily lead to survival, particularly after hepatobiliary surgery, meticulous attention to prevent surgical complications and intensive treatments before and after interventional radiology are required to improve outcomes.

TI  - Estrogen as a Neuroprotectant in Both Sexes: Stories From the Bird Brain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Estrogens such as estradiol (E2) are potent effectors of neural structure and function via peripheral and central synthesis. In the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), neural E2 synthesis is among the highest reported in homeotherms due to the abundant constitutive expression of aromatase (E-synthase) in discrete neuronal pools across the forebrain. Following penetrating or concussive trauma, E2 synthesis increases even further via the induced expression of aromatase in reactive astrocytes around the site of damage. Injury-associated astrocytic aromatization occurs in the brains of both sexes regardless of the site of injury and can remain elevated for weeks following trauma. Interestingly, penetrating injury induces astrocytic aromatase more rapidly in females compared to males, but this sex difference is not detectable 24 h posttrauma. Indeed, unilateral penetrating injury can increase E2 content 4-fold relative to the contralateral uninjured hemisphere, suggesting that glial aromatization may be a powerful source of neural E2 available to circuits. Glial aromatization is neuroprotective as inhibition of injury-induced aromatase increases neuroinflammation, gliosis, necrosis, apoptosis, and infarct size. These effects are ameliorated upon replacement with E2, suggesting that the songbird may have evolved a rapidly responsive neurosteroidogenic system to protect vulnerable brain circuits. The precise signals that induce aromatase expression in astrocytes include elements of the inflammatory cascade and underscore the sentinel role of the innate immune system as a crucial effector of trauma-associated E2 provision in the vertebrate brain. This review will describe the inductive signals of astroglial aromatase and the neuroprotective role for glial E2 synthesis in the adult songbird brains of both sexes.

TI  - Assessment of evapotranspiration estimates based on surface and satellite data and its relationship with El Nino-Southern Oscillation in the Rio de Janeiro State
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The need to validate the quality of evapotranspiration estimates is essential for this parameter which has extended its use. For this, it is necessary to evaluate both new remote sensing products that expand the areas of estimated evapotranspiration and empirical equations that provide estimates with different data requirements. In order to examine this problem, the present study compared the estimates of evapotranspiration obtained by remote sensing of the MOD16A2 product and seven empirical equations with the estimates obtained through the FAO-56 reference method, with data obtained from six meteorological stations in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Data cover the period from 2007 to 2013, which contains different phases of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. The methods proposed by Valiantzas were those that obtained the best performances when compared with FAO-56 withR(2)over 90%. The non-parametric analysis of Mann-Kendall for the six seasons was mostly not significant; only the station of Resende showed a tendency of significant growth during the El Nino episode (Z = 0.283 andpvalue = 0.050). The mangrove and forest classes were the ones that obtained the highest averages (3.75 mm d(-1)and 3.62 mm d(-1)), where the gradient of evapotranspiration can be observed in the South-Northeast portions. The MOD16A2 orbital product was inferior to the methods that used surface meteorological station data.

TI  - Effects of out-of-band and time-varying relative spectral response on the calibration of MODIS reflective solar bands
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Calibration of the on-orbit gain changes of the narrow bandwidth reflective solar bands (RSB) of Terra and Aqua MODIS is usually based on the band center wavelength. The relative spectral response (RSR) of each band is assumed to be constant on orbit, and the time dependence of an overall gain factor is calculated. Any on-orbit changes to the RSR of the MODIS bands will introduce some error into the calibration and may also have an impact on the Earth scene radiance retrieval. We consider two different ways to track how the RSR of the MODIS RSB may change on orbit and the effects that these changes have on the calibration. First, we study the broadband degradation of the MODIS scan mirror and how it may change the effective out-of-band response of the RSB. Second, we examine in-band RSR measurements from the spectroradiometric calibration assembly carried on-board both MODIS instruments. We find that RSR changes have a relatively small effect on the radiance calibrated using the on-board solar diffuser, generally <0.5% for all RSB at any time in the missions, though the effect may be slightly larger for some scan angles. The impact of RSR changes on the Earth scene radiance retrieval is highly dependent on the spectral properties of the scene and could be significantly larger. The bands showing the largest impacts are Terra bands 1, 4, 8, 9, 17, and 19 and Aqua bands 8 and 9. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Understanding tropical forest abiotic response to hurricanes using experimental manipulations, field observations, and satellite data
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - With projected increasing intensity of hurricanes and large uncertainty in the path of forest recovery from hurricanes, studies are needed to understand the fundamental response of forests to canopy opening and debris deposition: the response of the abiotic factors underneath the canopy. Through two manipulative experiments and instrumenting prior to Hurricane Maria (2017) in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) of Puerto Rico, this study found a long recovery time of primary abiotic factors (beneath canopy light, throughfall, and temperature) influenced by the disturbance of canopy opening, as well as complex responses by the secondary abiotic factors (relative humidity, soil moisture, and leaf saturation) influenced by the disturbance of the primary factors. Recovery took 4-5 years for beneath canopy light, while throughfall recovery took 4-9 years and neither had recovered when Hurricane Maria passed 3 years after the second experiment. Air and soil temperature seemingly recovered quickly from each disturbance ( < 2.5 years in two experiments for similar to +1 degrees C of change); however, temperature was the most important modulator of secondary factors, which followed the long-term patterns of the throughfall. While the soil remained wetter and relative humidity in the air stayed lower until recovery, leaves in the litter and canopy were wetter and drier, with evidence that leaves dry out faster in low rainfall and saturate faster in high rainfall after disturbance. Comparison of satellite and field data before and after the 2017 hurricanes showed the utility of satellites in expanding the data coverage, but the muted response of the satellite data suggests they measure dense forest as well as thin forest that is not as disturbed by hurricanes. Thus, quick recovery times recorded by satellites should not be assumed representative of all the forest. Data records spanning the multiple manipulative experiments followed by Hurricane Maria in the LEF provide evidence that intermediate hurricane frequency has the most extreme abiotic response (with evidence on almost all abiotic factors tested) versus infrequent or frequent hurricanes.

TI  - A Newly Emerging Thermal Area in Yellowstone
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Yellowstone is a large restless caldera that contains many dynamic thermal areas that are the surface expression of the deeper magmatic system. In 2018, using a Landsat 8 nighttime thermal infrared image, we discovered the emergence of a new thermal area located near Tern Lake on the northeast margin of the Sour Creek dome. A high-spatial-resolution airborne visible image from August 2017 revealed a large (similar to 33,300 m(2)) area of recently fallen trees, mostly devoid of vegetation, with bright soil, similar to other nearby thermal areas. Field observations in August 2019 confirmed that this was a steam-heated, acid-sulfate thermal area, with an arc-shaped zone of hydrothermally altered soil and heated ground, with surface temperatures of 60-80 degrees C, several steaming fumaroles, and boiling temperatures (93 degrees C) just beneath the surface. Fallen trees in contact with warm ground were being carbonized, yet new trees were growing in some cooler areas. Observations of stressed or dying vegetation from archived satellite and airborne remote sensing data going back to 1994 indicated that this thermal area started emerging around 2000. It increased in size slowly until around 2005, when the radiative heat output started measurably increasing. From 2005 to 2012, it grew more rapidly; and from 2012 through 2019, the growth rate slowed and the heat output stabilized. We predict that this stabilizing trend will continue in the coming years. The initial formation of this new thermal area was not clearly linked to any distinct seismic or geodetic events, although the period of rapid growth partly coincided with a period of rapid local uplift, possibly suggesting a causative relationship. The identification of this emerging thermal area illustrates the importance of satellite thermal infrared imaging combined with high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data and field observations for mapping, measuring, and monitoring Yellowstone's thermal areas. It is also an example of the dynamics we expect to observe within large caldera systems like Yellowstone, where changes in the size and distribution of thermal areas are normal and do not indicate an impending eruption nor any significant changes in the broader magmatic system.

TI  - Inversion of soil salinity according to different salinization grades using multi-source remote sensing
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salt information from unified soil salinity content (SSC) inversion models based on all samples is insufficient for accurate regional SSC monitoring. Here, a method of building SSC inversion models for different salinization grades is proposed, combined with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Sentinel-2A images. According to different salinization grades, three groups of samples (mild (M), medium-severe (S), and whole (W)) were obtained. Their SSC spectra characteristics, parameters, and quantitative inversion models were analysed, constructed, and compared, based on UAV images, and substituted into different salinization grade areas in Sentinel-2A. The UAV-based models for M and S outperformed those for W; the same trend occurred after substituted into Sentinel-2A images. The inversion results were closer to the field survey results. Models for different salinization grades achieved better regional inversion than those of the whole. UAV-based SSC models can be applied to satellite imagery to invert regional SSC.

TI  - Monitoring of water surface temperature of Eurasian large lakes usingMODISland surface temperature product
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, data from MODIS land surface temperature product level 3 (MOD11A2) were used to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of Eurasian lakes water surface temperature (LSWT) from 2001 to 2015, and to examine the most influencing factors of that variation. The temperature of most lakes in the dry climate zone and in the equatorial climatic zone varied from 17 to 31 degrees C and from 23 to 27 degrees C, respectively. LSWTs in the warm temperate and cold climatic zones were in the range of 20 to 27 degrees C and -0.6 and 17 degrees C, respectively. The average day time LSWT in the polar climate zone was -0.71 degrees C in the summer. Lakes in high latitude and in the Tibetan Plateau displayed low LSWT, ranging from -11 to 26 degrees C during the night time. Large spatial variations of diurnal temperature difference (DTD) were observed in lakes across Eurasia. However, variations in DTDs were small in lakes located in high latitude and in tropical rainforest regions. The shallow lakes showed a rapid response of LSWT to solar and atmospheric forcing, while in the large and deep lakes, that response was sluggish. Results of this study demonstrated the applicability of remote sensing and MODIS LST products to capture the spatial-temporal variability of LSWT across continental scales, in particular for the vast wilderness areas and protected environment in high latitude regions of the world. The approach can be used in future studies examining processes and factors controlling large scale variability of LSWT.

TI  - Examining Land Use Changes to Evaluate the Effects of Land Management in a Complex, Dynamic Landscape
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic alterations to landscapes have increased as the human population continues to rise, leading to detrimental changes in natural habitats. Ecological restoration assists in recovery by altering habitats to improve conditions and foster biodiversity. We examined land cover changes over time within a complex, dynamic region in the Midwest to assess the long-term effects of conservation. We used Landsat 8 bands for a 15-class land cover map of Oak Openings Region using supervised classification. We validated our map and achieved an overall accuracy of 71.2% from correctly classified points out of total visited points. Change over 10 years, from 2006 to 2016, was explored by comparing class statistics from FRAGSTATS between our map and original land cover map. We found that natural land, i.e., forest and early successional, covered 33%, with 10% permanently protected, while human-modified land, i.e., agricultural and developed, covered 67% of the region. Over 10 years, natural classes increased, and cultural classes decreased by 5.8%. There were decreases for the three forest communities and increases for the two early successional communities. These changes are likely the result of natural recovery and disturbance, and conservation efforts by the Green Ribbon Initiative. Changes in habitat also came with distribution changes, e.g., increased fragmentation for some classes, which was readily visible. Our useful method measured functionality by emphasizing changes in composition and configuration. Our approach provides a tool for assessing cumulative regional-scale effects from site-level management and conservation. This large-scale view for conservation is needed to effectively mitigate future changes.

TI  - Patterns of human exposure to malaria vectors in Zanzibar and implications for malaria elimination efforts
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Zanzibar provides a good case study for malaria elimination. The islands have experienced a dramatic reduction in malaria burden since the introduction of effective vector control interventions and case management. Malaria prevalence has now been maintained below 1% for the past decade and the islands can feasibly aim for elimination. Methods To better understand factors that may contribute to remaining low-level malaria transmission in Zanzibar, layered human behavioural and entomological research was conducted between December 2016 and December 2017 in 135 randomly selected households across six administrative wards. The study included: (1) household surveys, (2) structured household observations of nighttime activity and sleeping patterns, and (3) paired indoor and outdoor mosquito collections. Entomological and human behavioural data were integrated to provide weighted estimates of exposure to vector bites, accounting for proportions of people indoors or outdoors, and protected by insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) each hour of the night. Results Overall, 92% of femaleAnophelesmosquitoes were caught in the rainy season compared to 8% in the dry season and 72% were caught outdoors compared to 28% indoors. For individual ITN users, ITNs prevented an estimated two-thirds (66%) of exposure to vector bites and nearly three quarters (73%) of residual exposure was estimated to occur outdoors. Based on observed levels of ITN use in the study sites, the population-wide mean personal protection provided by ITNs was 42%. Discussion/conclusions This study identified gaps in malaria prevention in Zanzibar with results directly applicable for improving ongoing programme activities. While overall biting risk was low, the most notable finding was that current levels of ITN use are estimated to prevent less than half of exposure to malaria vector bites. Variation in ITN use across sites and seasons suggests that additional gains could be made through targeted social and behaviour change interventions. However, even for ITN users, gaps in protection remain, with a majority of exposure to vector bites occurring outdoors before going to sleep. Supplemental interventions targeting outdoor exposure to malaria vectors, and groups that may be at increased risk of exposure to malaria vectors, should be explored.

AB  - Data assimilation (DA) offers immense potential for uncertainty identification, improving the initial estimates for hydrological and atmospheric modelling. This paper reviews the studies in hydrological DA using Kalman filters. Recent applications of Kalman filters in hydrological and atmospheric DA are summarized. Existing challenges for DA studies are briefly described. In addition, three case study examples are presented highlighting the effects of: (a) soil moisture DA in the Noah land surface model; (b) variational assimilation for improving precipitation forecasts in the WRF (Weather Research Forecast) model; and (c) simulating AMSR-2 (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2) radiances towards DA. Although there are many unresolved issues in DA that warrant further research, it has immense potential for predicting variables at a better lead time for hydrometeorology.

TI  - Reducing uncertainties in satellite estimates of aerosol-cloud interactions over the subtropical ocean by integrating vertically resolved aerosol observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite quantification of aerosol effects on clouds relies on aerosol optical depth (AOD) as a proxy for aerosol concentration or cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). However, the lack of error characterization of satellite-based results hampers their use for the evaluation and improvement of global climate models. We show that the use of AOD for assessing aerosol-cloud interactions (ACIs) is inadequate over vast oceanic areas in the subtropics. Instead, we postulate that a more physical approach that consists of matching vertically resolved aerosol data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite at the cloud-layer height with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua cloud retrievals reduces uncertainties in satellite-based ACI estimates. Combined aerosol extinction coefficients (sigma) below cloud top (sigma(BC)) from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and cloud droplet number concentrations (N-d) from MODIS Aqua yield high correlations across a broad range of sigma(BC )values, with sigma(BC )quartile correlations >= 0.78. In contrast, CALIOP-based AOD yields correlations with MODIS N-d of 0.54-0.62 for the two lower AOD quartiles. Moreover, sigma(BC) explains 41 % of the spatial variance in MODIS N-d, whereas AOD only explains 17 %, primarily caused by the lack of spatial covariability in the eastern Pacific. Compared with sigma(BC), near-surface sigma weakly correlates in space with MODIS N-d, accounting for a 16 % variance. It is concluded that the linear regression calculated from ln(N-d)-ln(sigma(BC)) (the standard method for quantifying ACIs) is more physically meaningful than that derived from the N-d-AOD pair.

TI  - Sufficiency economy philosophy: Buddhism-based sustainability framework in Thailand
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drawing upon institutional theory, sustainability scholars have demonstrated that various institutional factors, such as environmental regulations, national business systems, and global sustainability standards, shape legitimate sustainability frameworks. However, most of the studies have focused on formal institutions that have law-like regulations and procedures. Owing to the skewed attention, the role of informal institutions in shaping sustainability frameworks has remained largely unexplored. The present study suggests that an informal institution, particularly religion, can play a significant role in developing a locally driven sustainability framework. In particular, this study investigates Thai context where Buddhism has shaped people's mindset, moral principles and day-to-day economic activity. For the past few decades, Thailand has theorized its own unique sustainability framework-sufficiency economy philosophy-based on Buddhist worldview on interrelationships of economy, society, and environment. By shedding light on how religion is formalized as a sustainability framework, this research contributes to institutional approach to sustainability.

TI  - Evaluation of the saturation property of vegetation indices derived from sentinel-2 in mixed crop-forest ecosystem
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The saturation property of vegetation indices posed a known limitation and this study was motivated to understand the saturation property of three widely used vegetation indices in mixed crop-forest ecosystem where limited knowledge existed. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Simple Ratio Index (SRI) and Transformed Vegetation Index (TVI) were computed from sentinel-2 bands and; variations among bands and among vegetation indices were evaluated. The study employed green Leaf Area Index (gLAI) Version 1 product, derived from PROBA-V daily data for discriminating the saturation property of the indices. Although the study applied various methods of image preprocessing and processing, best curve fitting and correlation analysis were the key ones. The three vegetation indices: NDVI, SRI, and TVI computed from sentinel-2 bands: four (red) and five (red edge) coupled with bands 8 and 8a showed some levels of saturation. Nonetheless, TVI computed from bands 8a and 4 is the best outperforming combination, i.e., the least saturated one and it is an interesting output in a sense that a single index with significantly lower values of noise equivalent green Leaf Area Index as well as having strong association with gLAI is obtained that could be very useful for quantification of gLAI in similar ecosystems. For the rest of the bands and vegetation indices combination of the indices via setting thresholds could be one possible solution.

TI  - Fracture-controlled groundwater seeps into the Mediterranean Sea along the coast of Lebanon
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater has recently become a main resource for domestic water and irrigation in Lebanon. During the last two decades, surface water and shallow groundwater have been severely exhausted to meet water demand. This study seeks to understand the groundwater flow/storage regime and the mechanism of water loss into the sea using a geospatial approach. Landsat thermal satellite images from years 2013-2015 are used to detect freshwater seeps in the coastal waters of Lebanon to analyse their distribution, time of occurrence and origin. The analysis is supplemented with data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), geological maps, the SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and springs' location maps. A groundwater potentiality map is constructed to understand points of surface water entry into the ground, areas of accumulation and water transport pathways. Results show dominant thermal plumes off-shore adjacent to Akkar District and Batroun city. The former relates to direct rainfall and the latter to rainfall and snowmelt on land. No surface drainage is associated with either plume. Both plumes project 8-13 km from inland along fault alignments. These faults act as conduits to channel rainwater and snowmelt from the surrounding mountains before seeping into the sea. It is thus feasible to capture the water lost this way for farming and domestic uses. The study presents an integrative geospatial approach that can be extended and applied throughout the coastal Middle East and North Africa Region to assess freshwater seeps into the sea.

AB  - The prevailing view on the genesis and development ofssial(seed) thought is that it has only Christian roots. In this essay, presenting a contrary view, I argue that Ryu'sssialthought shared common features with Taejonggyo (the Religion of the Divine Progenitor), with the latter serving as another root source for the thought of Ryu Yong-mo (1890-1981), founder ofssialthought, along with Christianity.Ssialrefers to the everlasting and permanent life within humans. It is generally accepted that Ryu, as a Christian thinker, in his interpretation of Samilsin'go (Teachings of the Trinitarian God), one of Taejonggyo scriptures, understood the immanence ofssialand construed it as abiding not only in the realm of the divine as a real ego of humanity, but also in the myriad things of the universe. Taejonggyo embraces a worldview of immanence in which there is no unconnected life form or permanent disappearance, and it is closely related to Daoist thought.

TI  - The Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity and Urban Expansion: A comparative analysis for the coastal areas of Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization and urban heat island have significant impacts that vary from local to global levels; therefore, cities are under greater threat to global environmental change. This study, for the first time, focuses on comparative assessment of an iconic phenomenon of "surface urban heat island" (SUHI) in the coastal areas of Pakistan. For the purpose of this study, remote sensing techniques are used. Data for the period of January 2017 to December 2017, day and night scenes of TERRA/MODIS are obtained to create land surface temperature (LST) maps. Surface temperatures are examined against land cover data across various cities while comparing them with LSTs and land cover data in GIS Software. Spatial patterns of SUHI in each city are also investigated through its diurnal variation and seasonal changes. Association between SUHI and wind stream is presented in monthly analysis, which indicates that high wind speed is generally linked with the lowest development of SUHI. This research provides a broad perspective over the SUHI phenomenon in the coastal areas of Pakistan, and the results will be useful for urban planners to make decisions that can enhance environmental sustainability practices.

TI  - Evaluation of Classification Techniques for Land Use Change Mapping of Indian Cities
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study looks into the development of multi-level classification approach for land use change mapping in Indian cities using Landsat imageries. In this study, we mapped 47 Indian cities at different time frames 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017. We started with traditional classification methods, but results provided unsatisfactory accuracy levels. Thus, we employed multiple classification techniques to achieve results with higher accuracy. The paper captures the evaluation of different classification techniques-hybrid, unsupervised, decision tree classification (DTC), and object-based image analysis (OBIA). The results suggest improvement in accuracy levels by using multi-level classification for different cities at different stages of the classification process. The most prominent is the hybrid classification technique; 14 cities out of 47 reached to accuracy above 72% through hybrid classification. For problematic classes, we used DTC, OBIA, and unsupervised classification techniques after masking the datasets. DTC was used in cities with a greater number of problems in datasets. For example, in the case of Kochi City, the accuracy at the initial level was reported 51% through unsupervised classification which improved to 77% (supervised classification), and finally, it reached 90% by DTC technique. The overall accuracy achieved through the multi-level classification approach described in this paper for the 47 Indian cities ranges from 81 to 93%.

TI  - The current clinical approach to newly diagnosed uterine cancer
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTICANCER THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Uterine cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy, although fortunately, 75% of women present with early-stage disease. A major area of controversy regarding the management of the disease concerns postoperative therapy for both women with early- and advanced-stage endometrial carcinoma. Here, we review landmark evidence that can help guide clinical decision-making in the treatment of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer. Areas covered In this review, we present the latest data driving decisions for both surgical management and postoperative therapy for women with endometrial carcinoma. Areas discussed include surgical staging, with a specific discussion on the role of sentinel lymph node mapping, and postoperative therapy, ranging from the data supporting observation for women with early-stage, low-risk disease to combination therapy for women with advanced disease. Less common histologies, such as serous and clear cell carcinoma, as well as carcinosarcoma, will also be covered. Furthermore, a section of the paper is dedicated to the current state of fertility-sparing surgery. Expert opinion We suggest several approaches for deciding on adjuvant therapy, based on stage and histology, after comprehensive surgical staging. The role that endometrial cancer molecular subtypes will play on postoperative therapy remains to be fully investigated.

TI  - Relationship between hydrocarbon micro-seepages and structures by detection of altered minerals using ASTER remote sensing data in the West of Coastal Fars, Zagros, Iran
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Coastal Fars sub-basin located in the Zagros Fold-Thrust Belt contains giant hydrocarbon fields. The existence of hydrocarbon micro-seepage on the surface can be an important indicator for the presence of oil and gas in subsurface formations. So the leakage of hydrocarbon micro-seepage to the surface leads to the alteration of some of the rocks and minerals and causes numerous effects on the surface. Therefore, by detecting these alterations, hydrocarbon seeps in the surface can be recognized. This study aims to investigate the hydrocarbon micro-seepage and its relationship with the structures of the western part of the Coastal Fars sub-basin. For this purpose, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer satellite images and remote sensing techniques, such as the band ratio method and the band ratio composite were used as effective tools for detecting alterations due to hydrocarbon micro-seepage. The comparison of the obtained results with surface and subsurface data indicates that there is a close relationship between the amount of hydrocarbons available in the reservoirs and the frequency of micro-seepages at the surface. Also, important structures of the region, such as Dashti strike-slip fault and salt diapirs, have affected the distribution of hydrocarbon micro-seepage and hydrocarbon reservoirs. Among these structures, the Darang buried salt diapir has played a destructive role and caused the evacuation of the reservoir, while Dashti emergent salt diapir has a positive impact on hydrocarbon accumulation.

TI  - Soil salinity detection and monitoring using Landsat data: a case study from Kot Addu, Pakistan
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite decades of research in soil mapping, characterizing the spatial variability of soil salinity across certain area remains a crucial challenge. This research illustrates the potential use of Landsat 8 satellite reflectance data (30 m resolution) to facilitate soil salinity mapping. For this purpose, soil samples from surface soils of Kot Addu, Muzaffargarh District in Pakistan, were collected in the 3rd week of January 2017 (January 20, 2017, to January 27, 2017). Multi-temporal data (atmospherically corrected Landsat 8 images from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website; January 19, 2017) and soil sample electrical conductivity (ECe) were obtained and processed for various indices' calculation and supervised classification. Soil sample EC(e)and pixel index values were compared for correlation using linear regression. Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) showed a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 54.98%, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) hasR(2) = 54.98%, Mosaic Simple Ratio (MSR) hasR(2) = 47.59%, and Moisture Stress Index (MSI) indicatedR(2)of 51.48%. These indices were stacked, and supervised classification of stacked images was performed to produce 3 salinity classes (< 4 dS m(-1), 4-10 dS m(-1), and > 10 dS m(-1)). The maximum area of Kot Addu falls at < 4 dS m(-1)class, while in other two classes small patches of soil salinity were observed which were distributed across the map. It was concluded that remote sensing technology can be used for mapping the spatial distribution of the soil salinity. The results suggest that Landsat 8 image data with information of soil ECs can be used to identify spatial variations of soil salinity in arid areas.

TI  - Time series assessment of the relationship between land surface temperature due to change in elevation: a case study from Hindukush-Himalayan Region (HKH)
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental studies that include studies related to climate change, change in biodiversity, and hydrology consider land surface temperature (LST) and near-surface air temperature as significant variables to contribute. In this context, we investigated the time series assessment of the relationship between LST and elevation over the two decades (1995-2017) using remotely sensed (Landsat 5, Landsat 7, Landsat 8, MODIS) and ground weather stations' datasets. The study area that is Gilgit-Baltistan, northern province of Pakistan in Hindukush and Himalaya Region (HKH), was selected for quantitative analysis in this study as it has high significance in terms of climate change due to presence of very high and large number of mountains and difficult terrain heavily covered with snow and glaciers. To assess the LST, a linear regression model was developed to quantify the significance of key factors affecting it. Our research results show that there exists a strong negative linear relationship (with correlation coefficient of 0.61 on average) for all datasets (remotely sensed and in situ) between LST and elevation and it is consistent over the study period (1995-2017) for both seasons of winter and summer. Further, there is a difference of change in LST for different seasons (average winter and summer difference is 3.0 degrees C) and for different datasets (Landsat, MODIS, and weather stations' dataset). There is a greater change in LST for change of elevation in 1000 m vertically as compared to change horizontally. Our results indicate that the change trend in LST from 1995 to 2007 is downward with minor variation, however, this trend changes into upward trend from 2007 to 2017. The comparison of results of remotely sensed and weather stations' dataset shows that there is a consistency of change in temperature and LST due to change in elevation. However, there is a less difference in summers (0.76 degrees C) and large difference in winters, i.e., 3.94 degrees C.

TI  - Remote analysis of an open-pit slope failure: Las Cruces case study, Spain
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Slope failures occur in open-pit mining areas worldwide, producing considerable damage in addition to economic loss. Identifying the triggering factors and detecting unstable slopes and precursory displacements -which can be achieved by exploiting remote sensing data- are critical for reducing their impact. Here we present a methodology that combines digital photogrammetry, satellite radar interferometry, and geo-mechanical modeling, to perform remote analyses of slope instabilities in open-pit mining areas. We illustrate this approach through the back analysis of a massive landslide that occurred in an active open-pit mine in southwest Spain in January 2019. Based on pre- and post-event high-resolution digital elevation models derived from digital photogrammetry, we estimate an entire sliding mass volume of around 14 million m(3). Radar interferometry reveals that during the year preceding the landslide, the line of sight accumulated displacement in the slope reached - 5.7 and 4.6 cm in ascending and descending geometry, respectively, showing two acceleration events clearly correlated with rainfall in descending geometry. By means of 3D and 2D stability analyses we located the slope instability, and remote sensing monitoring led us to identify the likely triggers of failure. Las Cruces event can be attributed to delayed and progressive failure mechanisms triggered by two factors: (i) the loss of historical suction due to a pore-water pressure increase driven by rainfall and (ii) the strain-softening behavior of the sliding material. Finally, we discuss the potential of this methodological approach either to remotely perform post-event analyses of mining-related landslides and evaluate potential triggering factors or to remotely identify critical slopes in mining areas and provide pre-alert warning.

TI  - Response Patterns of Vegetation Phenology along Urban-Rural Gradients in Urban Areas of Different Sizes
T2  - COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - On the basis of MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index time series data and multisource data, such as nighttime light data and China City Statistical Yearbook data, we investigated the differences in vegetation phenology along urban-rural gradients in urban areas of different sizes between coastal and inland cities in Liaoning Province, China. The results showed that the following: (1) the iterative extraction of urban built-up areas using the threshold method based on nighttime light data combined with the definition of urban built-up areas had high accuracy. (2) Additionally, we found that the start of the growing season (SOS) in Liaoning Province occurred between day 100 and day 180, while the end of the growing season (EOS) occurred between days 260 and 330. The difference in the SOS between coastal cities (i.e., Dalian, Yingkou, Panjin, Jinzhou, Huludao, and Dandong) and inland cities (i.e., Chaoyang, Fuxin, Tieling, Shenyang, Fushun, Liaoyang, Benxi, and Anshan) was 1.70 days. However, the difference in the EOS was more significant, i.e., the EOS in coastal cities occurred 4.47 days later than that in the inland cities. (3) In urban areas of different sizes, the increment SOS and increment EOS of inland cities had negative correlations with urban size. Specifically, when the urban size increased 10-fold, the increment SOS and increment EOS advanced by 10.03 and 5.71 days, respectively. In contrast, the increment SOS and increment EOS of coastal cities had positive and negative correlations with the urban size, respectively. Specifically, when urban size increased 10-fold, increment SOS was delayed by 11.29 days while EOS was advanced by 8.83 days.

TI  - Large-scale rain-fed to paddy farmland conversion modified land-surface thermal properties in Cold China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent acute evolution of cropland structure in Cold China could lead to rapid rice paddy expansion, potentially altering land-surface thermal processes and influencing climate. To address the issue, this study investigated the changes in cropland type, land-surface temperature (LST) and heat fluxes in the agricultural region of Cold China during 2000-2015 based on time-series of land-use data and MODIS LST product, using the split-window algorithms (SWA) model and the pixel component arranging and component algorithm (PCACA). The investigation revealed large-scale land transformation from rain-fed farmland to paddy field in Cold China during 2000-2015. Compared to the rain-fed farmland, lower LST was observed in paddy field throughout crop growing seasons, with the highest LST threshold found in June (7.17 +/- 1.05 degrees C) and the lowest value found in August (1.04 +/- 0.35 degrees C). The cooling effect of paddy-field ranged from 0.59 +/- 0.06 degrees C, 0.77 +/- 0.07 degrees C, and 1.08 +/- 0.08 degrees C for the low-, medium-, and high-density paddies, respectively. Compared to other months, stronger cooling effect was found in May and June. Further analysis showed the conversion of a rain-fed farmland to paddy field reduced the sensible heat flux and soil heat flux by 52.94 W/m(2) and 15.26 W/m(2), respectively, while increased the latent heat flux and net radiation by 115.66W/m(2) and 47.34W/m(2), respectively. The findings fromthis study indicated the changes in cropland structure and management regime (e.g., irrigation) could profoundly modify land-surface thermal processes and local/regional climate, interfering the signals from global warming. Therefore, instrumental climate data that collected from areas experienced large-scale conversion between rain-fed and paddy farmland should be carefully screened and corrected to prevent land-use induced biases.

TI  - Long-term aerosol optical depth trend over Iran and identi fication of dominant aerosol types
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper focuses on analysis of long-term changes of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over Iran. It describes contributions of dominant aerosol in the aerosol load over Iran covering the period 1980-2018. For this purpose, a long-term AOD dataset from the reanalysis-based Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2), the satellite-based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (the new version of MODIS/Terra and Aqua) as well as a new AOD product (MERRA-2 MODIS merged) were used. The groundbased AOD measurements of the five Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites used for validation demonstrated better consistency of the MERRA-2 MODIS merged (MMM) product. Analysis of these datasets demonstrated high AOD in the southwest of Iran because of the proximity to the major source areas of natural mineral dust in spring and summer. In contrast, low AOD was mostly observed along the high elevation lands in the northern and western highlands. The trend analysis of AODs revealed differences between the AOD datasets, but agree on the positive trends over southwestern Iran and negative trend in northern Iran. Classification of major aerosol types indicated that the clean marine andmixed aerosols were the dominant aerosol types during the cold and hot seasons, respectively, and the increase of desert dust around 2010 was another obvious result in spring and summer. Our results indicate that the variation in dust aerosol has a key role in determining the AOD long-term changes in Iran which has contributed in regional climate change and environmental evolutions.

TI  - Dynamics and oceanic response of the Madeira tip-jets
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Madeira island is a well-known source of atmospheric and oceanic eddy activity, with relevant downstream impact in both media. Previous studies focused on the dynamics of the island wake environment, suggesting the relevance of different atmosphere-ocean interactions in its maintenance. Here, results from one summer (two months) of fully coupled atmosphere-ocean high-resolution simulations are used to explore such interactions and to further understand the dynamics of Madeira's wake. Those results, validated against availablein situand remote-sensing data, indicate that the atmospheric and ocean circulations near Madeira are dominated by the variability of two quasi-permanent features, its tip-jets, and more so by the variability of its eastern jet. While both jets are of comparable magnitude and present similar intraseasonal variability at the multi-week time-scale, they are associated with qualitatively different forcing. The jets dominate the atmosphere forcing over the upper ocean, leading to enhanced mixing and deeper mixed-layer depth. Oceanic eddies are more frequent in the east jet region, as shedding anticyclones, confirming observational evidence. A comparison with a similar one-way coupled atmospheric simulation indicates that atmosphere-ocean feedbacks are relevant to the coastal surface temperature.

M3  - Review
AB  - In December 2019, a conference entitled "Europe That Protects: Safeguarding Our Planet, Safeguarding Our Health" was held in Helsinki. It was co-organized by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, the Finnish Environment Institute and the European Commission, under the auspices of Finland's Presidency of the EU. As a side event, a symposium organized as the final POLLAR (Impact of air POLLution on Asthma and Rhinitis) meeting explored the digital transformation of health and care to sustain planetary health in airway diseases. The Finnish Allergy Programme collaborates with MASK (Mobile Airways Sentinel NetworK) and can be considered as a proof-of-concept to impact Planetary Health. The Good Practice of DG Sante (The Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety) on digitally-enabled, patient-centred care pathways is in line with the objectives of the Finnish Allergy Programme. The ARIACARE-Digital network has been deployed in 25 countries. It represents an example of the digital cross-border exchange of real-world data and experience with the aim to improve patient care. The integration of information technology tools for climate, weather, air pollution and aerobiology in mobile Health applications will enable the development of an alert system. Citizens will thus be informed about personal environmental threats, which may also be linked to indicators of Planetary Health and sustainability. The digital transformation of the public health policy was also proposed, following the experience of the Agency for Health Quality and Assessment of Catalonia (AQuAS).

TI  - Snow avalanche detection and mapping in multitemporal and multiorbital radar images from TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow avalanches can endanger people and infrastructure, especially in densely populated mountainous regions. In Switzerland, the public is informed by an avalanche bulletin issued twice a day during winter which is based on weather information and snow and avalanche reports from a network of observers. During bad weather, however, information about avalanches that have occurred can be scarce or even be missing completely. To assess the potential of weather-independent radar satellites, we compared manual and automatic change detection avalanche mapping results from high-resolution TerraSAR-X (TSX) stripmap images and medium-resolution Sentinel-1 (S1) interferometric wide-swath images for a study site in central Switzerland. The TSX results were also compared to available mapping results from high-resolution SPOT-6 optical satellite images. We found that avalanche outlines from TSX and S1 agree well with each other. Cutoff thresholds of mapped avalanche areas were found with 500 m(2) for TSX and 2000 m(2) for S1. S1 provides a much higher spatial and temporal coverage and allows for mapping of the entire Alps at least every 6 d with freely available acquisitions. With costly SPOT-6 images the Alps can even be covered in a single day at meter resolution, at least for clear-sky conditions. For the SPOT-6 and TSX mapping results, we found a fair agreement, but the temporal information from radar change detection allows for a better separation of overlapping avalanches. Still, the total mapped avalanche area differed by at least a factor of 3 because with radar mainly the avalanche deposition zone was detected, whereas the release zone was very visible already in SPOT-6 data. With automatic avalanche mapping we detected around 70 % of manually mapped new avalanches, at least when the number of old avalanches is low. To further improve the radar mapping capabilities, we combined S1 images from multiple orbits and polarizations and obtained a notable enhancement of resolution and speckle reduction such that the obtained mapping results are almost comparable to the single-orbit TSX change detection results. In a multiorbital S1 mosaic covering all of Switzerland, we manually counted 7361 new avalanches which occurred during an extreme avalanche period around 4 January 2018.

TI  - Forest aboveground biomass estimation using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1A data with machine learning algorithms
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) plays an important role in the study of the carbon cycle and climate change in the global terrestrial ecosystem. AGB estimation based on remote sensing is an effective method for regional scale. In this study, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel-1A data and China's National Forest Continuous Inventory data in combination with three algorithms, either the linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), or the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were used to estimate biomass of the subtropical forests in Hunan Province, China. XGBoost is a scalable tree boosting system that is widely used by data scientists and provides state-of-the-art results for many problems. It can process an entire dataset with billions of examples using a minimal amount of computational resources through the particular way of cache access patterns, data compression, and data fragmentation. The results include: (1) The combination of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1A images as predictor variables in the XGBoost model provided the best AGB estimation. (2) In contrast to the LR method, the F-test results indicated that a significant improvement in AGB estimation was achieved with the RF and XGBoost algorithms. (3) The effect of parameter optimization was found to be more significant on XGBoost than on RF. (4) The XGBoost model is an effective method for AGB estimation and can reduce the problems of overestimation and underestimation. This research provides a new way of estimating AGB for the subtropical forest based on remote sensing through the synergy of different sensors datasets and modeling algorithms.

TI  - Invasive solid papillary carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation of the breast: a case report and literature review
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Solid papillary carcinoma (SPC) of the breast is a rare breast cancer that accounts for less than 1% of all breast cancers. The optimal clinical management of SPC remains controversial. Here, we report a case of invasive SPC with neuroendocrine differentiation in addition to review of the current literature. Case presentation A premenopausal 46-year-old female presented with a mass in her left breast that tended to increase in size over a 10-month period. Mammography and ultrasonography revealed a mass in the left upper-inner quadrant. The resulting images suggested a category 3 breast tumor according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). A core needle biopsy (CNB) was performed, and the pathological findings showed a solid papillary pattern and atypical cells suggestive of noninvasive SPC. After a left partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), the specimens were sent for histopathological analysis for further investigation. Postoperative pathological findings suggested invasive SPC. Whole-breast radiation therapy and adjuvant hormonal therapy were performed as postoperative treatments. Three years after surgery, multiple lung metastases were detected, and the patient was treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and an aromatase inhibitor. Five months later, multiple liver metastases and bone metastases appeared, and oral 5-fluorouracil was chosen for the subsequent treatment. The patient has been treated for 5 years to date, and she is continuing to take oral 5-fluorouracil and is alive without any further disease progression. Conclusions We report a rare case of premenopausal invasive SPC with multiple metastases. Further study is needed to clarify the molecular characteristics and clinical behaviors of SPC and to explore the optimal treatment strategy.

TI  - Evaluation of the MODIS Collection 6 multilayer cloud detection algorithm through comparisons with CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar and CALIPSO CALIOP products
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since multilayer cloud scenes are common in the atmosphere and can be an important source of uncertainty in passive satellite sensor cloud retrievals, the MODIS MODO6 and MYD06 standard cloud optical property products include a multilayer cloud detection algorithm to assist with data quality assessment. This paper presents an evaluation of the Aqua MODIS MYD06 Collection 6 multilayer cloud detection algorithm through comparisons with active Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) products that have the ability to provide cloud vertical distributions and directly classify multilayer cloud scenes and layer properties. To compare active sensor products with an imager such as MODIS, it is first necessary to define multilayer clouds in the context of their radiative impact on cloud retrievals. Three main parameters have thus been considered in this evaluation: (1) the maximum separation distance between two cloud layers, (2) the thermodynamic phase of those layers and (3) the upper-layer cloud optical thickness. The impact of including the Pavolonis-Heidinger multilayer cloud detection algorithm, introduced in Collection 6, to assist with multilayer cloud detection has also been assessed. For the year 2008, the MYD06 C6 multilayer cloud detection algorithm identifies roughly 20 % of all cloudy pixels as multilayer (decreasing to about 13 % if the Pavolonis-Heidinger algorithm output is not used). Evaluation against the merged CPR and CALIOP 2B-CLDCLASS-lidar product shows that the MODIS multilayer detection results are quite sensitive to how multilayer clouds are defined in the radar and lidar product and that the algorithm performs better when the optical thickness of the upper cloud layer is greater than about 1.2 with a minimum layer separation distance of 1 km. Finally, we find that filtering the MYD06 cloud optical properties retrievals using the multilayer cloud flag improves aggregated statistics, particularly for ice cloud effective radius.

TI  - Evapotranspiration as a response to climate variability and ecosystem changes in southwest, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of our study is to quantify the relationship between ecosystem and climate variables in southwest China. We further examined spatiotemporal distribution patterns of daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and ecosystem types through integrated approaches, including spatiotemporal interpolation, Penman-Monteith, Mann-Kendall test, statistical correlation analysis and transition matrix based on those datasets including observation climate data, satellite remote sensing images (MODIS and Landsat) and observed ecosystem data. The following results are achieved. First, changes of ET(0)were greatly influenced by the combined effects of precipitation (with a decrease rate of -13 mm/10 years) and temperature (with a decrease rate of + 0.17 celcius/10 years). The annual average ET(0)increased by + 2.1 mm/10 years, and the increased ET(0)are more than 25% of the total area. Second, evapotranspiration was regarded as a sensitive indicator of climate and ecosystem feedbacks, and these ecosystem types have a great transformation, including forest, agriculture, and grass. Forest and grass were distributed primarily in the southern and eastern mountain areas, grass was in high mountains area while agriculture was prevalent in basin areas respond to climate changes. The area of forest converted to grass was 3670 km(2), which was greater than transition from grass to forest (1720 km(2)). Correlation coefficients of evapotranspiration and NDVI were positive in forest and negative in agriculture. Third, the effects of these changes on climate vegetation and ecosystem process feedbacks on the quickly warming southwest China are potentially significant. Although the variation in ecosystem types was combined effects caused by climate variation and human activities, an effective ecological restoration program "Grain for Green" has improved the environmental conditions in southwest China.

TI  - Isotope-aided modelling of ecohydrologic fluxes and water ages under mixed land use in Central Europe: The 2018 drought and its recovery
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the interactions of vegetation and soil water under varying hydrological conditions is crucial to aid quantitative assessment of land-use sustainability for maintaining water supply for humans and plants. Isolating and estimating the volume and ages of water stored within different compartments of the critical zone, and the associated fluxes of evaporation, transpiration, and groundwater recharge, facilitates quantification of these soil-plant-water interactions and the response of ecohydrological fluxes to wet and dry periods. We used the tracer-aided ecohydrological model EcH(2)O-iso to examine the response of water ages of soil water storage, groundwater recharge, evaporation, and root-uptake at a mixed land use site, in northeastern Germany during the drought of 2018 and in the following winter months. The approach applied uses a dynamic vegetation routine which constrains water use by ecological mechanisms. Two sites with regionally typical land-use types were investigated: a forested site with sandy soils and a deep rooting zone and a grassland site, with loamier soils and shallower rooting zone. This results in much younger water ages (<1 year) through the soil profile in the forest compared to the grass, coupled with younger groundwater recharge. The higher water use in the forest resulted in a more pronounced annual cycle of water ages compared to the more consistent water age in the loamier soil of the grasslands. The deeper rooting zone of the forested site also resulted in older root-uptake water usage relative to soil evaporation, while the grassland site root-uptake was similar to that of soil evaporation. Besides more dynamic water ages in the forest, replenishment of younger soil waters to soil storage was within 6 months following the drought (cf. >8 months in the grassland). The temporal evaluation of the responsiveness of soil and vegetation interactions in hydrologic extremes such as 2018 is essential to understand changes in hydrological processes and the resilience of the landscape to the longer and more severe summer droughts predicted under future climate change.

TI  - High-Efficiency Same-Day Approach to Breast Reconstruction During the COVID-19 Crisis
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose As our hospitals conserve and re-allocate resources during the COVID-19 crisis, there is urgent need to determine how best to continue caring for breast cancer patients. During the time window before the COVID-19 critical peak and particularly thereafter, as hospitals are able to resume cancer operations, we anticipate that there will be great need to maximize efficiency to treat breast cancer. The goal of this study is to present a same-day protocol that minimizes resource utilization to enable hospitals to increase inpatient capacity, while providing care for breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction during the COVID-19 crisis. Methods IRB exempt patient quality improvement initiative was conducted to detail the operationalization of a novel same-day breast reconstruction protocol. Consecutive patients having undergone immediate breast reconstruction were prospectively enrolled between February and March of 2020 at Massachusetts General Hospital during the COVID-19 crisis. Peri-operative results and postoperative complications were summarized. Results Time interval from surgical closure to patient discharge was 5.02 +/- 1.29 h. All patients were discharged home, with no re-admissions or emergency department visits. No postoperative complications were observed. Conclusion This report provides an instruction manual to operationalize a same-day breast reconstruction protocol, to meet demands of providing appropriate cancer treatment during times of unprecedented resource limitations. Pre-pectoral implant-based breast reconstruction can be the definitive procedure or be used as a bridge to autologous reconstruction. Importantly, we hope this work will be helpful to our patients and community as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Wheat Area Mapping in Afghanistan Based on Optical and SAR Time-Series Images in Google Earth Engine Cloud Environment
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat is cultivated on more than 2.7 million hectares in Afghanistan annually, yet the country is dependent on imports to meet domestic demand. The timely estimation of domestic wheat production is highly critical to address any potential food security issues and has been identified as a priority by the Ministry of Agriculture Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL). In this study, we developed a system for in-season mapping of wheat crop area based on both optical (Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR, Sentinel-1) data to support estimation of wheat cultivated area for management and food security planning. Utilizing a 2010 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) cropland mask, wheat sown area for 2017 was mapped integrating decision trees and machine learning algorithms in the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. Information from provincial crop calendars in addition to training and validation data from field-based surveys, and high-resolution Digitalglobe and Airbus Pleiades images were used for classification and validation. The total irrigated and rainfed wheat area were estimated as 912,525 and 562,611 ha, respectively for 2017. Province-wise accuracy assessments show the maximum accuracy of irrigated (IR) and rainfed (RF) wheat across provinces was 98.76 and 99%, respectively, whereas the minimum accuracy was found to be 48% (IR) and 73% (RF). The lower accuracy is attributed to the unavailability of reference data, cloud cover in the satellite images and overlap of spectral reflectance of wheat with other crops, especially in the opium poppy growing provinces. While the method is designed to provide estimation at different stages of the growing season, the best accuracy is achieved at the end of harvest using time-series satellite data for the whole season. The approach followed in the study can be used to generate wheat area maps for other years to aid in food security planning and policy decisions.

TI  - Finding the Victim of Abuse: A New Frontier of Physicians' Liability? Data From a Local Italian Experience on Minor Maltreatment
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Violence toward minors is a widespread phenomenon and effective programs are desperately needed to prevent it. Data from the literature showed that underreporting child/adolescents abuse has become a widespread phenomenon, exposing minors to additional harm from further potentially dangerous situations. It is proved that systematic screening and standardized procedures for minors presenting at emergency departments with the suspicion of abuse might increase the detection rate, reducing the risk of underreporting. In Italy a system of mandatory reporting is in place, and it is considered to be crucial in detecting abuse and preventing further harm to children. In this paper we report our experience with a regional (Tuscany) project named "Codice Rosa" (Pink code) introduced in 2014 with the aim to treat and protect the most vulnerable bracket of the population. We present data concerning the access of minors for suspected abuse at the emergency room of the local hospital, focusing on a case of omitted diagnosis leading to further violence episodes. According to our experience, since the introduction of the "Pink Code" there have been 43 cases of reported child abuse, with an increasing trend throughout these years (from 1 reported event in 2015 to 16 reported events in 2018). Despite the limited number of our population, the increasing trend in the reported events was particularly evident for bullying cases (n= 0 in 2015;n= 4 in 2018). Despite data are still limited, the procedure proved effective in preventing child abuse, though it could still be implemented. Minor abuse and maltreatment are important health issue globally which can lead to significant physical and psychological morbidity. Implementing knowledge of healthcare professionals on how to deal with child abuse and introducing educational programs on recognition, treatment and report of child abuse is mandatory not only to prevent missing diagnosis of child and minor maltreatment, but also to reduce the risk of professional liability on different bases.

TI  - The clinical value of two combination regimens in the Management of Patients Suffering from Covid-19 pneumonia: a single centered, retrospective, observational study
T2  - DARU-JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There is no identified pharmacological therapy for COVID-19 patients, where potential therapeutic strategies are underway to determine effective therapy under such unprecedented pandemic. Therefore, combination therapies may have the potential of alleviating the patient's outcome. This study aimed at comparing the efficacy of two different combination regimens in improving outcomes of patients infected by novel coronavirus (COVID-19).Methods This is a single centered, retrospective, observational study of 60 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive inpatients (>= 18 years old) at two wards of the Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Patient's data including clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded. According to the drug regimen, the patients were divided into two groups; group I who received regimen I consisting azithromycin, prednisolone, naproxen, and lopinavir/ritonavir and group II who received regimen II including meropenem, levofloxacin, vancomycin, hydroxychloroquine, and oseltamivir.Results The oxygen saturation (SpO2) and temperature were positively changed in patients receiving regimen I compared to regimen II (P = 0.013 andP = 0.012, respectively). The serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) changed positively in group I (P < 0.001). Although there was a significant difference in platelets between both groups (75.44 vs 51.62, P < 0.001), their change did not clinically differ between two groups. The findings indicated a significant difference of the average length of stay in hospitals (ALOS) between two groups, where the patients under regimen I showed a shorter ALOS (6.97 vs 9.93,P = 0.001).Conclusion This study revealed the beneficial effect of the short-term use of low-dose prednisolone in combination with azithromycin, naproxen and lopinavir/ritonavir (regimen I), in decreasing ALOS compared to regimen II. Since there is still lack of evidence for safety of this regimen, further investigation in our ongoing follow-up to deal with COVID-19 pneumonia is underway.Graphical abstract

TI  - Pathogen-specific risk of seizure in children with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea: Case control study with follow-up
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To determine the pathogen-specific risk of seizure in under-five children hospitalised with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea (MSD) in rural settings. Method This was a prospective case-control study with follow-up, conducted in a sentinel facility of Global Enteric Multicenter Study in Mirzapur, a rural community of Bangladesh between 2007 and 2010. Children aged 0-59 months who presented with MSD and seizure constituted the cases whereas those who did not have seizure comprised the controls. MSD was defined if the episodes were associated with dehydration or dysentery or required hospitalisation with diarrhoea or dysentery. All enrolled children were followed up at home within 50-90 days of enrolment. A total of 64 cases and 128 randomly selected controls formed the analysable dataset. Results The result of logistic regression analysis after adjusting for potential confounders revealed that shigellosis (Shigellaspecies, OR = 5.34, 95% CI = 2.37-12.04) particularlyS.flexneri(OR = 3.34, 95% CI = 1.48-7.57),S.flexneri6 (OR = 23.24, 95% CI = 2.79-193.85),S.sonnei(OR = 6.90, 95% CI = 2.34-19.85); norovirus (OR = 6.77, 95% CI = 1.69-27.11), fever (OR = 16.75, 95% CI = 1.81-154.70) and loss of consciousness (OR = 35.25, 95% CI = 1.71-726.20) were the independent risk factors for seizure in MSD children. At enrolment, cases had lower WHZ (P = 0.006) compared to their peers, follow-up anthropometrics showed significant improvement in WHZ (P < 0.001) and WAZ (P < 0.05), whereas deterioration in HAZ (P < 0.001) in both cases and controls. Conclusion Childhood MSD episodes particularly due toShigellaand norovirus are often associated with seizure. Prompt identification and appropriate management of children with shigellosis may reduce occurrence and adverse consequences of seizure linked with MSD.

TI  - General practice patients starting treatment for substance use problems: observations from two data sources across levels of care
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In Belgium, the incidence of treatment episodes for substance use problems is monitored by the Network of Sentinel General Practices (SGP), and at higher, specialist care levels by the Treatment Demand Indicator (TDI) surveillance. Using both data sources, we examine 1) how patients starting specialist treatment for substance use problems on referral by their GP compare to those that were referred by non-GP caregivers; 2) how patients starting GP treatment for substance use problems without receiving concurrent specialist treatment compare to those who did. Methods Both surveillances are based on the TDI protocol for reporting data to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) on individuals starting treatment as a result of their substance use. Data from 2016 and 2017 were examined using 95% confidence intervals and multivariate logistic regression. Results According to TDI-data (n = 16,543), determinants of being referred by a GP (versus by a non-GP caregiver) for specialist treatment were age >= median (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.13-1.38), education >= secondary level (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.15-1.41), recent employment (OR 1.71; 1.56-1.88), recent stable accommodation (3.62; 95% CI 3.08-4.26), first treatment episode (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.57-1.87), recent daily primary substance use (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.33-1.59) and mono substance use (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.04-1.48). Type of substance use was a significant determinant with higher odds of using pharmaceuticals (and alcohol) (OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.04-1.48), and lower odds of using cannabis only/primarily (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.62-0.86), with reference to street drugs minus cannabis only/primarily. According to SGP data (n = 314), determinants of starting GP treatment without concurrent specialist treatment were recent employment (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.36-4.91), first treatment episode (OR 2.78; 95% CI 1.39-5.55) and living in the Brussels or Walloon region (OR 1.97; 95% CI 1.06-3.66). Conclusions This study provides a useful insight into the general practice population treated for substance use problems. It shows that both surveillances consistently found a relatively favourable profile of general practice patients with substance use problems.

TI  - Likelihood of elephant death risk applying kernel density estimation model along the railway track within biodiversity hotspot of Bhutan-Bengal Himalayan Foothill
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal and occasional movement of wild animals including elephants from one terrestrial habitat to another habitat are very common natural as well as biological habits for the survival of their lives. Around 163 km railway track runs from Siliguri Junction (SGUJ) to Alipurduar Junction (APDJ) within biodiversity hotspot region. According to the report of Forest Department, around 14 prominent and 59 minor elephant corridors have been crisscrossed over the railway track and in between the years 1974 and 2019, nearly 71 elephants are brutally killed due to collision with running trains. The kernel density estimation model is applied to evaluate the spatio-temporal death risk of elephants. To predict the spatial vulnerability or risk of accidental death of elephants, Kernel density estimation analytical algorithms like Bandwidth selection, Intensity, Grid Resolution, Kernel function have been considered. This model considers past accidental deaths data along with secondary data like train speed, fragmentation of elephant habitats, distance of croplands from railway track, human encroachment with electric fencing etc. The anthropogenic activities as well as land use and land cover change have been analysed using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager-OLI (2019) satellite images and digitally processed by EDRAS IMAGINE 16.5(v16.5.0.852) software. Similarly digital thematic maps have also been prepared on ArcGIS 10.3 platform. Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) intensity (risk) is computed considering the Elephant Death Risk Score (EDRS) as it takes into account of the first and second order properties. Fixed bandwidth is selected for the whole distribution and it is computed by the nearest neighbour distance mean method. On the basis of calculated tau value, (the mean distance between centroids and nearest neighbour index) Kernel Density map is prepared to show the elephant death risk in term of first order properties and second order properties. The result shows very high and high KD (risk) values ( 0.9799-10.0709) are confined in the eastern and western segments of the SGUJ to APDJ railway line. Therefore, this model helps to take sustainable holistic environmental management of wild animals as well as wild natural habitats in different corners of the globe.

TI  - Understanding forest biomass and net primary productivity in Himalayan ecosystem using geospatial approach
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest operates as sink-source of the atmospheric CO2; hence, they form the integral part of terrestrial global carbon cycle. Biomass and primary productivity are the crucial dynamic biophysical parameters for understanding the ecosystem functioning in any forested landscape. The present study was performed in Aglar watershed situated in outer Indian Himalayan range. We performed geospatial modeling of plot-level field data on forest above ground biomass (AGB) by correlating it with textural, spectral and linearly transformed variables retrieved from Landsat 8 OLI data using of random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm. We also applied recursive feature elimination function (RFE) to obtain the variables contributing most in AGB prediction. A combination of 24 among 96 variables was identified as the most effective variables. Ground-based AGB varied from 62.54 to 470.98 Mg ha(-1), whereas RF-modeled AGB ranged from 48.5 to 407.73 Mg ha(-1). Results indicated that RFE selected variables were able to predict AGB withR(2)of 0.84, RMSE of 42.03 Mg ha(-1), MAE of 34.68 and %RMSE of 19.49 Mg ha(-1)which was accepted considering the terrain complexity. Light use efficiency approach was used to model monthly NPP using Landsat 8 OLI data. The results indicated thatQuercusmixed forest had highest carbon assimilation (95,148,073.9 gC) followed byPinus roxburghii(1,863,187.7 gC),Cedrus deodara(5,752,954.1 gC) and mixed forest (2,634,737.1 gC). The seasonal pattern of NPP indicated that its strike peaked in October, whereas December and January were the lean months, suggesting that NPP is governed by climatic factors, viz. PAR, precipitation and temperature. Such watershed-level study in complex Himalayan terrain would help to understand complex biogeochemical processes in basins and ecosystem services provided by the forests.

TI  - The reconstruction of burned area and fire severity using charcoal from boreal lake sediments
T2  - HOLOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although lacustrine sedimentary charcoal has long been used to infer paleofires, their quantitative reconstructions require improvements of the calibration of their links with fire regimes (i.e. occurrence, area, and severity) and the taphonomic processes that affect charcoal particles between the production and the deposition in lake sediments. Charcoal particles >150 mu m were monitored yearly from 2011 to 2016 using traps submerged in seven head lakes situated in flat-to-rolling boreal forest landscapes in eastern Canada. The burned area was measured, and the above-ground fire severity was assessed using the differentiated normalized burn ratio (dNBR) index, derived from LANDSAT images, and measurements taken within zones radiating 3, 15, and 30 km from the lakes. In order to evaluate potential lag effects in the charcoal record, fire metrics were assessed for the year of recorded charcoal recording (lag 0) and up to 5 years before charcoal deposition (lag 5). A total of 92 variables were generated and sorted using a Random Forest-based methodology. The most explanatory variables for annual charcoal particle presence, expressed as the median surface area, were selected. Results show that, temporally, sedimentary charcoal accurately recorded fire events without a temporal lag; spatially, fires were recorded up to 30 km from the lakes. Selected variables highlighted the importance of burned area and fire severity in explaining lacustrine charcoal. The charcoal influx was thus driven by fire area and severity during the production process. The dispersion process of particles resulted mostly of wind transportation within the regional (<30 km) source area. Overall, charcoal median surface area represents a reliable proxy for reconstructing past burned areas and fire severities.

TI  - Metal brain bioaccumulation and neurobehavioral effects on the wild rodent<i>Liomys irroratus</i>inhabiting mine tailing areas
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecotoxicological studies are necessary in order to evaluate the effects of environmental exposure of chemicals on wild animals and their ecological consequences. Particularly, neurobehavioral effects of heavy metal elements on wild rodents have been scarcely investigated. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of metal bioaccumulation (Pb, As, Mg, Ni, and Zn) in the brain and in the liver on exploratory activity, learning, memory, and on some dopaminergic markers in the wild rodentLiomys irroratusliving inside mine tailings, at Huautla, Morelos, Mexico. We found higher Pb concentration but lower Zn in striatum, nucleus accumbens, midbrain, and hippocampus in exposed animals in comparison to rodents from the reference site. Exposed rodents exhibited anxious behavior evaluated in the open field, while no alterations in learning were found. However, they displayed slight changes in the memory test in comparison to reference group. The neurochemical evaluation showed higher levels of dopamine and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid in midbrain, while lower levels of metabolites dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid and homovanillic acid in striatum of exposed rodents. In addition, mRNA expression levels of dopaminergic D2 receptors in nucleus accumbens were lower in animals from the mining zone than in animals from the reference zone. This is the first study that shows that chronic environmental exposure to metals results in behavioral and neurochemical alterations in the wild rodentL. irroratus, a fact that may comprise the survival of the individuals resulting in long-term effects at the population level. Finally, we suggest the use ofL. irroratusas a sentinel species for environmental biomonitoring of mining sites.

TI  - The Potential of Sentinel-2 for Crop Production Estimation in a Smallholder Agroforestry Landscape, Burkina Faso
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop production statistics at the field scale are scarce in African countries, limiting potential research on yield gaps as well as monitoring related to food security. This paper examines the potential of using Sentinel-2 time series data to derive spatially explicit estimates of crop production in an agroforestry parkland in central Burkina Faso. This type of landscape is characterized by agricultural fields where cereals (millet and sorghum) and legumes (cowpea) are intercropped under a relatively dense tree canopy. We measured total above ground biomass (AGB) and grain yield in 22 field plots at the end of two growing seasons (2017 and 2018) that differed in rainfall timing and amount. Linear regression models were developed using the in situ crop production estimates and temporal metrics derived from Sentinel-2 time series. We studied several important aspects of satellite-based crop production estimation, including (i) choice of vegetation indices, (ii) effectiveness of different time periods for image acquisition and temporal metrics, (iii) consistency of the method between years, and (iv) influence of intercropping and trees on accuracy of the estimates. Our results show that Sentinel-2 data were able to explain between 41 and 80% of the variation in the in situ crop production measurements, with relative root mean square error for AGB estimates ranging between 31 and 63% in 2017 and 2018, respectively, depending on temporal metric used as estimator. Neither intercropping of cereals and legumes nor tree canopy cover appeared to influence the relationship between the satellite-derived estimators and crop production. However, inter-annual rainfall variations in 2017 and 2018 resulted in different ratios of AGB to grain yield, and additionally, the most effective temporal metric for estimating crop production differed between years. Overall, this study demonstrates that Sentinel-2 data can be an important resource for upscaling field measurements of crop production in this agroforestry system in Burkina Faso. The results may be applicable in other areas with similar agricultural systems and increase the availability of crop production statistics.

TI  - Investigation of Highway Stormwater Management Pond Capacity for Flood Detention and Water Quality Treatment Retention via Remote Sensing Data and Conventional Topographic Survey
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Stormwater management ponds are common best management practice (BMP) and green infrastructure (GI) for flood attenuation and water quality treatment in highway projects. Originally designed to provide storage volume for flood detention, stormwater ponds today often employ additional retention volume at pond bottom in a hope to improve water quality via sedimentation and other pollutant-removal mechanisms. It is commonly assumed that sediment accumulation and topographic variations (such as erosion, channelization, and in-pond plant growth and decay) over time often decrease the capacity of stormwater ponds. However, differences between design capacities and field capacities over time have never been verified and quantitatively analyzed before. This study presents such analysis using conventional topographic survey techniques and remote sensing data (topographic light detection and ranging digital elevation model [LIDAR DEM]) for 10 highway stormwater ponds along Interstate Highway-95 (I-95) systems in Baltimore City, Cecil County, and Harford County, Maryland, United States, with facility service life ranging from 14 to 26 years (1990-2015). Data derived from LIDAR DEM were compared with those from topographic survey; the LIDAR DEM data appear to be effective in measuring flood detention capacities and identifying silted ponds, but not in estimating the remaining retention volume for water quality treatment. Data from topographic survey indicate that the total volume in the ponds was relatively unchanged compared with the design, with increases in some instances. The increase typically occurred at the pond's upper stages. Nonetheless, the water quality treatment capacity at pond bottom (wet pool volume) was drastically less (up to 100% of the design). As current maintenance practice of stormwater ponds relies heavily on visual inspection, the storage volume variations are often overlooked. As such, the findings prompt uncertainty on the long-term effectiveness of watershed implementation plan and models in the Chesapeake Bay watersheds, as many of them depend on wet pool volume design in BMP and GI.

TI  - Difficulties in Daily Living Experienced by Adolescents, Transition-Aged Youth, and Adults With Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder
T2  - ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) experience a range of problems in their cognitive, affective, and physical functioning following prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), in addition to multiple complex difficulties in daily living that impact well-being. Using the Canadian National FASD Database, we sought to profile a range of difficulties in daily living, along with risk factors, in a large cross-sectional cohort of adolescents, transition-aged youth, and adults with PAE, of which a subset was ultimately diagnosed with FASD. Methods We summarized data for 9currentdifficulties in daily living reported at the time of diagnostic assessment for 726 individuals with PAE assessed at 26 FASD diagnostic clinics across Canada, including 443 adolescents (12 to 17 years), 135 transition-aged youth (18 to 24 years), and 148 adults (25 to 60 years). Difficulties included problems related to school disruption, employment, independent living needs, supportive or sheltered housing, legal problems with victimization, legal problems with offending, incarceration, alcohol misuse, and other substance misuse. Risk factors included age, gender, living placement, postnatal trauma, and neurodevelopmental impairment. Results Across the full PAE sample, adolescents, transition-aged youth, and adults presented with high rates of difficulties in daily living, including independent living support needs (63%), alcohol misuse (38%), other substance misuse (46%), employment problems (37%), legal problems with offending (30%), assisted or sheltered housing (21%), school disruption (18%), legal problems with victimization (4%), and incarceration (3%). Difficulty rates were similar for those with FASD irrespective of diagnosis (e.g., with or without sentinel facial features), but rates greater for adults, and those with low overall intellectual functioning (IQ < 70). Controlling for age and IQ, cumulative difficulty was independently associated with gender, living placement, and neurodevelopmental impairment. Conclusions Adolescents, transition-aged youth, and adults with FASD experienced a range of substantial and complex difficulties at the time of their diagnostic assessment, signaling a high level of service needs. These findings underscore the importance of developmentally informed assessment continued through childhood, as well as ongoing functional and needs-based service provision as youth with FASD transition to adulthood and beyond.

TI  - Anatomical Variations That Can Lead to Spine Surgery at The Wrong Level: Part II Thoracic Spine
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spine surgery at the wrong level is a detrimental ordeal for both surgeon and patient, and it falls under the wrong-site surgery sentinel events reporting system. While there are several methods designed to limit the incidence of these events, they continue to occur and can result in significant morbidity for the patient and malpractice lawsuits for the surgeon. In thoracic spine, numerous risk factors influence the development of this misadventure. These include anatomical variations such as transitional vertebrae, rib variants, hemivertebra, and block/fused vertebrae as well as patient characteristics, such as tumors, infections, previous thoracic spine surgery, obesity, and osteoporosis. An extensive literature search of the PubMed database up to 2019 was completed on each of the anatomical entities and their influence on developing thoracic spine surgery at the wrong level, taking into consideration patient's individual factors. A reliable protocol and effective techniques were described to prevent this error. In addition, the surgeon should collaborate with radiologists, particularly in challenging cases. A thorough understanding of the surgical anatomy and its variants coupled with patients characteristic is crucial for maximal patient benefit and avoidance of thoracic spine surgery at the wrong level.

TI  - Potential risks in sentinel lymph node biopsy for cervical cancer: a single-institution pilot study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is an attractive technique that is widely performed in many oncological surgeries. However, the potential risks in SLN biopsy for cervical cancer remains largely unclear. Methods Seventy-five patients with histologically confirmed cervical cancer were enrolled between May 2014 and June 2016. SLN biopsies were performed followed by pelvic lymphadenectomies and all resected nodes were labeled according to their anatomic areas. Only bilateral detections of SLNs were considered successful. Patients' clinicopathologic feature, performance of SLN detection, and distributions of lymph node metastases were analyzed. Results Of the 75 enrolled patients, at least one SLN was detected in 69 (92.0%), including 33 in bilateral and 36 in unilateral. SLNs were most detected in the obturator area (52 of 69 patients, 75.4%) and 26 (37.7%) patients presented SLNs in more than one area of hemipelvis. Lymphovascular invasion was found to be the only factor that adversely influenced SLN detection, while the tumor diameter, growth type, histological grade, deep stromal invasion, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed no significant impacts. Patients with lymphovascular invasion showed a significantly higher rate to have unsuccessful detection (90.9% versus 41.5%,P< 0.001) and lymph node metastasis (40.9% versus 3.8%,P< 0.001) compared with those without. Nodal metastases were confirmed in 11 patients, of whom 9 (81.8%) had lymphovascular invasion and 7 (63.6%) had non-SLN metastasis. The most frequently involved SLNs were obturator nodes (9/11, 81.8%). In addition, the parametrial nodes also have a high rate to be positive (4/11, 36.4%), although they were relatively less identified as SLNs. Besides, 3 patients showed metastases in the laterals without SLN detected. Conclusions In cervical cancer, lymphovascular invasion is a significant factor for unsuccessful SLN detection. The risk of having undetected metastasis is high when SLN is positive; therefore, further lymphadenectomy may be necessary for these patients.

TI  - Extracting impervious surfaces from full polarimetric SAR images in different urban areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of impervious surface in urban areas is of great demand in environmental and socio-economic studies since impervious surface growth is recognized as an indicator of urbanization. To demonstrate the potential of full polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in impervious surface detection in different urban areas, this study focused on the exploitation of only SAR data. Three cities with different levels of urbanization - Tehran, Kordkuy, and Arak - have been selected to reduce the effect of input data on achieved results. Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR) images have been classified by support vector machine (SVM) with the help of training data from high-resolution satellite images. Quantitative assessment of classification accuracy revealed that Kordkuy, a not fully developed city (i.e. 84.2%) has the lowest accuracy and Arak, a medium urbanized city, has the highest accuracy (i.e. 90.0%). To further explore the efficiency of full polarimetric SAR, grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture of polarized bands has been extracted and put into the classification procedure. The texture information of SAR data provided positive contribution to the impervious surface estimation in three study cases. The improvement is especially noted in dark impervious surface class. All three study areas show an increase of about 6-8% in classification accuracy. The results prove that single use of full polarimetric SAR images holds high potential in identifying impervious surfaces in urban areas. The findings are of great importance in frequent urban impervious surface mapping and monitoring especially in cloud-prone area, where the use of optical data as well as the fusion of optic and SAR data are limited.

TI  - Land subsidence from interferometric SAR and groundwater patterns in the Qazvin plain, Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Qazvin plain as one of the important plains in northwest Iran in terms of industrial and agricultural activities, reveals evidence of land subsidence in the last decade. We used a descending ENVISAT dataset during 2003-2006 and two ascending and descending Sentinel-1 tracks acquired during 2014-2016 to study the subsidence in the area. Our time-series analysis of the ENVISAT data reveals that the area is subsiding at an average rate of 40 mm yr(-1) with a maximum value of 50 mm yr(-1) in the line of sight direction. Moreover, our result for the Sentinel-1 ascending and descending tracks shows that the average subsidence rate reaches 65 mm yr(-1) in the line of sight direction. Comparing the obtained mean velocity maps of the two datasets indicates the growing subsidence pattern in the northwest-southeast direction inside the plain. The investigation of the water source reveals that the overexploitation of aquifers caused an approximately 17 m decline in the groundwater level from 2001 to 2011. This drastic drop in the groundwater level has resulted in progressive subsidence over time. The comparison between the extent of subsidence from the image processing and the water level depletion contour map in the Qazvin plain depicts that subsidence is occurring in areas with a high decrease in underground water level. This study suggests that, besides decreasing the number of deep wells as well as their outflow water, the types of agricultural production related to water consumption and irrigation methods in an area such as Iran can play an important role in decreasing the stress on aquifers.

TI  - How far can we trust forestry estimates from low-density LiDAR acquisitions? The Cutfoot Sioux experimental forest (MN, USA) case study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerial discrete return LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) technology (ALS - Aerial Laser Scanner) is now widely used for forest characterization due to its high accuracy in measuring vertical and horizontal forest structure. Random and systematic errors can still occur and these affect the native point cloud, ultimately degrading ALS data accuracy, especially when adopting datasets that were not natively designed for forest applications. A detailed understanding of how uncertainty of ALS data could affect the accuracy of derivable forest metrics (e.g. tree height, stem diameter, basal area) is required, looking for eventual error biases that can be possibly modelled to improve final accuracy. In this work a low-density ALS dataset, originally acquired by the State of Minnesota (USA) for non-forestry related purposes (i.e. topographic mapping), was processed attempting to characterize forest inventory parameters for the Cutfoot Sioux Experimental Forest (north-central Minnesota, USA). Since accuracy of estimates strictly depends on the applied species-specific dendrometric models a first required step was to map tree species over the forest. A rough classification, aiming at separating conifers from broadleaf, was achieved by processing a Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) scene. ALS-derived forest metrics initially greatly overestimated those measured at the ground in 230 plots. Conversely, ALS-derived tree density was greatly underestimated. To reduce ALS uncertainty, trees belonging to the dominated plane were removed from the ground dataset, assuming that they could not properly be detected by low-density ALS measures. Consequently, MAE (Mean Absolute Error) values significantly decreased to 4.0 m for tree height and to 0.19 cm for diameter estimates. Remaining discrepancies were related to a bias affecting the native ALS point cloud, which was modelled and removed. Final MAE values were 1.32 m for tree height, 0.08 m for diameter, 8.5 m(2) ha(-1) for basal area, and 0.06 m for quadratic mean diameter. Specifically focusing on tree height and diameter estimates, the significance of differences between ground and ALS estimates was tested relative to the expected 'best accuracy'. Results showed that after correction: 94.35% of tree height differences were lower than the corresponding reference value (2.86 m); 70% of tree diameter differences were lower than the corresponding reference value (4.5 cm for conifers and 6.8 cm for broadleaf). Finally, forest parameters were computed for the whole Cutfoot Sioux Experimental Forest. Main findings include: 1) all forest estimates based on a low-density ALS point cloud can be derived at plot level and not at a tree level; 2) tree height estimates obtained by low-density ALS point clouds at the plot level are highly reasonably accurate only after testing and modelling eventual error bias; 3) diameter, basal area, and quadratic mean diameter estimates have large uncertainties, suggesting the need for a higher point density and, probably, a better mapping of tree species (if possible) than achieved with a remote sensing-based approach.

TI  - Calculating the surface melt rate of Antarctic glaciers using satellite-derived temperatures and stream flows
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Melt rate models are fundamental for understanding the impacts of climate change on glaciers and the subsequent effects on habitats and sea level rise. Ice melt models have mostly been derived from energy balance or air temperature index calculations. This research demonstrates that satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) measurements provide a simpler method for estimating surface melt rate that substitutes for energy balance models. Since these satellite images are continuous (distributed) across space, they do not need calibration for topography. Antarctic glacier melt discharge data from nearby stream gauges were used to calibrate an LST-derived melt model. The model calculations are simplified by the fact that groundwater flow is assumed to be minimal due to permafrost, and the glaciers are assumed to only melt on the surface. A new method called the Temperature Area Sum model is developed, which builds on an existing Temperature Area Index model. A daily melt rate model is developed using 77 Landsat 8 images and calculates the volume of meltwater produced per hectare for any given LST between -7 and 0 degrees C. A seasonal average daily melt rate model is also developed that uses 1660 MODIS images. The utility of the seasonal MODIS model is demonstrated by calculating melt rates, water flows and wetness across the entire Ross Sea Region. An unexpected large wet area to the southwest of the Ross Ice Shelf requires further investigation and demonstrates the usefulness of these models for large remote areas. Surface melt rate and wetness can now be calculated for different climate change scenarios.

TI  - Approach of spectral information-based image registration similarity
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For local intensity-based image registration methods, a template of a predefined size is adopted. Some measure of similarity between the images is used to determine when the optimal alignment has occurred. Most intensity-based similarity utilizes the statistical and spatial information of an image. However, there are significant nonlinear radiometric differences between infrared and visible data. Images of natural scenes usually do not have enough spatial features within the template. Hence, many similarities will be useless when dealing with infrared and visible data. Minor eigenvalues (ME) image registration similarity is presented with the exploitation the spectral properties of remote sensing images. ME similarity is based on the linear spectral mixture model and detects control points through searching the minimum of ME of the covariance matrix. Experiments on Landsat-7 satellite Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus data are performed to verify and evaluate the effectiveness. Transformation performance curves, correct match ratio (CMR), and registration accuracy are also discussed. According to the data, root-mean-square error of phase correlations is 0.0722 pixels and the CMR of ME similarity is nearly 100%. The results on the basis of TM1, TM2, TM3, and TM4 band images indicate that the proposed similarity holds promise for infrared and color image registration in natural scenes, with advantages over previous normal mutual information and gradient mutual information similarities.

TI  - Characteristics of lightning signals over the Tibetan Plateau and the capability of FY-4A LMI lightning detection in the Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of its topographic features, lightning flashes are unique over the Tibetan Plateau. The Lightning Mapper Imager (LMI) on board the launched China's Fengyun (FY)-4A geostationary satellite is a useful tool for studying these lightning flashes. In this study, firstly, based on data acquired by the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) on board the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite in the period 1998-2013, the optical radiation characteristics of lightning flashes over the Tibetan Plateau were compared with those over the central and eastern land region (CELR) of China at the same latitude. The results showed that lightning flashes over the Tibetan Plateau had a mean optical radiance of 422.35 mu J sr(-1) m(-2) nm(-1), a mean duration of 210.79 ms and a mean radiation area of 217.33 km(2), whereas the lightning flashes over the CELR had a mean optical radiance of 692.83 mu J sr(-1) m(-2) nm(-1), a mean duration of 295.29 ms and a mean radiation area of 290.85 km(2). Evidently, lightning flashes over the Tibetan Plateau had significantly lower radiance, shorter life cycles, and smaller radiation areas than those over the CELR. Secondly, the data for lightning events over the Tibetan Plateau acquired from the FY-4A LMI and International Space Station (ISS) LIS were compared from 21 March 2017 to 25 September 2017, and from 20 March 2018 to 18 September 2018. The correlation between the frequency distribution of the optical radiance of lightning events observed by the two lightning imagers was 99.33%, but due to the footprint area of a LMI pixel is larger than that of a LIS pixel, the mean radiance of lightning events over the Tibetan Plateau measured by the FY-4A LMI was only 1/5 of that measured by the ISS LIS. Based on the statistical results, a time/space coincidence window of 2.1 s/33 km was selected. A resulting mean coincidence ratio (CR) of 3.66% was found for the FY-4A LMI and ISS LIS lightning events for the Tibetan Plateau. The spatial distribution of the CR values was correlated with the optical radiance of lightning events and the duration of lightning flashes as well as the number of events in flashes, with the Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) of 0.80, 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. These results suggest that the optical radiation characteristics of lightning flashes over the Tibetan Plateau have a great impact on their detection by the FY-4A LMI. For observation of lightning flashes over the Tibetan Plateau using the FY-4A LMI, it is necessary to enable the Real-Time Event Processor (RTEP) algorithm to more finely distinguish various regions based on lightning flash characteristics and to set a more flexible and smaller threshold for extracting lightning events.

TI  - Identifying potential vegetation establishment areas on the dried Aral Sea floor using satellite images
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aral Sea was one of the largest lakes in the world, but almost 60,000 km(2)of the waterbody has dried up due to water withdrawal for irrigation. Afforestation on the desiccated seafloor could be important in preventing soil flation, dust storms, and negative impact on human health. In this study, we aimed to delineate potential vegetation establishment areas on the dried Aral Sea bed using remote-sensed data in support of the decision-making related to afforestation. Various indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), topsoil grain size index (TGSI), soil salinity index (SSI), and normalized multiband drought index (NMDI) were calculated from the LANDSAT-8 OLI satellite imagery. As an indicator of vegetation existence, NDVI was classified into three groups and set as a base for classifying other indices by performing statistical analyses. Based on the decision tree method, indices were combined and the potential vegetation establishment area was detected. Higher NDVI was identified in the southeast than the west of the study area. The results of statistical analyses showed that TGSI had a positive correlation with NDVI, while SSI and NMDI had a negative correlation. Overall, the potential vegetation area comprised 7,295.21 km(2)(61.34%) of the 'unsuitable' area, 2,818.64 km(2)(23.7%) of the 'intermediate' area, 1,612.15 km(2)(13.56%) of the 'suitable' area, and 166.42 km(2)(1.4%) of the 'very suitable' area. The developed map enables to identify dried seafloor area suitable for vegetation establishment thus contributing to planning the land rehabilitation efforts and preventing further land degradation.

TI  - Automatic building footprint extraction from very high-resolution imagery using deep learning techniques
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Building footprint maps are useful for urban planning, infrastructural development, population estimation and disaster management. With the availability of very-high resolution satellite imagery, remote sensing community is pursuing automatic techniques for extracting building footprints for cities with varried building types. Recently, CNNs (Convolutional Neural Network) have been successfully applied for extraction of building footprint from satellite imagery. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN architecture termed UNet-AP inspired by UNet and the concept of Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling, for automatic extraction of building footprint from very-high resolution satellite imagery. We demonstrate extraction of building footprints from Cartosat-2 series 4-band (Blue, Green, Red and Near-Infrared) multispectral satellite imagery, pan-sharpened using the panchromatic image with less than 1-meter resolution. We also compare the performance of our proposed architecture with baseline implementation of recently proposed UNet and SegNet architectures. We present a comparative assessment of the architecture performance across different types of urban settlement classes such as dense built-up areas, slums and isolated buildings. We demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms SegNet and UNet in terms of overall mean intersection over union (0.75 vs 0.70 and 0.68 for UNet and SegNet respectively) and delivers consistent improvement across all three settlement classes.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is not specific to a particular region and is affecting different parts of the world, one of these areas being the western half of Iran, which has been suffering from this phenomenon in the recent years. The western half of Iran has been affected by natural hazards in the recent decades. One of these natural hazards is reduced rainfall, which manifests itself in the form of drought. The effects of drought in the different parts of the human society have been strongly felt in the recent years. Therefore, it is important to address this issue. The purpose of this study is to monitor and analyze drought in the western part of Iran. To do this, the MODIS satellite data, the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), and the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Project) satellite were used from 2000 to 2018, and for better analysis, they were compared with the fuzzy index of T.I.B.I (combined index based on four indices: SET, SPI, SEB, and MCZI) neural network. To calculate the T.I.B.I index, the ground climate parameters of precipitation, temperature, sunshine, minimum relative humidity, and wind speed were used; to extract satellite data and images, Google Earth Engine was used. The results of the study indicate that drought has started to weaken in the western part of Iran since 2010, and in 2016 and in the recent years, it has reached its peak. The northern and central regions of the study area were more prone to drought than elsewhere. Approximately 69.80% of the area is subject to severe drought. In order to deal with the catastrophe caused by drought that has many dangerous effects, it requires careful planning in the future.

TI  - Anatomical Variations That Can Lead to Spine Surgery at the Wrong Level: Part I, Cervical Spine
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Spine surgery at the wrong level is an adversity that many spine surgeons will encounter in their career, and it falls under the wrong-site surgery sentinel events reporting system. The cervical spine is the second most common location in the spine at which surgery is performed at the wrong level. Anatomical variations of the cervical spine are one of the most important incriminating risk factors. These anomalies include craniocervical junction abnormalities, cervical ribs, hemivertebrae, and block/fused vertebrae. In addition, patient characteristics, such as tumors, infection, previous cervical spine surgery, obesity, and osteoporosis, play an important role in the development of cervical surgery at the wrong level. These were described, and several effective techniques to prevent this error were provided. A thorough review of the English-language literature was performed in the database PubMed between 1981 and 2019 to review and summarize these risk factors. Compulsive attention to these factors is essential to ensure patient safety. Therefore, the surgeon must carefully review the patient's anatomy and characteristics through imaging and collaborate with radiologists to reduce the likelihood of performing cervical spine surgery at the wrong level.

TI  - Comparative landslide susceptibility assessment using statistical information value and index of entropy model in Bhanupali-Beri region, Himachal Pradesh, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide is a complex natural hazard that sometimes causes disaster resulting in loss of life, assets and infrastructure, especially in the Himalayas. Recent studies suggest that for effective mitigation and resilience through proper planning and policymaking, it is equally important to justify and select a suitable scientific technique that most appropriately addresses the salient causes of a landslide in any area. The principal objective of this study is to carry out a comparative assessment between two contemporary statistical techniques, i.e., the statistical information value (SIV) and index of entropy (IOE), to find out the effectiveness of the two said methods in landslide susceptibility mapping in Bhanupali-Beri region. During the analysis, the higher-resolution satellite images, i.e., World view-2 image of 2017 and Landsat-8 OLI image of 2018, have been used for delineation of various triggering parameters used for landslide susceptibility. The contemporary GIS technique integrated with the remote sensing applications was distinct in preparing the prominent landslide conditioning factor layers such as slope, slope aspect, thrust and fault proximity, geomorphology, landuse-landcover, stream power index, topographic wetness index, geology, roads proximity, lineament density and past landslide inventory. The final assessment was performed using GIS software through raster re-sampling, and the values derived for each conditioning factors were combined using defined SIV and IOE equations. The study area was categorized into five distinct landslide susceptible zones (very low, low, moderate, high and very high) using the Jenk's Natural Breaks algorithm. Index of entropy model has given better results compared to SIV. The utmost vital factors triggering landslide (estimated for entropy values) in the area are landuse-landcover with barren land and sparse vegetation followed by TWI, lineament density, geomorphology, and slope.

TI  - DInSAR method applied to dual-pair interferograms with Sentinel-1 data: a study case on inconsistent unwrapping outputs
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many works have been implemented to describe how seismic vertical displacement maps can be generated from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The theory that supports these works is a very interesting field in remote sensing which is called differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR). However, behind this theory, there are many limitations and ambiguities that should be clarified before concluding specific results from the interpretation of subsidence maps. In this work, some of these drawbacks will be discussed, by following a typical subsidence map reconstruction with Sentinel-1 satellite images of a seismic region in Mexico. Particularly, the correct estimation of the unwrapped phase, is a crucial step for future analysis, like in time-series studies on subsidence ratios. In order to do this, a sophisticated routine called statistical-cost network-flow phase-unwrapping algorithm (SNAPHU), provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) in free software tools, is commonly applied to general SAR interferograms. However, in this particular study case, focused on simple dual-pair interferometry, atypical outputs obtained from SNAPHU were observed. Due to this inconsistency, the alternate solution proposed here is based on the so-called phase unwrapping by an accumulation of residual maps (ARM) algorithm. Our comparative analysis suggests that ARM outperforms SNAPHU and other tested methods in terms of unwrapped estimates.

TI  - Large-scale surface water change observed by Sentinel-2 during the 2018 drought in Germany
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of hydrological droughts with seamless geographical coverage over large areas is essential for an assessment of impacts on water resources, industry, transport, and human health. This became particularly relevant during the heat and drought of 2018 in Germany, which affected the country across various sectors and caused significant interruptions to ship traffic on rivers and lakes with negative impacts on tourism, transportation, and supply chains. In this study, we provide a spatially and temporally consistent view on the 2018 hydrological drought in Germany as seen from Sentinel-2 satellite images. We extract waterbodies with national coverage at different timestamps using an automated processing chain, which is based on a convolutional neural network and has originally been developed for near-real time flood monitoring. The method produces water segmentations with consistently high Overall Accuracy (>= 0.95) and Kappa Coefficient (>= 0.89), despite varying topography, land-use/land-cover and atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, we identify hotspots of change in water extent at a national scale by comparing monthly water maps for 2018 with the respective maps of the previous year 2017. For the change hotspots, we map change gradients and produce water extent time-series with mapping frequencies <5 days along a timeline of 12 months.

TI  - Habitat-Mediated Responses of Zooplankton to Decreasing Light in Two Temperate Lakes Undergoing Long-Term Browning
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Increases in dissolved organic matter and the consequent "browning" of some lakes in recent decades are reducing water transparency to both ultraviolet and photosynthetically active radiation with important, but poorly understood ecosystem-level consequences for zooplankton grazers. The prevailing resource-based unimodal hypothesis posits that nutrients in dissolved organic matter stimulate primary production in clear-water lakes, while shading by dissolved organic matter inhibits primary production in browner lakes, with zooplankton responses following the patterns of their food resources. Support for this hypothesis derives primarily from short-term experiments, space-for-time analyses, and modeling studies. Here we use three decades of long-term monitoring data from two temperate lakes to assess zooplankton responses to changes in not only resources (chlorophyll) as drivers of change, but also light-related habitat variables (ultraviolet and photosynthetically active radiation, surface and deep-water temperatures, deep-water dissolved oxygen, and pH). The study lakes include one clear-water lake and one browner lake, both of which have experienced long-term browning. Given that zooplankton depth distribution and body size can vary with water transparency, color, and temperature, we test for responses in not only overall zooplankton abundance, but also in vertical distribution and body size. We also examine the ability of the relationship between short-term interannual variation in the driver vs. response variables to predict long-term zooplankton trends. The primary responses of zooplankton were strong changes in abundance that varied with taxon and life history stage in response to habitat variables rather than food resources. Only two groups showed vertical distribution responses, and they trended toward deeper distributions with browning. There was no significant change in body size ratio. The directionality of the response of zooplankton abundance to interannual variability in the driver variables was consistent with those observed in the long-term trends for 33 of 80 comparisons (41%), though only three of those (4%) had statistically significant short-term interannual variability relationships. We conclude that habitat-related changes associated with browning in lakes have important consequences for zooplankton community structure with stronger effects in clear-water lakes than in browner lakes, and that even at the whole-lake scale short-term data are generally not adequate to predict long-term responses.

TI  - AGA-SVR-based selection of feature subsets and optimization of parameter in regional soil salinization monitoring
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinization is a major eco-environmental threat in arid and semi-arid regions. Machine learning combined with salinization-related factors extracted from satellite images and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data to monitor salinization is popular in recent years. The hyper-parameters referring to the parameters prior to fitting the model to the data and the features referring to the factors used for model establishment are vital to modelling accuracy, while the optimization of the above two was not given enough attention. In this study, we proposed a novel approach for simultaneously identifying the input features and hyper-parameters of Support Vector Regression (SVR) based on Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (AGA) for quantitative assessment of salinization in Weigan-Kuqa river delta oasis (Wei-Ku oasis), Sangong River Basin, and Qitai oasis of Xinjiang. First, a total of 41 salinization-related factors of 7 categories were extracted from Landsat 5 TM and DEM data. In each sub-region, the Pearson's correlation analysis was developed between Soil Salt Content (SSC) and salinization-related factors, and the factors significantly correlated with SSC were arranged in descending order of absolute correlation coefficient to form the Candidate Feature Variables (CFVs). The ration of Coefficient of Determination (R-2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) multiplied by 1000 was considered as the fitness function of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and AGA. The CFVs and hyper-parameters were combined together and binary coded, then brought into the AGA and GA for simultaneous feature selection and hyper-parameters optimization of SVR, and established salinization monitoring models (AGA-SVR, GA-SVR). In order to highlight the importance of identifying the input features and hyper-parameter to modelling accuracy, the GS-SVR with all the CFVs as input was established using Grid Search (GS) algorithm to optimize the hyper-parameters. Finally, the salinization maps predicted by three models were compared. The results showed that the sensitivity of salinization-related factors to SSC varied with regions, and 25, 16, 24 salinization-related factors were selected as CFVs in Wei-Ku oasis, Sangong River Basin, and Qitai oasis, respectively. Compared with GS-SVR, the GA-SVR and AGA-SVR got more accurate salinization monitoring with fewer features as input, and fitness generated by AGA-SVR increased by 25.968% in Wei-Ku oasis, 25.159% in Sangong River Basin, 27.568% in Qitai oasis, respectively. Both nature and human factors lead to salinization. The difference of Land Surface Temperature (LST) was the main contributor of different salinization between Wei-Ku oasis of southern Xinjiang and the other two sub-regions of northern Xinjiang. The differences in soil texture, irrigation methods, and livestock carrying capacity were the main factors resulting in differences of salinization in Qitai oasis and Sangong River Basin. Our study shows that the proposed approach can provide technical support for accurate salinization monitoring.

TI  - Land subsidence along the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway during the period of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway (BTR) passes through the subsidence centre of the Chaoyang Wangsiying-Heizhuanghu subsidence funnel edge, which is the most serious subsidence areas in the Beijing Plain. In this paper, we performed Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) time-series analyses technique to investigate land subsidence along the BTR with ENVISAT-ASAR, TerraSAR-X, and Sentinel-1 data. We found the serious subsidence area occupies 14.6% of the total area and reaches a maximum rate of 70 mm yr(-1) in Dougezhuang. Sequential subsidence aggregation obtained by global Moran's I shows that the subsidence heterogeneity is the greatest in 2013. Using the Getis-Ord statistics, the uneven sections of spatial subsidence along the railway are DK7-11 and DK21-23. Combining the compressible layer thickness with groundwater data reveals that the greater the compressible layer thickness, the more serious the subsidence is and the correlation is highest between the extraction of groundwater from the second and third layers and the ground subsidence. With the start of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, the extraction of groundwater began to slow, but the slowing trend of subsidence was not obvious because of the lag between groundwater and land subsidence.

TI  - Impact of Coronavirus Outbreak on NO<sub>2</sub>Pollution Assessed Using TROPOMI and OMI Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne NO(2)column observations from two high-resolution instruments, Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board Sentinel-5 Precursor and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on Aura, reveal unprecedented NO(2)decreases over China, South Korea, western Europe, and the United States as a result of public health measures enforced to contain the coronavirus disease outbreak (Covid-19) in January-April 2020. The average NO(2)column drop over all Chinese cities amounts to -40% relative to the same period in 2019 and reaches up to a factor of similar to 2 at heavily hit cities, for example, Wuhan, Jinan, while the decreases in western Europe and the United States are also significant (-20% to -38%). In contrast with this, although Iran is also strongly affected by the disease, the observations do not show evidence of lower emissions, reflecting more limited health measures.

TI  - Estimating Mo, Cu, Ni, Cd Contents in the Crop Leaves Growing on Small Land Plots Using Satellite Data
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this research was to estimate heavy metals (HMs) (molybdenum (Mo), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd)) contents in crop leaves through multispectral satellite imagery. During the acquisition of a SPOT 7 satellite image (28 July 2017) in situ sampling (38 samples) was done from the leaves of potatoes and beans growing close to the mining town of Kajaran (Armenia). To estimate HMs contents, multivariate regression (multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR)), and artificial neural network (ANN) were used. As input data for the models raw, atmospherically corrected (Dark Object Subtraction (DOS)) and hyperspherical direction cosines (HSDC) normalized values of SPOT 7 spectral data in combination with one or combined log10, multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), standard normal variate transform (SNV) preprocessing methods were utilized. The best results were obtained for Cu using MLR (R-cal.(2) = 0.79, R-CV(2) = 0.70, RMSEcal. = 11.27, RMSECV = 13.47) and ANN (R-Train(2)approximate to 0.80, R-Test(2)approximate to 0.72, RMSETrain approximate to 11, RMSETest approximate to 13) models in case of bean leaves. The results are quite optimistic, however, further research with the use of high spatial/spectral resolution satellite images is needed to improve the accuracy of models.

T2  - COGENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy metal pollution and accumulation in aquatic ecosystems present serious threats to sustainability. In the current study, the heavy metal content of water and edible muscles of a piscivorous fish (Protopterus annectens) as well as bioaccumulation of the heavy metals in fish tissues were evaluated. Samples of water (n = 6) and fish (n = 6) were taken from Kirinda bridge and Ruliba station on Nyabarongo river and analyzed by UV spectroscopy and atomic absorption spectrometry, respectively. The heavy metal concentrations in water were: iron (0.63 +/- 0.02 and 1.61 +/- 0.03 mg/kg), manganese (0.53 +/- 0.002 mg/kg at Ruliba station), chromium (0.06 +/- 0.002 mg/kg at Kirinda bridge), cadmium (0.106 +/- 0.002 mg/kg at Ruliba station) and lead (0.75 +/- 0.02 and 0.051 +/- 0.01 mg/kg). Edible muscles ofProtopterus annectenscontained 336.0 +/- 0.70, 302.6 +/- 1.22, 6.4 +/- 0.26, 44.7 +/- 0.20, 138.2 +/- 0.17 and 302.4 +/- 1.50 mg/kg of iron, manganese, copper, zinc, chromium and lead at Kirinda bridge and 272.8 +/- 0.36, 292.2 +/- 0.25, 8.8 +/- 0.36, 135.2 +/- 0.15, 148.0 +/- 0.21 and 432. 0 +/- 0.50 mg/kg of iron, manganese, copper, zinc, chromium and lead, respectively, at Ruliba station. Most of the heavy metal contents were above the recommended levels. Bioaccumulation factors recorded inProtopterus annectensranged from 403.2 to 15,130 L/kg, implying that consumption of this fish could pose deleterious health risks. The study suggested thatP. annectenscould be used as a sentinel organism for biomonitoring of aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy using indocyanine green in lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - GENERAL THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective The use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been gaining popularity with the emergence of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging. We aimed to systematically review the literature and perform a meta-analysis on the diagnostic accuracy of SLNB using ICG for lung cancer. Methods A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library using search terms "lung/pulmonary" AND "tumor/carcinoma/cancer/neoplasm/adenocarcinoma/malignancy/squamous/carcinoid" AND "indocyanine green" was completed in June 2018. Articles were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) diagnostic accuracy study design; (2) ICG injected at the tumor site with near-infrared fluorescence imaging identification of sentinel lymph nodes; (3) lymphadenectomy or sampling was performed as the gold standard. Results Eight primary studies were included with a total of 366 patients. 43.0% of patients were females and the mean tumor size was 2.3 cm. Sentinel lymph nodes were identified with ICG in 251 patients, yielding a pooled identification rate of 0.83 (0.67-0.94). A meta-analysis of seven studies computed a diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity, and specificity of 177.6 (45.6-691.1), 0.85 (0.71-0.94), and 1.00 (0.98-1.00), respectively. The summary receiver operator characteristic demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.963 (SE = 0.038) and aQ* of 0.91 (SE = 0.057). Conclusion Our review found suboptimal results for the diagnostic accuracy of SLNB using ICG and must be improved before routine clinical use. Further research is required to develop a robust protocol for the use SLNB with ICG for lung cancer.

TI  - Comparative Exposure Assessment Using Silicone Passive Samplers Indicates That Domestic Dogs Are Sentinels To Support Human Health Research
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Silicone wristbands are promising passive samplers to support epidemiological studies in characterizing exposure to organic contaminants; however, investigating associated health risks remains challenging because of the latency period for many chronic diseases that take years to manifest. Dogs provide valuable insights as sentinels for exposure-related human disease because they share similar exposures in the home, have shorter life spans, share many clinical/biological features, and have closely related genomes. Here, we evaluated exposures among pet dogs and their owners using silicone dog tags and wristbands to determine if contaminant levels were correlated with g validated exposure biomarkers. Significant correlations between measures on dog tags and wristbands were observed (r(s)= 0.38-0.90; p < 0.05). Correlations with their respective urinary biomarkers were stronger in dog tags compared to that in human wristbands (r(s) = 0.50-0.71; p < 0.01) for several organophosphate esters. This supports the value of using silicone bands with dogs to investigate health impacts on humans from shared exposures.

TI  - Variation of gross primary production, evapotranspiration and water use efficiency for global croplands
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An improved understanding of the productivity and water use efficiency (WUE) of global croplands is essential for coping with the growing demand for food and water. At present, the spatiotemporal distribution and trends of WUE and the associated gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) for croplands remain poorly quantified at the global scale, especially considering the differences between rainfed and irrigated conditions. In this study, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and the newly developed Global Food Security-support Analysis Data product of Crop Dominance (GFSAD1KCD) were utilized to quantify and analyze spatiotemporal variation and annual trends in GPP, ET and WUE for global croplands from 2000 to 2014. The analysis was complemented with total water storage data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment. The results showed that the croplands with the highest GPP had the highest ET. The mean WUE of global croplands was 1.73 g C kg(-1) H2O, ranging from a lower mean value of 1.62 g C kg(-1) H2O for irrigated croplands to a higher mean value of 1.83 g C kg(-1) H2O for rainfed croplands. Irrigated croplands generally had lower WUE than rainfed croplands; this difference decreased during 2000-2014 owing to a significantly increasing trend in WUE for irrigated cropland and a significantly deceasing trend in WUE for rainfed croplands. However, the increase in WUE observed for irrigated croplands did not necessarily overlap with the decrease in groundwater depletion, as indicated by the corresponding and significantly decreasing trend of total water storage. The GFSAD1KCD data proved useful for investigating primary production and WUE for global croplands, especially in comparisons between irrigated and rainfed conditions. Future studies should focus on reducing the uncertainty associated with the distribution of irrigated croplands in order to better quantify and understand WUE on a global scale.

TI  - Can UAVs fill the gap between in situ surveys and satellites for habitat mapping?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat mapping is an essential descriptor to monitor and manage natural or semi-natural ecosystems. Habitats integrate both the environmental conditions and the related biodiversity. However, it remains challenging to map certain habitats such as inland wetlands due to spectral, spatial and temporal variability in the vegetation cover. Currently, no satellite constellations optimize the spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions required to map wetlands according to the habitats discriminated from in situ surveys. Our approach aims to combine satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data to exceed their respective limitations. Both data sources were combined through a spectral unmixing algorithm with the hypothesis that endmembers from UAV data are pure enough to enhance plant community abundances estimated from satellite data. The experiment was conducted on the regional preserve of the Sougeal marsh, a wet grassland of 174 ha located upstream of the Mont-SaintMichel Bay. Two satellite data sources - Sentinel-2 and Pleiades - and three acquisition periods - November 2017, April 2018 and May 2018 - were considered. A reference map of plant community distribution was produced from UAV multitemporal data and floristic surveys to validate the unmixing of satellite data. This study shows innovative results and perspectives: while UAV can improve habitat discrimination, results vary among acquisition periods and habitats. Results illustrate well the great potential of combined UAV and satellite data but also demonstrate the influence of endmembers on the unmixing process and technical limitations (e.g. spectral mismatches between sensors), which can be overcome using domain adaptation.

TI  - The effects of ocean temperature gradients on bigeye tuna (<i>Thunnus obesus</i>) distribution in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The water temperature at 100-300 m depth layer impact on bigeye tuna distribution has been studied from data collected by 15 fishery survey vessels, surveying every day, in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean from February to March and June to September 2010. The in situ ocean temperature measurements at four depths (100, 150, 200, and 300 m), satellite data and TAO/TRITON moored buoy data were also augmented in this study. The results reveal stereoscopic temperature factors for the prediction of tuna fishing ground: horizontal temperature gradient (HTG), vertical temperature gradient (VTG) in the 100-300 m layer. Maximal catches were observed where (1) vertically there has a strong subsurface temperature front in the 150-200 m layer, with horizontal temperature gradient up to near 0.020 degrees C/km; (2) there have vertical temperature gradient between -0.088 and -0.066 degrees C/m. Meanwhile, the monthly tuna fishery catches decrease with the synchronized reduction of 20 degrees C isotherm depth in the ocean. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of illegal logging on Amazonian medium and large-sized terrestrial vertebrates
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective logging is a major form of land use in tropical rainforests, with more than half of the world's tropical forest already explored. In the Brazilian Amazon, most logging operations are illegal and highly damaging to forests. However, the effects of illegal logging on wildlife are poorly studied. Here we investigate the effects of illegal logging on the assemblage of medium- to large-bodied terrestrial vertebrates at the Gurupi Biological Reserve, a protected area in extreme eastern Amazonia that has been subjected to three decades of illegal logging. We used camera traps to survey the terrestrial vertebrate assemblage and visual interpretation of Landsat time series data (1984-2016) to assess the history of illegal logging (number of logging bouts and recovery time) for each camera trap site. Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) indicates that logging had a minor effect on both the assemblage composition and individual species abundance. At the local level, the study demonstrates that the reserve effectively safeguards a significant portion of the regional biodiversity even though it suffered degradation by illegal logging. At a wider scale, the results suggest that illegally logged forests can retain much of their conservation value, if they are protected from further anthropogenic impacts such as hunting, fragmentation and fires. However, our study represents a best-case scenario, unlikely to be met in most other illegally logged areas in the tropics, where logging is usually followed by secondary effects that amplify its impacts.

TI  - Understanding wheat lodging using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop lodging assessment is essential for evaluating yield damage and informing crop management decisions for sustainable agricultural production. While a few studies have demonstrated the potential of optical and SAR data for crop lodging assessment, large-scale crop lodging assessment has been hampered by the unavailability of dense satellite time series data. The unprecedented availability of free Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data may provide a basis for operational detection and monitoring of crop lodging. In this context, this study aims to understand the effect of lodging on backscatter/coherence and spectral reflectance derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and to detect lodging incidence in wheat using time-series analysis. Crop biophysical parameters were measured in the field for both healthy and lodged plots from March to June 2018 in a study site in Ferrara, Italy, and the corresponding Sentinel images were downloaded and processed. The lodged plots were further categorised into different lodging severity classes (moderate, severe and very severe). Temporal profiles of backscatter, coherence, reflectance and continuum removed spectra were studied for healthy and lodging severity classes throughout the stem elongation to ripening growth stages. The Kruskal Wallis and posthoc Tukey tests were used to test for significant differences between different classes. Our results for Sentinel-2 showed that red edge (740 nm) and NIR (865 nm) bands could best distinguish healthy from lodged wheat (particularly healthy and very severe). For Sentinel-1, the analysis revealed the potential of VH backscatter and the complementarily of 1/V and VH/VV backscatter in distinguishing a maximum number of classes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of Sentinel data for near real-time detection of the incidence and severity of lodging in wheat. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that has contributed to this application.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping with carbon nanoparticles in endometrial cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: A retrospective study was conducted to explore the value of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping with carbon nanoparticles (CNP) in endometrial cancer patients. Methods: Seventy-six endometrial cancer patients who underwent sentinel lymph node mapping with or without systemic pelvic lymphadenectomy were involved in this study. All patients received cervical injection of carbon nanoparticles. The detection frequency for sentinel lymph nodes was calculated for all 76 patients, while the sensitivity and negative predictive value for metastasis were calculated for patients who underwent additional systemic pelvic lymphadenectomy (n=43). Clinical factors associated with sentinel lymph node detection were also evaluated. Results: The overall and bilateral detection frequencies were 71.1% (54/76) and 61.1% (33/54), respectively. A total of 291 sentinel lymph nodes were removed from 54 patients, with the median number removed per patient being 4 (range 3-7). sentinel lymph nodes were mostly located in the external lilac (45.7%) and obturator (41.2%) regions. Fifteen positive lymph nodes including 6 positive sentinel lymph nodes were found in 5 patients. Two of the five patients failed sentinel lymph node mapping but showed positive lymph nodes after systemic pelvic lymphadenectomy. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of sentinel lymph node mapping were therefore both 100%. Conclusion: The detection frequency of sentinel lymph node mapping with carbon nanoparticles in endometrial cancer patients was not as high as for some other cancer types. However, the accuracy of this method was high despite the relatively low detection frequency. More research is needed to improve sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer patients.

TI  - Spatio-temporal assessment of beech growth in relation to climate extremes in Slovenia - An integrated approach using remote sensing and tree-ring data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is predicted to affect tree growth due to increased frequency and intensity of extreme events such as ice storms, droughts and heatwaves. Yet, there is still a lot of uncertainty on how trees respond to an increase in frequency of extreme events. Use of both ground-based wood increment (i.e. ring width) and remotely sensed data (i.e. vegetation indices) can be used to scale-up ground measurements, where there is a link between the two, but this has only been demonstrated in a few studies. We used tree-ring data together with crown features derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to assess the effect of extreme climate events on the growth of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in Slovenia. We found evidence that years with climate extremes during the growing season (drought, high temperatures) had a lower ring width index (RWI) but we could not find such evidence for the remotely sensed EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index). However, when assessing specific events where leaf burning or wilting has been reported (e.g. August 2011) we did see large EVI anomalies. This implies that the impact of drought or heatwave events cannot be captured by EVI anomalies until physical damage on the canopy is caused. This also means that upscaling the effect of climate extremes on RWI by using EVI anomalies is not straightforward. An exception is the 2014 ice storm that caused a large decline in both RWI and EVI. Extreme climatic parameters explained just a small part of the variation in both RWI and EVI by, which could indicate an effect of other climate variables (e.g. late frost) or biotic stressors such as insect outbreaks. Furthermore, we found that RWI was lower in the year after a climate extreme occurred in the late summer. Most likely due to the gradual increase in temperature and more frequent drought we found negative trends in RWI and EVI. EVI maps could indicate where beech is sensitive to climate changes and could be used for planning mitigation interventions. Logical next steps should focus on a tree-based understanding of the short -and long-term effects of climate extremes on tree growth and survival, taking into account differential carbon allocation to the crown (EVI) and to wood-based variables. This research highlights the value of an integrated approach for upscaling tree-based knowledge to the forest level.

TI  - Improved digital soil mapping with multitemporal remotely sensed satellite data fusion: A case study in Iran
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling and mapping of soil properties are critical in many environmental, climatic, ecological and hydrological applications. Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques are now commonly applied to predict soil properties with limited data by developing predictive relationships with environmental covariates. Most studies derive covariates from a digital elevation model (named static covariates). Many works also include single-day remotely sensed satellite imagery. However, multitemporal satellite images can capture information about soil properties over time and bring additional information in predicting soil properties in DSM. We refer to covariates derived from multitemporal satellite images as dynamic covariates. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of DSM when using terrain derivatives (static covariates), single-date remotely sensed satellite indices (limited dynamic covariates), multitemporal satellite indices (dynamic covariates), and combinations of terrain derivatives and satellite indices (covariate fusion) as covariates in predicting soil properties and estimating uncertainty. Three soil properties are considered in this study: organic carbon (OC), sand content, and calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE). Inclusion of single and/or multitemporal remotely sensed satellite indices improved the prediction of soil properties over traditionally used terrain indices. Significant improvements were observed in the prediction of soil properties using two models, Cubist and random forest (RF). The increase in the R-2 values for Cubist and RF were 126% and 78% for OC, 110% and 54% for sand, and 87% and 32% for CCE. The RMSE decreased by 34% and 27% for OC, 25% and 12% for sand, and 39% and 19% for CCE, when compared to the terrain indices only model. This also reduced the uncertainty of estimation and mapping. These clearly showed the advantage of using multitemporal satellite data fusion rather than simply using static terrain indices for DSM of soil properties to deliver a great potential in improving soil modeling and mapping for many applications.

TI  - Distribution of ecosystem services within oilseed rape fields: Effects of field defects on pest and weed seed predation rates
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent extreme weather events, which jeopardize agriculture by affecting crop health, characterize the ongoing climate change. Temporary patches where sown plants are poorly developed (hereafter "field defects") are likely to increase with climate change and can be colonized by other plant species. Although perennial non-crop habitats can act as refuges for beneficial insects in agricultural landscapes and increase ecosystem services (ESs) in neighbouring arable fields, the relevance of field defects is unknown. Here, we quantified two ESs (pest and weed seed predation) in field defects within oilseed rape crops and related the ES levels with the activity-density of ground beetles and temperature. In 10 fields, we used artificial caterpillars made of plasticine and seed cards of two weed species (Taraxacum sp. and Stellaria sp.) to quantify the ESs in two sampling periods (spring and summer) and three habitat types: field defects, crops grown in standard conditions (field interiors) and crop-defect boundaries. Ground beetles were sampled using pitfall traps and classified into feeding guilds and body-size classes. Insects and mammals were the main pest predators, and predation increased in summer but did not differ among habitats. Seed predation rates for both species were significantly higher in summer. Predation upon Taraxacum seeds was higher in the field interiors, whereas the predation rate upon Stellaria seeds was significantly higher in the field interiors and defects compared to that in the crop-defect boundaries. The predation rate by insects increased with the activity-density of the medium- and large-sized carnivorous carabids, whereas the seed predation rate for both weed species was positively related to the activity-density of medium-sized herbivorous carabids. Finally, the mean and maximum temperatures were negatively linked to the predation rates on artificial caterpillars and seeds of Taraxacum, respectively. Our results suggest that these ephemeral habitats are not related to a strong decrease in ecosystem services; thus, field defects may not cause substantial changes in ES provisioning. We confirmed that ground beetles are important providers of both investigated ESs and showed that microclimatic conditions might play an important role in the regulation of ESs in agroeco-systems.

TI  - Worldwide ACE (I/D) polymorphism may affect COVID-19 recovery rate: an ecological meta-regression
T2  - ENDOCRINE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the emergence of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), researchers worldwide have started detecting the probable pathogenesis of the disease. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin-converting enzymes have received a good deal of attention as possible pathways involved in 2019-nCoV pathogenesis. As the experiments seeking to find potential medications acting on these pathways are being conducted in the early phases, having an ecological worldview on the relationship between the prevalence of COVID-19 disease and the genetic differences in the genes involved in the RAS system could be valuable for the field. In this regard, we conducted a meta-analysis study of the prevalence of ACE (I/D) genotype in countries most affected by the COVID-19. In the meta-analysis, 48,758 healthy subjects from 30 different countries were evaluated in 116 studies, using the Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. The I/D allele frequency ratio was pooled by a random-effect model. The COVID-19 prevalence data of death and recovery rates were evaluated as the latitudes for the meta-regression analysis. Our results demonstrated that with the increase of the I/D allele frequency ratio, the recovery rate significantly increased (point estimate: 0.48, CI 95%: 0.05-0.91,p = 0.027). However, there was no significant difference in the case of death rate (point estimate: 1.74, CI 95%: 4.5-1.04,p = 0.22). This ecological perspective coupled with many limitations does not provide a direct clinical relevance between the COVID-19 and RAS system, but it shows potential pathophysiological associations. Our results raise concerns about ethnic and genetic differences that could affect the effectiveness of the currently investigated RAS-associated medications in different regions.

TI  - Improving surface roughness lengths estimation using machine learning algorithms
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface roughness lengths, including the aerodynamic roughness length (z(0m)) and the thermodynamic roughness length (z(0h), represented by excess resistance kB(-1)), are crucial parameters in the accurate simulation of surface turbulent fluxes. However, due to insufficient knowledge in the physical mechanisms of surface roughness lengths, there exist considerable uncertainties in physically-based models. In this study, we attempt to overcome this issue by establishing the data-driven surface roughness lengths models, which are based on global observations from the FLUXNET2015 dataset and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Four machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), single hidden layer artificial neural network (ANN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), deep belief network (DBN) are explored. A large number of data from 45 flux tower sites (as many as 44,662 daily z(0m) and 583,484 half-hour kB(-1) observations) are utilized to train and test the data-driven models. Our results show that the data-driven models surprisingly achieve significantly improved estimation of surface roughness lengths and turbulent fluxes than physical models, which indicated the model inadequacy of physical models. RF-driven models achieve the best results. MLP and DBN-driven models of higher complexity are slightly superior to ANN-driven models but exhibit unstable performance. RF and ANN accurately reproduce the unimodal function relationship between leaf area index and z(0m), thus demonstrating that the machine learning methods can extract physical rules from vast numbers of observations. In contrast, MLP and DBN fail to capture this relationship, possibly because of too complicated architecture. It implies that a suitable complexity of machine learning algorithm is critical to excavate true physical mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that machine learning technique can contribute to highly accurate estimations of surface turbulent fluxes by building data-driven surface roughness lengths models.

TI  - Spring vegetation green-up dynamics in Central Europe based on 20-year long MODIS NDVI data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study focuses on the leaf unfolding dynamics of deciduous broadleaf forests in Central Europe. MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to quantify green-up duration (GUD) for the wider Carpathian Basin located in Central Europe, covering the time period 2000-2019. GUD was calculated for similar to 170 000 pixels with deciduous broadleaf forest cover at 500 m spatial resolution. The GUD exhibited large interannual and elevation-dependent variability where the latter likely indicates the distribution of the different species. The longest mean GUD occurred in 2017 (32.7 days), while the shortest (14.5 days) was associated with 2018. The relationship between the start of leaf unfolding (SOS) and the GUD (R = -0.62) reveals that the timing of the bud break plays an important role in the leaf unfolding process. Multiple linear regression models were constructed to explain and forecast the GUD based on the date of SOS, the elevation and the meteorological variables. The main explanatory variable was the SOS date, explaining 38.3% of the GUD variability (RMSE= 8 days), while the addition of the elevation and its square to the model increased the explained variance to 47.8% (RMSE = 7.34 days). Further addition of meteorological variables covering periods prior to and after the SOS increased the explained variance (the best R-2 was 0.65). The results indicate the complexity of processes that drive the leaf unfolding. We propose that future studies should consider SOS, elevation and meteorological variables together to interpret GUD dynamics. Earlier SOS implies longer GUD, while delayed SOS is associated with short GUD, which means that the benefits of climate change possibly realized as a longer growing season could be smaller than anticipated. Accurate estimation of the SOS is a prerequisite for the successful modeling of the GUD.

AB  - Super-resolution reconstruction refers to the technique of reconstructing a high-resolution image from a single or a series of low-resolution images by digital image processing. This technology can not only increase the high-frequency information of the image, but also eliminate the low-resolution. Deep Learning has made breakthroughs in modern digital image processing. Compared to traditional algorithms, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) achieve superior performance on a series of challenging image-processing problems such as image classification and target detection. Enhancement Deep convolutional neural networks (EDCNN) learn through a large number of training samples, obtain relevant information within the image, and then use the information to achieve specific functions. EDCNN also has an excellent performance with remote sensing data. Performance evaluation was made with bicubic and other deep learning methods, EDCNN outperformed other deep learning algorithms.

TI  - Precipitation extremes influence patterns and partitioning of evapotranspiration and transpiration in a deciduous boreal larch forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High latitude boreal forests are experiencing dramatic changes in climate and hydrology. It is not clear how boreal forests will adapt to hydrological change or how stable they will be to extreme climate fluctuations and shifts in ecosystem water availability (EWA; residuals between precipitation and evapotranspiration). Although there have been numerous studies in North American and European boreal forests, the Siberian boreal region is underrepresented. Moreover, Siberia is dominated by deciduous conifers (larch) that may have different response to shifting hydrology than boreal evergreens do. We observed evapotranspiration (ET) by eddy covariance technique and transpiration (T) by sap-flow probes on a subsample of trees within the flux-tower footprint through two growing seasons in a larch forest in northernmost China. Ecosystems at the margins of their zone could be amongst the first to experience significant shifts in structure and function. At this site there have already been signs of permafrost degradation and more frequent temperature and precipitation anomalies. The canopy-dominant larch accounted for half the total T fluxes. The remaining 50% was distributed evenly among intermediate and suppressed trees. T is the dominant subcomponent in ET, where overall T/ET varies of 66%-84% depending on precipitation patterns. In dormant and early growing seasons, T still constitutes a majority of ET even though the canopy foliage is not fully developed because cold soil creates a negative soil to air vapor pressure gradient that impedes evaporation. However, in the peak growing season, excess precipitation reduces T while providing sufficient wetness for surface evaporation. ET from standard data product based on MODIS satellite reflectance underestimates tower ET by 17%-29%. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence measured by satellite is well correlated with tower ET (r(2) = 0.69-0.73) and could provide a better basis for regional ET extrapolations. A global comparison of data for 2000-2018 period reveals that boreal forests not only have the smallest annual MODIS ET but also the least EWA compared to temperate and tropical forests. Also, even though boreal deciduous and evergreens have comparable annual ET, their T/ET and EWA are distinct. This work highlights how short-term precipitation extremes may shift ecosystem function and structure by changing EWA through exported runoff. Sites along boreal ecotones are critical to observe for signs of shifts in their structure, function, and response to climate anomalies.

TI  - Ten-year global particulate mass concentration derived from space-borne CALIPSO lidar observations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive remote sensing has been widely used in recent decades to obtain global particulate matter (PM) mass concentration at daytime and under cloud-free condition. In this study, a retrieval method was developed for providing PM (PM10 and PM2.5) mass concentration both at daytime and nighttime using the latest data version (V4.10) from space-borne Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) lidar measurements. The advantage of the method is that PM10 & PM2.5 mass concentrations were obtained for seven aerosol types respectively base on active remote sensing observation at daytime and nighttime, even under cloudy condition. The results show that satellite-based PM mass concentrations are in good agreement with in-situ observations from 1602 ground monitoring sites throughout the world. Moreover, global distributions of PM10 and PM2.5 mass concentration during 2007-2016 were investigated, showing that for Beijing the annual mean PM2.5 mass concentration at nighttime is 11.31% less than those at daytime, however for London is 36.62%. It is suggested that diurnal variations in PM2.5 mass concentration are closely related to human activities. Thiswork provides a reliable high-resolution database for long-term particulatemass concentrations on the global scale, which is of importance to evaluate aerosol impacts on climate, environment as well as ecosystem.

TI  - The impact of tree canopy structure on understory variation in a boreal forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on understory composition and its relationships with the overstory tree canopy, especially leaf area index (LAI), is crucially needed in, e.g., modeling land-atmosphere interactions and productivity of forests. There are also several global LAI products produced from satellite data which need to be validated with ground reference data. However, to date, only scarce field data on simultaneous structural properties of under- and overstory vegetation, and tree canopy LAI, have been available in boreal forests. This paper shows how understory composition and fractional cover of different species types varies in a boreal forest site, and how it is linked to structural properties of the tree layer. The study is based on 301 understory plots collected in an area of similar to 16 km(2) around Hyytiala forestry field station, Finland (61 degrees 50'N, 24 degrees 17'E) in a southern boreal forest site. Forest understory plot data was accompanied with measurements of both standard forest inventory variables and optically-based canopy light transmittance data. Clear differences in average species composition between different site fertility types were observed, but also large variation within each site fertility type was noted. Forest understory composition was better correlated with structural forest canopy measures (e.g., tree canopy LAI, canopy cover, canopy openness) than with traditional forest inventory variables such as tree height or diameter. Forest canopy LAI and the fractional cover of understory were strongly related, especially in more fertile sites. Our results highlight the role of tree canopy structural metrics as modifiers of the understory light climate and growing conditions, also, in boreal forests.

TI  - Animal biodiversity in cider apple orchards: Simultaneous environmental drivers and effects on insectivory and pollination
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Making agriculture more sustainable requires a greater understanding of animal-mediated ecosystem services. The beneficial effects of pest-control and pollination provided by, respectively, insectivorous birds and pollinator insects are essential for many crops. Improving these ecosystem services simultaneously in the same crop system means, first, identifying the drivers of animal biodiversity that operate in agricultural landscapes, and second, revealing the relationships between biodiversity and the two services. Here, for two years, we addressed how landscape and small-scale orchard features affected bird and insect biodiversity (abundance and species richness) in cider apple orchards in northern Spain. We examined the effects of bird and insect biodiversity on the magnitude of, respectively, insectivory and pollination. Bird biodiversity was positively affected by the cover of apple canopy within orchards, whereas that of pollinators responded positively to the cover of semi-natural woody habitats and eucalyptus plantations in the surrounding landscape, and also on the level of bloom at the orchard scale. Insectivory, estimated from sentinel model and exclusion experiments, was positively affected by increased abundance and richness of birds across orchards. Similarly, fruit set responded positively to higher abundance and richness of wild bees, whereas seed set mostly depended on the abundance of wild pollinators. Our findings suggest simultaneous positive effects of animal biodiversity on pest-control and pollination in apple orchards, with no sign of trade-offs between biodiversity groups or between ecosystem functions. A multi-scaled management of orchard-level features (apple canopies and surrounding hedgerows for birds, and apple bloom and ground cover for pollinators) and landscape-level ones (surrounding cover of semi-natural woody habitats, moderate for birds, high for pollinators) is encouraged for the simultaneous enhancement of pest-control and pollination. Biodiversity-farming win-win scenarios are possible in cider apple orchards by simultaneously promoting multiple animal-mediated ecosystem services.

TI  - Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) 2017 and 2018: Prospective hospital-based surveillance for serious paediatric conditions
T2  - COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) network is a hospital-based active surveillance system employing prospective case ascertainment for selected serious childhood conditions, particularly vaccine-preventable diseases and potential adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). This report presents surveillance data for 2017 and 2018.MethodsSpecialist nurses screened hospital admissions, emergency department (ED) records, laboratory and other data on a daily basis in seven paediatric tertiary referral hospitals across Australia to identify children with the conditions under surveillance. In 2017 and 2018 these included acute flaccid paralysis (AFP; a syndrome associated with poliovirus infection), acute childhood encephalitis (ACE), influenza, intussusception (IS; a potential AEFI with rotavirus vaccines), pertussis, varicella-zoster virus infection (varicella and herpes zoster), invasive meningococcal, and invasive Group A streptococcus diseases. An additional social research component was added to evaluate parental attitudes to vaccination.ResultsPAEDS captured 1,571 and 923 cases for 2017 and 2018, respectively, across all conditions under surveillance. Key outcomes of PAEDS included: contribution to national AFP surveillance to reach the World Health Organization reporting targets; identification of a third human parechovirus outbreak among other infectious diseases linked to ACE; demonstration of variable influenza activity between 2017 and 2018, with vaccine effectiveness (VE) analysis demonstrating that the protection offered through vaccination is season-dependent. All IS cases associated with vaccine receipt were reported to the relevant state health department. Varicella and herpes zoster case numbers remained unchanged, with vaccine uptake found to be suboptimal among eligible children under the NIP. Enhanced pertussis surveillance continues to capture controls for VE estimation. Surveillance for invasive meningococcal disease showed predominance for serotype B at 57% over 2 years among 77 cases where serotyping was available, and surveillance for invasive group A streptococcus captured severe disease in children.ConclusionsPAEDS continues to provide unique policy-relevant data on serious paediatric conditions using hospital-based sentinel surveillance.

TI  - Hotspots of snow cover changes in global mountain regions over 2000-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of snow cover changes and related phenology in global mountain areas has not been consistently addressed, despite the well-known importance of the snow in this environment. By using MODIS products from 2000 to 2018, this study reveals that around 78% of the global mountain areas are undergoing a snow decline characterized by snow cover duration decrease up to 43 days, and a snow cover area decrease up to 13%. Few areas show positive changes with snow cover duration increase up to 32 days, and snow cover area increase up to 11%, mainly during wintertime in Northern Hemisphere. Significant snow cover duration changes are related in 58% of the areas to both delayed snow onset, and earlier melt; moreover, the rate of earlier snowmelt is greater than the rate of later snow onset in the analyzed time period. Snow cover, and phenology changes are highly variable at mid-elevations, while from 4000 m upward only negative changes are detected. Air temperature is the main driver for snow onset and melt, while a combined effect of air temperature and precipitation dominates the winter season. These changes have multiple implications on water resources, ecosystem services, tourism, and energy production. The results are provided with the caveats that the short time period of the analysis (2000-2018) limit the attributions of long-term trends, and snow cover estimates are affected by uncertainties, which may be stronger in complex terrain.

TI  - Multi-scale site evaluation of a relict active layer detachment in a High Arctic landscape
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigations into the susceptibility of permafrost landscapes response to thermokarst can be performed using various approaches, depending on the scale of investigation. In many cases, point-based field measurements are extrapolated to larger scales and vice versa. The integration of scales often requires some form of ground control in addition to remote sensing surveys, which are at times exclusively conducted. As upscaling from discrete field measurements can provide spatial coverage and landscape-scale significance, downscaling from remote sensing can offer insight into processes and serve as calibration or verification. Here we present a multiple-scale evaluation of an area initially interpreted as a relict active layer detachment slide (before 1950) on Melville Island in the High Arctic, where differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) showed subsidence between 2013 and 2015. Ground-based, cryostratigraphy measurements were combined with ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to investigate permafrost ice-content. The results indicate greater subsidence within the relict active layer detachment as detected by DInSAR. GPR surveys and permafrost coring indicated the presence of an ice-rich or massive ice layer near the base of the active layer in this area. In addition, cryostratigraphic evidences of thaw unconformity and of massive ice depth helped validate the interpretations of the geomorphology in the active layer detachment. This combination of methods indicated a localized and inherited landform-subsidence association, which brought further insight into the interpretation of DInSAR subsidence data. The framework presented in this study demonstrates the importance of site-specific investigations of thermokarst signal in order to understand the processes behind the remote sensing results.

TI  - Mapping and sampling to characterize global inland water dynamics from 1999 to 2018 with full Landsat time-series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global surface water extent is changing due to natural processes as well as anthropogenic drivers such as reservoir construction and conversion of wetlands to agriculture. However, the extent and change of global inland surface water are not well quantified. To address this, we classified land and water in all 3.4 million Landsat 5, 7, and 8 scenes from 1999 to 2018 and performed a time-series analysis to produce maps that characterize interannual and infra-annual open surface water dynamics. We also used a probability sample and reference time-series classification of land and water for 1999-2018 to provide unbiased estimators of area of stable and dynamic surface water extent and to assess the accuracy of the surface water maps. From the reference sample data, we estimate that permanent surface water covers 2.93 (standard error +/- 0.09) million km(2), and during this time period an estimated 138,011 (+/- 28,163) km(2) underwent only gain of surface water, over double the estimated 53,154 (+/- 10,883) km(2) that underwent only loss of surface water. The estimated area of 950,719 (+/- 104,034) km(2) that experienced recurring change between land and water states is far greater than the area undergoing these unidirectional trends. From a probability sample of high resolution imagery, an estimated 10.9% (+/- 1.9%) of global inland surface water is within mixed pixels at Landsat resolution indicating that monitoring of surface water changes requires improved spatial detail. We provide the first unbiased area estimators of open surface water extent and its changes with associated uncertainties and illustrate the challenges of tracking changes in surface water area using medium spatial and temporal resolution data.

TI  - Mapping depth to the argillic horizon on historically farmed soil currently under forests
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Piedmont region of the southeastern United States experienced a period of accelerated erosion in the 1800s. Clear-cuffing of the forests coupled with soil filling and inadequate erosion control practices led to substantial soil redistribution and loss. This redistribution exposed the subsoil clay (argillic) horizon in many locations and altered hydrologic processes (i.e., infiltration or interflow) across the landscape. Describing the current hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in this landscape requires a spatially explicit mapping of soil re-distribution and the current depth to the argillic horizon. To achieve this mapping, we measured the depth to the argillic horizon in highly eroded (historically farmed) and undisturbed hillslopes (reference areas) by direct measures-soil augur and file push probe-and by electromagnetic induction (EMI) combined with ancillary data (i.e., terrain features). Direct measures indicated that the depth to the argillic horizon in the historically farmed watersheds ranged from 26 +/- 2 to 87 +/- 12 cm in ridge-top and toe-slope, respectively, while in the reference hillslopes depths from ridge-top to toe-slope only ranged from 30 +/- 3 to 48 +/- 12 cm. Using remotely-sensed data, the best predictive models of the depth to the argillic horizon were based on measurements of the site topographic characteristics (percent slope and hillslope position), along with the following EMI data products: the 2 m horizontal coplanar (HCP) EMI measurement and some of its derivatives (i.e., 2 m HCP - 2 m perpendicular, 2 m HCP - 1 m HCP). Our data suggest that in this previously farmed and reforested landscape, geophysical sensing is an efficient means of predicting depth-to-clay when combined with landscape feature characteristics (R-2 = 0.69).

AB  - The study indicates the viability of geographic information system and remote sensing data for the analysis as well as estimation of the stage and the rate of erosional processes in a Himalayan watershed for improved planning and management. The Gaj watershed lies in the outer Himalayan region of Himachal Pradesh, India, which has been characterized in to nine sub-watersheds for studying the geomorphological evolution of each separately for comparative assessment irrespective of any scale issue. The method involves the use of 30 m Cartosat (digital elevation model) for operative and time-saving data extraction of morphometric and hypsometric parameters. The estimated hypsometric integral values and the shape of the hypsometric curves reveal varying degree of erosional stages of the sub-watersheds demanding attention over the denudation activities. The results have helped in the qualitative discussions and prioritizing the sub-watershed for sustainable soil-water conservation and management, which can be useful for controlling the erosional activities at right locations in the study area.

TI  - Quantification of lake clarity in China using Landsat OLI imagery data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The eutrophication of lake and reservoir (hereafter referred to as lakes) has attracted concerns from the public and government in China. Water clarity is a reliable indicator for quantifying eutrophic status because of its strong association with chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter, and nutrients. Traditionally, water clarity is measured using Secchi disk depth (SD). By linking the spectral signal from water surface with in situ measured SD, remote sensing provides a useful tool for SD estimation at a large scale in a repetitive manner. Remote sensing derived water clarity has been reported in many regions with specific models established for different satellite overpasses concurrent with in situ measured SD, but national water clarity remained unknown in China. In this study, 2152 samples were collected from 34 field campaigns in 2013-2018, of which 1792 samples were gathered within +/- 7 days of Landsat OLI overpasses. We used Landsat 8 OLI bands 1-4 to develop regression models (n = 1016), and 782 samples to validate model performances. We further collected three additional in situ SD datasets to validate the best performance model, and eventually used it to map SD at a national scale with OLI images mainly acquired in 2016. Our results indicated that the entire dataset of SD has a strong association with Landsat reflectance, yielding low root mean square error between measured and estimated SD (RMSE = 63 cm) for lakes in China. The national water clarity was averaged to 176 cm in 2016 with large spatial variability (S.D: 216 cm) due to the marked variation between turbid waters in the east plain area and clean water across the Tibet Plateau. Lakes in the northeastern (75 cm) and eastern (84 cm) China had low clarity due to shallow water depth combined with high suspended matter and algal abundance. Lakes in the Yungui Plateau (91 cm), Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang autonomous regions (114 cm) exhibited intermediate clarity; while lakes in the Tibet Plateau (294 cm) displayed the highest clarity. This investigation demonstrated that Landsat imagery with Rayleigh scattering correction reflectance combined with in situ observation can provide quantitative information about the lake clarity with surface area > 8 ha. Moreover, this method has the potential to retrieve SD with archived Landsat imagery to determine the temporal variation of SD at national or continental scale which can be used to support inland water management and decision-maker for improving water quality.

TI  - Impacts of urbanization on soil organic carbon stocks in the northeast coastal agricultural areas of China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic changes in soil organic carbon pools have significant impacts on regional and global carbon balance. Due to rapid development in urbanized areas, the land use changes dramatically, impacting soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in topsoil. This study aimed to document the impacts of urbanization on SOC stocks in a rapidly urbanized area from northeastern China. A total of 12 auxiliary variables were as SOC predictors including elevation, slope aspect, slope gradient, topographic wetness index, Landsat TM band3, Landsat TM band4, Landsat TM5, and normalized difference vegetation index. Urban-specific variables including population (POP), gross domestic product (GDP), distance to the socio-economic center, and distance to the roads are also considered. A set of 523 (in 1990) and 847 (in 2015) top soil samples with SOC measurement were collected. Two random forest (RF) models, one with all auxiliary variables except urban-specific variable (MA) and the other with all auxiliary variables (MB) were used to map the spatial distribution of SOC stocks in the two periods. Ten-fold cross-validation was conducted to evaluate the performance of RF models. We find that the full auxiliary variables model had a better performance for the both periods. POP and GDP were key auxiliary variables affecting spatial variability of SOC stocks in 2015. Over a 25-year period, SOC stocks decreased from 2.77 +/- 1.09 kg m(-2) to 2.16 +/- 0.93 kg m(-2), resulting in 3.78 Tg SOC loss in this region. Rapid urbanization led to drastic land- use change, which was the main reason for the decrease of SOC stocks. Additionally, urban-specific variables should be used as the main auxiliary variables when predicting SOC stocks in the areas that experience rapid urbanization. We believe that accurate prediction and mapping of SOC stocks will help manage land use and facilitate soil quality assessment so as to increase soil carbon sequestration in the region.

TI  - Variations of suspended particulate concentration and composition in Chinese lakes observed from Sentinel-3A OLCI images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentration and composition of suspended particulate matter provide important information for evaluating water quality and understanding the variability in the underwater light field in lakes. In this study, inherent optical property (IOP)-centered algorithms were developed to estimate the concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chla, [mg/m(3)]) and suspended particulate matter (SPM, [g/m(3)]) and the Chla/SPM ratio (an indicator of the suspended particulate composition) of 118 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers (MLYHR) of China using Sentinel-3A/OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) data collected from August 2016 to July 2018. The mean Chla concentration and Chla/SPM ratio were high in summer and low in winter, while the mean SPM peaked in winter and decreased in summer. The 94 lakes in the Yangtze River basin had a higher mean Chla concentration (30.94 +/- 14.84) and Chla/SPM ratio (0.97 x 10(-3) +/- 0.60 x 10(-3)), but a lower mean SPM (44.87 +/- 12.61) than the 24 lakes in the Huai River basin (Chla: 27.35 +/- 12.18, Chla/SPM: 0.79 x 10(-3) +/- 0.48 x 10(-3), SPM: 47.31 +/- 13.40). Regarding the mean values of each lake, Chla and Chla/SPM ratio correlated well with temperature, whereas the wind speed and precipitation had little effect on the variations of suspended particulate matter. Moreover, shipping transportation and sand dredging activities affected the spatial distribution of Chla, SPM, and Chla/SPM in several large lakes (e.g., Lake Poyang and Lake Dongting). Chla/SPM related well with other proxies that express the suspended particulate composition, and had a significant correlation with the Chla-specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton at 443 nm (a(ph)*(443)). The remotely sensed concentration and composition of suspended particulate matter can provide a comprehensive reference for water quality monitoring and expand our knowledge of the trophic status of the lakes.

TI  - Modeling and spatio-temporal analysis of city-level carbon emissions based on nighttime light satellite imagery
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming due to carbon emissions has been recognized as a threat to food security, human health and natural ecosystem, and carbon emission reduction is a challenging job for each country in the world. In this study, an ensemble structure-based neural network model (NNEnsemble) is proposed to analyze the nonlinear relationship between the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Line-Scan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime stable light (NSL) data, and province-scale statistical data on carbon emissions. Given the challenge of obtaining urban-scale carbon emission data, a weighted coefficient strategy by using the NSL data were employed to analyze the carbon emissions at the urban scale. The performance of the proposed method was found to be superior to that of comparable methods with respect to various evaluation indices. Under these circumstances, a hot spot and Standard deviational ellipse analysis of three northeast provinces in China was conducted from 1998 to 2013. The results can promote a better understanding of the spatio-temporal characteristics of carbon emissions in three northeastern Chinese provinces. Moreover, the developed application software based on NNEnsemble can serve as a basis for the development of carbon emission mitigation policies for other provinces.

TI  - Forest restoration scenarios produce synergies for agricultural production in southern Ethiopia
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the factors influencing agricultural productivity is vital to food security, especially for food insecure smallholder farmers. Within agricultural landscape mosaics, the arrangement of tree cover such as forests, trees, and hedgerows can positively or negatively impact agricultural productivity in fields. In such settings, forest restoration has the potential to impact food security goals in addition to the typical restoration goals of reversing land degradation and supporting carbon storage. Here, we compare and contrast forest restoration scenarios in order to explore whether there are ideal amounts and configurations of forests that optimize benefits for food production. To do so, we explored forest restoration scenarios in an agricultural-forest landscape in southern Ethiopia where previous research showed increased wheat productivity in sections of fields adjacent to forests. We used hypothetical historically-relevant and plausible future scenarios to examine the landscape-level implications of forest restoration on total wheat production. To accomplish this, we first characterized contemporary forest cover as well as long-term trends using remote sensing. Then, trends in forests and hedgerows were used to create a series of hypothetical yet realistic scenarios to explore trade-offs among total forest cover, its configuration, and total wheat production. From 1967-2013, analysis of historical aerial photography and Landsat imagery showed a general trend of reforestation (an 8% increase in forest cover). While the abundance of primary forests remained constant from 1986-2013, mixed vegetation expanded from 16 % to occupy 26 % of the landscape, generally in the form of small forest fragments with sparse tree cover. Our hypothetical reforestation and hedgerow planting scenarios found that field productivity increases near forest edges resulted in non-linear food production benefits with hedgerow expansion. Benefits to total landscape-level wheat production were almost twice as great when transitioning from low to medium tree cover than when transitioning from medium-high to high tree cover. Furthermore, the benefits of hedgerows on agricultural production were asymptotic; productivity gains eventually levelled off with increasing hedgerows. Our results highlight potential benefits of a landscape approach for enhancing smallholder agricultural productivity in southern Ethiopia and beyond. We argue that considering a landscape perspective can help support food security goals particularly within the context of climate change and should play a more prominent role in forest conservation and restoration.

TI  - A near real-time deep learning approach for detecting rice phenology based on UAV images
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Near real-time crop phenology detection is essential for crop management, estimation of harvest time and yield estimation. Previous approaches to crop phenology detection have relied on time-series (multi-temporal) vegetation index (VI) data, and have included threshold-based, phenometrics-based and shape-model-fitting-based (SMF) methods. However, the performance of these methods depends on the duration and temporal resolution of the time-series data. In this study, we propose a new approach which identifies the principal growth stages of rice (Oryza saliva L.) directly from RGB images. Only a mono-temporal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery was required for a large-area phenology detection via the well-trained network. An efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was designed to estimate rice phenology. The CNN incorporated spatial pyramid pooling (SPP), transfer learning and an auxiliary branch with external data. A total of 82 plots across a 160hectare rice cultivation area of Southern China were selected to evaluate the proposed network. CNN predictions were ground truthed using rice phenology measurements taken from each plot throughout the growing season. Aerial data were collected using a fixed-wing UAV equipped with multispectral and RGB cameras. The performance of traditional SMF methods deteriorated when time-series VI data were of short duration. In contrast, the phenological stage estimated by the proposed network showed good agreement with ground observations, with a top-1 accuracy rate of 83.9% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.18. The spatial distribution of harvest dates for 627 plots in the study area were computed from the phenological stage estimates. The estimates matched well with the observed harvest dates. The results demonstrated the excellent performance of the proposed deep learning approach in near real-time phenology detection and harvest time estimation.

TI  - A method for remote sensing image denoising based on structured dictionary learning and cloud computing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - With the emerging technology of remote sensing, a huge amount of remote sensing data is collected and stored in the remote sensin02222g platform, and the transmission and processing of data on the platform is extremely wasteful. It is essential to incorporate the speedy remote sensing processing services in an integrated cloud computing architecture. In order to improve the denoising ability of remote sensing image, a new structured dictionary-based method for multispectral image denoising based on cluster is proposed. This method incorporates both the locality of spatial and the correlation across spectrum of multispectral image. Remote sensing image is divided into different groups by clustering, and sparse representation coefficients of spatial and spectral and dictionary is obtained according to the dictionary learning algorithm. After threshold processing, the similar blocks are averaged and realized with multispectral remote sensing image denoising. The algorithm is applied to denoise the noisy remote sensing image of Maoergai area in the upper Minjiang which contain typical vegetation and soil is chosen as study area, simulation results show that higher peak-signal to noise ratio can be obtained as compared to other recent image denoising methods.

TI  - The potential of remote sensing-based models on global water-use efficiency estimation: An evaluation and intercomparison of an ecosystem model (BESS) and algorithm (MODIS) using site level and upscaled eddy covariance data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE) is a critical indicator to investigate the interaction between the terrestrial ecosystem carbon and water cycles. WUE, estimated from gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) based on remote sensing (RS)-based ecosystem models and algorithms (e.g., MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), BESS (Breathing Earth System Simulator)), have been used to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of WUE and its responses to environmental changes. However, few studies have assessed the ability of RS-based ecosystem models and algorithms on global WUE estimation. In this study, we evaluated 8-day and annual WUE from MODIS and BESS among different sites, land cover types and climate zones using the FLUXNET2015 dataset as reference, and conducted spatial intercomparisons of annual WUE between MODIS, BESS and an upscaled FLUXNET dataset (MTE). The site level evaluation results showed that BESS WUE had better performance than MODIS WUE at both 8-day and annual scales. Among different land cover types and climate zones, MODIS and BESS WUE performed unsatisfactorily, especially for MODIS WUE in open shrublands and savannas and for BESS WUE in closed shrublands. Additionally, both MODIS and BESS WUE performed poorly in the hot semi-arid climate zone. The spatial intercomparisons over 2001-2011 revealed that BESS WUE had similar spatial patterns of annual WUE and linear trends with MTE WUE over the globe, except at the high latitudes. However, the spatiotemporal patterns of MODIS WUE were different from those of MTE and BESS WUE, particularly in the (sub) tropical arid and semi-arid regions. Our evaluations results suggested that coupling carbon and water cycles into RS-based models could improve their performance on global WUE estimation. Moreover, the performance of MODIS and BESS on global WUE estimation should be further improved, especially for their performance on temporal variation and their performance at the (semi) arid areas and the high latitudes.

TI  - Through the Eyes of Narcissus: Competitive Social Worldviews Mediate the Associations that Narcissism has with Ideological Attitudes
T2  - SELF AND IDENTITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present research examined whether the associations that the assertive/extraverted, antagonistic/disagreeable, and vulnerable/neurotic aspects of narcissism had with ideological attitudes were mediated by social worldviews . The assertive/extraverted and antagonistic/disagreeable aspects of narcissism had similar associations with the competitive social worldview which, in turn, mediated their associations with certain ideological attitudes. In contrast, social worldviews did not mediate the tendency for vulnerable/neurotic narcissism to be characterized by the rejection of right-wing ideological attitudes and the endorsement of left-wing ideological attitudes. These results suggest that these aspects of narcissism diverged in their associations with ideological attitudes and that the competitive social worldview played an important role in the associations that the assertive/extraverted and antagonistic/disagreeable aspects of narcissism had with ideological attitudes.

TI  - A three-variables cokriging method to estimate bare-surface soil moisture using multi-temporal, VV-polarization synthetic-aperture radar data
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A cokriging model using three variables is developed to estimate bare-surface soil moisture content based on multi-temporal synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data. This model utilizes cross-semivariogram function to take into account spatially varied correlation among multiple variables. Here, five sentinel-1 SAR scenes were acquired on different dates using the interferometric wide-swath (IW) mode and a mean incidence angle of 39.02 degrees to build the backscatter temporal-ratio in VV polarization. This algorithm is generally based on the assumption of contributions of soil moisture and surface roughness to the backscattering coefficient under the given radar configurations. In this study, soil moisture is the target variable, and the surface roughness and backscatter temporal-ratio in VV polarization are the auxiliary variables. A cross-semivariogram relationship is formulated among those three spatial variables; then ordinary cokriging is used, based on that cross-semivariogram formula, to estimate the spatial distribution of bare soil moisture content. The root mean square error (RMSE) of soil-moisture retrieval ranges from 2.62 to 2.66 vol%. The new empirical model described in this paper will provide new insights into the study of soil environments.

TI  - Mapping spatio-temporal dynamics of main water parameters and understanding their relationships with driving factors using GF-1 images in a clear reservoir
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to eutrophication and water quality deterioration in clear reservoirs, it is necessary to monitor and manage the main water parameters: concentration of total phosphorus (C-TP), chemical oxygen demand (C-COD), chlorophyll-a (C-Chla), total suspended matter (C-TSM), and Secchi disk depth (SDD). Five random forest (RF) models are developed to estimate these parameters in Xin'anjiang Reservoir, which is a clear drinking water resource in Zhejiang, China. Then, the spatio-temporal distributions of the parameters over 7 years (2013-2019) are mapped using GaoFen-1 (GF-1) images and the relationships with driving factors are analyzed. Our study demonstrates that the parameters' distributions exhibited a significant spatio-temporal difference in Xin'anjiang Reservoir. Spatially, relatively high C-TP, C-COD, C-Chla, and C(TSM)but low SDD appear in riverine areas, showing strong evidence of impact from the incoming rivers. Temporally, C(Chla)and C(TSM)reached high values in summer and winter, whereas SDD and C(TP)were higher in the summer and autumn, respectively. In contrast, no significant seasonal variations of C(COD)could be observed. This may be why C(COD)is not sensitive to hydrological or meteorological factors. However, precipitation had a significant impact on C-Chla, C-TP, SDD, and C(TSM)in riverine areas, though these parameters were less sensitive to meteorological factors. Moreover, the geomorphology of the reservoir and anthropogenic interference (e.g., tourism activities) also have a significant impact on the water quality parameters. This study demonstrates that coupling long-term GF-1 images and RF models could provide strong evidence and new insights to understand long-term dynamics in water quality and therefore support the development of corresponding management strategies for freshwater reservoirs.

TI  - Modeling permafrost distribution over the river basins of Mongolia using remote sensing and analytical approaches
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of permafrost and associated mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) and active layer thickness (ALT) are crucial data for hydrological studies. In this paper, we present the current state of knowledge on the spatial distribution of the permafrost properties of 29 river basins in Mongolia. The MAGT and ALT values are estimated by applying TTOP and Kudryavtsev methods. The main input of both methods is the spatially distributed surface temperature. We used the 8-day land surface temperature (LST) data from the day- and night-time Aqua and Terra images of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The gaps of the MODIS LST data were filled by spatial interpolation. Next, an LST model was developed based on 34 observational borehole data using a panel regression analysis (Baltagi, Econometric analysis of panel data, 3 edn, Wiley, New York, 2005). The model was applied for the whole country and covered the period from August 2012 to August 2013. The results show that the permafrost covers 26.3% of the country. The average MAGT and ALT for the permafrost region is - 1.6 degrees C and 3.1 m, respectively. The MAGT above -2 degrees C (warm permafrost) covers approximately 67% of the total permafrost area. The permafrost area and distribution in cold and warm permafrost varies highly over the country, in particular in regions where the river network is highly developed. High surface temperatures associated with climate change would result in changes of permafrost conditions, and, thus, would impact the surface water availability in these regions. The data on permafrost conditions presented in this paper can be used for further research on changes in the hydrological conditions of Mongolia.

TI  - Declining human pressure and opportunities for rewilding in the steppes of Eurasia
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Large and ecologically functioning steppe complexes have been lost historically across the globe, but recent land-use changes may allow the reversal of this trend in some regions. We aimed to develop and map indicators of changing human influence using satellite imagery and historical maps, and to use these indicators to identify areas for broad-scale steppe rewilding. Location Eurasian steppes of Kazakhstan. Methods We mapped decreasing human influence indicated by cropland abandonment, declining grazing pressure and rural outmigration in the steppes of northern Kazakhstan. We did this by processing similar to 5,500 Landsat scenes to map changes in cropland between 1990 and 2015, and by digitizing Soviet topographic maps and examining recent high-resolution satellite imagery to assess the degree of abandonment of >2,000 settlements and >1,300 livestock stations. We combined this information into ahuman influence index(HI), mapped changes in HI to highlight where rewilding might take place and assessed how this affected the connectivity of steppe habitat. Results Across our study area, about 6.2 million ha of cropland were abandoned (30.5%), 14% of all settlements were fully and 81% partly abandoned, and 76% of livestock stations were completely dismantled between 1990 and 2015, suggesting substantially decreasing human pressure across vast areas. This resulted in increased connectivity of steppe habitat. Main conclusions The steppes of Eurasia are experiencing massively declining human influence, suggesting large-scale passive rewilding is taking place. Many of these areas are now important for the connectivity of the wider steppe landscape and can provide habitat for endangered megafauna such as the critically endangered saiga antelope. Yet, this window of opportunity may soon close, as recultivation of abandoned cropland is gaining momentum. Our aggregate human influence index captures key components of rewilding and can help to devise strategies for fostering large, connected networks of protected areas in the steppe.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing scholarly interest in monitoring and assessment of the impacts of land use and land cover changes (LULCC) on the environment. Recent technological developments and tools of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) facilitate the researches on this interest. This research aims at monitoring LULCC in Bandirma, Turkey over 30 years. This research utilizes GIS and RS techniques. Landsat satellite images of the years 1987, 2003, and 2019 are used in supervised classification methods with the maximum likelihood technique. The classified images show artificial surfaces, agricultural areas, forests, wetlands, and water bodies based on the first level classes of the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) land cover legend. Accuracy assessment is performed both before and after the correction process by using ArcGIS (10.6 Edition) software. The final overall Kappa values are above 0.95 for 3 years. These images are compared by using the Land Change Modeler tool of IDRISI (Selva Edition) software. The results represent that forest areas are increased and that wetlands are decreased in both 1987-2003 and 2003-2019 periods. Agricultural lands are decreased in the later period. Comparison maps demonstrate that land change from agricultural to artificial occurs (i) around existing settlements; (ii) along transportation axes; and (iii) in the locations of large urban land uses such as industrial areas, mines, and wind energy plants. The land change trend analysis shows that change from agricultural to artificial is the largest in the middle and southeastern parts of the area neighboring the Manyas Lake Ramsar conservation site.

TI  - Jarosite distribution maps based on the Sentinel-2 image band calculations and jarosite abundance analyses in the Bor mining area, Serbia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine the contamination caused by the waste generated in the historical Bor mining area and to present a sustainable environmental impact assessment method, the distribution of mine waste in the nearby riverbed is presented using remote sensing techniques and field observations. It is known that the existence of jarosite represents the presence of mine waste, and the reflection spectrum of jarosite exhibits an absorption band around 920 nm. Therefore, we use two multispectral Sentinel-2 images to determine a method to measure the amount of jarosite present. Furthermore, the amount of jarosite is evaluated by comparing X-ray powder diffraction analysis results of the collected ground-surface material samples and the normalized difference surface index (NDSI) values obtained from the Sentinel-2 band calculation. The results indicate that jarosite is distributed along the mining areas and the rivers downstream of the mine. Sediments containing jarosite have formed especially at the confluence of the rivers. From this survey result, it is possible to understand the overall spatial distribution of mine waste including jarosite around the mine, and it is concerned with the local situation. Therefore, the data of this research will be useful for future environmental restoration scenarios.

TI  - Blasphemy in an Age of Corroding Secularity
T2  - LAW AND CRITIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - 'Sacred' may be defined in various ways, depending on one's worldview. In a pluralistic society, a single perspective from which to decide what is sacred seems absent. Yet certain elements are taken to be sacred such that they transcend individual worldviews. Their inviolability entails blasphemy laws, where 'blasphemy' extends beyond what is traditionally considered religious, since 'religion' itself is not clearly demarcated either. The interests of the sacred may be protected by blasphemy laws, but the downside of such laws is that the freedom of expression is compromised. A balanced view is necessary to accommodate these conflicting interests.

TI  - Detection of <i>Campylobacter</i> species in different types of samples from dairy farms
T2  - VETERINARY RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Livestock, domestic pets and wildlife can be intestinal carriers of thermotolerant Campylobacter species. These reservoirs can in turn contaminate the environment and food products, thus creating pathways to campylobacteriosis in human beings. The purposes of this study were to investigate sampling strategies applied for surveillance of Campylobacter on dairy cattle farms and to identify the presence and species of Campylobacter in different age groups.Methods Boot sock and faecal samples were collected from five dairy herds from three age groups-cows, heifers and calves younger than 12 months-and from milk filters.Results Campylobacter species were isolated in 152 of 250 samples, of which 93 isolates were identified as C jejuni, 51 as C hyointestinalis, two as C lari and one as C coli, whereas five isolates could not be identified to species level. Campylobacter species were isolated from 86 of 110 faecal samples, 60 of 97 sock samples and six of 43 milk filter samples.Conclusion Faecal samples were the optimal sample type for detection of Campylobacter on dairy farms. However, taking multiple types of samples could be recommended in order to optimise the recovery rate and variety of Campylobacter species detected when investigating the presence of Campylobacter on dairy farms.

TI  - Impact of land use and land cover changes on landscape structure in the dry lands of Southern Africa: a case of the Zambezi Region, Namibia
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study evaluated patterns of land use and land cover (LULC) change in the Zambezi Region, Namibia between 1984 and 2010 using geospatial tools. Spatio-temporal dynamics of LULC changes were quantified using the post classification change detection method. The images were classified into five land use and land cover classes: forest land, shrub land, bare land, crop/grass land and other land. Landscape metrics were calculated using Fragstats to understand the landscape patterns and structural integrity of the landscape. The results showed that political transition (before and after independence) has resulted in dramatic decreases in patch density and increases in the interspersion and juxtaposition index values. The general pattern of LULC showed that the communal area compared to protected area became structurally diverse and ecologically more fragmented from 1984 to 2010. This study provides a foundation and baseline data demonstrating LULC alteration and landscape context suitable for monitoring future changes of protected and communal areas. Our approach is a novel way to assess the drivers and patterns of LULC under different land tenure types for natural resources conservation and sustainable land management in the dry lands of Southern Africa.

TI  - Geomorphic and paleoseismological evidence of active Kachchh Mainland Fault, Kachchh, India
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work pertains to the stratigraphic evidences found during paleoseismic investigations on the trench walls opened across the Kachchh Mainland Fault (KMF). High-resolution satellite (CARTOSAT-1 DEM) data is used for mapping fault traces and carried out paleoseismic studies to identify paleo-earthquakes. We undertook geomorphological and paleoseismological investigations along the central segment of the KMF zone with the aim of estimating long-term slip rate and recurrence interval of strong earthquakes. Two N-S trenches were excavated across the E-W striking branches of the KMF, named as KMF-1 and KMF-2, revealing that the KMF is dipping towards the north. Detailed studies of the trench walls and optical dating of event horizons have confirmed four earthquakes occurred in the KMF zone between 5600 and 1000 years. The earthquake event I occurred between 5000 and 5500 years; event II occurred between 4000 and 4600 years. The event III occurred between 2000 and 2900 years, and the event IV occurred between 1023 and 1259 AD and 02 BC to 427 AD. Our studies further indicate that the central KMF zone is probably undergoing a quiescent period of similar to 1000 years accumulating the stress in the system to generate a large earthquake. The uplifted and truncated fluvial strath terrace deposits resulting from the Holocene displacements are preserved along the hanging wall block of the KMF. Dividing the elevation of the bedrock strath by their ages yields estimates of the vertical uplift rate of 0.37 to 1.48 mm/year of the hanging wall block of central KMF. With the help of displaced sedimentary units and optical ages, we estimated an average slip rate of 0.28 mm/year and uplift rate of 0.13 mm/year along KMF-1 over an interval of 1800-4000 years. However, the estimated slip rate along KMF-2 is 0.30 mm/year and the observed uplift rate is 0.17 mm/year. The results obtained from the trench investigations along the KMF not only help in understanding the dynamics of KMF but also aid seismic hazard evaluation in the Western Peninsular India.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial data play a key role in the preparation of mine plan, lease boundary fixing and volume calculation of minerals in the mine. The conventional practice proposed by Indian Bureau of Mine is using differential global positioning system (DGPS), CartoSAT/LISS IV satellite imagery and cadastral maps to provide lease boundary fixing, digital elevation model of mine and rectified cadastral map. Most of the mine has steep terrain which is difficult to survey using DGPS/total station, and it involves human risks. The temporal resolution of the satellite, cost and time required to procure the satellite imagery is high. The increasing affordability of civilian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), aerial data acquisition is easy in any topography, time-saving and less cost compared to traditional survey technique like total station and DGPS. The main aim of this paper is to incorporate the proposed workflow to generate the high accurate geospatial data for Indian Mines through the integration of UAV and traditional survey technique. Based on the proposed workflow, UAV-based survey conducted on a iron ore mine and the output geodata were generated. The study discussed UAV geodata-based analytical technique to identify the encroachment, slope unstable area of mine, water disposal route and volume of the stockpile. This helps to reduce the violations in terms of quantity and area, provide a better decision support system to the lease of the mine and increase the revenue of the government.

TI  - Examination of heavy flooding over the desert state of Rajasthan in India
T2  - WEATHER
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple days with periods of torrential rain in Rajasthan (an arid state of India) during July and August 2019 resulted in extreme flooding in several districts, causing heavy damage to lives and property. The research described in this short communication examines this flood event using observations from satellite data. Baran, Bhilwara, Pali, Jhalawar, Jodhpur, Kota, Udaipur, Dungarpur and Banswara districts of Rajasthan were severely affected. Banswara, Dungarpur, Pali, Bhilwara, Kota and Jhalawar districts of Rajasthan received a cumulative rainfall total in excess of 1000mm for July and August 2019. Peak precipitation was in excess of 300mm day(-1)on 15-16 August 2019 over some of these districts. Pali district recorded maximum rainfall rates in excess of 50mmh(-1)on 15th and 16th August at 0630 utcand 0500 utc, respectively. Over a few of the regions of these districts, rainfall totals were in excess of 150% of the normal during July-August 2019, resulting in flash flooding. We also report that severe flood events are on the rise in recent decades over Rajasthan. Therefore, a proper flood management strategy is required to combat the risk of future flood disasters.

TI  - Estimation of annual regional drought index considering the joint effects of climate and water budget for Krishna River basin, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) became one of the popular drought indices due to the consideration of difference between precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET), which represents the energy-based climatic water balance. Implementation of actual evapotranspiration (AET), which accounts for both water and energy-based climatic evaporative demand in drought characterization studies, is limited. This study proposes a meteorological drought index with the structure of theSPEIand actual evapotranspiration modeled with empirical formulations and remote sensing data integrated with surface energy models at annual scale. The proposed drought index imposes the effect of precipitation,PET, andAETusing operational meteorological data sets of precipitation and temperatures. The present study aimed to test how a drought index based onPETandPcan outperform with the inclusion ofAETat a river basin scale at 12-month scale. The proposed hypothesis was tested considering Krishna River basin, India, as a case study for which most of the basin is in arid climate. The performance of drought indices was compared using historical droughts in terms of severity, areal extent, frequency, and duration based on empiricalAETmodels along with satellite-based land surfaceETdata-based drought indices. The proposedAET-based drought indices have effectively captured the historical drought years over the Krishna River basin. The empiricalAETformulation-based drought index was identified as a more reliable measure in the estimation of drought characteristics by comparing with satellite-based land surfaceAET-based drought index. TheAET-based drought indices were able to drive the areas into moderate, which or otherwise categorized under severe drought regions withPET-based drought indices. Inclusion ofAETin the drought characterization along with precipitation andPETcan drive the highly intensified drought events determined bySPEIinto moderate and less frequent droughts with short durations over a large river basin with arid climate.

TI  - Invasive paper wasp turns urban pollinator gardens into ecological traps for monarch butterfly larvae
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive species can be particularly disruptive when they intersect with organisms of conservation concern. Stabilizing the declining eastern migratory population of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) is projected to require extensive habitat restoration across multiple land use sectors including metropolitan areas. Numerous conservation programs encourage urban citizens to plant gardens with milkweeds, the obligate larval host plants of the monarch. Here, we show that predation by Polistes dominula, an invasive paper wasp that is particularly abundant in urban settings, can turn such sites into ecological traps for monarch larvae. Polistes dominula was the predominant paper wasp seen foraging in central Kentucky pollinator gardens. In 120 observed encounters with monarch larvae on milkweeds in gardens, most second to fourth instars were killed, whereas most fifth instars escaped by thrashing or dropping. The wasps bit and carried off second instars whole, whereas third and fourth instar kills were first gutted, then processed and carried away piecemeal. Predation on sentinel larvae was much higher in urban gardens than in rural settings. The wasps exploited ornamental butterfly "hibernation boxes" in pollinator gardens as nesting habitat. Polistes dominula is an under-recognized predator that may diminish the urban sector's contributions to monarch habitat restoration.

TI  - Classification of hyperspectral images by deep learning of spectral-spatial features
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Creating accurate land use and land cover maps using remote sensing images is one of the most important applications of remotely sensed data. Abundant spectral information in hyperspectral images (HSI) makes it possible to distinguish materials that would not be distinguishable by multi-spectral sensors. Spectral and spatial information from HSI is of primary importance for image classification. In this study, a hybrid stacked autoencoder (SAE) architecture and support vector machine (SVM) classifier was constructed to classify the HSI. The SAE architecture is constituted by stacking a multiple autoencoder (AE) deep learning network that consists in the encoder and decoder process. Spatial features in a neighbor region extracted from the principal component analysis (PCA) and the texture feature extracted from the gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) were fed into the classifier. It was found that the best result was from the combination of GLCM texture feature, PCA spatial feature, and spectral feature. Meanwhile, the representative features derived from SAE deep learning network were better than the original features. It reminded us that extracting the representative features from hyperspectral images is a key step of improving classification accuracy.

TI  - Does the Sentinel Lymph Node Sampling Alone Improve Quality of Life in Early Cervical Cancer Management?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective:In this subanalysis of the prospective randomized multicenter SENTICOL 2 study, we compared the quality of life (QoL), in two arms, in association with lower-limb consequences in women with early stage cervical cancer undergoing randomized sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling alone or SLN sampling and full pelvic lymphadenectomy. Methods:206 patients with an early stage cervical cancer and a negative SLN, were randomized. Every patient had a SLN detection based on a combination of radio-isotope (Nanocis (R)) and blue dye (Bleu Patente (R)) injections. One hundred and One patients, the "standard" group, had complete pelvic lymphadenectomy, 105 patients, the "SLN alone" group, had SLN biopsy without lymphadenectomy. At each visit (V0: preoperative, V1: 1 month, V2: 3 months and V3: 6 months following surgery) the patients completed a Short Form Health Survey (SF36) questionnaire and another questionnaire related to leg lymphedema. SF36 scores variations (compared to the baseline values) were assessed with a standard analysis and by an evaluation of the area under the curve (AUC). Several lower-limb circumferences and signs were also determined. Results:General characteristics of the patients were well-balanced between groups. Physical function and general health dimensions of the SF36 scale were significantly improved at V1 and V2 in the "SLN alone" group. Mental health was also statistically better in the "SLN alone" group at V2. Other dimensions were similar. The two groups had similar evaluation at V3. AUC of SF36 sub-scores was also in favor of the "SLN alone" arm, but the difference was not statistically significant. The analysis about the lymphedema of the legs showed a reduced (but not significant) risk in the "SLN alone" group for the top-of-thigh and the mid-thigh perimeters. Lymphedema symptoms reported by the patients were significantly less severe in the "SLN alone" group. Conclusion:Our study demonstrates a trend for a better quality of life and less severe leg heaviness and leg fatigue when a full pelvic lymphadenectomy is avoided.

T2  - SOCIAL COMPASS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fervor, creativity and dynamism represent characteristic features of the Peruvian religious field (Catholic and Evangelical). Specialists consider it as corresponding to an enchanted worldview. Nonetheless, some of them, in particular Casanova and the Catholic hierarchy, have noticed signs of transformation and slowdown, which they consider a secularization process. This article aims to interpret those signs in context and show how they reveal a change in the relationship between faithful and religious institutions. Churches maintain their presence and their prestige and have a power which has been redefined in a weakened social and political environment in the process of transformation. However, they no longer structure the essential individual rhythms and community norms. Between the fervor very often out of institutional context and the confusions of spheres, a secularization process is not really adequate to reflect the religious transformations in process.

T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective:The role of pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is still debated in patients with N3 stage penile cancer. In Denmark this subgroup of patients is in general managed with an inguinal lymphadenectomy (ILND) and adjuvant chemoradiation and PLND is not offered as a standard. The objective of this study was to report treatment outcomes of this regimen and compare this with existing literature. Materials and methods:We retrospectively reviewed records of patients with pT1-T4, N3, M0 penile cancer diagnosed between 1st January 2010 and 31th December 2014 in Denmark and treated with curative intend. Results:21 patients were identified with a median follow up of 74 months (CI 54-94). Management of the penile lesion was local resection in 5 (23.8%), partial penectomy in 10 (47.6%), and total penectomy in 6 (28.6%) of patients. Regarding the most extensive lymph node (LN) surgery: 4 patients (23,8%) went directly to oncological treatment from sentinel node biopsy with no further LN dissection, 6 patients (28.6%) were treated with unilateral ILND, 10 patients (47.6%) with bilateral ILND and a single patient (4.8%) was treated with ILND and PLND. In the adjuvant setting patients were treated with external beam therapy of involved regions and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Median overall survival was 84 months (CI 0-176). The 5-year probability of surviving penile cancer was 57.1% (CI 36.0-78.3). Conclusion:Treatment with surgery and chemo-irradiation in this national cohort does not show inferior survival outcomes compared to historical cohorts.

TI  - Tracing and assessment of simultaneous dust storms in the cities of Ahvaz and Kermanshah in western Iran based on the new approach
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most important and relatively new natural disaster compared with others is the dust-storm phenomenon in today's world, which has been aggravated by rising drought and global warming. Studies on the phenomenon of dust have different aspects and characteristics. To study this phenomenon, the use of meteorological models such asHYSPLIT, as well as satellite images with high temporal resolution and storm detection in terms of intensity, etc., is necessary. In this research, modeling in HYSPLIT system with back trajectory analysis was performed at three levels of altitude to determine the direction of motion of suspended particles in the atmosphere and its source in the interval 48 h prior to the occurrence of twosimultaneousdust storm phenomena in destinations ofAhwazandKermanshahwith a new approach. The dust detection was done by analyzing MODIS images using the iTIIDI (Improved Thermal Infrared Integrated Dust Index) method along with bands different method to remove cloudy pixels by determination of an appropriate threshold in digital numbers. The comparison of the transmission trajectories of dust yielded by HYSPLIT model for two destinations and false color composite of detected dust in MODIS images demonstrated the same sources for the dust phenomenon at the time of the study. Subsequently, the hydrological parameters of the identified region as the source were also evaluated; all of these, reflected the region's ability to produce suspended particles. Generally, the primary sources of dust on the two cities of Ahvaz and Kermanshah were desert parts of the northern of Iraq, a region between latitudes 33.80 degrees N to 35.85 degrees N and longitudes 42.00 degrees E to 44.76 degrees E in Tigris and Euphrates alluvial plain.

TI  - The PROFOUND Database for evaluating vegetation models and simulating climate impacts on European forests
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Process-based vegetation models are widely used to predict local and global ecosystem dynamics and climate change impacts. Due to their complexity, they require careful parameterization and evaluation to ensure that projections are accurate and reliable. The PROFOUND Database (PROFOUND DB) provides a wide range of empirical data on European forests to calibrate and evaluate vegetation models that simulate climate impacts at the forest stand scale. A particular advantage of this database is its wide coverage of multiple data sources at different hierarchical and temporal scales, together with environmental driving data as well as the latest climate scenarios. Specifically, the PROFOUND DB provides general site descriptions, soil, climate, CO2, nitrogen deposition, tree and forest stand level, and remote sensing data for nine contrasting forest stands distributed across Europe. Moreover, for a subset of five sites, time series of carbon fluxes, atmospheric heat conduction and soil water are also available. The climate and nitrogen deposition data contain several datasets for the historic period and a wide range of future climate change scenarios following the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, RCP8.5). We also provide pre-industrial climate simulations that allow for model runs aimed at disentangling the contribution of climate change to observed forest productivity changes. The PROFOUND DB is available freely as a "SQLite" relational database or "ASCII" flat file version (at https://doi.org/10.5880/PIK.2020.006/; Reyer et al., 2020). The data policies of the individual contributing datasets are provided in the metadata of each data file. The PROFOUND DB can also be accessed via the ProfoundData R package (https://CRAN.R- project.org/package=ProfoundData; Silveyra Gonzalez et al., 2020), which provides basic functions to explore, plot and extract the data for model set-up, calibration and evaluation.

TI  - Comparison of the third-generation Japanese ocean flux data set J-OFURO3 with numerical simulations of Typhoon Dujuan (2015) traveling south of Okinawa
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Insufficient in situ observations in high winds make it difficult to verify climatological data sets and the results of tropical cyclone (TC) simulations. Reliable data sets are necessary for developing numerical models that predict TCs more accurately. This study attempted to compare the third-generation Japanese Ocean Flux Data Sets with Use of Remote-Sensing Observations (J-OFURO3) data, with TC simulations conducted by a 2 km mesh coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean model. This is a case study of Typhoon Dujuan (2015) and the area of approximately 20 & x30a;N, 130 & x30a;E, south of Okinawa, was selected. The comparison reveals that J-OFURO3 data are reliable for verifying the atmospheric and oceanic components of TC simulations with two different initial sea surface temperature (SST) conditions, although the blank area remains within the inner core area for air temperature, specific humidity, and latent heat flux owing to issues with the construction method. Simulated maximum surface wind speeds (MSWs) are significantly correlated with J-OFURO3 MSWs. The asymmetrical distribution of simulated surface wind speeds within the inner core area can be reproduced well in the J-OFURO3 data set. In terms of the oceanic response to the TC, TC-induced sea surface cooling was reproduced well in the J-OFURO3 data set and is consistent with the simulation results. Unlike simulated SST, simulated surface wind speeds, surface air temperature, and surface specific humidity are still inconsistent with the J-OFURO3 data, even when the J-OFURO3 SST is used as the initial condition. New algorithms, more satellite data used, and model improvement are expected in the future.

TI  - Unexpected rise of ozone in urban and rural areas, and sulfur dioxide in rural areas during the coronavirus city lockdown in Hangzhou, China: implications for air quality
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus named COVID-19, initially identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread rapidly at the global scale. Most countries have rapidly stopped almost all activities including industry, services and transportation of goods and people, thus decreasing air pollution in an unprecedented way, and providing a unique opportunity to study air pollutants. While satellite data have provided visual evidence for the global reduction in air pollution such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) worldwide, precise and quantitative information is missing at the local scale. Here we studied changes in particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), NO2, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O-3) at 10 urban sites in Hangzhou, a city of 7.03 million inhabitants, and at 1 rural site, before city lockdown, January 1-23, during city lockdown, January 24-February 15, and during resumption, February 16-28, in 2020. Results show that city lockdown induced a sharp decrease in PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO(2)concentrations at both urban and rural sites. The NO(2)decrease is explained by reduction in traffic emissions in the urban areas, and by lower regional transport in rural areas during lockdown, as expected. SO(2)concentrations decreased from 6.3 to 5.3 mu g m(-3)in the city, but increased surprisingly from 4.7 to 5.8 mu g m(-3)at the rural site: this increase is attributed both to higher coal consumption for heating and emissions from traditional fireworks of the Spring Eve and Lantern Festivals during lockdown. Unexpectedly, O(3)concentrations increased by 145% from 24.6 to 60.6 mu g m(-3)in the urban area, and from 42.0 to 62.9 mu g m(-3)in the rural area during the lockdown. This finding is explained by the weakening of chemical titration of O(3)by NO due to reductions of NO(x)fresh emissions during the non-photochemical reaction period from 20:00 PM to 9:00 AM (local time). During the lockdown, compared to the same period in 2019, the daily average concentrations in the city decreased by 42.7% for PM2.5, 47.9% for PM10, 28.6% for SO2, 22.3% for CO and 58.4% for NO2, which is obviously explained by the absence of city activities. Overall, we observed not only the expected reduction in some atmospheric pollutants (PM, SO2, CO, NO2), but also unexpected increases in SO(2)in the rural areas and of ozone (O-3) in both urban and rural areas, the latter being paradoxically due to the reduction in nitrogen oxide levels. In other words, the city lockdown has improved air quality by reducing PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2, but has also decreased air quality by augmenting O(3)and SO2.

TI  - Quantifying drought's influence on moist soil seed vegetation in California's Central Valley through remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - California's Central Valley, USA is a critical component of the Pacific Flyway despite loss of more than 90% of its wetlands. Moist soil seed (MSS) wetland plants are now produced by mimicking seasonal flooding in managed wetlands to provide an essential food resource for waterfowl. Managers need MSS plant area and productivity estimates to support waterfowl conservation, yet this remains unknown at the landscape scale. Also the effects of recent drought on MSS plants have not been quantified. We generated Landsat-derived estimates of extents and productivity (seed yield or its proxy, the green chlorophyll index) of major MSS plants including watergrass (Echinochloa crusgalli) and smartweed (Polygonumspp.) (WGSW), and swamp timothy (Crypsis schoenoides) (ST) in all Central Valley managed wetlands from 2007 to 2017. We tested the effects of water year, land ownership and region on plant area and productivity with a multifactor nested analysis of variance. For the San Joaquin Valley, we explored the association between water year and water supply, and we developed metrics to support management decisions. MSS plant area maps were based on a support vector machine classification of Landsat phenology metrics (2017 map overall accuracy: 89%). ST productivity maps were created with a linear regression model of seed yield (n = 68,R-2 = 0.53, normalized RMSE = 10.5%). The Central Valley-wide estimated area for ST in 2017 was 32,369 ha (29,845-34,893 ha 95% CI), and 13,012 ha (11,628-14,396 ha) for WGSW. Mean ST seed yield ranged from 577 kg/ha in the Delta Basin to 365 kg/ha in the San Joaquin Basin. WGSW area and ST seed yield decreased while ST area increased in critical drought years compared to normal water years (Scheffe's test,P < 0.05). Greatest ST area increases occurred in the Sacramento Valley (similar to 75%). Voluntary water deliveries increased in normal water years, and ST seed yield increased with water supply.Zscores of ST seed yield can be used to evaluate wetland performance and aid resource allocation decisions. Updated maps will support habitat monitoring, conservation planning and water management in future years, which are likely to face greater uncertainty in water availability with climate change.

TI  - Cognitive and social/emotional influences on adaptive functioning in children with FASD: Clinical and cultural considerations
T2  - CHILD NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is one of the leading causes of intellectual disability and learning difficulties around the world. Children with FASD often have extremely low adaptive behavior due to the severity of brain impairment, however there is limited understanding as to the important predictors of adaptive behavior. In a study of 39 children with FASD and 29 comparison children, we found that social cognition (specifically recognizing emotions) was the only significant independent predictor of teacher-rated adaptive functioning even after including IQ, executive functioning, and adverse childhood experiences into the model. In this current study, Maori (Indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand) were overrepresented; therefore, the research was supported by a strong partnership with Te Wahanga Hauora Maori (Maori Health Service). Aotearoa New Zealand's colonized history is recognized and findings are discussed with regard to both the psychological literature and a Te Ao Maori worldview.

TI  - Speed rate (SR) as a new dynamic index of melanoma behavior
T2  - PIGMENT CELL & MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanomas are skin tumors that show a variety of biological behavior. Some develop very fast and some other grow extremely slow, with metastasis appearing, eventually, many years after the diagnosis. The number of mitoses in primary melanoma has been related to a more aggressive tumor and may have a potential as predictive factor for cutaneous melanoma survival. However, tumor mitotic rate is a static measure and in multivariate analysis on tumor survival, it has scored less than other tumor characteristics. We tried to evolve tumor mitotic rate from a static parameter to a time-dependent one. Similar to the already described growth rate (GR), we propose the speed rate (SR). SR is defined as the ratio of tumor mitotic rate to time to melanoma development. A prospective series of 345 patients with melanoma was investigated for the role of SR as predictive factor for sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity and tumor progression. We calculated the best threshold for SR and GR to predict the risk of recurrence. Melanoma clinical and histological characteristics as well as GR were correlated in a multivariated analysis with SR. SR values >0.2 mitoses/month were associated with negative prognostic factors such as ulceration (82.8%), SLN positivity (80%), progression (82.8%), and death (85.7%). The association of GR > 0.3 mm/months and SR > 0.2 mitoses/month had a significant predictive value in terms of SLN positivity, progression, and recurrence-free survival. We propose SR as a new "dynamic" predictor of histological SLN positivity and melanoma recurrence risk. We think that he association with this new feature with GR may be helpful in improving the accuracy of predicted clinical outcome of patient especially with thin melanomas.

TI  - Optimization of the segmented Knothe function and its dynamic parameter calculation
T2  - ROCK AND SOIL MECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To solve the problem that the influence coefficient (c) of the dynamic prediction time of mining subsidence, the subsidence value (Wv) and the time point (tau) at the maximum ground subsidence speed are set as fixed values, these parameters were theoretically and experimentally analyzed using segmented Knothe function. Based on the theoretical knowledge of the probability integral method, the functions of these three parameters were deduced by considering time as the independent variable. Then, the segmented Knothe function was optimized, which is showing better generalization performance and prediction accuracy. The experimental results reveal that the optimized Knothe function eliminates the defect that c, rand FY, of the conventional one were set as fixed values, and compensates for the shortage in similar geological conditions were used to generate a fitted empirical formula. After comparing and analyzing the prediction results from the optimized and the conventional models, it was concluded that the predicted results in the optimization model remain within the time range of the measured maximum subsidence velocity. The maximum mean square error and relative mean error of the optimized model are 0.116 m and 3.8%, respectively, which are improved by 65.1% and 51.9% compared with the conventional model. It proves the superiority of this model.

TI  - The Devil's in the Details: Discrepancy Between Biopsy Thickness and Final Pathology in Acral Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose We hypothesized that initial biopsy may understage acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) and lead to undertreatment or incomplete staging. Understanding this possibility can potentially aid surgical planning and improve primary tumor staging. Methods A retrospective review of primary ALMs treated from 2000 to 2017 in the US Melanoma Consortium database was performed. We reviewed pathology characteristics of initial biopsy, final excision specimens, surgical margins, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Results We identified 418 primary ALMs (321 plantar, 34 palmar, 63 subungual) with initial biopsy and final pathology results. Median final thickness was 1.8 mm (range 0.0-19.0). There was a discrepancy between initial biopsy and final pathology thickness in 180 (43%) patients with a median difference of 1.6 mm (range 0.1-16.4). Final T category was increased in 132 patients (32%), including 47% of initially in situ, 32% of T1, 39% of T2, and 28% of T3 lesions. T category was more likely to be increased in subungual (46%) and palmar (38%) melanomas than plantar (28%,p = 0.01). Among patients upstaged to T2 or higher, 71% had <= 1-cm margins taken. Among the 27 patients upstaged to T1b or higher, 8 (30%) did not have a SLNB performed, resulting in incomplete initial staging. Conclusions In this large series of ALMs, final T category was frequently increased on final pathology. A high index of suspicion is necessary for lesions initially in situ or T1 and consideration should be given to performing additional punch biopsies, wider margin excisions, and/or SLNB.

TI  - Matting-based automatic and accurate cloud detection for multisource satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The matting technique can accurately detect the differences between the foreground and the background of images, but most of the existing matting algorithms need foreground and background labels in advance, which leads to obvious limitations in the processing of mass images. With matting technology introduced into cloud detection for multisource satellite images, an automatic and accurate cloud detection algorithm is proposed. First, the S-curve is used for the original image to enhance the contrast between the cloud and the background, then the gray visible image is binarized by the ensemble threshold methods and a preliminary binarized map is obtained by the voting strategy. On this basis, the connected regions are calculated and the centers of the connected regions are taken as the seed point, then the trimap based on the connected regions is automatically generated. Finally, the improved Laplacian matrix and the conjugate gradient algorithm are used to solve the alpha value to obtain accurate results of cloud detection. The proposed method is compared with learning-based and robust matting-based cloud detection algorithms. Objective and subjective experiments based on images from the Fengyun-2G meteorological satellite, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 show that this proposed method can detect multiple types of clouds better and exhibits higher accuracy.

TI  - Modeling Invasive Plant Species in Kenya's Northern Rangelands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Kenya is composed of diverse geographic regions and is heavily impacted by climatic variability. Habitat heterogeneity has led to a diverse number of plants and animals. Invasive species, however, threaten this biodiversity. This study mapped the current distribution ofAcacia reficiensandOpuntiaspp. using occurrence data, then applied a species distribution model to identify where suitable habitats occur under current and projected climatic scenarios under Representative Climate Pathways (R) 2.6 and 8.5. Occurrences of the two invasive plant species were sampled using an android-based application and a GPS (Global Positioning System) device. Predictor variables included: elevation, distance to streams and rivers, human population density, and vegetation indices (monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Indices (EVI) derived from MODIS products 1-km spatial resolution). The mean of 25 replicates was used in identifying suitable habitats. We evaluated model performance using the average test AUC, mean testing omission rate metrics, and mean regularized training gain. The predictive models for both species performed better than random chance (p< 0.05). Mean test AUC values of 0.96 and 0.97 forA. reficiensandOpuntiaspp. respectively, were achieved and their associated 95% confidence intervals showed the fitted models realized the high discriminative ability to differentiate optimal conditions for invasive plant species from random pseudo-absence points. The mean test AUC results forA. reficiens(0.97 +/- 0.02) andOpuntiaspp. (0.985 +/- 0.01) were regarded as high. The models yielded moderate test gain values of 2.4 and 2.7, respectively. The model predictions show the distributions ofA. reficiensandOpuntiaspp. may increase under future climatic scenarios; with current extents estimated at 339,000 and 183,000 ha, respectively, with projected future spread reaching 732,800 and 206,900 ha, respectively, by 2070. Data on mapping, monitoring, and assessment of the invasive species can provide governments with insight into how the poor and vulnerable people are affected by the loss and degradation of biodiversity and ecosystems due to the spread of such species. This information is key in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals 15 (SDG) of the UN, aimed at the protection, restoration, and promotion of sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Duration of Contagion of Foot-And-Mouth Disease Virus in Infected Live Pigs and Carcasses
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Data-driven modeling of incursions of high-consequence, transboundary pathogens of animals is a critical component of veterinary preparedness. However, simplifying assumptions and excessive use of proxy measures to compensate for gaps in available data may compromise modeled outcomes. The current investigation was prospectively designed to address two major gaps in current knowledge of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) pathogenesis in pigs: the end (duration) of the infectious period and the viability of FMDV in decaying carcasses. By serial exposure of sentinel groups of pigs to the same group of donor pigs infected by FMDV A24 Cruzeiro, it was demonstrated that infected pigs transmitted disease at 10 days post infection (dpi), but not at 15 dpi. Assuming a latent period of 1 day, this would result in a conservative estimate of an infectious duration of 9 days, which is considerably longer than suggested by a previous report from an experiment performed in cattle. Airborne contagion was diminished within two days of removal of infected pigs from isolation rooms. FMDV in muscle was inactivated within 7 days in carcasses stored at 4(o)C. By contrast, FMDV infectivity in vesicle epithelium harvested from intact carcasses stored under similar conditions remained remarkably high until the study termination at 11 weeks post mortem. The output from this study consists of experimentally determined data on contagion associated with FMDV-infected pigs. This information may be utilized to update parameterization of models used for foot-and-mouth disease outbreak simulations involving areas of substantial pig production.

TI  - Talking Circles: A Culturally Responsive Evaluation Practice
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EVALUATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Talking Circles are safe spaces where relationships are built, nurtured, reinforced, and sometimes healed; where norms and values are established; and where people connect intellectually, spiritually, and emotionally with other members of the Circle. The Circle can also be an evaluation method that increases voice, decreases invisibility, and does not privilege one worldview or version of reality over another. The purpose of this article is to describe how the Circle can be a culturally responsive evaluation practice for those evaluators wishing to build relationships, share power, elicit stakeholder voice, solve problems, and increase participants' capacity for program design, implementation, and evaluation. Circles can be used by both Indigenous and non-Indigenous evaluators. By offering the global evaluation community this concrete, practical, and culturally responsive approach, we open the door so that others can build on this work and offer additional insights as this practice is used, refined, and documented.

TI  - Cloud Detection and Parameter Inversion Using Multi-Directional Polarimetric Observations
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The directional polarimetric camera (DPC) aboard the GF-5 satellite is the first domestic space-born instrument with operational multi -spectral, multi -directional, and polarimetric observations. A series of algorithms used for DPC measurements were formulated to acquire cloud detection results, cloud thermodynamic phase distribution, and cloud optical thickness of the observed zones. The cloud detection results were derived from the reflectance at 670 and 865 nm, the geometric normalized polarized radiance was obtained at 190 nm, and the linear degree of polarization was obtained at 865 nm. The cloud thermodynamic phase was derived from the normalized polarized radiance at 865 nm; the cloud optical thickness was obtained from the reflectance at 670 and 865 nm and results of cloud thermodynamic phase. Because of the lack of Ll data of DPC, the algorithms were applied to POLDER data to validate their feasibility. Results indicated that the consistency of "cloudy judgment" and "clear judgment" was 93.3% and 92.9%, respectively. Further, the consistency of "water clouds, " "ice clouds, " and "mixed -phase clouds" was 87. 1%, 76. 6% and 22. 8%, respectively. The correlation coefficient of the optical thickness was 0.89, which demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed algorithms. The proposed algorithms can develop the operational cloud production of DPC.

TI  - Effects of Climate Variability on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the Gojeb River Catchment, Omo-Gibe Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation dynamics have been visibly influenced by climate variability. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been the most commonly used index in vegetation dynamics. The study was conducted to examine the effects of climatic variability (rainfall) on NDVI for the periods 1982-2015 in the Gojeb River Catchment (GRC), Omo-Gibe Basin, Ethiopia. The spatiotemporal trend in NDVI and rainfall time series was assessed using a Theil-Sen (Sen) slope and Mann-Kendall (MK) statistical significance test at a 95% confidence interval. Moreover, the residual trend analysis (RESTREND) method was used to investigate the effect of rainfall and human induction on vegetation degradation. The Sen's slope trend analysis and MK significant test indicated that the magnitude of annual NDVI and rainfall showed significant decrement and/or increment in various portions of the GRC. The concurrent decrement and/or increment of annual NDVI and rainfall distributions both spatially and temporarily could be attributed to the significant positive correlation of the monthly (RNDVI-RF = 0.189,P <= 0.001) and annual (RNDVI-RF = 0.637,P <= 0.001) NDVI with rainfall in almost all portions of the catchment. In the GRC, a strongly negative decrement and strong positive increment of NDVI could be derived by human-induced and rainfall variability, respectively. Accordingly, the significant NDVI decrement in the downstream portion and significant increment in the northern portion of the catchment could be attributed to human-induced vegetation degradation and the variability of rainfall, respectively. The dominance of a decreasing trend in the residuals at the pixel level for the NDVI from 1982, 1984, 2000, 2008 to 2012 indicates vegetation degradation. The strong upward trend in the residuals evident from 1983, 1991, 1998 to 2007 was indicative of vegetation improvements. In the GRC, the residuals may be derived from climatic variations (mainly rainfall) and human activities. The time lag between NDVI and climate factors (rainfall) varied mainly from two to three months. In the study catchment, since vegetation degradations are mainly caused by human induction and rainfall variability, integrated and sustainable landscape management and climate-smart agricultural practices could have paramount importance in reversing the degradation processes.

TI  - Evaluation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> forecast using chemical data assimilation in the WRF-Chem model: a novel initiative under the Ministry of Earth Sciences Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Air quality has become one of the most important environmental concerns for Delhi, India. In this perspective, we have developed a high-resolution air quality prediction system for Delhi based on chemical data assimilation in the chemical transport model Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). The data assimilation system was applied to improve the PM2.5 forecast via assimilation of MODIS aerosol optical depth retrievals using three-dimensional variational data analysis scheme. Near real-time MODIS fire count data were applied simultaneously to adjust the fire-emission inputs of chemical species before the assimilation cycle. Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from biomass burning, anthropogenic emissions, and CO inflow from the domain boundaries were tagged to understand the contribution of local and non-local emission sources. We achieved significant improvements for surface PM2.5 forecast with joint adjustment of initial conditions and fire emissions.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Is Prognostic in Thickest Melanoma Cases and Should Be Performed for Thick Melanomas
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is recommended for intermediate thickness melanoma, but for thick melanoma, guidelines are less definitive about the use of SLNB in this population. We present a study on thick melanoma evaluating for prognostic factors. Patients and Methods The Sentinel Lymph Node Working Group database was queried for thick (> 4 mm) melanoma cases that had a SLNB from 1993 to 2018. Clinicopathologic characteristics were correlated with SLN status and melanoma-specific survival (MSS). Results There were 1235 patients. Median follow-up was 28 months. Median thickness was 5.9 mm, with 956, 175, and 104 cases presenting thickness > 4-8, > 8-12, and > 12 mm, respectively. SLN metastases were seen in 439 of 1235 (35.5%) cases and in 33.9%, 40.6%, and 42.3% of melanomas > 4-8, > 8-12, and > 12 mm, respectively. In each thickness group, MSS was significantly worse for SLN-positive compared with SLN-negative cases (allP < 0.005). Multivariable analysis showed that SLN metastasis, male gender, increasing thickness, lymphovascular invasion, and microsatellitosis significantly predicted worse MSS for melanomas > 4-8 mm, with SLN metastasis showing the greatest risk (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.64-2.87,P < 0.0001). For melanomas > 8 mm, only SLN metastasis significantly predicted MSS (> 8-12 mm: HR 3.93, 95% CI 2.00-7.73,P < 0.0001; > 12 mm: HR 3.58, 95% CI 1.56-8.22,p < 0.0027). Conclusions Thick melanoma patients with SLN metastasis have significantly worse MSS compared with SLN-negative patients, even in the thickest cases, and SLN status is the most powerful and/or only predictor of MSS. Given these results, SLNB shows important prognostic value in this population and is indicated for clinically localized thick melanoma.

TI  - Diversifying Voice, Democratizing the News? A Content Analysis of Citizen News Sources in Spanish-language International Broadcasting
T2  - JOURNALISM STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores sourcing practices in three international broadcasters in Spanish: China's CGTN Espanol, Iran's HispanTV and Russia's RT. Often described as counter-hegemonic, in that the worldview they present is not in alignment with dominant Anglo-American media, these three State-sponsored TV channels have grown their presence globally in recent years, but remain largely understudied. Drawing on literature about non-elite sourcing, source functions and public diplomacy, we examine the degree to which citizen sources are featured in these three channels, and, when that happens, how these sources are used to advance the foreign policy objectives that inform the broadcasters' raison d'etre (i.e., promoting the interest of their home country while challenging the international status quo). To do so, we conducted a quantitative content analysis of news stories broadcast in 2014 and 2017 (N = 1,265). Our results show the use of non-elite sources is not ubiquitous but strategic, and is often linked to critical reporting of countries that are not political allies. We also present evidence that the practice is not equally common across broadcasters.

TI  - How changing fire management policies affect fire seasonality and livelihoods
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a long history of fire management in African savannas, but knowledge of historical and current use of fire is scarce in savanna-woodland biomes. This study explores past and present fire management practices and perceptions of the Khwe (former hunter-gatherers) and Mbukushu (agropastoralists) communities as well as government and non-government stakeholders in Bwabwata National Park in north-east Namibia. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were used in combination with satellite data (from 2000 to 2015), to investigate historical and current fire management dynamics. Results show that political dynamics in the region disrupted traditional fire practices, specifically a policy of fire suppression was initiated by colonial governments in 1888 and maintained during independence until 2005. Both the Khwe and Mbukushu communities use early season (i.e. between April and July) fires for diverse interrelated historical and current livelihood activities, and park management for managing late season fires. The Mbukushu community also use late season burns to prepare land for crops. In this study, we use a pyrogeographic framework to understand the human dimension of fires. This study reveals how today's fire management practices and policies, specifically the resurgence of early season burning are entrenched in the past. Understanding and acknowledging the social and cultural dynamics of fire, alongside participatory stakeholder engagement is critical for managing fires in the future.

TI  - Oncoplastic breast surgery combining partial mastectomy with a triangular skin resection and re-centralization of the nipple-areola
T2  - SURGERY TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - The treatment of early breast cancer using breast conservation therapy (BCT) commonly ensures local control and acceptable cosmetic results. We herein report a useful technique to obtain symmetry of the breast shape and a level inframammary line and nipple-areola, which achieved excellent results. Six Japanese patients with early breast cancer located on the upper area of the breast were enrolled into this study. A triangle-shaped area of skin was removed together with cancerous and healthy-surrounding breast tissue. Two crescents were designed and de-epithelialized in the directions of 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock. The width of the crescent was decided to be the same as a half or the length of the base of a triangle to be removed. After partial mastectomy, the inner and outer glandular flaps were horizontally sutured. The operations were simple to perform and were not associated with any postoperative complications. Oncoplastic breast surgery combining partial mastectomy with triangular skin resection and re-centralization of the nipple-areola was useful for patients with breast cancer on the upper quadrant area of non-ptotic breasts.

TI  - Sentinel headache as a warning symptom of ischemic stroke
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEADACHE AND PAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There are no previous controlled studies of sentinel headache in ischemic stroke. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the presence of such headache, its characteristics and possible risk factors as compared to a simultaneous control group. Methods Eligible patients (n = 550) had first-ever acute ischemic stroke with presence of new infarction onmagnetic resonanceimaging with diffusion-weighted imaging (n = 469) or on computed tomography (n = 81). As a control group we studied in parallel patients (n = 192) who were admitted to the emergency room without acute neurological deficits or serious neurological or somatic disorders. Consecutive patients with stroke and a simultaneous control group were extensively interviewed soon after admission using validated neurologist conducted semi-structured interview forms. Based on our previous study of sentinel headache in transient ischemic attacks we defined sentinel headache as a new type of headache or a previous kind of headache with altered characteristics (severe intensity, increased frequency, absence of effect of drugs) within seven days before stroke. Results Among 550 patients with stroke 94 patients (17.1%) had headache during seven days before stroke and 12 (6.2%) controls (p < 0.001; OR 3.9; 95% CI 1.7-5.8). Totally 81 patients (14.7%) had sentinel headache within the last week before stroke and one control. Attacks of arrythmia during seven days before stroke were significantly associated with sentinel headache (p = 0.04, OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.1-4.8). Conclusions A new type of headache and a previous kind of headache with altered characteristics during one week before stroke are significantly more prevalent than in controls. These headaches represent sentinel headaches. Sudden onset of such headaches should alarm about stroke.

TI  - Effect of aerosols on the macro- and micro-physical properties of warm clouds in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction between aerosols and clouds plays an important role in the climate system. There is still uncertainty about the influences of aerosols on the macro- and micro-physical properties of clouds in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The relationships between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the macro- and microphysical properties of warm clouds in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region were analyzed based on MODIS/Aqua data from 2007 to 2016. In addition, the ERA-Interim meteorological data was employed to investigate the relationship of AOD and cloud parameters under different meteorological conditions. The results showed that the variation of cloud droplet effective radius (CER) with AOD was in agreement with the Anti-Twomey effect, the main reason was that the increasing aerosol causes the water vapor competition effect among the cloud droplets, which makes the smaller cloud droplets evaporate. The multi-year average AOD was positively correlated with liquid water path (LWP). The relationship between AOD and cloud optical depth (COD) was quite different. When AOD was <0.4 or >0.8, COD increased with the increase of AOD, and when AOD was between 0.4 and 0.8, AOD and COD showed negative correlation. With the increment of AOD, cloud top pressure (CTP) also increased, which indicated that cloud top height decreased. When AOD was <0.3, cloud fraction (CF) was negatively correlated with AOD and conversely, positively correlated when AOD was >0.3. Furthermore, under most meteorological conditions, AOD was positively correlated with cloudmacro- andmicro-physical properties. Under the conditions of relative humidity ranged from 40% to 80%, there was a negative correlation between AOD and COD. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatial Changes in Glaciers Between 1965 and 2018 in Tirungkhad Watershed, Upper Sutlej Basin, Himachal Pradesh
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is an attempt to estimate spatial changes (area and length in the frontal area) in glaciers of Tirungkhad watershed in Upper Sutlej Basin. It also investigates the influence of topography on the changes in glaciers. High-resolution (spatial) Corona KH4A (1965), Landsat TM (1990) and Sentinel 2B (2018) imageries and Aster GDEM elevation data have been used in this study to estimate changes of the glaciers between 1965 and 2018. Total 41 glaciers with an area of 58.73 km(2)were mapped from Sentinel 2B imagery (2018). Due to cloud cover, 20 glaciers were selected for change calculation. During the period, 1965-2018, the glaciers have lost 1.95 +/- 1.06 km(2)or 5.58 +/- 3.16% (0.11 +/- 0.06%/year) of its total area. Average area loss rate was 0.037 +/- 0.020 km(2)/year during 1965-2018. The glacier area change showed almost uniform rate throughout the period 1965-2018 (- 0.038 +/- 0.053 km(2)/year during 1990-2018, and - 0.035 +/- 0.057 km(2)/year during 1965-1990). Average retreat rate of glaciers was 6.76 +/- 1.91 m/year during 1965-2018 (6.95 +/- 2.08 m/year during 1965-1990 and 6.60 +/- 1.74 m/year during 1990-2018). The topographic analysis showed that smaller glaciers had lost a higher percentage of area as compared to the larger glaciers.

TI  - Investigating the performance of sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 imagery in mapping shoreline changes
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Regular detection and timely monitoring of shoreline evolution are essentially needed in order to identify areas that require further investigation and protection. Possibilities for regular monitoring of shoreline changes are better facilitated now with high-frequency revisit times of Landsat-Sentinel-2 virtual constellation. Accordingly, this study aimed at investigating the performance of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A satellite imagery in mapping shoreline changes. The specific objectives were to 1) create reference data of shoreline erosion, accretion and seafilling using very high spatial resolution data, 2) compare the results of shoreline changes by using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A imagery respectively, and 3) complete the inventory of shoreline changes between 1962 and 2016. A Quickbird panchromatic imagery (0.6 m) of 2010 was employed in combination with aerial photography (0.5 m) from 1962 for the generation of reference data using a traditional photo-interpretation method. Then, geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) was employed to map changes in the shoreline between 1962 (i.e., reference shoreline) and 2016 using Sentinel-2A (10 m) and Landsat 8 panchromatic band (15 m) imagery, consecutively. The use of Sentinel-2A image provided slightly better accuracy results when compared with those from the Landsat 8 image. Accordingly, an inventory of Lebanese shoreline evolution between 1962 and 2016 was completed using the Sentinel-2A classification results. The combined use of Landsat-Sentinel-2 imagery is expected to generate reliable data records for continuous monitoring of shoreline changes.

TI  - A first comparison of TROPOMI aerosol layer height (ALH) to CALIOP data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) level-2 aerosol layer height (ALH) product has now been released to the general public. This product is retrieved using TROPOMI's measurements of the oxygen A-band, radiative transfer model (RTM) calculations augmented by neural networks and an iterative optimal estimation technique. The TROPOMI ALH product will deliver ALH estimates over cloud-free scenes over the ocean and land that contain aerosols above a certain threshold of the measured UV aerosol index (UVAI) in the ultraviolet region. This paper provides background for the ALH product and explores its quality by comparing ALH estimates to similar quantities derived from spaceborne lidars observing the same scene. The spaceborne lidar chosen for this study is the Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) on the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) mission, which flies in formation with NASA's A-train constellation since 2006 and is a proven source of data for studying ALHs. The influence of the surface and clouds is discussed, and the aspects of the TROPOMI ALH algorithm that will require future development efforts are highlighted.A case-by-case analysis of the data from the four selected cases (mostly around the Saharan region with approximately 800 co-located TROPOMI pixels and CALIOP profiles in June and December 2018) shows that ALHs retrieved from TROPOMI using the operational Sentinel-5 Precursor Level-2 ALH algorithm is lower than CALIOP aerosol extinction heights by approximately 0.5 km. Looking at data beyond these cases, it is clear that there is a significant difference when it comes to retrievals over land, where these differences can easily go over 1 km on average.

TI  - Multi-disciplinary ore deposit exploration in Sonqor, northwest Iran
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-disciplinary exploration methods are used to explore for possible ore deposits in the Sonqor area, Iran, which lies within the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone, and contains significant iron, copper and gold mineralisation. Hydrothermal alteration was mapped using field, remotely sensed, geophysical and geochemical data as well as Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus, and two Advanced Space Borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer images. Image processing techniques, viz band ratio, principal component analysis (PCA), and various spectral analysis methods were applied to map the distribution of hydrothermally altered rocks (geochemical halos) associated with porphyry (e.g. Cu-Au) mineralisation. The geochemical halos enabled vectoring to mineralised zones with mapping of advance argillic, argillic, carbonates, Fe-oxides, phyllic, propylitic and silicification using minerals such as alunite (K/Na), muscovite, kaolinite, illite, chlorite, goethite, hematite, jarosite, calcite and silica/quartz. The band ratio combination of sensors for mapping altered areas show promising results, similar to other more advanced methods. PCA exposed variations in the spatial distribution of more hydroxyl-based minerals like alunite/jarosite, whereas the geophysical magnetic survey identified the main lineaments, possible faults and magmatic intrusion boundaries. While geochemical methods show the potential occurrence of elements like Fe, Au and Fe-bearing Ti in the southeast and southern parts, and skarn-type anomalies in the northern part of Sonqor, leaking of specific geochemical elements (such as Fe, Au and Fe-bearing Ti) produce false anomalies. Copper, Pb and Zn anomalies in the central part show the possibility of sulfide-based mineralisation.

TI  - Cartographic Design as Visual Storytelling: Synthesis and Review of Map-Based Narratives, Genres, and Tropes
T2  - CARTOGRAPHIC JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I review considerations and techniques for approaching cartographic design as visual storytelling. Stories, like maps, are a method for documenting and explaining, for meaningfully abstracting our experiences, for communicating and sharing, and for asserting a particular worldview. I argue that visual storytelling offers an entry point forhybridizationin cartography, uniting technology with praxis, product with process, and design with critique while opening rich new avenues for transdisciplinary research and design. I begin by introducing influences on map-based visual storytelling and review ten recurring themes that make visual storytelling different from traditional perspectives on cartographic design. I then offer three of potentially many ways to articulate and organize the design space for map-based visual storytelling: foundationalnarrativeelements and their adaptation to geographic phenomena and processes, visual storytellinggenresdelineating different story experiences, and visual storytellingtropesused to advance narratives across text, maps, images, and other multimedia. I conclude with a call for future research on visual storytelling in cartography, including visual design, visual ethics, and visual literacy.

TI  - Remotely sensed drought evaluation over rice cultivated areas in Cambodia during 2000 to 2019
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the costliest natural disasters, effecting many aspects of human livelihoods. This study assessed drought conditions in Cambodia from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data during 2000 to 2019 using the Vegetation Health Index. The results verified with the satellite soil moisture indicated close agreement between these two datasets. The drought areas were concentrated in the country's central plains, with the larger drought area particularly observed for 2016. Roughly 31.3% of rice-growing area was affected by severe drought during the dry season in this abnormal year (2016), compared to that of 26.1% in a normal year (2017). The results of drought probability calculated for the entire study period indicated that 63 and 17 districts were associated with droughts in the dry and wet seasons, respectively. This study demonstrated the potential application of MODIS data for decadal drought assessment over rice cultivated areas, which was important for crop and water management.

TI  - Enhancing community engagement in disaster early warning system in Aceh, Indonesia: opportunities and challenges
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Engaging communities in Early Warning Systems (EWSs) is crucial to save lives, reduce injuries, and protect the environment due to disaster events. Yet, community input is not always commonly sought in many disaster policy development and implementation processes. Following the major disaster event of 2004 that had large consequences for multiple countries, the concept of people-centred EWSs was promulgated to encourage Community Engagement (CE) in EWSs. Aceh, Indonesia was one of the regions most devastated by the 2004 event, and despite the progress that has been achieved in disaster risk management and prevention and preparedness including the EWS design and operation following this event, improving CE in the system remains an important challenge. This study investigates the opportunities and challenges for enhancing CE in the EWS in Aceh by exploring current social systems, governance arrangements, donor funded projects and community perspectives using in-depth interviews, document reviews, and focus group discussions. The findings identify that there is inadequate CE across all four elements of a people-centred EWS. To enhance such CE in the EWS, numerous opportunities were identified: improved recognition of community figures, promotingadatand sharia practices in enhancing community involvement; and utility ofmeunasahsand mosques as important physical places for engaging the community in the system. Despite these opportunities, various barriers were identified to improve CE including insufficient integration of CE in the formal EWS contingency plans or the existing EWS SOP; the erosion ofmeuserayapractices; inadequate funds to maintain CE programs; insufficient sustained integration of CE into government disaster policy processes; lack of community ownership of CE programs; and a fatalistic worldview of disasters. Various recommendations are provided to enhance CE in the EWS in Aceh. This is a critical requirement towards reducing harm for future hazard events.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The WorldView-2 high spatial resolution satellite with eight multispectral imaging bands is ideally suited for extracting built-up areas (BUs) from remote sensing images. In this study, an object-based automatic multi-index BUs extraction method was developed. First, several indices, including BUs extraction index (NBEIr-c), vegetation extraction index(NDVInir2-r) and water extraction index (NDWI (b-nir1)), were developed to obtain the BUs, vegetation and water maps, and then the fractional-order Darwinian particle swarm optimization (FODPSO) algorithm was employed to automatically segment the multi-index images and obtained BUs, water, vegetation and bare soil (BS) information. Finally, the extracted BUs results were optimized via an object-based analysis method and the results were compared with those of two other relevant indices, which confirmed the proposed method had a higher accuracy and exhibited higher performance when separating the BS from the BUs.

TI  - Spatiotemporal tracking of carbon emissions and uptake using time series analysis of Landsat data: A spatially explicit carbon bookkeeping model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing terrestrial carbon emissions to the atmosphere requires accuratemeasuring, reporting and verification of land surface activities that emit or sequester carbon. Many carbon accounting practices in use today provide only regionally aggregated estimates and neglect the spatial variation of pre-disturbance forest conditions and post-disturbance land cover dynamics. Here, we present a spatially explicit carbon bookkeeping model that utilizes a high-resolution map of aboveground biomass and land cover dynamics derived from time series analysis of Landsat data. The model produces estimates of carbon emissions/uptake with model uncertainty at Landsat resolution. In a case study of the Colombian Amazon, an area of 47 million ha, the model estimated total emissions of 3.97 +/- 0.71 Tg C yr(-1) and uptake by regenerating forests of 1.11 +/- 0.23 Tg C yr(-1) 2001-2015, with an additional 45.1 +/- 7.99 Tg of carbon remaining in the form of woody products, decomposing slash and charcoal at the end of 2015 (estimates provided with +/- 95% confidence intervals). Total emissions attributed to the study period (including carbon not yet released) is 6.97 +/- 1.24 Tg C yr(-1). The presented model is based on recent technological advancements in the field of remote sensing to achieve spatially explicit modeling of carbon emissions and uptake associated with land surface changes and post-disturbance landscapes that is compliant with international reporting criteria.

TI  - Vegetation biomass and carbon stocks in the Parnaiba River Delta, NE Brazil
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems are considered environments with great potential for carbon storage. Given the difficulties in quantifying biomass, allometric equations and remote sensing have become fundamental tools in the studies of quantification of vegetation biomass and carbon stocks. Thus, the objective of this study is to quantify and estimate the spatial distribution of vegetation biomass and to quantify the carbon stock of the Parnaiba River Delta vegetation. The study was carried out in part of theParnaiba River Delta Environmental Protection Areaand in theParnaiba River Delta Marine Extractive Reserve, in NE Brazil, in five spots within distinct vegetation types: psammophile pioneer vegetation, dune subevergreen vegetation, mangrove evergreen vegetation, floodplain vegetation and vegetation associated with carnaubals. At 26 collection points, 10 x 20 m plots were marked, in which the diameter at breast height and height of all individuals were measured. The collected data were used in allometric equations for vegetation biomass estimates and these values were converted into carbon stocks. The spatial distribution of aboveground vegetation biomass (AGB) was also estimated by remote sensing, where we extracted and selected spectral variables obtained from Landsat-8 OLI sensor images, on three different dates. Prediction models were calculated by multiple linear regression analysis. It was observed that the mangrove evergreen vegetation obtained higher vegetation biomass and carbon stock than the others. The models obtained through remote sensing that provided the best estimates of AGB were those of November 12th, 2016 (EAM = 6.84; RMSE = 47.89 Mg ha(-1); R-2 = 0.72) and November 28th, 2016 (EAM = 9.63; RMSE = 34.67 Mg ha(-1); R-2 = 0.58).

AB  - The pre-monsoon cyclone Viyaru in the Bay of Bengal during May 2013 traversed a long track from 5 degrees N to 22 degrees N over 7 days with basin-wide response, which was well captured by the time series observations of OMNI buoy network along with satellite data. The differential upper ocean characteristics and its variable response reveal that vertical mixing override horizontal advection during cyclone passage. This study provides insight into the variability in wave spectra, differential response on either side of the track and presence of cold core eddy combined with a thick barrier layer in modulating the upper ocean response.

TI  - Impact of upstream landslide on perialpine lake ecosystem: An assessment using multi-temporal satellite data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring freshwater and wetland systems and their response to stressors of natural or anthropogenic origin is critical for ecosystem conservation.A multi-temporal set of 87 images, acquired by Sentinel-2 satellites over three years (2016-2018), provided quantitative information for assessing the temporal evolution of key ecosystem variables in the perialpine Lake Mezzola (northern Italy), which has suffered from the impacts of a massive landslide that took place upstream of the lake basin in summer 2017.Sentinel-2 derived products revealed an increase in lake turbidity triggered by the landslide that amounted to twice the average values scored in the years preceding and following the event. Hotspots of turbidity within the lake were in particular highlighted. Moreover, both submerged and riparian vegetation showed harmful impacts due to sediment deposition. A partial loss of submerged macrophyte cover was found, with delayed growth and a possible community shift in favor of species adapted to inorganic substrates. Satellite-derived seasonal dynamics showed that exceptional sediment load can overwrite climatic factors in controlling phenology of riparian reed beds, resulting in two consecutive years with shorter than normal growing season and roughly 20% drop in productivity, according to spectral proxies. Compared to 2016, senescence came earlier by around 20 days on average in 2017 season, and green-up was delayed by up to 50 days (20 days, on average) in 2018, following the landslide.The approach presented could be easily implemented for continuous monitoring of similar ecosystems subject to external pressures with periods of high sediment loads.

TI  - Angle Factor On-Orbit Calibration Method of Solar Diffuser Reflectance Degradation Monitor in Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar diffuser reflectance degradation monitor (SDRDM) is used to gain the reflectance of a solar diffuser (SD). The transmittance of the sun view port and the relative bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of the solar diffuser vary with the angle. Therefore, the SDRDM observation signals arc affected by the angle of the incident light. The effect factor is called the SDRDM angle factor (abbreviated as the angle factor). This study proposes a method for calculating the SDRDM angle factor using on-board data employed on the premise that the solar diffuser plate does not decay in the early orbit stage. The same solar angle ratio calculation is used, thereby verifying the stability of the solar diffuser reflector without discussing the angle factor. The angle factor is calculated and compared with laboratory measurements. Results show that the deviation between the calculated values and the measured values of the laboratory is less than 0.5%. The angle factor measured prior to the launch can be used to calculate the HRDF degradation factor of the SD.

TI  - Decreasing underwater ultraviolet radiation exposure strongly driven by increasing ultraviolet attenuation in lakes in eastern and southwest China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Underwater light attenuation plays an important role in modulating aquatic ecosystems and is considered a sentinel of climate change and human activity. However, knowledge of the long-term exposure of underwater ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in aquatic ecosystem is still very limited. We carried out extensive UVR measurements in different seasons in five lakes at different altitudes, collected long-term Secchi disk depth (SDD) data, developed the models between UVR diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) and SDD, and further assessed the long-term underwater UVR exposure. Observation results from five lakes including 259 samples showed large spatial variabilities of K-d(313) (UVB) from 0.83 to 5.91 m(-1) and K-d(340) (UVA) from 0.51 to 4.67 m(-1). Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficients were significantly correlated with K-d(313) and K-d(340). Thus, the effects of climate change and human activity on CDOM abundance, source and composition may significantly alter UVR attenuation in aquatic environments. The long-term underwater UVR exposure, which was estimated from significant positive correlations between 1/SDD and Kd(313) and Kd(340), and incident UVR, significantly decreased in Lake Fuxianhu, Lake Erhai, and Lake Qiandaohu. The regime shift from clear water state to turbid state in Lake Erhai around 2001-2003 dramatically decreased underwater UVR exposure. In conclusion, increasing UVR attenuation played a more important role in determining underwater UVR exposure than decreasing incident UVR with the relative contributions of 89.9% and 87.7% in Lake Fuxianhu, 98.0% and 97.7% in Lake Erhai, 94.4% and 92.5% in Lake Qiandaohu for UVB and UVA exposure, respectively. This is the first study to elucidate the long-term trend of underwater UVR exposure considering both increasing UVR attenuation and decreasing incident UVR. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Assessment of the radiation effect of aerosols on maize production in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the recent increases in atmosphere aerosol concentration, its impact on agriculture in China is of considerable concern for scientific community. In this study, the effects that aerosols have on radiation and consequently the production of maize in China were investigated from 2002 to 2014 using the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data, Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum radiative transfer (6S) model, and Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model. Ten stations in the maize planting areas including Beijing, Xianghe, Taihu, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hefei, Baotou, Lanzhou, Qinghaihu, and Xuzhou stations were selected. The results showed that the APSIM-maize model, which was further calibrated, was able to simulate the interactions between maize and the climatic constraints in the maize planting areas of China. Our results indicated that aerosols obviously reduced the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface during the maize growing season in China. We also found that the aerosols have negative effects on both biomass and yield of maize in China at ten stations. The average annual maize biomass during the maize growing season from 2002 to 2014 decreased by 23.70%. The average yield of maize from 2002 to 2014 decreased by 15.10%. However, the influence of aerosol on different varieties of maize varied. We found the aerosols had greater negative impacts on summer maize than on spring maize. For spring maize, the average biomass and yield from 2002 to 2014 decreased by 10.36% and 5.16%, respectively. However, as for the summer maize, the average biomass and yield from 2002 to 2014 were reduced by 19.72% and 20.56%, respectively. Our findings can provide a useful method for estimating the effect of aerosols on crops at the national level, supporting local agricultural production in coping with the ongoing climate change.

TI  - Remote sensing of two exceptional winter aerosol pollution events and representativeness of ground-based measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Two intense winter aerosol pollution events, which took place in winter 2016-2017 in Paris, were monitored using a ground-based N-2-Raman lidar, in the framework of WASLIP (Winter Aerosol Survey by Lidar In Paris), a dedicated field campaign that was carried out in this area from 1 November 2016 to 31 January 2017. The data analysis uses the synergy between ground-based and spaceborne lidar observations and data from the air quality monitoring network Airparif. The first severe aerosol pollution event began on 30 November 2016 and ended on 2 December, concerning a circular area of similar to 250 km in diameter around Paris. The maximum PM10 was 121 +/- 63 mu g m(-3) (regional spatial average +/- SD) for the Airparif ground-based PM monitoring stations, and the aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC) ranged from 0.2 to 1 km(-1). The second event took place from 20 to 23 January which covered all of the northwestern Europe, with maxima of PM10 around 156 +/- 33 mu g m(-3) and AEC between 0.6 and 1 km(-1), within the winter atmospheric boundary layer. Although these two major aerosol pollution events did not occur under identical anticyclonic weather conditions, they share very low planetary boundary layer (PBL) heights, down to 300 m above ground level. Moreover, they are associated with significantly different aerosol lidar ratios: 72 +/- 15 and 56 +/- 15 sr, respectively in December and January. Such results are consistent with available spaceborne lidar data, 70 +/- 25 sr from CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations), and values found in the literature. During these two events, the continuous temporal evolution of the aerosol extinction coefficient allows us to investigate the representativeness of optical parameters found in the planetary boundary layer to assess surface aerosol concentration. No one-to-one relationship between the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and PM2.5 values stands out within our study. In contrast, the maximum aerosol extinction coefficient found within the planetary boundary layer correlates well with PM2.5 at the ground (R-2 similar to 0.75, specific extinction cross section of 9.4 m(2) g(-1)) for these polluted events. Thus this lidar-derived aerosol extinction co-efficient is identified as a consistent variable to monitor the pollution during winter events.

TI  - An integrated system for rapid assessment of ecological quality based on remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological quality assessment (EQA) is important for regional socio-economic development and its sustainability. To assess the status of land ecological quality more precisely, an ecological quality assessment system with 11 indicators of ecological stability, ecosystem service function, and habitat stress was established using the analytic hierarchy process for Guangdong Province, a highly urbanized region of China. Remotely sensed data were mainly used to quantify the 11 indicators and acquire regional EQA graphs at high spatial resolution. In addition, we used the spatial autocorrelation measure Moran's I to capture dynamic signatures of spatial organization of ecological quality in the study area. The results show that the ecological quality of the study area is heterogeneous spatially but relatively consistent in different regions. Significant positive spatial autocorrelation for EQI in Guangdong was revealed by global Moran's I. Potential ecological hot spot or cold spot were detected based on the spatial clustering patterns that were obtained by local Moran's I. Lands with low ecological quality is mainly distributed in economically developed areas such as the Pearl River Delta and coastal cities in eastern and western Guangdong, while those with high ecological quality are mostly situated in northern mountainous areas that have lush vegetation. The low assessment scores for Guangdong, especially for the Pearl River Delta, are highly correlated with large populations and degrees of industrial agglomeration; this is mainly because urbanization and economic development jeopardize the environment. The presented case study can facilitate information provision and targeted strategy making for environmental protection. This study provides a helpful approach to assess and to analyze the ecological status in the future research. In contrast with methods that employ a single metric and limited data, the assessment system proposed in this study expands the potential application of the remotely sensed data and enriches the methodological system for EQAs.

TI  - Monitoring LST-NDVI Relationship Using Premonsoon Landsat Datasets
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study monitors the interrelationship of land surface temperature (LST) with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in Raipur City of India using premonsoon Landsat satellite sensor for the season of 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018. The results describe that the mean LST of Raipur City is gradually increased with time. The value of mean NDVI is higher in the area below mean LST compared to the area above mean LST. The value of mean NDVI is also higher in Landsat 8 data than Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 data. A strong negative LST-NDVI correlation is observed throughout the period. The correlation coefficient is higher in the area above mean LST and lower in the area below mean LST. The value of the correlation coefficient is decreased with time. The mixed urban landscape of the city is closely related to the changes of LST-NDVI relationship. These results provide systematic planning of the urban environment.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility assessment of national highway 1D from Sonamarg to Kargil, Jammu and Kashmir, India using frequency ratio method
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is an attempt to carry landslide susceptibility assessment along national highway 1D a lifeline to the Ladakh region using Frequency Ratio Method in GIS environment. The landslide influencing factors which have been investigated to form the frequency ratio matrix are a slope, lithology, rainfall, landuse, distance to road, distance to fault, distance to river, altitude, soil, and slope aspect. The study identified and mapped active landslides along national highway 1D through rigorous multiple field surveys and secondary sources. The landslides did not show any drastic variation in size while the smallest landslide that was identified near Hardas, while the largest one at Zojila Pass. In this study, very high landslide susceptible zone covers thirty-one percent of the study area, while high, moderate, low, and very low landslide susceptible zones cover eleven, eight, eighteen, and thirty-two percent of the study area, respectively. The results show that the major area falls under very high and high landslide susceptibility zones constituting forty-two percent of the study area. The villages which fall under these zones are Sonamarg, Gumri, Pandras, and, Matayan and thus are highly prone to landslide activity and there is a frequent incidence of traffic disruptions along the road. There certainly arises a need to take concrete measures to minimize human and economic losses along the highly susceptible areas.

TI  - The datafication of the worldview
T2  - AI & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The goal of this article is twofold. First, it aims at sketching the outlines of material hermeneutics as a three-level analysis of technological artefacts. In the first section, we introduce Erwin Panofsky's three levels of interpretation of an artwork, and we propose to import this approach in the field of philosophy of technology. Second, the rest of the article focuses on the third level, with a specific attention towards big data and algorithms of artificial intelligence. The thesis is that these new technologies are not only radically transforming our interactions with the world, or our modes of production and consumption, but also our worldview. In the second section, we rely on Panofsky'sGothic Architecture and Scholasticismto describe the Scholastic "mental habit" or worldview and its principles. In the third section, we confront this worldview with the mechanistic and informationistic worldviews. Our contribution consists in arguing that (1) despite the differences, the Scholastic, mechanistic, and informationistic worldviews are part of the same logical and causal order that dominated Western epistemology, and (2) today we are facing the appearance of a new worldview that we call "data worldview". Examples from design, architecture, and visualization of knowledge will be set all along the article.

A1  - Canadian Immunization Monitoring
TI  - Review of pediatric encephalitis and encephalopathy cases following immunization reported to the Canadian Immunization Monitoring Program Active (IMPACT) from 1992 to 2012
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Neurological adverse events following immunization (AEFI) remain poorly characterized. Our objective was to describe pediatric acute and chronic encephalopathy and encephalitis cases following immunization reported via active sentinel surveillance from 1992 to 2012.Methods: This case series provides a descriptive analysis of encephalopathy/encephalitis admissions reported to the Canadian Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive (IMPACT). Acute cases were reported if symptom onset (seizures, decreased level of consciousness, change in mental status) occurred 0-7 days after tetanus or pertussis-containing vaccines, 0-15 days after other inactivated vaccines, or 5-30 days after live vaccines. Chronic cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis or subacute progressive rubella encephalitis were reported at any interval after vaccination. Clinical data were examined to identify possible causes for encephalopathy/encephalitis other than vaccination.Results: Sixty-one cases of encephalopathy/encephalitis following immunization were reported to IMPACT over 21 years; 57 (93.4%) were classified as acute and 4 (6.6%) were chronic cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Most patients (73.8%) were previously healthy and immunocompetent. The vaccines most frequently administered prior to presentation were diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, measles-mumpsrubella, and influenza. At discharge, 38 patients (62.3%) had normal neurological status or were expected to recover. Forty patients (70.2%) with acute encephalopathy/encephalitis had a more likely alternate etiology besides vaccination based on neuroimaging, symptoms suggestive of infection, laboratory-confirmed non-vaccine-related infection, or clinical diagnosis. No cases of encephalitis were causally associated with pertussis or influenza vaccines. Two patients (50%) with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis had known wild-type measles infection prior to immunization. Three deaths were reported during hospitalization (4.9%); all were acute encephalitis/encephalopathy cases and none were confirmed to be vaccine-related.Conclusions: Encephalopathy/encephalitis following immunization remains a rare but serious adverse event. Most cases had another more likely etiology than vaccination. Continued monitoring and analysis of AEFI is paramount to ensure the safety of immunization programs. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Degrees of freedom
T2  - SYNTHESE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human freedom is in tension with nomological determinism and with statistical determinism. The goal of this paper is to answer both challenges. Four contributions are made to the free-will debate. First, we propose a classification of scientific theories based on how much freedom they allow. We take into account that indeterminism comes in different degrees and that both the laws and the auxiliary conditions can place constraints. A scientific worldview pulls towards one end of this classification, while libertarianism pulls towards the other end of the spectrum. Second, inspired by Hoefer, we argue that an interval of auxiliary conditions corresponds to a region in phase space, and to a bundle of possible block universes. We thus make room for a form of non-nomological indeterminism. Third, we combine crucial elements from the works of Hoefer and List; we attempt to give a libertarian reading of this combination. On our proposal, throughout spacetime, there is a certain amount of freedom (equivalent to setting the initial, intermediate, or final conditions) that can be interpreted as the result of agential choices. Fourth, we focus on the principle of alternative possibilities throughout and propose three ways of strengthening it.

TI  - Radioguided sentinel node biopsy to avoid unnecessary neck dissection in T1-T2N0 oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma: personal experience with same day protocol
T2  - EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Data from literature show a mean incidence of occult metastases of 33% in early OCSCC. The gold standard for most authors is a selective neck dissection and a routine pathological examination. 60-70% of unnecessary neck dissections with associated morbidity, can be avoided by using SNB. The aim of this study is to present the results of one of the major Italian centres for the SNB procedure, reserving neck dissection only for proven positive lymphatic metastases. Methods From July 2004 to March 2015, 48 patients with transorally resectable cT1-T2N0 oral SCC were submitted to a lymphoscintigraphic examination one-three hours before surgery and a radio-guided SNB (same day protocol). Patients with a negative SNB were checked every 3 months by ultrasound examination. The minimum follow-up was 5 years. Results Sentinel nodes were found in all cases, with 71% localized in the ipsilateral neck only in levels I-II. Metastases were found in 15 out of 48 cases (31.2%), on levels I, II and III. Further metastatic nodes were found in 6 cases in the neck dissection specimen. In the cohort of 33 patients with SNB negative at 5 years, no-one had a recurrence on the ipsilateral neck. Conclusion This study confirms the accuracy of SNB in predicting the presence of occult metastases, sparing the need for unnecessary neck dissection in 70% of cases. The same day protocol is designed to detect sentinel nodes, which are almost always on neck level I-II, thereby limiting the number of nodes examined and the extension of the surgical approach.

TI  - Judgments of a Product's Quality and Perceptions of User Experience Can Be Mediated by Brief Messaging That Matches the Person's Pre-existing Attitudes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mediation of an attitude to a product following a brief message is investigated. Statements indicating whether a computer was running on energy from renewable or more conventional sources were presented and users' experiences were measured. Participants' pre-existing environmental concern and the satisfaction they expressed with the computers were related, but only when the "renewable energy" message was presented. We conclude that enduring attitudes to environmental concern and situation-specific knowledge can interact in evaluations of a situation - a finding with implications for behavior-change strategies. Theoretically, results are discussed in terms of "spillover" from one behavior to another, the Halo Effect and self-activation, where those with a self-identity of being environmentally conscious have this identity activated by messaging congruent with their self-identity, resulting in an influence of their opinion of a product. Conversely, those with an anti-environmental worldview might rate products more negatively when the product's environmental credentials are mentioned, presumably because these credentials are not congruent with self-identity.

TI  - Glacier mass changes over Duxueshan, Burog Kangri, and Zangser Kangri in the Inner Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The variation of glacier mass balance during the past decades remains poorly known for Duxueshan, Burog Kangri, and Zangser Kangri (DBZ) which are located in the Inner Tibetan Plateau (ITP), a transition zone with shifting influences between the westerlies and the Indian summer monsoon. In the present study, glacier area and mass changes were determined by topographic maps (TOPO), Landsat imagery and multi-temporal digital elevation models (DEMs) generated with TOPO, SRTM, TanDEM-X bistatic interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images, and High Mountain Asia 8-m DEMs. On average, the glaciers showed a slight retreat from 343.27 +/- 5.23 km(2) in 1971 to 334.67 +/- 3.21 km(2) in 2018 (0.05 +/- 0.04% a(-1)). However, glaciers lost mass at a rate of -0.32 +/- 0.03 m w.e. a(-1) from 1971 to 2012. For the 1999-2012 and 2012-2017 periods, mass balances of - 0.03 +/- 0.16 and 0.09 +/- 0.04 m w.e. a(-1), respectively, were observed, which represents an approximately equilibrium. Two glaciers also advanced in our investigation period, and we confirmed one of them surged in 2015.

TI  - Analyzing the occurrence of floods and droughts in connection with climate change in Punjab province, Pakistan
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are immensely changing throughout the world. This study aims to give insight into the changing climatic patterns leading to severe flood and drought conditions in the interior of Punjab province of Pakistan and devise adaptation strategies for risk governance. Landsat TM 30 m imagery was processed for flood analysis, while for drought analysis, Land Surface Temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) were calculated from MODIS (MOD11A2 and MOD13A2) imageries. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted to prepare a management plan based on views of experts and local communities. The main regions affected by extreme events (flood and drought) in interior Punjab were Bahawalpur, Faisalabad, Mianwali, Multan, Sargodha, and Rahim Yar Khan. Supervised classification shows flooding in the Mianwali district during August 2010, and TVDI values show that drought prevailed during the year 2000 in the Bahawalpur district. Annual precipitation showed a significant trend in Sargodha and Mianwali with the magnitude of 6.95 mm/year and 2.97 mm/year, respectively. However, SPI moves to positive in the case of all studied districts except Sargodha where temperature change is 0.6 degrees C. Climatic analysis and survey show that the people of districts, i.e., Faisalabad, Mianwali, Multan, and Sargodha, were more affected by floods, whereas the people of districts, i.e., Bahawalpur and Rahim Yar Khan, were affected by both flood and drought. Adaptation strategies suggest that the flood water should be conserved which can help farmers in irrigation throughout the year.

TI  - Quantifying the recent expansion of native invasive rush species in a UK upland environment
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rushes, such as soft rush (Juncus effusus L.), hard rush (Juncus inflexus L.), and compact rush (Juncus conglomeratus L.) have become problem species within upland grasslands across the United Kingdom and the coastal grasslands of western Norway. Indeed, being largely unpalatable to livestock and having a vigorous reproductive ecology means that they can rapidly come to dominate swards. However, rush dominance results in a reduction in grassland biodiversity and farm productivity. Anecdotal evidence from the United Kingdom suggests that rush cover within marginal upland grasslands has increased considerably in recent decades. Yet, there is currently no published evidence to support this observation. Here, we use recent and historical Google Earth imagery to measure changes in rush frequency over a 13-year period within four survey years: 2005, 2009, 2015, and 2018. During each survey year, we quantified rush presence or absence using a series of quadrats located within 300 upland grassland plots in the West Pennine Moors, United Kingdom. Data were analysed in two stages, first, by calculating mean rush frequencies per sample year using all the available plot-year combinations (the full dataset), and second by examining differences in rush frequency using only the plots for which rush frequency data were available in every sample year (the continuous dataset). The full dataset indicated that rush frequency has increased by 82% between 2005 and 2018. Similarly, the continuous dataset suggested that rush frequency has increased by 174% over the same period, with the increases in frequency being statistically significant (p < .05) between 2005-2018 and 2009-2018. We discuss the potential drivers of rush expansion in the West Pennine Moors, the ecological and agronomic implications of grassland rush infestations, and priorities for future research.

TI  - Comparison of south-east Atlantic aerosol direct radiative effect over clouds from SCIAMACHY, POLDER and OMI-MODIS
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The direct radiative effect (DRE) of aerosols above clouds has been found to be significant over the south-east Atlantic Ocean during the African biomass burning season due to elevated smoke layers absorbing radiation above the cloud deck. So far, global climate models have been unsuccessful in reproducing the high DRE values measured by various satellite instruments. Meanwhile, the radiative effects by aerosols have been identified as the largest source of uncertainty in global climate models. In this paper, three independent satellite datasets of DRE during the biomass burning season in 2006 are compared to constrain the southeast Atlantic radiation budget. The DRE of aerosols above clouds is derived from the spectrometer SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY), the polarimeter Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER), and collocated measurements by the spectrometer Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the imager Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). All three datasets confirm the high DRE values during the biomass season, underlining the relevance of local aerosol effects. Differences between the instruments can be attributed mainly to sampling issues. When these are accounted for, the remaining differences can be explained by a higher cloud optical thickness (COT) derived from POLDER compared to the other instruments and a neglect of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at shortwave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths in the method used for SCIAMACHY and OMI-MODIS. The higher COT from POLDER by itself can explain the difference found in DRE between POLDER and the other instru- ments. The AOT underestimation is mainly evident at high values of the aerosol DRE and accounts for about a third of the difference between POLDER and OMI-MODIS DRE. The datasets from POLDER and OMI-MODIS effectively provide lower and upper bounds for the aerosol DRE over clouds over the south-east Atlantic, which can be used to challenge global circulation models (GCMs). Comparisons of model and satellite datasets should also account for sampling issues. The complementary DRE retrievals from OMI-MODIS and POLDER may benefit from upcoming satellite missions that combine spectrometer and polarimeter measurements.

TI  - Evaluation of polarimetry and interferometry of sentinel-1A SAR data for land use and land cover of the Brazilian Amazon Region
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has been an alternative for monitoring ground targets, especially in areas with cloud cover. This study evaluates the potential of Sentinel-1A attributes for mapping land use and land cover (LULC) in a region of the Brazilian Amazon, using two different machine learning classifiers: Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Different scenarios were used that combined backscattering, polarimetry, and interferometry to the classification process, which was divided into two phases to improve the results. The RF shows superiority over the SVM for almost all scenarios for the two phases of the mapping. The scenario with all data, presented the best results with both classifiers. The final maps with RF and SVM, obtained a global accuracy of 82.7% and 74.5%, respectively. This study demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-1 to map LULC classes in the Amazon region using a classification in two phases.

TI  - Estimation of woody plant species diversity during a dry season in a savanna environment using the spectral and textural information derived from WorldView-2 imagery
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques are useful in the monitoring of woody plant species diversity in different environments including in savanna vegetation types. However, the performance of satellite imagery in assessing woody plant species diversity in dry seasons has been understudied. This study aimed to assess the performance of multiple Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM) derived from individual bands of WorldView-2 satellite imagery to quantify woody plant species diversity in a savanna environment during the dry season. Woody plant species were counted in 220 plots (20 m radius) and subsequently converted to a continuous scale of the Shannon species diversity index. The index regressed against the GLCMs using the all-possible-subsets regression approach that builds competing models to choose from. Entropy GLCM yielded the best overall accuracy (adjusted R-2: 0.41-0.46; Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 0.60-0.58) in estimating species diversity. The effect of the number of predicting bands on species diversity estimation was also explored. Accuracy generally increased when three-five bands were used in models but stabilised or gradually decreased as more than five bands were used. Despite the peak accuracies achieved with three-five bands, performances still fared well for models that used fewer bands, showing the relevance of few bands for species diversity estimation. We also assessed the effect of GLCM window size (3x3, 5x5 and 7x7) on species diversity estimation and generally found inconsistent conclusions. These findings demonstrate the capability of GLCMs combined with high spatial resolution imagery in estimating woody plants species diversity in a savanna environment during the dry period. It is important to test the performance of species diversity estimation of similar environmental set-ups using widely available moderate-resolution imagery.

TI  - Patients with cutaneous head and neck melanoma, particularly elderly with more advanced primary tumors, seem to benefit from initial CT staging before considering a sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - ACTA OTO-LARYNGOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:The role of CT scanning at the time of diagnosis for patients with primary cutaneous head and neck melanoma (cHNM) clinically asymptomatic for metastatic disease remains unclear. Aim:To determine the positive yield of initial CT scanning before considering sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) staging. Materials and methods:A retrospective review was performed on 170 consecutive patients with cHNM referred to a tertiary head and neck academic center for SLNBs from 2014 through 2018. Results:Initial CTs identified occult melanoma metastases in 7.1% and other advanced malignancies in 4.7%. The overall CT yield for patients >65 years (n = 115) was 13.9%, and 5.5% for patients <65 (only occult melanoma metastases). The SLNB yield did not differ between older (11.5%) and younger patients (10.2%). Patients with more advanced primary tumors were upstaged more often by both staging procedures. Multivariate analysis indicated a true-positive CT finding as the strongest prognostic factor for OS (p<.001). Conclusions and significance:The CT yield was >11% and higher for older than for younger patients. The findings suggest that CT imaging may be considered before SLNB staging, potentially identifying metastatic melanoma disease as well as other occult malignancies, enabling especially older patients to bypass the SLNB procedure.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for T1b Melanoma: Balancing Prognostic Value and Cost
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The purpose of this study is to report the additional prognostic information and cost associated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for patients with T1b melanoma. Patients and Methods An institutional database was queried for patients with T1b melanoma (0.8-1.0 mm or < 0.8 mm with ulceration) with at least 5 years of follow-up. Results of SLNB, completion lymphadenectomy (CLND), recurrence, and melanoma-specific survival (MSS) were assessed. Institutional costs of melanoma care were converted to Medicare proportional dollars. A Markov model was created to estimate long-term costs. Results Among the total 392 patients, 238 underwent SLNB. Median follow-up was 10.5 years. SLNB was positive in 19 patients (8.0%). Patients who underwent SLNB had higher 10-year nodal recurrence-free survival (98.6% vs. 91.2%, p < 0.001) but not MSS (94.4% vs. 93.2%, p = 0.55). Ulceration (HR 4.7, p = 0.022) and positive sentinel node (HR 11.5, p < 0.001) were associated with worse MSS. Estimates for 5-year costs reflect a fourfold increase in total costs of care associated with SLNB. However, a treatment plan that forgoes adjuvant therapy for resected stage IIIA melanoma but offers systemic therapy for a node-basin recurrence would nullify the additional cost of SLNB. Conclusions SLNB is prognostic for T1b melanoma. Its impact on the overall cost of melanoma care is intimately tied to systemic therapy in the adjuvant and recurrent settings.

TI  - Optimizing deep learning model selection for angular feature extraction in satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning techniques have been leveraged in numerous applications and across different data modalities over the past few decades, more recently in the domain of remotely sensed imagery. Given the complexity and depth of convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, it is difficult to fully evaluate performance, optimize the hyperparameters, and provide robust solutions to a specific machine learning problem that can be applied to nontraditional real-world feature extraction and automation tasks. Ursa Space Systems Inc. develops machine learning approaches to build custom solutions and extract answers from synthetic aperture radar satellite data fused with other remote sensing data sets. One application is identifying the orientation of nontexture linear features in imagery, such as an inlet pipe on top of a cylindrical oil storage tank. We propose a two-phase approach for determining this orientation: first an optimized CNN is used in a nontraditional way to probabilistically determine a coarse location and orientation of the inlet pipe, followed by a maximum likelihood voting scheme to automatically extract the orientation of the angular feature within 7.5 deg. We use a known hyperparameter optimization technique to determine the best deep learning CNN architecture for our specific problem and under user-defined optimization and accuracy constraints, by optimizing model hyperparameters (number of layers, size of the input image, and data set preprocessing) using a manual and grid search approach. The use of this systematic approach for hyperparameter optimization yields increased accuracy for our angular feature extraction and orientation finding algorithm from 86% to 94%. Additionally, this proposed algorithm shows how machine learning can be used to improve real-world remote sensing workflows. (C) 2020 Society of Photo Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of <i>Salmonella</i> and generic <i>Escherichia coli</i> isolated from surface water samples used for recreation and a source of drinking water in southwestern Ontario, Canada
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the aquatic environment represents an important means of introduction and dissemination of resistance genes, and presence of resistant pathogens in surface waters may pose a public health concern to recreational and drinking water users. The purpose of this study was to explore antimicrobial resistance patterns in water samples collected from the Grand River watershed (southwestern Ontario, Canada) to describe the composition, trends and potential risks of AMR in the aquatic environment. As part of FoodNet Canada and the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS), stream water samples were collected bi-weekly from sampling sites within the Grand River watershed in the Waterloo, Ontario sentinel site and tested for the presence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella spp. (2005-2013) and generic Escherichia coli (2012-2013). Of all samples tested, 16% of Salmonella and 22% of E. coli isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial, including three Salmonella isolates and two E. coli isolates that were resistant to Category I antimicrobials, which are classified as very high importance for the treatment of serious bacterial infections in humans. The greatest proportion of resistant E. coli isolates were observed from the river site upstream of the drinking water intake, while the greatest proportion of resistant Salmonella isolates were from sites upstream in the watershed, and at one recreational water site. Salmonella resistance trends remained fairly stable between 2007 and 2013, with the exception of streptomycin and tetracycline which increased in 2010 and 2013. Continued surveillance of antimicrobial resistance patterns and exploration of risk factor data will allow for a better understanding of resistance transmission in the aquatic environment.

TI  - Photometric properties of lunar regolith revealed by the Yutu-2 rover
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. The surface composition of the Moon has mainly determined based on the visible and near-infrared spectra achieved from orbits and/or landing sites, and the spectroscopic analysis is based on photometric properties of the topmost lunar regolith. However, the lack of a ground truth for the photometric parameters of the undisturbed lunar surface has limited accurate applications of spectral observations.Aims. Here we report the photometric properties of the small-scale (i.e., centimeter level) undisturbed lunar regolith around the Chang'E-4 landing site, determined from a series of photometric experiments conducted by the rover Yutu-2.Methods. The simplified Hapke model was used to derive the photometric properties. The micro-topographic effect on the spectral measurements was corrected for the first time in the in situ photometric investigations on the Moon, which improves the accuracy of the derived photometric parameters.Results. The single-scattering albedo w and two parameters (b, c) of the Henyey-Greenstein phase function were derived, and they show a wavelength dependence. The regolith at the Chang'E-4 landing site exhibits strong forward scattering according to the retrieved c values, and the higher asymmetry parameter indicates that the regolith here is more strongly forward scattering than the Apollo lunar soil samples. The derived photometric parameters can serve as ground truth and can be used in the radiative transfer modeling analysis of the orbital remote-sensing data.

TI  - Real-time diagnosis of sentinel lymph nodes involved to breast cancer based on pH sensing through lipid synthesis of those cells
T2  - BIOSCIENCE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lipid synthesis is the recently found metabolism of cancer cells after their metastasis to lymph nodes (LNs). Carbonic acid is the main byproduct of the lipid metabolism in such cells which resulted in acidification of LN ambient. Hence, calibrated pH sensing could be a diagnostic method to find involved LNs. Here, we designed a simple pH sensing method by a syringe containing sterile PBS and embedded by litmus paper to intraoperatively check the pH of LN fluid. Injected phosphate buffer saline (PBS) would homogenize the LN fluid and litmus needle would detect the pH of the LN. We presented an experimental pathological calibration for the pH values in correlation with cancerous states of the LNs. This system named metabolism based metastatic lymph diagnoser (MMLD) could be a real-time noninvasive tool for precise and fast diagnosis of involved LNs.

TI  - Use of multispectral satellite datasets to improve ecological understanding of the distribution of Invasive Alien Plants in a water-limited catchment, South Africa
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive Alien Plants (IAPs) pose major threats to biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and services. The availability of moderate resolution satellite data (e.g. Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager) offers an opportunity to map and monitor the occurrence and spatial distribution of IAPs. The use of two multispectral remote sensing data sets to map and monitor IAPs in the Heuningnes Catchment, South Africa, was therefore investigated using the maximum likelihood classification algorithm. It was possible to identify areas infested with IAPs using remote sensing data. Specifically, IAPs were mapped with a higher overall accuracy of 71%, using Sentinel-2 MSI as compared to using Landsat 8 OLI, which produced 63% accuracy. However, both sensors showed similar patterns in the spatial distribution of IAPs within the hillslopes and riparian zones of the catchment. This work demonstrates the utility of the two multispectral data sets in mapping and monitoring the occurrence and distribution of IAPs, which contributes to improved ecological modelling and thus to improved management of invasions and biodiversity in the catchment.

TI  - A comparison of data mining techniques and multi-sensor analysis for inland marshes delineation
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland Marsh (IM) is a type of wetland characterized by the presence of non-woody plants as grasses, reeds or sedges, with a water surface smaller than 25% of the area. Historically, these areas have been suffering impacts related to pollution by urban, industrial and agrochemical waste, as well as drainage for agriculture. The IM delineation allows to understand the vegetation and hydrodynamic dynamics and also to monitor the degradation caused by human-induced activities. This work aimed to compare four machine learning algorithms (classification and regression tree (CART), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)) using active and passive remote sensing data in order to address the following questions: (1) which of the four machine learning methods has the greatest potential for inland marshes delineation? (2) are SAR features more important for inland marshes delineation than optical features? and (3) what are the most accurate classification parameters for inland marshes delineation? To address these questions, we used data from Sentinel 1A and Alos Palsar I (SAR) and Sentinel 2A (optical) sensors, in a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach. In addition, we performed a vectorization of a 1975 Brazilian Army topographic chart (first official document presenting marsh boundaries) in order to quantify the marsh area losses between 1975 and 2018 by comparing it with a Sentinel 2A image. Our results showed that the method with the highest overall accuracy was k-NN, with 98.5%. The accuracies for the RF, ANN, and CART methods were 98.3%, 96.0% and 95.5%, respectively. The four classifiers presented accuracies exceeding 95%, showing that all methods have potential for inland marsh delineation. However, we note that the classification results have a great dependence on the input layers. Regarding the importance of the features, SAR images were more important in RF and ANN models, especially in the HV, HV + VH and VH channels of the Alos Palsar I L-band satellite, while spectral indices from optical images were more important in the marshes delineation with the CART method. In addition, we found that the CART and ANN methods presented the largest variations of the overall accuracy (OA) in relation to the different parameters tested. The multi-sensor approach was critical for the high OA values found in the IM delineation (> 95%). The four machine learning methods can be accurately applied for IM delineation, acting as an important low-cost tool for monitoring and managing these environments, in the face of advances in agriculture, soil degradation and pollution of water resources due to agrochemical dumping.

TI  - Spatial relationship between land-use/land-cover change and land surface temperature in the Dongting Lake area, China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Dongting Lake area (China) is a climate change-sensitive and ecologically fragile area and plays a crucial role in the regulation of the regional climate. In recent decades, rapid social and economic development has led to increased land use/land cover (LULC) changes in the Dongting Lake area, which affect the surface energy balance and hydrological processes. Its contemporary variability under climate change remains highly uncertain. Therefore, we retrieved the Land surface temperature (LST) from the Landsat 7 data and explored its relationship with the LULC types. The results showed that LST is significantly affected by surface type. LST varied significantly across LULC types, with higher LSTs in built-up land, reed beach land, forest land, and paddy fields than in water bodies, mud beaches, marshlands, and riparian forests. Water bodies play an important regulatory role in reducing LST and mitigating thermal effects on the ground. The winter LST in the study area increased by approximately 3.5 degrees C, which may be related to the decrease in the area of Dongting Lake water bodies, water fields and reed flats after the Three Gorges Reservoir was impounded. Compared with the relationship between the NDVI, DEM, and distance from the water body, the negative correlation between the NDMI and LST was stronger and more stable and had the greatest effect on LST. These insights improve the understanding of the land change consequences on the temporal dynamics of LST.

TI  - [Spatial and Temporal Characteristics of AOD and Angstrom Exponent in the Yangtze River Delta Based on MODIS_C061].
T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Considering the Yangtze River Delta as the research region, the applicability of the Terra-MODIS C061 deep blue algorithm (DB) AOD products was evaluated using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground-based observations. The results demonstrated that the correlation between Terra-MODIS C061 deep blue algorithm (DB) aerosol optical depth (AOD) and AERONET AOD was high (0.95). Characteristics of spatial distribution and temporal variation of AOD and Angstrom exponent (AE) from 2000 to 2018 in the study area were analyzed using MOD04_L2 products from 2000 to 2018. The results showed that the AOD in the Yangtze River Delta was distributed as "eastern and northern plains high and southern and western mountains low". The AE showed a "northern low and south high" pattern. In terms of temporal distribution, from 2003 to 2007, the annual average AOD increased significantly, with a growth rate of 23%. After 2011, the AOD showed a downward trend. From 2001 to 2003, the annual average of AE rapidly increased, while after 2012, the AE decreased gradually. The AOD showed obvious seasonal changes in the Yangtze River Delta region, with high values in summer and low values in winter. The highest AOD was observed in June (0.84) in all monthly averages, while the lowest was observed in August (0.40). The seasonal average AE was high in autumn and low in spring. The highest AE of 1.47 was observed in September in all monthly averages, and the lowest of 1.08 was observed in March. Aerosol types in the Yangtze River Delta region were investigated according to the relationship between AOD and AE. The results suggested that the urban industrial aerosol was the main aerosol type in the region, followed by mixed type and clean continental aerosols.

TI  - Estimating snow depth Inversion Model Assisted Vector Analysis based on temperature brightness for North Xinjiang region of China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The measurement of snow depth based on temperature brightness with passive microwave sensing is still achallenging problem. Snow depth for the snow cover hydrological model and climate model is asignificant input parameter. Hence, this study concentrates on Inversion Model Assisted Vector Analysis (IMAV) for estimating snow depth in north Xinjiang based on the brightness of temperature. Further, the estimated set of IMAV has been hybridized to address the problem. The results suggested that for both horizontal and vertically polarized PMW radiation the IMAV outperforms SVM at 11.05, 19.6, and 38.4 GHz. If the root mean square error (RMSE) in the IMAV performance is 8 K or below, compared with anormal SVM calculation, then the average over the nine-year study period across the North Xinjiang region of China, the failure correlation coefficient is 7 or greater. Compared with SVM tests, the RMSE was decreased by more than 17% for any of the six frequencies and polarization combinations evaluated, while the anomaly coefficient was raised by more than 50%.Such results suggest that the IMAV is asuperior alternative to the SVM for subsequent use in adata assimilation system as acalculating operator.

TI  - Factors influencing the amount of therapy received during inpatient stroke care: an analysis of data from the UK Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme
T2  - CLINICAL REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives:To understand why most stroke patients receive little therapy. We investigated the factors associated with the amount of stroke therapy delivered.Methods:Data regarding adults admitted to hospital with stroke for at least 72 hours (July 2013-July 2015) were extracted from the UK's Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme. Descriptive statistics and multilevel mixed effects regression models explored the factors that influenced the amount of therapy received while adjusting for confounding.Results:Of the 94,905 patients in the study cohort (mean age: 76 (SD: 13.2) years, 78% had a mild or moderate severity stroke. In all, 92% required physiotherapy, 87% required occupational therapy, 57% required speech therapy but only 5% were considered to need psychology. The average amount of therapy ranged from 2 minutes (psychology) to 14 minutes (physiotherapy) per day of inpatient stay. Unmodifiable characteristics (such as stroke severity) dominated the variation in the amount of therapy. However important, modifiable organizational factors were the day and time of admission, type of stroke team, timely therapy assessments, therapy and nursing staffing levels (qualified and support staff), and presence of weekend or early supported discharge services.Conclusion:The amount of stroke therapy is associated with unmodifiable patient-related characteristics and modifiable organizational factors in that more therapy was associated with higher therapy and nurse staffing levels, specialist stroke rehabilitation services, timely therapy assessments, and the presence of weekend and early discharge services.

TI  - Gauging the efficacy of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients with known axillary disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) for ER+ breast cancer can downstage primary tumors. We evaluated NET efficacy in node-positive patients.Methods Node-positive patients undergoing NET for ER+ breast cancer from 2012 to 2019 were reviewed. Primary endpoints included rates of axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND), pathologic complete response (pCR), and final nodal staging.Results Thirty-nine patients were included. Before NET, all were clinically node-positive (cN1 = 36, 94%; cN2 = 2, 5%; cN3 = 1, 3%; Stage II = 23, 59%, Stage III = 16, 41%). After NET, nine (23%) had clinically persistent axillary disease necessitating ALND. The remaining 30 (77%) underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Of these, 25 (83%) were SLNB+ on frozen section, undergoing immediate ALND. Five patients were negative on frozen section: one had a confirmed axillary pCR, and four had residual nodal disease on permanent pathology. One underwent delayed ALND, and for the remaining three patients, decision was made to forgo ALND. Final overall axillary staging was: N0 (pCR) = 1, 3%, pN1mic = 1, 3%, pN1 = 20, 51%, pN2 = 12, 30%, pN3 = 5, 13%; Stage II = 16, 41%, Stage III = 23, 59%.Conclusions While NET is reported to downstage primary tumors, downstaging of the axilla was unsuccessful in the majority of patients.

TI  - Hot spot (G*<sub>i</sub>) model for forest vulnerability assessment: a remote sensing-based geo-statistical investigation of the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The 5th category super-cyclone Sidr disrupts the world's largest mangrove forest Sundarbans on November 15, 2007. It seriously shatters about 1900 km(2) that 31% of the total area of the Sundarbans. That makes a great threat to the mangrove ecosystem and biodiversity, which convey to forest vulnerability monitoring of Sundarbans. This research emphasizes on mangrove forest monitoring with vulnerability assessment using Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 remote sensing data based on geo-statistical hot spot (G(i)*) model, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and forest discrimination index (FDI). However, the analysis works with statistical algorithm G(i)(d) and G(d) in terms of geo-statistical nearest neighborhood spatial autocorrelation analysis. Hot spot (G(i)*) model used to explore the hot and cold confidence zone, which provided the mangrove vulnerability confidence level. The simulated, similar to 14.1% extreme safe zone is increased from 2001 to 2015 and extremely vulnerable zone also increased 4.1% at the same time, although 4.3% stable zone also decreased in that time. Even, high-density mangrove area was decreased in 2009, and the low-density mangrove area increased due to cyclone Sidr. In addition, FDI denotes the mangrove density, and NDVI provides vegetation health condition and represents the mangrove variability scenario with geospatial location those signify to detect the threatening condition of mangrove population and density. Furthermore, this study's methods and results will provide the base for further long-term studies on this world's largest mangrove forest and would have an implication for the mangrove monitoring and disaster risk reduction strategies.

TI  - Feasibility and surgical impact of Z0011 trial criteria in a single-Institution practice
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is the evaluation of clinical and surgical impact of the Z0011 trial criteria on the management of breast cancer (BC) patients undergoing breast conservative surgery (BCS) at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO). We studied 1386 patients who underwent BCS and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) from July 2016 to July 2018. Clinical evaluation, breast ultrasound, mammogram, and cyto/histological examination were performed for all patients at the time of diagnosis. Frozen sections of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) were not performed for any patient. Patients who underwent neo-adjuvant therapy were excluded. To evaluate the results before and after the introduction of Z0011 criteria, a group of 1425 patients with the same characteristics who underwent BCS and SLNB from July 2013 to July 2015 were analyzed. We studied the characteristics of the patients by nodal status, and we observed that T stage, tumor grade, and lymphovascular invasion were statistically related with the highest rate of positive SLN. Of the 1386 patients who underwent surgery after the introduction of the Z011 trial, 1156 patients (83.4%) had negative SLN, 230 patients (16.6%) had positive SLN. Subsequent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed in only 7 cases (3.0%). Of the 1425 patients operated before the introduction of the Z0011 trial, 216 patients had subsequent ALND (15%). The reduction in the number of ALND performed after the introduction of Z0011 is statistically significant, and this could result in a remarkable reduction of the comorbidities of our patients.

TI  - Preliminary calibration results for Jason-3 and Sentinel-3 altimeters in the Wanshan Islands
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present preliminary calibration results for Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A altimeters that we set up in the Wanshan Islands in Guandong Province, China. Two campaigns were carried out in 2018, from March 8 to April 16 and from November 3 to December 11, 2018. Three GPS reference stations and tide gauges were established on the islands of Zhiwan, Dangan, and Wailingding during the campaigns. The in-situ sea surface height (SSH) of the altimeter footprint was determined using the tide gauge. The tidal and geoid connection between the tide gauge locations and the altimeter footprints were computed with the NAO.99Jb tidal prediction system and the EGM 2008 geoid, respectively. The data of the tide gauges were defi ned using the GPS buoy and GPS reference stations during the campaigns. The results show that the waveform of the altimeters was slightly contaminated by the small islands. The bias associated with Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A amounted to approximately +20.7 +/- 49.7 mm and +30.1 +/- 39.4 mm, respectively, which agreed well with the results from other in-situ calibration fi elds. This indicates that the Wanshan area was very suitable as an in-situ calibration/validation fi eld. The wet zenith delay (WZD) determined from the Microwave Radiometer (MWR) and the GPS measurements diff ered from each other for the Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A by -6.6 +/- 7.4 mm and 0 +/- 6.8 mm, respectively.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gold mining operations generate a range of ecological and environmental impacts that can be measured spatially using geographic information system and remote sensing methods. This study assessed land-use and land-cover dynamics in the gold mining area using geographic information system and remote sensing techniques with the aid of Landsat 5 for years 1984, 1994, 2004 and Landsat 8 for 2014 and 2019 obtained from the United States Geological Survey and Remote Pixel Databases using ArcGIS 10.4 and R programming. The result from the study revealed the current changes and how they have evolved over the years where tailings dam and built-up areas increased from 90.5 to 172.9 km(2) between the year 1984 and 2019, while mine effluent (return water ponds) and water bodies increased from 14.7 to 18.8 km(2) during the same period. The area also experienced increased vegetation from 342.5 to 371.1 km(2) (though fluctuating during the study period) an indication that the area has witnessed revegetation in the area. Results from the study further revealed the vegetation health in the area utilises some vegetation indices such as the Global Environmental Monitoring Index, Normalised Difference Impervious Surface Index and Normalised Difference Moisture Index. Findings from the study show that areas with low index values are susceptible to the impact of mining and other anthropogenic activities, whereas high-index areas connote little or no impact. The outcome of this study provides a cost-effective tool for evaluating environmental impacts in mining areas that can drive policy interventions for remediation in affected areas.

T2  - RADIOPHYSICS AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the results of comparing the total electron content measurements based on GLONASS satellite signals and the EISCAT UHF incoherent scatter radar (Tromso, Norway) during modification of the high-latitude ionosphere in the magnetic zenith direction by high-frequency radio waves of the EISCAT/Heating facility (Tromso, Norway). The measurements were performed during two experiment campaigns in October 2013 and in October 2018. In general, the total electron content variations obtained from the radar data in the altitude range 100-400 km were consistent with the total electron content variations from the GLONASS satellites. The efficiency of using GLONASS satellites for observations of high-latitude phenomena was shown. The anomalous increase in the total electron content by 4 TECU obtained from the incoherent scatter radar when the ionosphere was heated in the region close to the magnetic zenith is considered. The GLONASS satellite data show the total electron content reduction in the same region. To explain the disagreement between measurements by these two methods, the effect of smallscale electron-density irregularities arising in the region modified by high-power HF radio waves is considered. It is shown that when the electron density in artificial irregularities exceeds the background density of the medium by 2 & x30fb; 10(-3) times in relative units, scattering by irregularities with spatial scales of the order of 16 cm becomes predominant in the reflected signal.

TI  - Surveillance-based evidence: elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem in the Peoples' Republic of China
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background A steady progress on schistosomiasis control in the Peoples' Republic of China (P.R. China) was achieved and broadened into the twelve-year medium and long term national plan (MLNP) which marled the implementation of an integrated control strategy across all endemic areas in P.R. China in 2004. To understand the endemic trends of schistosomiasis to assess the effectiveness of an integrated strategy, we conducted an analysis of schistosomiasis surveillance data spanned from 2005 to 2015. Methods The schistosomiasis sentinel surveillance data from sentinel sites were collected and analyzed from 2005 to 2015. In these sentinel sites, residents aged 6 years or above were screened annually by indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA), while only antibody positives were followed by stool examination either Kato-katz method (KK) and/or hatching technique (HT). Domestic animals raised in sentinel sites were examined by HT for confirming the infection of schistosomes. Snail investigation was conducted each year through systematic sampling method combined with environmental sampling method. The snails collected from field were tested by microscopic dissection method. The infection rates of schistosomes in residents, domestic animals and snails, as well as the indicators reflecting the snails' distribution were calculated and analyzed. ANOVA analysis was used to examine the changes of the number of eggs per gram feces in population and Chi-square test was used to examine any change in proportions among groups. Results A total of 148 902 residents from sentinel sites attended this study and 631 676 blood samples were examined by IHA test during the 11 covered years. The annual average antibody positive rates presented a significant decrease trends, from 17.48% (95% CI: 17.20-17.75%) in 2005 to 5.93% (95% CI: 5.71-6.15%) (chi(2) = 8890.47, P < 0.001) in 2015. During 2005-2015, the average infection rate of schistosomes in residents declined from 2.07% (95% CI: 1.96-2.17%) to 0.13% (95% CI: 0.09-0.16%), accompanied by significant decrease of infection intensity in population. In 2015, the stool positives were only found in farmers, fishermen and boatmen with infection rate of 0.16% (95% CI: 0.11-0.20%), 0.17% (95% CI: 0-0.50%) respectively. The infection rate of schistosomes in domestic animals dropped from 9.42% (538/5711, 95% CI: 8.66-10.18%) to 0.08% (2/2360, 95% CI: 0-0.20%) from 2005 to 2015. Infections were found in eight species of domestic animals at the beginning of surveillance while only two cattle were infected in 2015. Totally 98 ha of new snail habitats were found, while 94.90% (93/98) distributed in lake and marshland regions. The percentage of frames with snails decreased from 16.96% (56 884/33 5391, 95% CI: 16.83-17.09%) in 2005 to 4.28% (18 121/423 755, 95% CI: 4.22-4.34%) in 2014, with a slightly increase in 2015. Meanwhile, the infection rate of schistosomes in snails was decreased from 0.26% (663/256 531, 95% CI: 0.24-0.28%) to zero during 2005-2015. Conclusions The infection rate of schistosomes declined significantly, providing evidence that the goal of the MLNP was achieved. Elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem defined as WHO was also reached in P.R. China nationwide. Surveillance-response system should be improved and strengthened to realize the final goal of schistosomiasis elimination.

TI  - Application of airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral imaging techniques for atmospheric research: past, present, and future
T2  - APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral imaging techniques are topics of great interest in the remote sensing field due to their ability to provide rich spatial and spectral information, which are paramount for a better characterization of the Earth's surface and atmosphere. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in the applications of airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral imaging for atmospheric research. Main hyperspectral imaging systems, data analysis methods and their applications in some atmosphere research areas, including the estimation of aerosol and water vapor content for a deeper understanding of atmospheric phenomena, cloud characterization for better prediction of weather phenomena, and gas emissions detection for air quality control, were discussed. Many studies have shown very promising results, but as hyperspectral imaging is in a continuous dynamic, there are several challenges that need to be addressed in future studies so that it can become one of the most important tools for atmosphere research. The answer to some questions on this topic is provided and directions for future research are outlined.

TI  - Continuous monitoring of the 2015-2018 Nevado del Ruiz activity, Colombia, using satellite infrared images and local infrasound records
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nevado del Ruiz Volcano (NRV) had a phreatomagmatic eruption in 1985. The eruption partially melted the volcano's ice cap leading to floods and lahars flowing down to nearby towns, which killed at least 25,000 people. This event has raised particular importance of monitoring activity including small eruptions at ice-capped high-altitude volcanoes. However, the high altitude makes it difficult to maintain monitoring stations near the summit crater. Moreover, the visibility of the summit area is frequently prevented by clouds. In this paper, we report the results of a feasibility study for detecting thermal anomalies and small eruptions using satellite thermal remote sensing and ground-based infrasound technique. We newly included South and Central America to the observation areas of the near-real-time monitoring system of the active volcanoes, which uses infrared images from satellites. We also operated three infrasound stations in the distances of 4-6 km from the active crater. Each of the stations consisted of a pair of infrasound sensors, and a cross-correlation technique was applied. The thermal and infrasound data acquisition started in August 2015 and December 2016, respectively, and recorded the recent dome-forming activity of NRV. We proposed parameters representing the visibility of the thermal anomalies and infrasound signals. These parameters are useful for monitoring because the severe weather condition at NRV frequently prevents signal detections. We discussed the detected thermal anomalies and infrasound signals in comparison with their visibilities and the changes in the volcanic activity of NRV reported by the local observatory. The thermal anomaly and infrasound detections were consistent with the high eruptive activity occurring at the NRV from October 2015 to May 2017 and its subsequent decline. Within the active period, there were breaks in the detections of thermal anomaly and infrasound. The visibility analyses allowed us to interpret the breaks as a result of bad weather conditions and to distinguish them from the confirmed low-activity periods after May 2017.

TI  - Validating a case definition for adult asthma in primary care electronic medical records
T2  - NPJ PRIMARY CARE RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although asthma is one of the most common chronic conditions affecting Canadians, its epidemiologic characteristics and burden in primary care contexts are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a case definition to identify adults with asthma who consult family physicians and to estimate the prevalence of asthma in that setting in Canada. This validation study utilized a database of electronic medical records (EMRs) from the Southern Alberta Primary Care Research Network, a node of the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (SAPCReN-CPCSSN). The population included patients over age 17y of any gender and health status who had visited an SAPCReN-CPCSSN primary care provider during the period December 1, 2014-December 31, 2016. The validation of the case definition involved comparing a case-finding algorithm to caseness determined by an expert physician review of the records of 1000 patient in the CPCSSN database. The case definition, which included the ICD-9 code 493 and asthma-related text words, had 83.33% sensitivity (95% CI: 63.61-93.88%), 99.28% specificity (95% CI: 98.51-99.67%), a positive predictive value of 74.07% (95% CI: 55.03-87.14%), and a negative predictive value of 99.59% (95% CI: 98.93-99.86%). The prevalence of adult asthma in CPCSSN primary care practices in southern Alberta was 4.20% (95% CI: 4.09-4.31). The strong validation metrics suggest that this case definition is valid for both clinical and research purposes. The validated case definition may be used to improve patient care and improve understanding of the prevalence and burden of asthma in primary care in Canada.

TI  - Dark control: The default mode network as a reinforcement learning agent
T2  - HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
M3  - Article
AB  - The default mode network (DMN) is believed to subserve the baseline mental activity in humans. Its higher energy consumption compared to other brain networks and its intimate coupling with conscious awareness are both pointing to an unknown overarching function. Many research streams speak in favor of an evolutionarily adaptive role in envisioning experience to anticipate the future. In the present work, we propose a process model that tries to explain how the DMN may implement continuous evaluation and prediction of the environment to guide behavior. The main purpose of DMN activity, we argue, may be described by Markov decision processes that optimize action policies via value estimates through vicarious trial and error. Our formal perspective on DMN function naturally accommodates as special cases previous interpretations based on (a) predictive coding, (b) semantic associations, and (c) a sentinel role. Moreover, this process model for the neural optimization of complex behavior in the DMN offers parsimonious explanations for recent experimental findings in animals and humans.

AB  - Metaproteomics of gut microbiomes from animal hosts lacking a reference genome is challenging. Here we describe a strategy combining high-resolution metaproteomics and host RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) with generalist database searching to survey the digestive tract of Gammarus fossarum, a small crustacean used as a sentinel species in ecotoxicology. This approach provides a deep insight into the full range of biomasses and metabolic activities of the holobiont components, and differentiates between the intestine and hepatopancreatic caecum.

TI  - The mechanisms and seasonal differences of the impact of aerosols on daytime surface urban heat island effect
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island intensity (UHII) is the temperature difference between urban areas and their rural surroundings. It is commonly attributed to changes in the underlying surface structure caused by urbanization. Air pollution caused by aerosol particles can affect the UHII through changing (1) the surface energy balance by the aerosol radiative effect (ARE) and (2) planetary-boundary-layer (PBL) stability and airflow intensity by modifying thermodynamic structure, which is referred to as the aerosol dynamic effect (ADE). By analyzing satellite data and ground-based observations collected from 2001 to 2010 at 35 cities in China and using the WRF-Chem model, we find that the impact of aerosols on UHII differs considerably: reducing the UHII in summer but increasing the UHII in winter. This seasonal contrast is proposed to be caused by the different strengths of the ARE and ADE between summer and winter. In summer, the ARE on UHII is dominant over the ADE, cooling down surface temperature more strongly in urban areas than in rural areas because of much higher aerosol loading, and offsets the urban heating, therefore weakening UHII. In winter, however, the ADE is more dominant, because aerosols stabilize the PBL more in the polluted condition, weakening the near-surface heat transport over urban areas in both vertical and horizontal directions. This means that the heat accumulated in urban areas is dispersed less effectively, and thus the UHII is enhanced. These findings shed new light on the impact of the interaction between urbanization-induced surface changes and air pollution on urban climate.

TI  - Transmission of the "World": Sumeru Cosmology as Seen in Central Asian Buddhist Paintings Around 500 AD
T2  - NTM
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper considers the process of how the image of Mount Sumeru, the axis mundi of the Indian Buddhist cosmology, was transmitted from the Indo-Iranian cultural sphere to the Chinese cultural sphere in the fifth and sixth centuries. The research focus is mainly on the representations of Mt. Sumeru in the wall paintings of two monumental Buddhist sites from this period, the Kizil Grottoes (Kucha) and the Mogao Grottoes (Dunhuang), with reference to a relevant image in the Yungang Grottoes (Datong). As the monks of Kucha were in direct intellectual contact with contemporaneous India via the Sanskrit language, it is a purely Indian Buddhist cosmological worldview that is reflected in early Kizil paintings. In Dunhuang, on the other hand, the earliest-extant Sumeru representation clearly shows the visual syncretism of Buddhist and Taoist cosmologies. These visual symbols of the "World" are composites of multiple historical factors, such as languages, geopolitical situation of regional powers, and ideological trends of the regions.

TI  - Comparison of 3 γ-probes for simultaneous iodine-125-seed and technetium-99m breast cancer surgery: NEMA standard characterisation with extended processing
T2  - EJNMMI PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Iodine-125 (I-125) seeds can be used as landmarks to locate non-palpable breast lesions instead of implanting metal wires. This relatively new technique requires a nuclear probe usually used for technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sentinel node detection. This study aimed to compare the performances of different probes and valid the feasibility of this technique, especially in the case of simultaneous I-125-seed and Tc-99m breast cancer surgery. Methods Three probes with different features (SOE-3211, SOE-3214 and GammaSUP-II) were characterised according to the NEMA NU3-2004 standards for a Tc-99m source and a I-125-seed. Several tests such as sensitivity, linearity or spatial resolution allowed an objective comparison of their performances. NEMA testing was extended to work on signals discrimination in case of simultaneous detection of two different sources (innovative figure of merit "Shift Index") and to assess the Tc-99m scatter fraction, a useful parameter for the improvement of the probes in terms of detector materials and electronic system. Results Although the GammaSUP-II probe saturated at a lower activity (1.6 MBq at 10 mm depth), it allowed better sensitivity and spatial resolution at the different NEMA tests performed with the Tc-99m source (7865 cps/MBq and 15 mm FWHM at 10 mm depth). With the I-125-seed, the GammaSUP-II was the most sensitive probe (3106 cps/MBq at 10 mm depth) and the SOE-3211 probe had the best spatial resolution (FWHM 20 mm at 10 mm depth). The SOE-3214 probe was more efficient on discriminating I-125 from Tc-99m in case of simultaneous detection. The SOE probes were more efficient concerning Tc-99m scatter fraction assessments. The SOE-3211 probe, with overall polyvalent performances, seemed to be an interesting trade-off for detection of both I-125 and Tc-99m. Conclusion The three probes showed heterogeneous performances but were all suitable for simultaneous Tc-99m sentinel node and I-125-seed detection. This study provides an objective and innovative methodology to compare probes performances and then choose the best trade-off regarding their expected use.

TI  - Mapping seagrass (Zostera) by remote sensing in the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The change of mapping methods for seagrass beds, here species of eelgrasses, from aerial surveys to automated classification of optical satellite data is described. Both methods are compared with respect to availability and suitability of their data. Differences in the detection capability of the methods are shown as well as results of the validation of the satellite image classification.In North Friesia, where the largest area of eelgrass occurs in the Wadden Sea, eelgrass beds have been mapped regularly using aerial surveys since 1994. After a significant decline in the 1930s and 1960s, monitoring results show a steady increase in the size of the area covered by eelgrass beds up to 2017.Since 2006, the aerial surveys have been complemented by ground surveys, which, however, only cover one sixth of the area of the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea each year. Results show that size estimates of individual beds can vary significantly between aerial and ground surveys.In recent years, satellite-borne remote sensing technology and subsequent analysis methods have reached a level of quality, which makes them an alternative and cost-efficient method for mapping eelgrass. The technology has advantages such as the coverage of large areas at single points in time, repeatable and transferable image analysis methods, and high spatial resolution of the satellite images, as well as frequent repetition of acquisition of data. This provides standardised results, which allow direct comparisons over time and between areas.

TI  - Quantitative biokinetics over a 28 day period of freshly generated, pristine, 20 nm silver nanoparticle aerosols in healthy adult rats after a single 11/2-hour inhalation exposure
T2  - PARTICLE AND FIBRE TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There is a steadily increasing quantity of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) produced for numerous industrial, medicinal and private purposes, leading to an increased risk of inhalation exposure for both professionals and consumers. Particle inhalation can result in inflammatory and allergic responses, and there are concerns about other negative health effects from either acute or chronic low-dose exposure. Results To study the fate of inhaled AgNP, healthy adult rats were exposed to 11/2-hour intra-tracheal inhalations of pristine Ag-105-radiolabeled, 20 nm AgNP aerosols (with mean doses across all rats of each exposure group of deposited NP-mass and NP-number being 13.5 +/- 3.6 mu g, 7.9 +/- 3.2 center dot 10(11), respectively). At five time-points (0.75 h, 4 h, 24 h, 7d, 28d) post-exposure (p.e.), a complete balance of the [Ag-105]AgNP fate and its degradation products were quantified in organs, tissues, carcass, lavage and body fluids, including excretions. Rapid dissolution of [Ag-105]Ag-ions from the [Ag-105]AgNP surface was apparent together with both fast particulate airway clearance and long-term particulate clearance from the alveolar region to the larynx. The results are compatible with evidence from the literature that the released [Ag-105]Ag-ions precipitate rapidly to low-solubility [Ag-105]Ag-salts in the ion-rich epithelial lining lung fluid (ELF) and blood. Based on the existing literature, the degradation products rapidly translocate across the air-blood-barrier (ABB) into the blood and are eliminated via the liver and gall-bladder into the small intestine for fecal excretion. The pathway of [Ag-105]Ag-salt precipitates was compatible with auxiliary biokinetics studies at 24 h and 7 days after either intravenous injection or intratracheal or oral instillation of [Ag-110m]AgNO3 solutions in sentinel groups of rats. However, dissolution of [Ag-105]Ag-ions appeared not to be complete after a few hours or days but continued over two weeks p.e. This was due to the additional formation of salt layers on the [Ag-105]AgNP surface that mediate and prolonge the dissolution process. The concurrent clearance of persistent cores of [Ag-105]AgNP and [Ag-105]Ag-salt precipitates results in the elimination of a fraction > 0.8 (per ILD) after one week, each particulate Ag-species accounting for about half of this. After 28 days p.e. the cleared fraction rises marginally to 0.94 while 2/3 of the remaining [Ag-105]AgNP are retained in the lungs and 1/3 in secondary organs and tissues with an unknown partition of the Ag species involved. However, making use of our previous biokinetics studies of poorly soluble [Au-195]AuNP of the same size and under identical experimental and exposure conditions (Kreyling et al., ACS Nano 2018), the kinetics of the ABB-translocation of [Ag-105]Ag-salt precipitates was estimated to reach a fractional maximum of 0.12 at day 3 p.e. and became undetectable 16 days p.e. Hence, persistent cores of [Ag-105]AgNP were cleared throughout the study period. Urinary [Ag-105]Ag excretion is minimal, finally accumulating to 0.016.Conclusion The biokinetics of inhaled [Ag-105]AgNP is relatively complex since the dissolving [Ag-105]Ag-ions (a) form salt layers on the [Ag-105]AgNP surface which retard dissolution and (b) the [Ag-105]Ag-ions released from the [Ag-105]AgNP surface form poorly-soluble precipitates of [Ag-105]Ag-salts in ELF. Therefore, hardly any [Ag-105]Ag-ion clearance occurs from the lungs but instead [Ag-105]AgNP and nano-sized precipitated [Ag-105]Ag-salt are cleared via the larynx into GIT and, in addition, via blood, liver, gall bladder into GIT with one common excretional pathway via feces out of the body.

AB  - BackgroundTo evaluate the effectiveness of root cause analysis (RCA) recommendations and propose possible ways to enhance its quality in Hong Kong public hospitals.MethodsA retrospective cross-sectional study was performed across 43 public hospitals and institutes in Hong Kong, reviewing RCA reports of all Sentinel Events and Serious Untoward Events within a two-year period. The incident nature, types of root causes and strengths of recommendations were analysed. The RCA recommendations were categorised as 'strong', 'medium' or 'weak' strengths utilizing the US's Veteran Affairs National Center for Patient Safety action hierarchy.ResultsA total of 214 reports from October 2016 to September 2018 were reviewed. These reports generated 504 root causes, averaging 2.4 per RCA report, and comprising 249 (49%) system, 233 (46%) staff behavioural and 22 (4%) patient factors. There were 760 recommendations identified in the RCA reports with an average of 3.6 per RCA. Of these, 18 (2%) recommendations were rated strong, 116 (15%) medium and 626 (82%) weak. Most recommendations were related to 'training and education' (466, 61%), 'additional study/review' (104, 14%) and 'review/enhancement of policy/guideline' (39, 5%).ConclusionsThis study provided insights about the effectiveness of RCA recommendations across all public hospitals in Hong Kong. The results showed a high proportion of root causes were attributed to staff behavioural factors and most of the recommendations were weak. The reasons include the lack of training, tools and expertise, appropriateness of panel composition, and complicated processes in carrying out large scale improvements. The Review Team suggested conducting regular RCA training, adopting easy-to-use tools, enhancing panel composition with human factors expertise, promoting an organization-wide safety culture to staff and aggregating analysis of incidents as possible improvement actions.

TI  - Earth Observations for Monitoring Marine Coastal Hazards and Their Drivers
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal zones have large social, economic and environmental values. They are more densely populated than the hinterland and concentrate large economic assets, critical infrastructures and human activities such as tourism, fisheries, navigation. Furthermore, coastal oceans are home to a wealth of living marine resources and very productive ecosystems. Yet, coastal zones are exposed to various natural and anthropogenic hazards. To reduce the risks associated with marine hazards, sustained coastal zone monitoring programs, forecasting and early warning systems are increasingly needed. Earth observations (EO), and in particular satellite remote sensing, provide invaluable information: satellite-borne sensors allow an effective monitoring of the quasi-global ocean, with synoptic views of large areas, good spatial and temporal resolution, and sustained time-series covering several years to decades. However, satellite observations do not always meet the precision required by users, in particular in dynamic coastal zones, characterized by shorter-scale variability. A variety of sensors are used to directly monitor the coastal zone and their observations can also be integrated into numerical models to provide a full 4D monitoring of the ocean and forecasts. Here, we review how EO, and more particularly satellite observations, can monitor coastal hazards and their drivers. These include coastal flooding, shoreline changes, maritime security, marine pollution, water quality, and marine ecology shifts on the one hand, and several physical characteristics (bathymetry, topography, vertical land motion) of coastal zones, meteorological and oceanic (metocean) variables that can act as forcing factors for coastal hazards on the other hand.

TI  - Respiratory health and eruptions of the Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira volcanoes in the Democratic Republic of Congo: a time-series analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Nyamulagira and Nyiragongo are active volcanoes situated close to Goma (North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo). These volcanoes are among the most prolific sources of volcanic SO2 pollution on earth. Objective We investigated the possible spatiotemporal relationships between volcanic degassing represented by eruptive emissions of SO2 that occurred between 2000 and 2010, and the incidence of acute respiratory symptoms (ARS) in populations living in areas up to more than 100 km from the volcanoes. Methodology The total flux of SO2 emitted during eruptions since 2000 and the average spatial distribution of the volcanic plume (2004-2008) were based on publicly available remote sensing data. The monthly numbers of adults and children reporting acute respiratory symptoms were extracted from health data collected routinely by selected local health centres and hospitals between 2000 and 2010. The monthly numbers of persons with ARS recorded during or after eruptions were compared with those recorded before eruptions, using negative binomial regression models allowing the calculation of incidence rate ratios (IRR) and their 95% confidence intervals. We first compared years with and without eruptions and then considered shorter time-windows (months). Results In the investigated area, ARS were the second most frequent cause of medical visits (12.2%, n = 3.2 million cases), after malaria (32.3%, n = 8.4 million cases). SO2 emissions gradually increased 30 to 50 times in 2010 compared to 2002. Taking 1999 as a reference, the IRR for ARS increased three-fold between 2000 [0.9 (0.8, 1.1)] and 2009 [2.8 (2.2, 3.7)]. Although the incidence of ARS appeared to increase after some eruptions, especially in areas close (< 26 km) to the volcanoes, we did not find a consistent temporal association between the yearly incidence of ARS and volcanic eruptions when considering the entire observation period. When we analysed shorter time-windows (6 months in the year preceding an eruption), we observed increased ARS incidences in eruptive months, except in 2010. IRRs were increased for centres situated close to volcanoes (< 26 km) in 2001 and 2002. Conclusion ARS incident cases increased over the years in populations living around the Nyamulagira and Nyiragongo volcanoes, but we found no consistent evidence for an association between the yearly incidence of ARS and volcanic eruptions or the intensity of SO2 emissions, possibly because of interference with man-made events, including massive population displacements caused by insecurity in the area. Nevertheless, some evidence was found for increased incidence of ARS following eruptions, especially in areas close to volcanoes. Assessing personal, ground level exposure to SO2 and particulates with adequate controlling for confounding, such as viral and other infections, could clarify the contribution, if any, of volcanic emissions of SO2 to the high burden of respiratory diseases in this region.

TI  - Environmental interactions between people and birds in semiarid lands of the Zapotitlan Valley, Central Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Birds have been among the most important element in lives of humans around the world, due to their presence and abundance in practically all ecosystems. Zapotitlan Salinas, a community of the Tehuacan Valley, has been a site of interest for studying ecology of bird communities, but no previous studies addressing the relationship between humans and birds have been conducted in the area. Based on their local knowledge, people of the area shape the use and conservation of local bird fauna diversity, which is being maintained or lost under the influence of factors like commerce, tourism, agriculture intensification or abandonment, public policies for conservation, environmental changes, among others. This study aims to analyze the patterns of interactions between humans and birds in a context of high biocultural diversity with a long history and facing the environmental and social challenges of semiarid areas. Methods Ecological sampling for documenting bird species richness was conducted from November 2015 to May 2017 in three transects that included agroforestry systems, forests, and fallow agricultural land. The method of counting by fixed radius points at 16 points within the study systems was used. Thirty in-depth interviews were conducted with local people who own land in the study areas by random sampling and choosing experts of Zapotitlan Salinas, Puebla, a semiarid natural protected area and, since 2019, recognized as Mixed World Heritage. Some visitor guides of the Helia Bravo Hollis Botanical Garden who are member of the community and local people who dedicated part of their time to catching birds were considered as local experts. They have experience in identifying birds through bird watching and listening to bird songs, as well as their knowledge on behavior and habits of the bird species occurring in their locality. We in addition conducted free listing of bird species recognized by people and interviews on ecological aspects, forms of use, and management of birds using a photographic catalog as visual stimulus. The following aspects were addressed with local people: (i) the bird species of Zapotitlan recognized by them; (ii) the biological, ecological, and behavioral knowledge about these species; (iii) the description of practices of use and management of these animals; (iv) the perceived changes regarding presence and abundance of the wild birds recognized; and (v) the regulations of these practices and uses. Results Through the ecological sampling, we identified 89 bird species, a number representing nearly 68% of all species reported for the Zapotitlan Valley. The species recorded belong to 61 genera, 26 families, and 11 orders. Local people interviewed recognized 62 morphospecies occurring in their territory, and designated them with 50 local names. The interactions of local people with birds and the knowledge related to habitats and habits varied according to people's daily life activities and the ways of inter-generational transmission of knowledge. The interactions identified respond to several motivations. The most intense are those of utilitarian nature (three types of use are recognized: nutritional, medicinal, and ornamental), while other less notorious but equally relevant are those related to the awareness and conservation of biological diversity, and aesthetic appreciation of nature. Also relevant are those interactions shaped by the people's worldview since some species are interpreted as climatic environmental predictors, amulets, or omens.Conclusions To understand the various human-bird environmental interactions, it is necessary not only to address the utilitarian assessment that species have in a specific place but also those associated with cultural expressions and the connection between these aspects. Lifestyles, traditions, and beliefs model intangible forms of use, such as the interpretation of climate predictors. Ancient roles of birds in local culture are ongoing, and new demand of ornamental birds from cities influences catching activities but local and regional regulations have contributed to maintain them below a critical level.

TI  - CM6: a comprehensive geomagnetic field model derived from both CHAMP and Swarm satellite observations
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - From the launch of the Orsted satellite in 1999, through the CHAMP mission from 2000 to 2010, and now with the Swarm constellation mission starting in 2013, satellite magnetometry has provided excellent monitoring of the near-Earth magnetic field regime. The advanced Comprehensive Inversion scheme has been applied to data before Swarm and to the Swarm data itself, but now for the first time to all the satellite data in this new era, culminating in the CM6 model. The highlights of this model include not only a continuous core magnetic field description over the entire time period 1999 to 2019.5 in good agreement with the CHAOS model series, but the addition of two new oceanic tidal magnetic sources: the larger lunar elliptic semi-diurnal constituent N-2 and the lunar diurnal constituent O-1. CM6 is also the parent model of the NASA/GSFC candidates for the DGRF2015 and IGRF2020 in response to the IGRF-13 call. This paper provides a full report on the development of CM6.

TI  - Temporal inventory of glaciers in the Suru sub-basin, western Himalaya: impacts of regional climate variability
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The importance of updated knowledge about the glacier extent and characteristics in the Himalaya cannot be overemphasized. Availability of precise glacier inventories in the latitudinally diverse western Himalayan region is particularly crucial. In this study we have created an inventory of the Suru sub-basin in the western Himalaya for the year 2017 using Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. Changes in glacier parameters have also been monitored from 1971 to 2017 using temporal satellite remote-sensing data and limited field observations. Inventory data show that the sub-basin has 252 glaciers covering 11 % of the basin, having an average slope of 25 +/- 6 degrees (standard deviations have been italicized throughout the text) and dominantly north orientation. The average snow line altitude (SLA) of the basin is 5011 +/- 54 m a.s.l. with smaller (47 %) and cleaner (43 %) glaciers occupying the bulk area. Long-term climate data (1901-2017) show an increase in the mean annual temperature (T-max and T-min) of 0.77 degrees C (0.25 and 1.3 degrees C) in the sub-basin, driving the overall glacier variability in the region. Temporal analysis reveals a glacier shrinkage of similar to 6 +/- 0.02 %, an average retreat rate of 4.3 +/- 1.02 m a(-1), debris increase of 62 % and a 22 +/- 60 m SLA increase in the past 46 years. This confirms their transitional response between the Karakoram and the Greater Himalayan Range (GHR) glaciers. Besides, glaciers in the sub-basin occupy two major ranges, the GHR and Ladakh Range (LR), and experience local climate variability, with the GHR glaciers exhibiting a warmer and wetter climate as compared to the LR glaciers. This variability manifests itself in the varied response of GHR and LR glaciers. While the GHR glaciers exhibit an overall rise in SLA (GHR: 49 +/- 69 m; LR: decrease of 18 +/- 50 m), the LR glaciers have deglaciated more (LR: 7 %; GHR: 6 %) with an enhanced accumulation of debris cover (LR: 73 %; GHR: 59 %). Inferences from this study reveal prevalence of glacier disintegration and overall degeneration, transition of clean ice to partially debris-covered glaciers, local climate variability and non-climatic (topographic and morphometric)factor-induced heterogeneity in glacier response as the major processes operating in this region. The Shukla et al. (2019) dataset is accessible at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.904131.

TI  - Low-cost Fluorescein as an Alternative to Radio-colloid for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy-a Prospective Validation Study in Early Breast Cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using radio-pharmaceutical (RP) and a blue dye is gold standard for axillary staging in clinically node-negative early breast cancer. High costs and limited availability of RP and/or gamma probe are major deterrents in performing SLNB in developing countries. Fluorescence-guided SLNB can obviate the need for RP and gamma probe. Fluorescein is an inexpensive fluorescent lymphatic tracer. In this study, we compared SLN identification rate (SLN-IR) and false negative rates (FNR) of fluorescein-guided SLNB and radio-guided SLNB using Tc-99m-Sulfur-colloid, in isolation, or in combination with methylene blue dye (MBD). Methods Sixty-five cN0 early and large operable breast cancer patients underwent validation SLNB using fluorescein (and blue LED light), Tc-99m-Sulfur-colloid (and gamma probe) and MBD. Inj Fluorescein 4% was injected, 1 ml each peri-tumoral and sub-areolar five minutes before axillary incision. Axillary dissection was performed irrespective of SLNB histology. The SLN-IR and FNR with various tracers and their combinations were compared. Results The mean number of SLNs identified was 3.5 +/- 1.8 (range 1-6). The SLN-IR using RP alone was 94%, fluorescein alone was 92%, and MBD alone was 82%. The SLN-IR using fluorescein plus MBD combination was 95.4%, compared to 97% using MBD plus RP combination. FNR was 6.3% using fluorescein plus MBD, as well as RP plus MBD combinations. Conclusions SLN-IR of > 90% and SLN-FNR of < 10% using fluorescein plus MBD combination are in acceptable range, and are comparable to that of RP plus MBD combination. Fluorescein can replace RP for performing SLNB, in combination with MBD.

TI  - Inverse modeling of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emissions over China using multisensor satellite data - Part 1: Formulation and sensitivity analysis
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - SO2 and NO2 observations from the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) sensor are used for the first time in conjunction with the GEOS-Chem adjoint model to optimize both SO2 and NOx emission estimates over China for October 2013. Separate and joint (simultaneous) optimizations of SO2 and NO2 emissions are both conducted and compared. Posterior emissions, compared to the prior, yield improvements in simulating columnar SO2 and NO2, in comparison to measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and OMPS. The posterior SO2 and NO, emissions from separate inversions are 748 Gg S and 672 Gg N, which are 36 % and 6 % smaller than prior MIX emissions (valid for 2010), respectively. In spite of the large reduction of SO2 emissions over the North China Plain, the simulated sulfate-nitrate-ammonium aerosol optical depth (AOD) only decrease slightly, which can be attributed to (a) nitrate rather than sulfate as the dominant contributor to AOD and (b) replacement of ammonium sulfate with ammonium nitrate as SO2 emissions are reduced. For joint inversions, both data quality control and the weight given to SO(2 )relative to NO2 observations can affect the spatial distributions of the posterior emissions. When the latter is properly balanced, the posterior emissions from assimilating OMPS SO2 and NO2 jointly yield a difference of -3 % to 15 % with respect to the separate assimilations for total anthropogenic SO2 emissions and +/- 2 % for total anthropogenic NO, emissions; but the differences can be up to 100 % for SO2 and 40 % for NO2 in some grid cells. Improvements on SO2 and NO2 simulations from the joint inversions are overall consistent with those from separate inversions. Moreover, the joint assimilations save similar to 50 % of the computational time compared to assimilating SO2 and NO2 separately in a sequential manner of computation. The sensitivity analysis shows that a perturbation of NH3 to 50 % (20 %) of the prior emission inventory can (a) have a negligible impact on the separate SO2 inversion but can lead to a decrease in posterior SO2 emissions over China by -2.4 % (-7.0 %) in total and up to -9.0 % (-27.7 %) in some grid cells in the joint inversion with NO2 and (b) yield posterior NOx emission decreases over China by -0.7 % (-2.8 %) for the separate NO2 inversion and by -2.7 % (-5.3 %) in total and up to -15.2 % (-29.4 %) in some grid cells for the joint inversion. The large reduction of SO2 between 2010 and 2013, however, only leads to similar to 10 % decrease in AOD regionally; reducing surface aerosol concentration requires the reduction of emissions of NH3 as well.

TI  - Inverse modeling of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emissions over China using multisensor satellite data - Part 2: Downscaling techniques for air quality analysis and forecasts
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Top-down emission estimates provide valuable up-to-date information on pollution sources; however, the computational effort and spatial resolution of satellite products involved with developing these emissions often require them to be estimated at resolutions that are much coarser than is necessary for regional air quality forecasting. This work thus introduces several approaches to downscaling coarse-resolution (2 degrees x 2.5 degrees) posterior SO2 and NOx emissions for improving air quality assessment and forecasts over China in October 2013. As in Part 1 of this study, these 2 degrees x 2.5 degrees posterior SO2 and NOx emission inventories are obtained from GEOS-Chem adjoint modeling with the constraints of OMPS SO2 and NO2 products retrieved at 50km x 50km at nadir and similar to 190km x 50km at the edge of ground track. The prior emission inventory (MIX) and the posterior GEOS-Chem simulations of surface SO2 and NO2 concentrations at coarse resolution underestimate observed hot spots, which is called the coarse-grid smearing (CGS) effect. To mitigate the CGS effect, four methods are developed: (a) downscale 2 degrees x 2.5 degrees GEOS -Chem surface SO2 and NO2 concentrations to the resolution of 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees through a dynamic downscaling concentration (MIX-DDC) approach, which assumes that the 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees simulation using the prior MIX emissions has the correct spatial distribution of SO2 and NO2 concentrations but a systematic bias; (b) downscale surface NO2 simulations at 2 degrees x 2.5 degrees to 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees ac- cording to the spatial distribution of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime light (NL) observations (e.g., NL-DC approach) based on correlation between VIIRS NL intensity with TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) NO2 observations; (c) downscale posterior emissions (DE) of SO2 and NOx to 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees with the assumption that the prior fine-resolution MIX inventory has the correct spatial distribution (e.g., MIX-DE approach); and (d) downscale posterior NOx emissions using VIIRS NL observations (e.g., NL-DE approach).Numerical experiments reveal that (a) using the MIX-DDC approach, posterior SO2 and NO2 simulations improve on the corresponding MIX prior simulations with normalized centered root mean square error (NCRMSE) decreases of 63.7 % and 30.2 %, respectively; (b) the posterior NO2 simulation has an NCRMSE that is 17.9 % smaller than the prior when they are both downscaled through NL-DC, and NL-DC is able to better mitigate the CGS effect than MIX-DDC; (c) the simulation at 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees using the MIX-DE approach has NCRMSEs that are 58.8 % and 14.7 % smaller than the prior 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees MIX simulation for surface SO2 and NO2 concentrations, respectively, but the RMSE from the MIXDE posterior simulation is slightly larger than that from the MIX-DDC posterior simulation for both SO2 and NO2; (d) the NL-DE posterior NO2 simulation also improves on the prior MIX simulation at 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees, but it is worse than the MIX-DE posterior simulation; (e) in terms of evaluating the downscaled SO2 and NO2 simulations simultaneously, using the posterior SO2 and NOx emissions from joint inverse modeling of both species is better than only using one (SO2 or NOx) emission from corresponding single-species inverse modeling and is similar to using the posterior emissions of SO2 and NOx emission inventories respectively from single-species inverse modeling.Forecasts of surface concentrations for November 2013 using the posterior emissions obtained by applying the posterior MIX-DE emissions for October 2013 with the monthly variation information derived from the prior MIX emission inventory show that (a) the improvements of forecasting surface SO2 concentrations through MIX-DE and MIX-DDC are comparable; (b) for the NO2 forecast, MIX-DE shows larger improvement than NL-DE and MIX-DDC; (c) NL-DC is able to better decrease the CGS effect than MIX-DE but shows larger NCRMSE; (d) the forecast of surface O-3 concentrations is improved by MIX-DE downscaled posterior NOx emissions. Overall, for practical forecasting of air quality, it is recommended to use satellite-based observation already available from the last month to jointly constrain SO2 and NO2 emissions at coarser resolution and then downscale these posterior emissions at finer spatial resolution suitable for regional air quality modeling for the present month.

TI  - Spatial regionalisation of morphometric characteristics of mini watershed of Northern Foreland of Peninsular India
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The morphometric (geomorphic) parameters are reconnaissance tools used to analyse and evaluate the different aspects of a river basin (watershed) such as lithological characteristics, geomorphic landforms, and hydrological behaviour. In this study, a recurrent drought-affected Barua watershed of Tons river basin has been selected for detailed analysis of spatial regionalisation of morphometric characteristics. This mini watershed has been studied using topographic maps (1:50,000 scale), satellite images (CARTOSAT DEM of 1 '' or similar to 32-m resolution), extensive field surveys, and generated isopleth maps of morphometric parameters in GIS environment using ArcGIS 10.2.2. The areal parameters indicate elongated shape of the basin, hilly region, and moderate-to-steeper ground slope. More than 85% of the area have gentle-to-moderate slope (2-10 degrees); steep slope found along the escarpment of the Bhander Plateau; more than half of the area has above 30 m of basin relief. Hypsometric integral (HI) is 0.47, and the shape of hypsometric curve is sigmoidal; it indicate equilibrium stage of the watershed. The correlation matrix enables that the correlation coefficient between drainage attributes (as drainage density, stream frequency, and drainage texture) are reflecting very strong positive correlation and ranges from 0.83 to 0.91, and the basin relief showing very strong positive correlation with dissection index (0.99), moderately positive correlation with average slope and ruggedness number. The HI and length of overland flow (L-o) are show weak correlation with the other variables. It means the high drainage density, stream frequency, and drainage texture are associated with moderately hilly region, less permeable rock, and high run-off, giving less time for infiltration. Hence, hilly and rocky surfaces of the region are identified as poor groundwater-potential zones, while the areas of alluvial valley plain are characterised as better groundwater-potential zones.

TI  - Sentinel node identification with [99mTc]-tilmanocept SPECT/CT: a pictorial essay of clinical applications
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The recently developed radiopharmaceutical for sentinel node depiction is the mannose derivate Tilmanocept (Lymphoseek(R)). [99mTc]-tilmanocept, as a receptor-binding molecular imaging agent, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency in 2014 for lymphatic mapping and lymph-node localization in breast cancer, melanoma, clinically node-negative squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, and other solid tumors. Methods Selected patients were enrolled in a retrospective study on the use of [99mTc]-tilmanocept planar scintigraphy, and SPECT/CT in melanoma, oral and breast cancer. Results In this pictorial review, we present, in a clinical series of nine patients, the most commonly observed SLN identification findings and the related benefits using planar scintigraphy and SPECT/CT [99mTc]-tilmanocept in melanoma, oral and breast cancer. Discussion [99mTc]-tilmanocept SPECT/CT resulted in an excellent choice for preoperative lymphatic mapping and presented an optimal biodistribution with a rapid injection-site clearance and persistent SLN retention that could lead to improved accuracy of sentinel node identification in selected cases of melanoma, oral and breast cancer.

TI  - Sentinel optical and SAR data highlights multi-segment faulting during the 2018 Palu-Sulawesi earthquake (M<sub>w</sub> 7.5)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main active tectonic structure in the western part of Central Sulawesi (Indonesia) is the left-lateral Palu-Koro strike-slip fault. Its offshore section was thought not to have broken during the M-w 7.5 Palu Earthquake on 28 September 2018, challenging the established knowledge of the tectonic setting at this location. Here, we use Sentinel-1 SAR interferometry to produce a map of the ground velocities in the area of the M-w 7.5 earthquake for the seven months following the 2018 earthquake. We show evidence of surface deformation along the western coast of the Palu bay, indicating that the Palu Koro offshore fault section might have contribute to or been affected by the earthquake. As the possibility of multi-segment ruptures is a high concern in the area because of the high seismic and tsunami hazard, we present here, a fault model that includes the offshore section of the Palu-Koro fault. Thanks to four independents space-based geodetics measurements of the co-seismic displacement (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 correlograms) we constrain the 3D co-seismic ground displacements. The modeling of these displacements allows us to estimate the co-seismic fault slip amplitude and geometry at depth. At the end, we consider the multi-segment faulting scenario, including the offshore section of the Palu-Koro fault, as a plausible model to explain the submarine landslides and the tsunamis. This study also gives the opportunity to observe a super-shear earthquake in the context of a complex fault network and implies an increase in the probability of submarine landslides within the bay in the forthcoming years.

TI  - Implications of climate variability and changing seasonal hydrology for subarctic riverbank erosion
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Warmer climatic conditions have been associated with numerous hydrologic changes that may impact riverbank erosion in cold regions, but the net effect is not well understood. We used regression and correlation analyses to examine the relationships among subarctic riverbank erosion and seasonal hydrology, the impact of climate change and variability, and the societal implications. Geomorphic change (loss and gain of vegetated land) was mapped along several river reaches in the Yukon River Basin, Alaska, throughout 1984 and 2017 using Landsat satellite imagery. Annual erosion rates were estimated from these spatial data. At most study sites, erosion rates (km(2)/year) were either positively correlated (r = 0.68-0.84, p = 0.0085-0.061) with monthly mean discharge within the cold season or inversely correlated (r = - 0.74 - -0.62, p < 0.10) with river ice breakup date in the spring. These proximate controls on erosion, in turn, were influenced both by climate variability and long-term climatic change. We conclude that increased cold season discharge and earlier freshet that occurs under warmer conditions enhance riverbank erosion in most areas. Climate-related changes to fluvial dynamics may impact communities through effects on infrastructure, travel safety, channel navigability, fish and wildlife habitat, and access to subsistence resources.

TI  - Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for mark-resight nesting population estimation of adult female green sea turtles at Raine Island
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nester abundance is a key measure of the performance of the world's largest green turtle rookery at Raine Island, Australia, and has been estimated by mark-resight counts since 1984. Nesters are first marked by painting their carapace with a longitudinal white stripe. Painted and unpainted turtles are then counted by a surface observer on a small boat in waters adjacent to the reef. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and underwater video may provide more cost-effective and less biased alternatives to this approach, but estimates must be comparable with historical estimates. Here we compare and evaluate the three methods. We found comparatively little variation in resighting probabilities between consecutive days of sampling or time of day, which supports an underlying assumption of the method (i.e. demographic closure during sampling). This lack of bias in the location availability for detection of painted versus unpainted turtles and further supported by a parallel satellite tracking study of 40 turtles at Raine Island. Our results demonstrated that surface observers consistently reported higher proportions of marked turtles than either the UAV or underwater video method. This in turn yielded higher population estimates with UAV or underwater video compared to the historical surface observer method, which suggested correction factors of 1.53 and 1.73 respectively. We attributed this to observer search error because a white marked turtle is easier to spot than the non-marked turtle. In contrast, the UAV and underwater video methods allowed subsequent frame-by-frame review, thus reducing observer search error. UAVs were the most efficient in terms of survey time, personnel commitment and weather tolerance compared to the other methods. However, underwater video may also be a useful alternative for in-water mark-resight surveys of turtles.

TI  - Mapping summer soybean and corn with remote sensing on Google Earth Engine cloud computing in Parana state - Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian farming influences directly the worldwide economy. Thus, fast and reliable information on areas sown with the main crops is essential for planning logistics and public or private commodity market policies. Recent farming practices have embraced remote sensing to provide fast and reliable information on commodity dynamics. Medium-to-low resolution free orbital images, such as those from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2, have been used for crop mapping; however, satellite image processing requires high computing power, especially when monitoring vast areas. Therefore, cloud data processing has been the only feasible option to deal with a large amount of orbital data and its processing and analysis. Thus, our goal was to develop a method to map the two main crops (soybeans and corn) in Parana, one of the major Brazilian state producers. Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, SRTM+, and field data from 2016 to 2018 were used with the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering segmentation method and the Continuous Naive Bayes classifier, to identify cropped areas. A minimum global accuracy of 90% was found for both crops. Comparison with field data showed correlations of 0.96 and agreement coefficients no lower than 0.86. This ensures mapping quality when using Sentinel and/or Landsat imagery on the GEE platform.

T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vaginal cancer is a rare occurrence. Since November 2018 the S2k guidelines for the treatment are freely available from the homepage of the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF). Due to the lack of case numbers and studies, these guidelines are essentially based on expert opinions of the committee on the vulva and vagina of the Working Group for Gynecological Oncology (AGO) and methodologically on the consensus process of the AWMF. As no randomized studies can be expected in the foreseeable future, healthcare research generating knowledge on this rare oncological entity should be carried out with the assistance of a national interdisciplinary cancer register for vaginal cancer. The short form of the guidelines presented in this article provide the framework conditions for the diagnostics, treatment and aftercare.

TI  - Fast stripe noise removal from hyperspectral image via multi-scale dilated unidirectional convolution
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often contaminated by noises due to the multi-detector imaging systems, which greatly affects the subsequent HSIs interpretation and application. The 3D HSIs deliver extra spectral information, which makes the most existing destriping algorithms hardly satisfied, and the complete stripes removal and less test time consuming remain to be overcome. To meet these challenges, we present a multi-scale dilated unidirectional convolution network (MsDUC) with the following contributions. First, the deep learning-based method can fully exploit and preserve spatial-spectral correlations in 3D HSIs while the conventional methods failed to realize it. Second, different dilated convolution learns different scale features, so the introduced multi-scale dilated convolution could get more contextual information for the final restoration. Third, the clear directional signature of stripe noise and the unidirectional total variation (UTV) model inspired us to put forward the unidirectional convolution to capture the directional signature of stripe, meanwhile, the less trainable parameters and the utilized residual strategy speed up the learning process. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms many of the state-of-the-art methods in both image restoration performance and test running time. Our code can be download from.

TI  - A Nomogram Model of Radiomics and Satellite Sign Number as Imaging Predictor for Intracranial Hematoma Expansion
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We aimed to construct and validate a nomogram model based on the combination of radiomic features and satellite sign number for predicting intracerebral hematoma expansion. Methods A total of 129 patients from two institutions were enrolled in this study. The preprocessed initial CT images were used for radiomic feature extraction. The ANOVA-Kruskal-Wallis test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were applied to identify candidate radiomic features and construct the Radscore. A nomogram model was developed by integrating the Radscore with a satellite sign number. The discrimination performance of the proposed model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the predictive accuracy was assessedviaa calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis were performed to evaluate the clinical value of the model. Results Four optimal features were ultimately selected and contributed to the Radscore construction. A positive correlation was observed between the satellite sign number and Radscore (Pearson'sr: 0.451). The nomogram model showed the best performance with high area under the curves in both training cohort (0.881, sensitivity: 0.973; specificity: 0.787) and external validation cohort (0.857, sensitivity: 0.950; specificity: 0.766). The calibration curve, DCA, and KM analysis indicated the high accuracy and clinical usefulness of the nomogram model for hematoma expansion prediction. Conclusion A nomogram model of integrated radiomic signature and satellite sign number based on noncontrast CT images could serve as a reliable and convenient measurement of hematoma expansion prediction.

TI  - How much damage do serial homicide offenders wrought while the innocent rot in prison? A tabulation of preventable deaths as outcomes of sentinel events
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY CRIME & LAW
M3  - Article
AB  - The criminal justice system has allowed serial homicide offenders (SHOs) to commit additional homicides by failing to identify them after their initial homicide. Recidivism has been possible in instances where the SHO benefited from the wrongful incarceration of an innocent person for one of their homicides. Data from the National Registry of Exonerations was utilized to tabulate the full extent of these sentinel events, defined as the number of deaths that could have been prevented. Additional research was conducted to identify where victims fell in the offender's killing sequence. This ancillary data revealed the number of victims whose deaths could have been prevented had the offender been apprehended earlier in their series of homicides. Sixty-two SHOs were responsible for 249 deaths, 114 of which were committed after an innocent person was incarcerated for the SHO's initial homicide. To prevent further loss of life, law enforcement must: act upon accurate information; lower the SHO evidentiary threshold; prevent personal bias from influencing investigative steps; obtain training in the behavior of SHOs; admit mistakes; and re-examine convictions if wrongdoing is suspected.

TI  - An accurate and efficient radiative transfer model for simulating all-sky images from Fengyun satellite radiometers
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forward radiative transfer models (RTM) are an indispensable tool for quantitative applications of satellite radiometers, e.g., for data calibration, instrument development, retrieval, and so on. In this study, we develop an accurate and efficient RTM for radiometers onboard Fengyun satellites, namely FYRTM (RTM for Fengyun Radiometers). Correlated k-distribution models are developed to improve the computational efficiency for gas absorption, and the effects of cloud and aerosol multiple scattering and emission are accelerated with pre-computed look-up tables. FYRTM is evaluated with a rigorous simulation based on discrete ordinate radiative transfer model (DISORT) as well as a popular fast forward model, i.e., the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM). Results indicate that FYRTM-based simulations are two to three orders of magnitudes faster than the DISORT-based simulations. Compared to the rigorous model, FYRTM relative errors are within 2% at solar channels, and brightness temperatures (BT) differences are within 1 K at infrared channels. Compared with CRTM, FYRTM is computationally similar at solar channels, but three times faster at infrared channels. Furthermore, simulated reflectances/BTs using FYRTM are in a good agreement with the satellite observations. Overall, FYRTM is capable to simulate satellite observations under different atmospheric conditions, and can be extended to other radiometers onboard the Fengyun satellites (both geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites). It is expected to play important roles in future applications with Fengyun observations.

AB  - Tunde Kelani is a Yoruba filmmaker whose auteurial vision deploys Yoruba cultural dynamics towards the understanding of not only Yoruba people's beingness, but also of their place in the plural existence of the Nigerian state. This article takes seriously Tunde Kelani's philosophical sensibility, grounded in the Yoruba worldview, as a means by which Kelani relates with the world. The article argues that, although Tunde Kelani's cultural philosophy serves as the basis for his cinematic vision and his search for cultural authenticity, his neotraditionalism fails to sufficiently interrogate the Yoruba concept ofasaand its implication for what it means to be Yoruba in the world today. This significantly undermines the capacity of his auteurial vision to project cinematic possibilities that nevertheless extend what it means to be Yoruba in the world.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel node navigation surgery reduces the extent of gastric and lymph node dissection, and may improve quality of life. The benefit and harm of laparoscopic sentinel node navigation surgery (LSNNS) for early gastric cancer is unknown. The SENORITA (SEntinel Node ORIented Tailored Approach) trial investigated the pathological and surgical outcomes of LSNNS compared with laparoscopic standard gastrectomy (LSG) with lymph node dissection.Methods The SENORITA trial was an investigator-initiated, open-label, parallel-assigned, non-inferiority, multicentre RCT conducted in Korea. The primary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival. The secondary endpoints, morbidity and mortality within 30 days of surgery, are reported in the present study.Results A total of 580 patients were randomized to LSG (292) or LSNNS (288). Surgery was undertaken in 527 patients (LSG 269, LSNNS 258). LSNNS could be performed according to the protocol in 245 of 258 patients, and a sentinel node basin was detected in 237 (96 center dot 7 per cent) Stomach-preserving surgery was carried out in 210 of 258 patients (81 center dot 4 per cent). Postoperative complications occurred in 51 patients in the LSG group (19 center dot 0 per cent) and 40 (15 center dot 5 per cent) in the LSNNS group (P = 0 center dot 294). Complications with a Clavien-Dindo grade of III or higher occurred in 16 (5 center dot 9 per cent) and 13 (5 center dot 0 per cent) patients in the LSG and LSNNS groups respectively (P = 0 center dot 647).Conclusion The rate and severity of complications following LSNNS for early gastric cancer are comparable to those after LSG with lymph node dissection.

TI  - Assessing distribution shifts and ecophysiological characteristics of the only Antarctic winged midge under climate change scenarios
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Parts of Antarctica were amongst the most rapidly changing regions of the planet during the second half of the Twentieth Century. Even so, today, most of Antarctica remains in the grip of continental ice sheets, with only about 0.2% of its overall area being ice-free. The continent's terrestrial fauna consists only of invertebrates, with just two native species of insects, the chironomid midges Parochlus steinenii and Belgica antarctica. We integrate ecophysiological information with the development of new high-resolution climatic layers for Antarctica, to better understand how the distribution of P. steinenii may respond to change over the next century under different IPCC climate change scenarios. We conclude that the species has the potential to expand its distribution to include parts of the west and east coasts of the Antarctic Peninsula and even coastal ice-free areas in parts of continental Antarctica. We propose P. steinenii as an effective native sentinel and indicator species of climate change in the Antarctic.

TI  - Adenovirus emergence in a red squirrel (<i>Sciurus vulgaris</i>) in Iberian Peninsula
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Adenoviruses (AdV) are pathogens capable of infecting animals and humans leading to a wide spectrum of diseases. They have a widespread geographical dissemination and infect several species, including red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris). In the Iberian Peninsula, there are no reports of infection of red squirrels by AdV. In this study, we report for the first time the detection of squirrel AdV in a red squirrel trapped in central Portugal. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences obtained for the hexon and the penton base genes were similar to the Korean squirrel AdV strain and strongly divergent from the strains present in red squirrels in Europe. These findings indicate the emergence of a new strain circulating in Europe and raise concerns regarding the conservation of the red squirrel.

TI  - Seasonal and Spatial Variability in Patchiness of Microphytobenthos on Intertidal Flats From Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial structure of microphytobenthos (MPB) on intertidal flats is necessary to gain insight in the benthic community structure and ecosystem processes. The increasing availability of high resolution satellite sensors provides the opportunity to better understand spatial patterns of MPB on various (meter to km) scales. We tested how MPB patch size (indicated by the range derived from a semi-variogram) and degree of patchiness (indicated by the sill) vary as function of seasons, salinity, tidal flat type (muddy fringing versus sandy mid-channel tidal flats) or ecotopes (defined by hydrodynamics, silt content and elevation), in the Westerschelde estuary, the Netherlands. We used Sentinel-2 imagery (2016-2019) with 10 m spatial resolution to derive (omnidirectional) semi-variogram parameters from the NDVI (used as indicator for MPB biomass) and evaluated (seasonality in) patchiness of MPB in the different categories. We demonstrated that MPB patch size (the range) remains constant from winter to summer, while the sill increased from winter to summer. The location of patches on tidal flats was variable throughout the year and shows a remarkable similarity with seasonality in the spatial heterogeneity of the silt content on tidal flats. The patch size and degree of patchiness is higher on relatively sandy mid-channel tidal flats than on relatively silt rich fringing tidal flats. This implies that spatial patterning of MPB biomass on the meso-scale is likely closely linked to abiotic conditions and that spreading processes or grazing activity play a minor role. We observed visually that some areas with a relatively high MPB biomass ('patches') remain visible throughout the year, while other patches were only present during a particular season.

TI  - Four-dimensional surface motions of the Slumgullion landslide and quantification of hydrometeorological forcing
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides modify the natural landscape and cause fatalities and property damage worldwide. Quantifying landslide dynamics is challenging due to the stochastic nature of the environment. With its large area of similar to 1 km(2) and perennial motions at similar to 10-20mm per day, the Slumgullion landslide in Colorado, USA, represents an ideal natural laboratory to better understand landslide behavior. Here, we use hybrid remote sensing data and methods to recover the four-dimensional surface motions during 2011-2018. We refine the boundaries of an area of similar to 0.35 km(2) below the crest of the prehistoric landslide. We construct a mechanical framework to quantify the rheology, subsurface channel geometry, mass flow rate, and spatiotemporally dependent pore-water pressure feedback through a joint analysis of displacement and hydrometeorological measurements from ground, air and space. Our study demonstrates the importance of remotely characterizing often inaccessible, dangerous slopes to better understand landslides and other quasi-static mass fluxes in natural and industrial environments, which will ultimately help reduce associated hazards.

TI  - Measuring river planform changes from remotely sensed data - a Monte Carlo approach to assessing the impact of spatially variable error
T2  - EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data from fluvial systems are extensively used to document historical planform changes. However, geometric and delineation errors inherently associated with these data can result in poor or even misleading interpretation of measured changes, especially rates of channel lateral migration. It is thus imperative to take into account a spatially variable (SV) error affecting the remotely sensed data. In the wake of recent key studies using this SV error as a level of detection, we introduce a new framework to evaluate the significance of measured channel migration. Going beyond linear metrics (i.e. migration vectors between diachronic river centrelines), we assess significance through a channel polygon method yielding a surficial metric (i.e. quantification of eroded, deposited, or eroded-then-deposited surfaces).Our study area is a mid-sized active wandering river: the lower Bruche, a similar to 20m wide tributary of the Rhine in eastern France. Within our four test sub-reaches, the active channel is digitised using diachronic orthophotos (1950 and 1964), and the SV error affecting the data is interpolated with an inverse-distance weighting (IDW) technique. The novelty of our approach arises from then running Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to randomly translate active channels and propagate geometric and delineation errors according to the SV error. This eventually leads to the computation of percentage of uncertainties associated with each of the measured planform changes, which allows us to evaluate the significance of the planform changes. In the lower Bruche, the uncertainty associated with the documented changes ranges from 15.8% to 52.9 %.Our results show that (i) orthophotos are affected by a significant SV error; (ii) the latter strongly affects the uncertainty of measured changes; and (iii) the significance of changes is dependent on both the magnitude and the shape of the surficial changes. Taking the SV error into account is strongly recommended even in orthorectified aerial photos, especially in the case of mid-sized rivers (< 30m width) and/or low-amplitude river planform changes (< 1m(2)m(-1) yr(-1)). In addition to allowing detection of low-magnitude planform changes, our approach is also transferable as we use well-established tools (IDW and MC): this opens new perspectives in the fluvial context (e.g. multi-thread river channels) for robustly assessing surficial channel changes.

TI  - Evaluating Sentinel-1A datasets for rice leaf area index estimation based on machine learning regression models
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Three Sentinel-1A datasets in vertical transmitted and horizontal received (VH) and vertical transmitted and vertical received (VV) polarisations, and the linear combination of VH and VV (VHVV) are evaluated for rice green leaf area index (LAI) estimation using four machine learning regression models [Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT)]. Results showed that for the entire growing season, VV outperformed VH, recording an R(2)of 0.68 and an RMSE of 0.98 m(2)/m(2)with the k-NN model. However, VHVV produced the most accurate estimates with GBDT (R(2)of 0.82 and RMSE of 0.68 m(2)/m(2)), followed by that of VHVV with RF (R(2)of 0.78 and RMSE of 0.90 m(2)/m(2)). Our findings have further confirmed that combining VH and VV data can achieve improved rice growth modelling, and that tree-based algorithms can better handle data dimensionality.

TI  - Axillary nodal metastatic burden in patients with breast cancer with clinically positive axillary nodes
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The aim of this study was to determine preoperative factors and tumour characteristics related to a high nodal tumour burden in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer. These findings were used to construct a predictive tool to evaluate the patient-specific risk of having more than two axillary lymph node metastases.Methods Altogether, 507 consecutive patients with breast cancer and axillary lymph node metastasis diagnosed by preoperative ultrasound-guided needle biopsy were reviewed. These patients underwent breast surgery and axillary lymph node dissection at Helsinki University Hospital between 2010 and 2014. Patients were grouped into those with one or two, and those with more than two lymph node metastases.Results There were 153 patients (30 center dot 2 per cent) with one or two lymph node metastases and 354 (69 center dot 8 per cent) with more than two metastases. Five-year disease-free survival was poorer for the latter group (P = 0 center dot 032). Five-year overall survival estimates for patients with one or two and those with more than two lymph node metastases were 87 center dot 0 and 81 center dot 4 per cent respectively (P = 0 center dot 215). In multivariable analysis, factors significantly associated with more than two lymph node metastases were: age, tumour size, lymphovascular invasion in the primary tumour, extracapsular extension of metastasis in lymph nodes, and morphology of lymph nodes. These factors were included in a multivariable predictive model, which had an area under the curve of 0 center dot 828 (95 per cent c.i. 0 center dot 787 to 0 center dot 869).Conclusion The present study provides a patient-specific prediction model for evaluating nodal tumour burden in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer.

TI  - Accuracy assessment of ALOS AW3D30 DSM and comparison to ALOS PRISM DSM created with classical photogrammetric techniques
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study the accuracy of ALOS Global Digital Surface Model (AW3D30) with a point spacing of approx. 30-meter mesh was examined, taking as a case study several areas of Greece with complex geomorphologic characteristics. DSMs from ALOS stereo pairs were created using classical photogrammetric techniques. These DSMs were compared with the ALOS AW3D30 and a DEM created from digitized contours. Visual and statistical comparison of the DSMs has been performed.Check Points of known elevation selected from the National Trigonometric Network have been used to estimate the accuracy of the DSMs and the results are presented herein. It has been proved that the freely available AW3D30 DSM presents two or three times lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) than the respective DSMs from ALOS PRISM images. In areas with low relief such as Antiparos Island in the Cyclades complex, the ALOS AW3D30 RMSE is only 2.69 m, while in Areas with high relief such as the Chania Prefecture in Western Crete the respective error rises up to 14m. In urban area such as Athens, the capital of Greece, the respective error ranges around 12m due to the complex urban environment (high buildings, narrow urban roads, moving vehicles etc.).

TI  - Snow depth estimation and historical data reconstruction over China based on a random forest machine learning approach
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the potential capability of the random forest (RF) machine learning (ML) model to estimate snow depth in this work. Four combinations composed of critical predictor variables were used to train the RF model. Then, we utilized three validation datasets from out-of-bag (OOB) samples, a temporal subset, and a spatiotemporal subset to verify the fitted RF algorithms. The results indicated the following: (1) the accuracy of the RF model is greatly influenced by geographic location, elevation, and land cover fractions; (2) however, the redundant predictor variables (if highly correlated) slightly affect the RF model; and (3) the fitted RF algorithms perform better on temporal than spatial scales, with unbiased root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of similar to 4.4 and similar to 7.3 cm, respectively. Finally, we used the fitted RF2 algorithm to retrieve a consistent 32-year daily snow depth dataset from 1987 to 2018. This product was evaluated against the independent station observations during the period 1987-2018. The mean unbiased RMSE and bias were 7.1 and -0.05 cm, respectively, indicating better performance than that of the former snow depth dataset (8.4 and -1.20 cm) from the Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China (WESTDC). Although the RF product was superior to the WESTDC dataset, it still underestimated deep snow cover (> 20 cm), with biases of -10.4, -8.9, and -34.1 cm for northeast China (NEC), northern Xinjiang (XJ), and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), respectively. Additionally, the long-term snow depth datasets (station observations, RF estimates, and WESTDC product) were analyzed in terms of temporal and spatial variations over China. On a temporal scale, the ground truth snow depth presented a significant increasing trend from 1987 to 2018, especially in NEC. However, the RF and WESTDC products displayed no significant changing trends except on the QTP. The WESTDC product presented a significant decreasing trend on the QTP, with a correlation coefficient of -0.55, whereas there were no significant trends for ground truth observations and the RF product. For the spatial characteristics, similar trend patterns were observed for RF and WESTDC products over China. These characteristics presented significant decreasing trends in most areas and a significant increasing trend in central NEC.

TI  - Impact of climate change on net primary production (NPP) in south Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is a natural hazard which threatens the sustainable development of human health, food security, economic well-being, and natural resources. It also affects photosynthesis, plant respiration, and decomposition of organic matter that contribute to atmospheric carbon flow. The net primary production (NPP) is one of the main components of carbon balance. This study investigated the impact of climatic change on the net production in the Hormozgan county in south Iran. To obtain NPP, MODIS NPP product (MOD17A3) was used and future temperature and precipitation values were obtained using the HadGEM2-ES model under the RCP4.5 scenario. These values were downscaled using the LARSWG 6 statistical model, and precipitation and temperature were simulated for the RCP4.5 scenario. For further analysis, NPP was simulated based on the BIOME-BGC model and compared with the NPP data obtained from the MODIS images. Comparison of the climatic parameters of the basic (2001-2015) and future (2016-2030) periods indicated an increase in precipitation, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature of the study area and subsequently an increase in the NPP value in all biomes (averagely 17.73%) in the future. The highest NPP values were observed in the central and western parts of the region in biomes 4 (mangrove forest cover), 10 (broadleaf forest vegetation), and 6, 5, and 1 (rangeland vegetation), respectively, and the lowest values were observed in the eastern parts. Results showed that the increase in future NPP could be due to the increase in precipitation.

TI  - Nodal and systemic recurrence following observation of a positive sentinel lymph node in melanoma
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Two RCTs found no survival benefit for completion lymphadenectomy after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy compared with observation with ultrasound in patients with melanoma. Recurrence patterns and regional control are not well described for patients undergoing observation alone.Methods All patients with a positive sentinel node biopsy who did not have immediate completion lymphadenectomy were identified from a single-institution database (1995-2018). First recurrences were classified as node only, local and in-transit (LCIT) only, LCIT and nodal, or systemic. Regional control and factors associated with recurrence survival were analysed.Results Median follow-up was 33 months. Of 370 patients, 158 (42 center dot 7 per cent) had a recurrence. The sites of first recurrence were node only (13 center dot 2 per cent), LCIT only (11 center dot 9 per cent), LCIT and nodal (3 center dot 5 per cent), and systemic (13 center dot 8 per cent). The 3-year postrecurrence melanoma-specific survival rate was 73 (95 per cent c.i. 54 to 86) per cent for patients with node-only first recurrence, and 51 (31 to 68) per cent for those with initial systemic recurrence. In multivariable analysis, ulceration in the primary lesion (hazard ratio (HR) 2 center dot 53, 95 per cent c.i. 1 center dot 27 to 5 center dot 04), disease-free interval 12 months or less (HR 2 center dot 38, 1 center dot 28 to 4 center dot 35), and systemic (HR 2 center dot 57, 1 center dot 16 to 5 center dot 65) or LCIT and nodal (HR 2 center dot 94, 1 center dot 11 to 7 center dot 79) first recurrence were associated significantly with decreased postrecurrence survival. Maintenance of regional control required therapeutic lymphadenectomy in 13 center dot 0 per cent of patients during follow-up.Conclusion Observation after a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy is associated with good regional control, permits assessment of the time to and pattern of recurrence, and spares lymphadenectomy-related morbidity in patients with melanoma.

TI  - Evaluation of WaPOR V2 evapotranspiration products across Africa
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) portal to monitor water productivity through open-access of remotely sensed derived data (WaPOR) offers continuous actual evapotranspiration and interception (ETIa-WPR) data at a 10-day basis across Africa and the Middle East from 2009 onwards at three spatial resolutions. The continental level (250 m) covers Africa and the Middle East (L1). The national level (100 m) covers 21 countries and 4 river basins (L2). The third level (30 m) covers eight irrigation areas (L3). To quantify the uncertainty of WaPOR version 2 (V2.0) ETIa-WPR in Africa, we used a number of validation methods. We checked the physical consistency against water availability and the long-term water balance and then verify the continental spatial and temporal trends for the major climates in Africa. We directly validated ETIa-WPR against in situ data of 14 eddy covariance stations (EC). Finally, we checked the level consistency between the different spatial resolutions. Our findings indicate that ETIa-WPR is performing well, but with some noticeable overestimation. The ETIa-WPR is showing expected spatial and temporal consistency with respect to climate classes. ETIa-WPR shows mixed results at point scale as compared to EC flux towers with an overall correlation of 0.71, and a root mean square error of 1.2 mm/day. The level consistency is very high between L1 and L2. However, the consistency between L1 and L3 varies significantly between irrigation areas. In rainfed areas, the ETIa-WPR is overestimating at low ETIa-WPR and underestimating when ETIa is high. In irrigated areas, ETIa-WPR values appear to be consistently overestimating ETa. The relative soil moisture content (SMC), the input of quality layers and local advection effects were some of the identified causes. The quality assessment of ETIa-WPR product is enhanced by combining multiple evaluation methods. Based on the results, the ETIa-WPR dataset is of enough quality to contribute to the understanding and monitoring of local and continental water processes and water management.

TI  - Effect of hypofractionation on the incidental axilla dose during tangential field radiotherapy in breast cancer
T2  - STRAHLENTHERAPIE UND ONKOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Tangential field irradiation in breast cancer potentially treats residual tumor cells in the axilla after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). In recent years, hypofractionated radiotherapy has gained importance and currently represents the recommended standard in adjuvant breast cancer treatment for many patients. So far, the impact of hypofractionation on the effect of incidental lymph node irradiation has not be addressed. Materials and methods Biological effective dose (BED) and tumor control probability (TCP) were estimated for four different hypofractionated radiation schemes (42.50 Gy in 16 fractions [Fx]; 40.05 Gy in 15 Fx; 27 Gy in 5 Fx; and 26 in 5 Fx) and compared to conventional fractionation (50 Gy in 25 Fx). For calculation of BED and TCP, a previously published radiobiological model with an alpha/beta ratio of 4 Gy was used. The theoretical BED and TCP for incidental irradiation between 0 and 100% of the prescribed dose were evaluated. Subsequently, we assessed BED and TCP in 431 axillary lymph node metastases. Results The extent of incidental lymph node irradiation and the fractionation scheme have a direct impact on BED and TCP. The estimated mean TCP in the axillary nodes ranged from 1.5 +/- 6.4% to 57.5 +/- 22.9%, depending on the patient's anatomy and the fractionation scheme. Hypofractionation led to a significant reduction of mean TCP of lymph node metastases for all schedules. Conclusion Our data indicate that hypofractionation might affect the effectiveness of incidental radiotherapy in the axilla. This is particularly relevant for patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes who receive SLNB only.

TI  - Prediction of Photochemically Produced Reactive Intermediates in Surface Waters via Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Absorption of solar radiation by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in surface waters results in the formation of photochemically produced reactive intermediates (PPRIs) that react with pollutants in water. Knowing the steady-state concentrations of PPRIs ([PPRI](ss)) is critical to predicting the persistence of pollutants in sunlit surface waters. CDOM levels (a(440)) can be measured remotely for lakes over large areas using satellite imagery. Laboratory measurements of [PPRI](ss) as and apparent quantum yields (Phi) of three PPRIs ((DOM)-D-3*, O-1(2), and center dot OH) were made for 24 lake samples under simulated sunlight. The total rate of light absorption by the water samples (R-a), the rates of formation (R-f), and [PPRI](ss) of (DOM)-D-3* and( 1)O(2) linearly increased with increasing a(440). The production rate of center dot OH was linearly correlated with a(440), but the steady-state concentration was best fit by a logarithmic function. The relationship between measured a(440) and Landsat 8 reflectance was used to map a(440) for more than 10000 lakes across Minnesota. Relationships of a(440) with R-f, [PPRIs](ss), and R-a were coupled with satellite-based a(440) assessments to map reactive species production rates and concentrations as well as contaminant transformation rates. This study demonstrates the potential for using satellite imagery for estimating contaminant loss via indirect photolysis in lakes.

TI  - Comparing MODIS snow products Collection 5 with Collection 6 over Italian Central Apennines
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed snow-cover information has become a key tool to study temporal and spatial snow-cover patterns and to develop regional snow-cover climatologies. Aqua/Terra MODIS products provide about 20-year daily snow-cover data with 500 m spatial resolution. MODIS Collection 6 represents the most recent release of global snow-cover mapping algorithms and could further increase the high accuracy of previous collections: snow cover is now reported by its NDSI (Normalized Difference Snow Index) values, allowing more flexibility in using the datasets for specific regions than previous releases. We quantified the potential-added value of tuning the NDSI threshold as opposed to a global snow-detection algorithm by developing a 16-year snow-cover climatology for the Central Apennines (Italy) from daily observations in MODIS snow products Collection 5 (C5) and Collection 6 (C6). Seven ground-based stations were used as independent benchmark. Three versions of binary snow-cover maps were generated from the NDSI Snow Cover product (C6), using NDSI-threshold tests for snow detection. The most accurate snow-cover maps show an agreement with available ground data of 88% for Aqua and 89% for Terra MODIS, with an improvement compared to snow-cover maps obtained from C5 Snow Cover Area (SCA) products (yielding 86% for Aqua and 88% for Terra). NDSI thresholds in the range 0.10-0.40 provide an agreement higher than 83% but snow-cover duration, distribution, and spatial extent are sensible to the NDSI threshold: if compared to the optimal NDSI threshold for this region (0.20), the value of 0.40 reduces by 15% the snow-cover extent in all seasons due to increased underestimation. The lowest tested threshold (0.10) estimates at least 10% larger snow-cover fraction in winter and spring but increases commission errors. This high sensitivity to the NDSI threshold makes its choice an essential step for using MODIS C6 snow products in hydrologic or climatologic studies.

TI  - Object-based random forest classification for informal settlements identification in the Middle East: Jeddah a case study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of informal settlements in urban areas is an important step in developing and implementing pro-poor urban policies. Understanding when, where and who lives inside informal settlements is critical in efforts to improve their resilience. This study aims to analyse the capability of machine-learning (ML) methods to map informal settlement areas in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, using very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery and terrain data. Fourteen indicators of settlement characteristics were derived and mapped using an object-based ML approach and VHR imagery. These indicators were categorized according to three different spatial levels: environ, settlement and object. The most useful indicators for prediction were found to be density and texture measures, (with random forest (RF) relative importance measures of over 25% and 23% respectively). The success of this approach was evaluated using a small, fully independent validation dataset. Informal areas were mapped with an overall accuracy of 91%. Object-based ML as a processing chain approach performed better (8%) than object-based image analysis alone due to its ability to encompass all available geospatial levels.

TI  - Theory of green purchase behavior (TGPB): A new theory for sustainable consumption of green hotel and green restaurant products
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fostering customer green purchase behavior is a fundamental constituent of an eco-friendly hospitality firms' success. The present study developed a theory of green purchase behavior (TGPB) that clearly and sufficiently explains customer environmentally responsible buying behavior for green hospitality products, such as green hotels and green restaurants. Mixed methods based on a psychometric approach were used for the development of the theory. Within the theory, attitude, ascribed responsibility, and social norm directly activate the personal norm. These types of activators form based on awareness of consequences, image, ecological worldview, and environmental value. In addition, past behavior increases behavior. This theorization is fully supported and demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative processes. Green purchase behavior was satisfactorily accounted for by the proposed theory. The TGPB included a stronger prediction power than the existing pro-social theories, and it is applicable to diverse hospitality/tourism/consumer behavior contexts.

TI  - Artificial neural networks for cloud masking of Sentinel-2 ocean images with noise and sunglint
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloudy regions in optical satellite images prevent the extraction of valuable information by image processing techniques. Several threshold, multi-temporal and machine learning approaches have been developed for the separation of clouds in land and ocean applications, but this task still remains a challenge. Concerning deep water marine applications, the main difficulties are imposed in regions with high noise levels and sunglint. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different configurations are evaluated for the detection of clouds in Sentinel-2 images depicting deep water regions with several noise levels. The ANNs are trained on a manual public dataset and on a manual dataset created for the needs of this study, which authors intend to make publicly available. Results are compared with the cloud masks produced by three state-of-the-art algorithms: Fmask, MAJA, and Sen2Cor. It was shown that the ANNs trained on the second dataset perform very favourably, in contrast to the ANNs trained on the first dataset that fails to adequately represent the spectra of the noisy Sentinel-2 images. This study further reinforces the value of the 'cirrus' band and indicates the bands that mitigate the influence of noisy spectra, by defining and examining an index that characterizes the importance of the bands according to the weights produced by the ANNs. Finally, the possibility of improving results by making predictions using the feature scaling parameters of the test set instead of those of the training set is also investigated in cases where the test set cannot be adequately represented by the training set.

TI  - Estimating aboveground forest carbon density using Landsat 8 and field-based data: a comparison of modelling approaches
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating and mapping forest aboveground carbon density (AGCD) is important for evaluating forest carbon sequestration efficiency and dynamics. This study compares different modelling approaches for estimating AGCD using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery and field forest inventory data. We tested it in Yongshun County, Hunan Province, China. Linear regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) were used to map crown density (CD). We fitted models with and without CD dummy variables for AGCD estimations. The fitting results and performances of these two types of AGCD models were analysed and compared. There was a difference in the estimation of remote-sensing-based CD models and AGCD models; the coefficients of determination (R-2) were 0.66 for LR and 0.84 for RF, respectively, in CD estimations; R-2 values were 0.46 for LR and 0.65 for RF, respectively, in AGCD estimations as indicated by basic AGCD models. RF was the best algorithm for CD and AGCD estimations. All of the dummy variable AGCD models provided more accurate AGCD estimates than their basic AGCD counterparts. The dummy variable models (DLR and DRF), which took the observed CD as a dummy variable, were the most accurate for the R-2 were 0.61 and 0.85, respectively. The AGCD estimations were significantly overestimated and underestimated by basic AGCD models in thin and dense CD classes, respectively. Nevertheless, none of the AGCD estimates produced by any of the dummy variable models showed this problem. The models that used predicted CD as a dummy variable were more consistent with those that considered observed CD as a dummy variable. The accuracies of AGCD estimations were significantly improved by the dummy variable AGCD models, especially in thin and dense plots; in addition, the CD estimations produced by CD models could be used as dummy variables in AGCD remote-sensing-based models. This work provides that a method considering CD dummy variable in remote sensing-based models was reliable for mapping AGCD at a regional scale.

TI  - Detecting and mapping slums using open data: a case study in Kenya
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The worldwide slum population currently stands at over one billion, with substantial growth expected in the coming decades. Traditionally, slums have been mapped using information derived mainly from either physical indicators using remote sensing data, or socio-economic indicators using census data. Each data source on its own provides only a partial view of slums, an issue further compounded by data poverty in less-developed countries. To overcome such issues, this paper explores the fusion of traditional with emerging open data sources and data mining tools to identify additional indicators that can be used to detect and map the presence of slums, map their footprint, and map their evolution. Towards this goal, we develop an indicator database for slums using open sources of physical and socio-economic data that can be used to characterize slum settlements. Using this database, we then leverage data mining techniques to identify the most suitable combination of these indicators for mapping slums. Using three cities in Kenya as test cases, results show that the fusion of these data can improve the mapping accuracy of slums. These results suggest that the proposed approach can provide a viable solution to the emerging challenge of monitoring the growth of slums.

TI  - Extranodal Tumor Deposits in the Axillary Fat Indicate the Need for Axillary Dissection Among T1-T2cN0 Patients with Positive Sentinel Nodes
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial demonstrated the safety of omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in T1-T2cN0 patients with fewer than three positive sentinel nodes (SLNs) undergoing breast-conservation therapy. While microscopic extracapsular extension (mECE) > 2 mm is associated with increased nodal burden, the significance of extranodal tumor deposits (ETDs) in the axillary fat is uncertain. Methods Consecutive patients with T1-T2cN0 breast cancer undergoing sentinel node biopsy and ALND for SLN metastases from January 2010 to December 2018 were identified. ETDs were defined as intravascular tumor emboli or metastatic deposits in the axillary fat. Clinicopathologic characteristics and nodal burden were compared by ETD status. Results Among 1114 patients, 113 (10%) had ETDs: 81 (72%) were intravascular tumor emboli and 32 (28%) were soft tissue deposits. Patients with ETDs had larger tumors (median 2.2 vs. 2.1 cm; p = 0.033) and more often had mECE (83% vs. 44%; p < 0.001). On univariable analysis, presence of ETDs (odds ratio [OR] 9.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.36-14.68), larger tumors (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.25-1.72), and mECE (OR 10.73, 95% CI 6.86-16.78) were associated with four or more additional positive non-SLNs (NSLNs; all p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, ETDs remained associated with four or more positive NSLNs (OR 5.67, 95% CI 3.53-9.08; p < 0.001). ETDs were strongly associated with four or more positive NSLNs (OR 7.15, 95% CI 4.04-12.67) among patients with one to two positive SLNs (n = 925). Conclusions Among T1-T2cN0 patients with SLN metastases, ETDs are strongly associated with four or more positive NSLNs at ALND. Even among those who may otherwise meet the criteria for omission of ALND, the presence of ETDs in axillary fat warrants consideration of ALND.

TI  - An early warning system for inundation forecast due to a tropical cyclone along the east coast of India
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyclone-induced coastal inundation along the east coast of India is simulated using the state-of-the-art advanced circulation model coupled with Simulating Waves Nearshore model. Bathymetry of the computational domain is prepared by integrating digital coastal bathymetric chart with global digital elevation model (DEM) ETOPO-2. Topography of the coastal land region is created by merging data from the fine resolution airborne DEM with that from the Indian satellite CARTOSAT-2 derived CARTO2 DEM and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM. The major shortcomings of coastal inundation simulation due to inaccurate representation of intricate networks of river, creeks and lagoons have been overcome by careful description of the critical coastal wetland features influencing the landward inundation of storm surge in the present work. Experimental simulation of coastal inundation is carried out for the Phailin (2013) and Hudhud (2014) cyclones. The computed surge residual for Phailin and Hudhud are compared with available tide-gauge observations, which have resulted in root mean square error of 0.06 m and 0.11 m, respectively. The simulations show realistic coastal inundations, which are compared with the Indian meteorological department records. The model set up is then used to generate forecast of coastal inundation due to Titli (2018) cyclone with a lead period of 48 h. The Weather Research and Forecasting model forecast winds at 5 km spatial resolution are used as the primary forcing parameter. The coastal inundation forecast due to Titli cyclone is validated by assessing the spatial coherency of simulated inundation with the water logged area demarcated from synthetic-aperture radar image taken from Canadian satellite RADARSAT-2. The results clearly indicate acceptability of the model performance with a potential to predict the coastal inundation during a cyclone for operational early warning.

TI  - Surface Albedo Assimilation and Its Impact on Surface Radiation Budget in Beijing
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is a crucial parameter in land surface radiation budget. As bias exists between the model simulated and observed surface albedo, data assimilation is an important method to improve the simulation results. Moreover, surface albedo is associated with the wavelength of the sunlight. So, solar radiation partitioning is important to parameterize the surface albedo. In this paper, the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer- (MODIS-) retrieved direct visible, direct near-infrared, diffuse visible, and diffuse near-infrared surface albedos were assimilated into the integrated urban land model (IUM). The solar radiation partitioning method was introduced to parameterize the surface albedo. Based on the albedo data from MODIS and the solar radiation partitioning method, the surface albedo data set for the Beijing municipal area was generated. Based on the surface albedo data set and the IUM, the impacts of the surface albedo on the surface radiation budget were discussed quantitatively. Surface albedo is inversely proportional to the net radiation. For urban areas, after assimilation, the annual average net radiation decreases about 5.6%. For cropland, grassland, and forest areas, after assimilation, the annual average net radiations increase about 20.2%, 24.3%, and 18.7%, respectively.

TI  - Association between prognosis and complete resection in primary cutaneous myoepithelial carcinoma: two case presentations and literature review
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Myoepithelial carcinoma is a rare tumor that occurs in the salivary glands. Therefore, primary cutaneous myoepithelial carcinoma is extremely rare. The malignancy of this tumor is due to its aggressive nature and high metastatic potential. Despite the general consideration that primary cutaneous myoepithelial carcinoma has a poor prognosis, there are few available prognostic data. Herein, we report two cases of primary cutaneous myoepithelial carcinoma to expand the literature on the clinical and pathological characteristics of this disease. In case 1, the tumor was completely resected and sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed, resulting in long-term survival. In contrast, case 2 progressed aggressively with multiple bone metastases despite treatment with docetaxel chemotherapy, and the patient ultimately died of the disease. Only 14 cases, including the present two cases, of primary cutaneous myoepithelial carcinoma have been reported to date. Overall, patients with clinical regional or distant metastases show a severe clinical course. Nevertheless, even in cases of inappropriate resection or local recurrence, if complete resection is ultimately achieved prior to clinical metastasis, the prognosis is good and survival is prolonged. Therefore, obtaining complete resection appears to be the most important treatment strategy for primary cutaneous myoepithelial carcinoma.

TI  - Selecting Node-Positive Patients for Axillary Downstaging with Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be avoided in node-positive patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) if three or more negative sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are retrieved. We evaluate how often node-positive patients avoid ALND with NAC, and identify predictors of identification of three or more SLNs and of nodal pathological complete response (pCR). Methods From November 2013 to July 2019, all patients with cT1-3, biopsy-proven N1 tumors who converted to cN0 after NAC received SLN biopsy (SLNB) with dual mapping and were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Results 630 consecutive N1 patients were eligible for axillary downstaging with NAC; 573 (91%) converted to cN0 and had SLNB, and 531 patients (93%) had three or more SLNs identified. Lymphovascular invasion (LVI; odds ratio [OR] 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.87; p = 0.02) and increasing body mass index (BMI; OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.96 per 5-unit increase; p = 0.02) were significantly associated with failure to identify three or more SLNs. 255/573 (46%) patients achieved nodal pCR; 237 (41%) had adequate mapping. Factors associated with ALND avoidance included high grade (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.6-3.94, p = 0.001) and receptor status (HR+/HER2- [referent]: OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.15-3.46 [p = 0.01] for HR-/HER2-, OR 3.93, 95% CI 2.40-6.44 [p < 0.001] for HR+/HER2+, and OR 8.24, 95% CI 4.16-16.3 [p < 0.001] for HR-/HER2+). LVI was associated with a lower likelihood of avoiding ALND (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.18-0.43; p < 0.001). Conclusions ALND was avoided in 41% of cN1 patients after NAC. Increased BMI and LVI were associated with lower retrieval rates of three or more SLNs. ALND avoidance rates varied with receptor status, grade, and LVI. These factors help select patients most likely to avoid ALND.

TI  - Breast cancer surgery in older women: outcomes of the Bridging Age Gap in Breast Cancer study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Breast cancer surgery in older women is variable and sometimes non-standard owing to concerns about morbidity. Bridging the Age Gap in Breast Cancer is a prospective multicentre cohort study aiming to determine factors influencing treatment selection and outcomes from surgery for older patients with breast cancer.Methods Women aged at least 70 years with operable breast cancer were recruited from 57 UK breast units between 2013 and 2018. Associations between patient and tumour characteristics and type of surgery in the breast and axilla were evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses. Oncological outcomes, adverse events and quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes were monitored for 2 years.Results Among 3375 women recruited, surgery was performed in 2816 patients, of whom 24 with inadequate data were excluded. Sixty-two women had bilateral tumours, giving a total of 2854 surgical events. Median age was 76 (range 70-95) years. Breast surgery comprised mastectomy in 1138 and breast-conserving surgery in 1716 procedures. Axillary surgery comprised axillary lymph node dissection in 575 and sentinel node biopsy in 2203; 76 had no axillary surgery. Age, frailty, dementia and co-morbidities were predictors of mastectomy (multivariable odds ratio (OR) for age 1 center dot 06, 95 per cent c.i. 1 center dot 05 to 1 center dot 08). Age, frailty and co-morbidity were significant predictors of no axillary surgery (OR for age 0 center dot 91, 0 center dot 87 to 0 center dot 96). The rate of adverse events was moderate (551 of 2854, 19 center dot 3 per cent), with no 30-day mortality. Long-term QoL and functional independence were adversely affected by surgery.Conclusion Breast cancer surgery is safe in women aged 70 years or more, with serious adverse events being rare and no mortality. Age, ill health and frailty all influence surgical decision-making. Surgery has a negative impact on QoL and independence, which must be considered when counselling patients about choices.

TI  - A new shape descriptor for road network separation from parking lots and intersection detection on VHR remote sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main problems in automating road network extraction from high-resolution satellite images is the misclassification between roads and other spectrally similar objects. Significant work is already done on the road class refinement direction. But, extraction of the roads that are closely adjacent to parking lots/buildings and identification of major road intersection is still an issue as they are misclassified. In this paper, a new shape descriptor to separate roads from spectrally similar non-road objects and to identify road network intersection is proposed. The proposed approach classified the input image into road and non-road classes using spectral features at first. In the binary image, considering roads continuous and elongated homogeneous regions, a new shape descriptor measuring the continuity of road pixels in a different direction is applied. The experiments on worldview-2, Ikonos, and GeoEye images showed that the proposed method is simple and effective in automating the separation of roads which are connected to parking lots/buildings and it can identify road intersection correctly.

TI  - Discrepancies between satellite-derived and in situ SST data in the Cape Frio Upwelling System, Southeastern Brazil (23&x2da;S)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) presents discrepancies in both magnitude and temporal variability in the wind-driven coastal upwelling region off the Cape Frio (23 degrees S) in Southeastern Brazil. Level 2 (L2) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua, and Level 4 (L4) SST products are compared with in situ measurements. Strong positive biases up to 4 degrees C are systematically observed in L4 products during upwelling events and decrease to less than 1 degrees C in non-upwelling days. Lower biases were found in L2 MODIS SST, and the statistical performance of L4 SST products did not present significant improvements in days when high-resolution clear-sky observations from MODIS were available. This indicates that spatio-temporal interpolation and ingestion of microwave-based data sets in L4 SST analyses are likely the main cause of observed discrepancies during upwelling events. Improved L2 SST retrieval algorithms and L4 SST analyses that take into account upwelling-related regional characteristics are required for more accurate satellite SST products over coastal regions.

TI  - Passive Samplers vs Sentinel Organisms: One-Year Monitoring of Priority and Emerging Contaminants in Coastal Waters
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal monitoring of pollutants in aquatic systems impacted by human activities is mandatory for a correct assessment on their environmental impact and later management. The aim of this work was to study the suitability of using silicone rubber passive samplers and caged organisms (Ruditapes philippinarum), simultaneously, to examine the spatial and temporal variability of priority and emerging contaminants in a coastal environment (Cadiz Bay, SW Spain) over the course of an entire year. Seasonal trends were observed for some classes of compounds, such as UV filters and fragrances, and attributed to fluctuations in their sources and changes in the hydrodynamic conditions, respectively. Up to 42 out of 48 (in seawater) and 27 out of 37 (in biota) target analytes were detected, the highest concentrations being observed for synthetic fragrances and UV filters in both biota (136.9-159 ng g(-1)) and the dissolved phase (3322.2-265.7 ng L-1). Conversely, spatiotemporal differences in the concentrations of target contaminants in clam tissues were minimal. Higher field bioaccumulation factors (log BAF > 5) were found for priority substances. Overall, silicone rubber passive samplers proved to be more sensitive than sentinel organisms for monitoring spatiotemporal changes in the dissolved aqueous concentrations of contaminants, whereas the latter allowed for a more realistic evaluation of the potential uptake and bioaccumulation of each compound.

TI  - Resolvable estuaries for satellite derived water quality within the continental United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are a wide range of satellite sensors used for water quality measures with various spatial resolutions. Here, we focus on spatial resolution because some estuaries are smaller than the satellite nadir pixel width, and multiple pixels within an estuary are required for quality assurance . We used the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (US EPA) Estuarine Data Mapper polygon set to determine the spatial resolution required to reliably image every estuary and sub-estuary in the continental US. Kilometre resolution ocean colour sensors resolve 25% of estuaries and 36% of sub-estuaries with a 3 x 3-pixel grid. The 300 m Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on Sentinel-3 resolves 53% of continental US estuaries with a 3 x 3-pixel grid, and 85% of sub-estuaries. Currently orbiting 30 m resolution land imaging satellites are sufficient to resolve all US sub-estuaries and all estuaries in the Atlantic, 89% in the Gulf of Mexico, and 54% in the Pacific with a 3 x 3-pixel grid. However, 45% of Pacific estuaries cannot be resolved at 30 m resolution, because they have narrow riverine morphology. Our results indicate that a resolution of <= 15 m will be necessary to resolve these narrow riverine estuaries, which is only currently available with commercial satellites.

TI  - Development of satellite-based surface methane flux model for major agro-ecosystems using energy balance diagnostics
T2  - PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Present study was carried out to develop multiple linear regression (MLR) model of surface CH4 flux emission from monthly atmospheric clearness index (8 km), day-night land surface temperature (LST) at 1 km and surface soil moisture (25 km) from Kalpana-1, MODIS TERRA and GCOM-W1 satellites, respectively. All these products were aggregated to GOSAT level-4A product resolution. 2 degrees x 2 degrees grids representing homogeneous agro-ecosystems were used to draw data samples. Initial results showed that methane flux (from GOSAT) produced significant coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.84) with tri-variate (LST, surface soil moisture and atmospheric transmissivity) as compared to bi-variate (LST-soil moisture, LST-atmospheric transmissivity, soil moisture-atmospheric transmissivity) MLR models. These have been utilised for predicting surface methane flux for monthly scale. Validation of predicted methane flux with actual GOSAT methane flux was carried out and RMSE of 4.2-15.9% was obtained using variance-based bias correction. All these scaling models may be utilised to predict CH4 flux at regional level using high-resolution LST from thermal remote sensing and soil moisture from Synthetic Aperture Radar.

TI  - Rainfall-runoff simulation and flood dynamic monitoring based on CHIRPS and MODIS-ET
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, satellite meteorological products were used as important data sources to achieve rainfall-runoff simulation and flood dynamic monitoring in the Songhua River basin (below the Sancha estuary) in northeastern China. Satellite precipitation products CHIRPS (the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations) and satellite evapotranspiration products MODIS-ET (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Evapotranspiration) were collected for the study area during 2010-2015. The accuracy of satellite meteorological products was validated by ground observation data in the same period. Then, combined with satellite meteorological products, a daily-scale rainfall-runoff model suitable for the study area was established. The daily river runoff (RR) and surface runoff depth (SRD) of the study area were obtained through this model. It is found that the overall performance of satellite meteorological products is good through verification. The annual average deviation of MODIS-ET and observation data is less than 1 mm. In tertiary basins of the study area, the correlation coefficient (CC) between CHIRPS and observation data is in the range from 0.59 to 0.71, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) varies from 3.75 to 4.50 mm. The rainfall-runoff model based on satellite meteorological products can well simulate the variation characteristics of observed RR: the CC reach 0.83, and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) reach 0.72. The established model was used to analyse a flood event in 2013. And the simulation results showed the changing process of the RR accurately. The dynamic changing process of the SRD was monitored by the established model during the flooding period. The model can be used to reflect the spatial distribution of potential inundation areas. This study validates the performance and deviation of CHIRPS and MODIS-ET, and proves that these satellite meteorological products have good applicability in rainfall-runoff simulation and flood dynamic monitoring. The output results, daily RR and SRD data with 0.05 degrees grid unit, can provide the decision support for hydrological information monitoring and flood forecasting.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations in vegetation coverage observed using AVHRR GIMMS and Terra MODIS data in the mainland of China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities and climate change have changed the vegetation in China. The analysis of the changes in vegetation that have occurred over the past 30 years in China remains a great challenge due to intense human activity and lack of field observations. The use of various Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets to study vegetation coverage changes has received much attention. In this paper, we selected the early versions of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Monitoring and Modelling Studies (GIMMS), GIMMS3g (third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data including the fusion data (GIMMS+MODIS). We analysed spatial and temporal changes in vegetation cover in different ecosystems and basins in the mainland of China. Different contributions of ecosystems and variations in NDVI trends exist in different ecosystems in 17 basins. The results show that different NDVI from different data sources yield different results: (1) Vegetation increased in 74.62-77.7% of the area of the Chinese mainland during 1982-2015, mainly in the Yellow River and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River basin; (2) 2000-2017 MODIS NDVI in mainland China has increased more area (79.67%). (3) Farmland and Forest ecosystems were significantly enhanced in the eastern monsoon region; (4) High-resolution NDVI can provide more information than domain average NDVI. GIMMS and MODIS NDVI data have complementary spatial and temporal distributions. Our study improves the understanding of vegetation dynamics over long time periods and large areas and, moreover, has potential for supporting ecological managers in mainland China.

TI  - An observation-driven optimization method for continuous estimation of soil moisture over large heterogeneous areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In most remote sensing-based soil moisture (SM) retrieval methods, in-situ SM measurements are commonly used for validation purposes. Few studies have investigated whether such measurements can be used for calibration. In this paper, an observation-driven optimization method was proposed to estimate SM from remote sensing observations. Specifically, the optimization method was developed within the surface temperature-vegetation index (TVX) framework for the definition of objective function and constraints. In-situ SM measurements were used to optimize the theoretical boundaries of the TVX feature space. We demonstrated the applicability of the new method with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) of the United States of America. Results indicate that the accuracy produced using only one site for calibration has reached a level comparable with those produced by traditional methods. Moreover, the method has not only bypassed the complex parameterization of aerodynamic and surface resistance but also achieved continuous monitoring of SM. That is just the capacity that the traditional TVX method does not possess. Therefore, although our optimization method requires the ancillary of in-situ observations, its simplicity proves that it is a useful tool for a quick and continuous monitoring of SM over large heterogeneous areas.

TI  - Patients' and gynecologists' views on sentinel lymph node mapping in low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancer: a Dutch vignette study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveSentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in endometrial cancer is gaining ground. However, patient views on this new technique are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine factors important to patients and gynecologists when considering SLN mapping in low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancer.MethodsWe performed a vignette study. Patients who underwent a total hysterectomy for low- or intermediate-risk endometrial cancer between 2012 and 2015 were invited. Dutch gynecologists specializing in gynecologic oncology were also invited. We based the selection for attributes in the vignettes on literature and interviews: risk of complications of SLN mapping; chance of finding a metastasis; survival gain; risk of complications after radiotherapy; operation time; and hospital of surgery (travel time). We developed a questionnaire with 18 hypothetical scenarios. Each attribute level varied and for each scenario, participants were asked how strongly they would prefer SLN on a scale from 1 to 7. The strength of preference for each scenario was analyzed using linear mixed effects models.ResultsA total of 38% of patients (41/108) and 33% of gynecologists (42/126) participated in the study. Overall, they had a preference for SLN. The mean preference for patients was 4.29 (95% CI 3.72 to 4.85) and 4.39 (95% CI 3.99 to 4.78) for gynecologists. Patients' preferences increased from 3.4 in the case of no survival gain to 4.9 in the case of 3-year survival gain (P<0.05) and it decreased when travel time increased to >60 min (-0.4, P=0.024), or with an increased risk of complications after adjuvant radiotherapy (-0.6, P=0.002). For gynecologists all attributes except travel time were important.ConclusionsOverall, patients and gynecologists were in favor of SLN mapping in low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancer. Most important to patients were survival gain, travel time, and complication risk after adjuvant radiotherapy. These preferences should be taken into account when counseling about SLN mapping.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate and identify potential floods in coastal areas with simple slopes of the Al-Lith valley basin, and to identify urban areas exposed to flooding with flood water in the coastal city of Al-Lith during the period between 1988-2019 as a model for the coastal city of Saudi Arabia, and designing strategies to mitigate the effects of floods and the establishment of a Department of Urban Planning Flood Risk. These are very important things for political and planning decision-makers, as the city suffers from repeated exposure to the risk of floods as a result of its occurrence directly below the Al-Lith valley basin. In order to reach these goals, the (Light Detection and Ranging, Lidar) data was analyzed to build and develop a two-dimensional model of the depth, speed and spread of water using a hydraulic model (Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System, HEC-RAS) to calculate the risk matrix of floods. Changes in Earth's use of the city of Al-Lith were monitored by analyzing consecutive satellite visualizations made by the American satellite Landsat in the years 1988, 2000, 2013, and 2019. The hydrological model (Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modelling System, HEC-HMS) was applied in calculating the floods hydrograph curve for the Al-Lith Valley basin during different return periods, and estimating the calculation of the amounts of flood water and flow rates depending on the (SCS Unit Hydrograph) method.

TI  - Development of post-fire vegetation response-ability model in grassland mountainous ecosystem using GIS and remote sensing
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mountainous grassland ecosystem in Golden Gate National Park (South Africa) has post-fire ecological resilience. However, vegetation species composition and structure can alter when the ecosystem continually has uncontrolled fires. This study developed a vegetation response-ability model by integrating environmental factors (elevation, aspect, rainfall, land surface temperature, soil, and fire severity), adaptive strategies (flowering months, water requirements, resprouter/seeders) and ecological status (increaser or decreaser) for the park. Vegetation recovery index derived from pre- and post-fire normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used with correlation and regression analysis to validate the model. The results showed that amongst the environmental variables, elevation and fire were the most important factors influencing vegetation response-ability followed by soil, aspect, rainfall, and land surface temperature. Almost half (48%) of the park had a high vegetation response-ability, 43% medium, and 9% low. On the other hand, the vegetation recovery index showed 34% of the park fully recovered to pre-fire conditions, while 61% and 5% largely and slightly recovered, respectively. There was a strong correlation between vegetation response-ability and vegetation recovery index. The regression analysis showed a good relationship between vegetation response-ability and vegetation recovery index (R = 0.91) with 83.34% coefficient of determination.

TI  - Utilizing Remotely Sensed Observations to Estimate the Urban Heat Island Effect at a Local Scale: Case Study of a University Campus
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect has become a significant focus of research in today's era of climate change, and a key consideration for the next generation of urban planning focused on green and livable cities. UHI has traditionally been measured using in situ data and ground-based measurements. However, with the increased availability of satellite-based thermal observations of the Earth, remotely sensed observations are increasingly being utilized to estimate surface urban heat island (SUHI), using land surface temperature (LST) as a critical indicator, due to its spatial coverage. In this study, we estimated LST based on Landsat-8 observations to demonstrate the relationship between LST and the characteristics of the land use and land cover on the campus of King Abdulaziz University (KAU), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. We found a consistent variation of between 7 and 9 degrees Celsius for LST across campus, spanning all summer and winter seasons between 2014 and 2019. The LST correlates strongly with both green vegetation and built-up land cover, with a slightly stronger correlation with the latter. The relationship between LST and green vegetation has a notable seasonality, with higher correlation in the summer seasons compared to the winter seasons. Our study also found an overall increase in LST between 2014 and 2019, due to intentional changes in the built-up land cover, for example from the conversion of natural green surfaces to artificial surfaces. The findings of this study highlight the utility of the remotely sensed observation of LST to assess the SUHI phenomenon and can be used to inform future planning aimed at securing green and livable urban areas in the face of a changing climate.

TI  - Representation of Foreign Law and Legislation on the Pages of the "Journal of the Ministry of Justice" in 1894-1904
T2  - BYLYE GODY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with specificity of representation of foreign law and legislation in the "Journal of the Ministry of justice" of the turn of XIX-XX centuries. The reasons of attention of Russian specialists to foreign justice was the revision of Judicial statutes of Alexander the Second, an active foreign policy of the Russian Empire, the interaction of Russian lawyers with foreign colleagues and the common problem problems. Most of the authors served in the Ministry of justice, as well as engaged in research and teaching activities. Professional education, formed in the logic of the European conceptual and categorical apparatus, made Western realities understandable for Russian specialists. The generation of lawyers who were actively published in the departmental journal shared the ideas of the sociological school, which was based on the strong relationship between law and all other spheres of society. Their worldview was also influenced by the mass codification of European legislation. It is revealed that the most frequent appeal of Russian lawyers to the French legislation was caused by similar positions laid down by the Judicial statutes of 1864, and to the German - by serious economic ties between Russia and Germany. The specifics of the justice system in England provided few opportunities for borrowing, but it retained the honorary role of the founder of modern legal institutions. Russian lawyers described the legal realities of the East from the point of view of orientalism: for Japan, France and England played a civilizing role, and for China - Russia, which was positioned as a European state. The law was accepted as a tool to set society on the path of progress. At the same time, Russian lawyers agreed with their European colleagues in the need to make the legislation as clear as possible for the population.

TI  - Evaluation of the Consistency of Simultaneously Acquired Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 Imagery on Plastic Covered Greenhouses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques based on medium resolution satellite imagery are being widely applied for mapping plastic covered greenhouses (PCG). This article aims at testing the spectral consistency of surface reflectance values of Sentinel-2 MSI (S2 L2A) and Landsat 8 OLI (L8 L2 and the pansharpened and atmospherically corrected product from L1T product; L8 PANSH) data in PCG areas located in Spain, Morocco, Italy and Turkey. The six corresponding bands of S2 and L8, together with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were generated through an OBIA approach for each PCG study site. The coefficient of determination (r(2)) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were computed in sixteen cloud-free simultaneously acquired image pairs from the four study sites to evaluate the coherence between the two sensors. It was found that the S2 and L8 correlation (r(2)> 0.840, RMSE < 9.917%) was quite good in most bands and NDVI. However, the correlation of the two sensors fluctuated between study sites, showing occasional sun glint effects on PCG roofs related to the sensor orbit and sun position. Moreover, higher surface reflectance discrepancies between L8 L2 and L8 PANSH data, mainly in the visible bands, were always observed in areas with high-level aerosol values derived from the aerosol quality band included in the L8 L2 product (SR aerosol). In this way, the consistency between L8 PANSH and S2 L2A was improved mainly in high-level aerosol areas according to the SR aerosol band.

TI  - Computable Phenotype Implementation for a National, Multicenter Pragmatic Clinical Trial Lessons Learned From ADAPTABLE
T2  - CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY AND OUTCOMES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many large-scale cardiovascular clinical trials are plagued with escalating costs and low enrollment. Implementing a computable phenotype, which is a set of executable algorithms, to identify a group of clinical characteristics derivable from electronic health records or administrative claims records, is essential to successful recruitment in large-scale pragmatic clinical trials. This methods paper provides an overview of the development and implementation of a computable phenotype in ADAPTABLE (Aspirin Dosing: a Patient-Centric Trial Assessing Benefits and Long-Term Effectiveness)-a pragmatic, randomized, open-label clinical trial testing the optimal dose of aspirin for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events.METHODS AND RESULTS: A multidisciplinary team developed and tested the computable phenotype to identify adults >= 18 years of age with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease without safety concerns around using aspirin and meeting trial eligibility criteria. Using the computable phenotype, investigators identified over 650 000 potentially eligible patients from the 40 participating sites from Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network-a network of Clinical Data Research Networks, Patient-Powered Research Networks, and Health Plan Research Networks. Leveraging diverse recruitment methods, sites enrolled 15 076 participants from April 2016 to June 2019. During the process of developing and implementing the ADAPTABLE computable phenotype, several key lessons were learned. The accuracy and utility of a computable phenotype are dependent on the quality of the source data, which can be variable even with a common data model. Local validation and modification were required based on site factors, such as recruitment strategies, data quality, and local coding patterns. Sustained collaboration among a diverse team of researchers is needed during computable phenotype development and implementation.CONCLUSIONS: The ADAPTABLE computable phenotype served as an efficient method to recruit patients in a multisite pragmatic clinical trial. This process of development and implementation will be informative for future large-scale, pragmatic clinical trials.

TI  - Drought Risk Assessment in Cultivated Areas of Central Asia Using MODIS Time-Series Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the most damaging environmental hazards and a naturally occurring phenomenon in Central Asia that is accompanied by crucial consequences for the agriculture sector. This research aimed at understanding the nature and extent of drought over the cropland regions of Central Asia with the help of spatiotemporal information from the region. We assessed drought occurrence using the vegetation health index (VHI). An algorithm was developed to reduce the noise of heterogeneous land surfaces by adjusting the vegetation index and brightness temperature. The vegetation condition index (VCI) and temperature condition index (TCI) were calculated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products for the growing season (April-September) from 2000 to 2015. The intense drought years were identified and a drought map (drought probability occurrence) was generated. The findings of this research indicated regional heterogeneity in the cropland areas having experienced droughts, observed through spatiotemporal variations. Some of the rain-fed and irrigated croplands of Kazakhstan demonstrated a higher vulnerability to annual drought occurrences and climate change impacts, while other cropland regions were found to be more resistant to such changes. The development of policy tools is required to support informed decision-making and planning processes to adapt to the occurrence of droughts. This could be achieved by the timely assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of the spatiotemporal distribution trends and variabilities of drought occurrences in this region. The results from this study focus on the spatiotemporal variations in drought to reveal the bigger picture in order to better understand the regional capacity for sustainable land management and agricultural activities within a changing environment.

TI  - Support tools for land use policies based on high resolution regional air quality modelling
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is becoming a stringent issue, especially in large urban agglomerations like Bucharest, Romania. National and European air quality regulations are focusing on enforcing emission and immission limit values, but there is a poor correlation between air quality policies and land use policies, both critical to urban development.The objective of this study is to develop a methodological framework for including air quality data in policies concerning urban development and land use change. The novelty is given by the use of high-resolution regional air quality modelling data for key pollutants like PM10, SO2 and NO2 with land use datasets. The study proposes a methodological framework based on the Urban Atlas Project's land use classes and the WRF-Chem air quality model. Through overlay analysis of the air quality model output and land use datasets, it is possible to derive two major types of information: (1) the land use area and classes exposed to certain pollutant concentration intervals and (2) the variability of the exposed land use classes according to the air pollutants source - receptor dynamics.Results are presented in the form of applications of the methodological framework in two different case studies. The methodological framework could be used as a tool for practitioners to include and use the evidence from air pollution information in the spatial planning policies and practice. In the first case study, three PM10, classes were set up in order to demonstrate the possibility to identify land use classes exposed to certain intervals of PM10, concentrations and their extent. The second case study focuses on the land use classes and their extent exposed to SO2 and NO2 concentrations in two different meteorological scenarios during two days in September 2014.This approach could provide support for decision makers in the policy development process, resulting in more informed decisions regarding future destinations of different land categories taking into account air pollution data and indicators. This study also opens the way for future air quality satellite data (ESA Sentinel 5-P and 5), with resolutions similar to the air quality model outputs to be used in land use planning and policy development purposes.

TI  - Recommendations for the surgical management of gynecological cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic - FRANCOGYN group for the CNGOF
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY OBSTETRICS AND HUMAN REPRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, specific recommendations are required for the management of patients with gynecologic cancer.Materials and method: The FRANCOGYN group of the National College of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF) convened to develop recommendations based on the consensus conference model.Results: If a patient with a gynecologic cancer presents with COVID-19, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, radiotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy could replace surgery as first-line treatment and the value of lymph node staging should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be preferred over primary cytoreduction surgery. It is legitimate not to perform hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. For patients who are scheduled to undergo interval surgery, chemotherapy can be continued and surgery performed after 6 cycles. For patients with early stage endometrial cancer of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy combined with a sentinel lymph node procedure is recommended. Surgery can be postponed for 1-2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For patients of high ESMO risk, the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) should be applied to avoid pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomy.Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, management of a patient with cancer should be adapted to limit the risks associated with the virus without incurring loss of chance.

TI  - Possibilities of urban flood reduction through distributed-scale rainwater harvesting
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban flooding in Chittagong City usually occurs during the monsoon season and a rainwater harvesting (RWH) system can be used as a remedial measure. This study examines the feasibility of rain barrel RWH system at a distributed scale within an urbanized area located in the northwestern part of Chittagong City that experiences flash flooding on a regular basis. For flood modeling, the storm water management model (SWMM) was employed with rain barrel low-impact development (LID) as a flood reduction measure. The Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) inundation model was coupled with SWMM to observe the detailed and spatial extent of flood reduction. Compared to SWMM simulated floods, the simulated inundation depth using remote sensing data and the HEC-RAS showed a reasonable match, i.e., the correlation coefficients were found to be 0.70 and 0.98, respectively. Finally, using LID, i.e., RWH, a reduction of 28.66% could be achieved for reducing flood extent. Moreover, the study showed that 10%-60% imperviousness of the subcatchment area can yield a monthly RWH potential of 0.04-0.45 m(3) from a square meter of rooftop area. The model can be used for necessary decision making for flood reduction and to establish a distributed RWH system in the study area. (C) 2020 Hohai University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Assessing How Land-Cover Change Associated with Urbanisation Affects Ecological Sustainability in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area, Ghana
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive land-cover changes (LCC) driven by unplanned urbanisation continue to threaten the sustainability of ecological assets in many cities in Africa. Evaluating the nature and processes of these changes is key to understanding the extent to which ecological instability may be affecting sustainability futures. This study employed integrated remote sensing, GIS, land accounting techniques and utilisation of high-resolution Quickbird and Worldview 2 images to analyse actual (2008-2017) and future (2017-2030) LCC and explored implications for ecological sustainability in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area, Ghana. After mapping and classifying actual LCC, multi-layer perception (MLP) neural network and Markov chain were employed to predict future LCC for the year 2030. The results indicate that the built-up area increased substantially from 27% in 2008 to 46% in 2017 and is expected to rise to 73% by 2030. In contrast, open-space (10%), forestlands (5%) and grassland/farmlands (49%) decreased progressively (2008-2030). In effect, these land-cover types experienced area turnover >100% during the actual and predicted period, indicating high vulnerability of natural land cover to urban growth, ecological degradation and resource depletion. These findings highlight significant implications of LCC for ecological sustainability in the study area. A proactive land-cover/use management plan is necessary to ensure sustainable urban development and ecological land conservation.

TI  - Detecting and Analyzing Land Use and Land Cover Changes in the Region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar, Libya Using Time-Series Landsat Data from 1985 to 2017
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar in northeastern Libya has undergone rapid, wide-ranging changes in the land use and land cover (LULC) intensified by the conversion of natural resources for food purpose, urbanization, and other socioeconomic benefits. This study examined the use of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to gain a quantitative understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC. In addition, the major factors behind LULC changes and decline of natural vegetation in the region were analyzed. A post-classification comparison approach was used to detect LULC changes in the study area between 1985 and 2017 using four Landsat images from 1985, 2000, 2010, and 2017. The observed changes were indicative of a decrease in the expanse of the natural Mediterranean forest which lost 9018 ha over 32 years, 39% of its total area, with the highest deforestation rate registered between 2010 and 2017 estimated at 513 ha. year(-1). Orchards and rain-fed agriculture lands gained 4095 ha, which matches 55% of initial area, whereas the land under irrigated crops increased by 2266 ha, about 85% of the original area. The area of urban and built-up land in 2017 was more than double in 1985 and achieved the highest urbanization rate between 2010 and 2017 at 203 ha.year(-1). Results indicate an unstable trend of bare and low vegetation lands which generally increased by about 50%. From the outcomes of this research, it is strongly recommended that urgent measures be taken to conserve the natural forest and to achieve a rational use of agricultural land in the region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar.

TI  - Large Scale Flood Risk Mapping in Data Scarce Environments: An Application for Romania
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale flood risk assessment is essential in supporting national and global policies, emergency operations and land-use management. The present study proposes a cost-efficient method for the large-scale mapping of direct economic flood damage in data-scarce environments. The proposed framework consists of three main stages: (i) deriving a water depth map through a geomorphic method based on a supervised linear binary classification; (ii) generating an exposure land-use map developed from multi-spectral Landsat 8 satellite images using a machine-learning classification algorithm; and (iii) performing a flood damage assessment using a GIS tool, based on the vulnerability (depth-damage) curves method. The proposed integrated method was applied over the entire country of Romania (including minor order basins) for a 100-year return time at 30-m resolution. The results showed how the description of flood risk may especially benefit from the ability of the proposed cost-efficient model to carry out large-scale analyses in data-scarce environments. This approach may help in performing and updating risk assessments and management, taking into account the temporal and spatial changes in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.

TI  - Validation of Sentinel-3A SRAL Coastal Sea Level Data at High Posting Rate: 80 Hz
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Altimetry data of two and a half years (June 2016 & x2013;November 2018) of Sentinel-3A SRAL (S3A-SRAL) were validated at the sampling frequency of 80 Hz. The data were obtained from the European Space Agency (ESA) Grid Processing On Demand (GPOD) service over three coastal sites in Spain: Huelva (HU) (Gulf of C & x00E1;diz), Barcelona (BA) (Western Mediterranean Sea), and Bilbao (BI) (Bay of Biscay). Two tracks were selected in each site: one ascending and one descending. Data were validated using <italic>in situ</italic> tide gauge (TG) data provided by the Spanish Puertos del Estado. The altimetry sea level anomaly time series were obtained using the corrections available in GPOD with the exception of the sea state bias (SSB) correction, not available at 80 Hz. Hence, the SSB was approximated to 5 & x0025; of the significant wave height (SWH). The validation was performed using two statistical parameters, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and the root mean square error (rmse). In the 5 & x2013;20-km segment with respect to the coastline, the results were 6 & x2013;8 cm (rmse) and 0.7 & x2013;0.8 (r) for all the tracks. The 0 & x2013;5-km segment was also analyzed in detail to study the land effect on the altimetry data quality. The results showed that the track orientation, the angle of intersection with the coast, and the land topography concur to determine the nearest distance to the coast at which the data retain a similar level of accuracy than in the 5 & x2013;20-km segment. This & x201C;distance of good quality & x201D; to shore reaches a minimum of 3 km for the tracks at HU and the descending track at BA.

TI  - A deep learning framework for land-use/land-cover mapping and analysis using multispectral satellite imagery
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we present an approach to land-use and land-cover (LULC) mapping from multispectral satellite images using deep learning methods. The terms satellite image classification and map production, although used interchangeably have specific meanings in the field of remote sensing. Satellite image classification describes assignment of global labels to entire scenes, whereas LULC map production involves producing maps by assigning a class to each pixel. We show that by classifying each pixel in a satellite image into a number of LULC categories we are able to successfully produce LULC maps. This process of LULC mapping is achieved using deep neural networks pre-trained on the ImageNet large-scale visual recognition competition datasets and fine-tuned on our target dataset, which consists of Landsat 5/7 multispectral satellite images taken of the Province of Manitoba in Canada. This approach resulted in 88% global accuracy. Performance was further improved by considering the state-of-the-art generative adversarial architecture and context module integrated with the original networks. The result is an automated deep learning framework that can produce highly accurate LULC maps images significantly faster than current semi-automated methods. The contribution of this article includes extensive experimentation of different FCN architectures with extensions on a unique dataset, high classification accuracy of 90.46%, and a thorough analysis and accuracy assessment of our results.

TI  - Primary Cutaneous Clear Cell Sarcoma, Clinical Outcome With Sentinel Lymph Nodes Status Case Series With Systematic Review
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: Primary cutaneous clear cell sarcoma (PCS) is a rare malignancy and difficult to differentiate from melanoma. We investigated factors influencing survival and recurrence.Methods: An institutional cancer registry and literature search were used for a retrospective study. Only clear cell sarcoma cases with a primary site of skin and subcutaneous tissue were included. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to assess survival time and hazard ratios.Results: Three eligible cases were identified at our institution. In addition, the PubMed and Google Scholar reviews identified 1,878 items, with 23 patients with PCS. The median age was 25 years with 62% female. The tumors ranged in size from 0.4 to 4.5 cm. Cytogenetics showed t(12;22)(q13;q12) in all cases and a unique variant of t(2;22)(q32.3;q12) in one case. Surgery was the most common treatment, followed by chemotherapy/radiation. PCS recurred in 46% of patients with a median relapse-free survival time of 15 months. Only two known PCS-related mortalities were recorded, at 38 and 60 months following initial diagnosis. Smaller tumor size and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) status were significantly associated with a better disease-free survival.Conclusions: Tumor size and SLNB status influence PCS survival and recurrence. More research is needed due to the rarity of this disease.

TI  - Evaluating Prediction Models for Mapping Canopy Chlorophyll Content Across Biomes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate measurement of canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) is essential for the understanding of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics through monitoring and evaluating properties such as carbon and water flux, productivity, light use efficiency as well as nutritional and environmental stresses. Information on the amount and distribution of CCC helps to assess and report biodiversity indicators related to ecosystem processes and functional aspects. Therefore, measuring CCC continuously and globally from earth observation data is critical to monitor the status of the biosphere. However, generic and robust methods for regional and global mapping of CCC are not well defined. This study aimed at examining the spatiotemporal consistency and scalability of selected methods for CCC mapping across biomes. Four methods (i.e., radiative transfer models (RTMs) inversion using a look-up table (LUT), the biophysical processor approach integrated into the Sentinel application platform (SNAP toolbox), simple ratio vegetation index (SRVI), and partial least square regression (PLSR)) were evaluated. Similarities and differences among CCC products generated by applying the four methods on actual Sentinel-2 data in four biomes (temperate forest, tropical forest, wetland, and Arctic tundra) were examined by computing statistical measures and spatiotemporal consistency pairwise comparisons. Pairwise comparison of CCC predictions by the selected methods demonstrated strong agreement. The highest correlation (R-2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.4371 g/m(2)) was obtained between CCC predictions of PROSAIL inversion by LUT and SNAP toolbox approach in a wetland when a single Sentinel-2 image was used. However, when time-series data were used, it was PROSAIL inversion against SRVI (R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.19) that showed greatest similarity to the single date predictions (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.17 g/m(2)) in this biome. Generally, the CCC products obtained using the SNAP toolbox approach resulted in a systematic over/under-estimation of CCC. RTMs inversion by LUT (INFORM and PROSAIL) resulted in a non-biased, spatiotemporally consistent prediction of CCC with a range closer to expectations. Therefore, the RTM inversion using LUT approaches particularly, INFORM for 'forest' and PROSAIL for 'short vegetation' ecosystems, are recommended for CCC mapping from Sentinel-2 data for worldwide mapping of CCC. Additional validation of the two RTMs with field data of CCC across biomes is required in the future.

TI  - Evaluating the potential of red edge position (REP) of hyperspectral remote sensing data for real time estimation of LAI & chlorophyll content of kinnow mandarin (<i>Citrus reticulata</i>) fruit orchards
T2  - SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content (Chl) content are important indicators of plants health and nutrition status. Hyperspectral remote sensing is useful for the real-time estimation of plants biophysical and biochemical traits. The main objective of the current study was to evaluate the potential of red edge position (REP) extracted from hyperspectral reflectance profiles to estimate the LAI and Chl content of kinnow mandarin fruit orchards in Pakistan. First, we compared methods to extract the REP from hyperspectral reflectance profiles of kinnow mandarin tree canopies. Second, the ordinary least square (OLS) regression was used to investigate relationships of the derived REP with the observed kinnow mandarin traits (LAI and Chl content). Finally, kinnow mandarin traits for non-observed locations were predicted and the validity of the calibrated models was confirmed through the validation dataset. The results showed that kinnow mandarin trees depicted higher spectral response in the red edge region (680-731 nm) with REP shifting towards longer wavelengths with higher values of LAI and Chl content. Among the four algorithms tested for extraction of REP from hyperspectral reflectance, the REP models calibrated with polynomial fitting and the linear extrapolation outperformed to predict LAI and Chl content of kinnow mandarin trees with R-2 values equal to 0.93 and 0.90 and RMSE values equal to 0.156% and 10.1% respectively while REP models calibrated with maximum first derivative and polynomial interpolation were less sensitive to predict these traits in kinnow mandarin trees. We conclude that the REP extracted from ground based hyperspectral reflectance can accurately estimate the kinnow mandarin LAI and Chl content and can be effectively used to assess crop health status in a wider range to manage nutritional requirement real-time in the kinnow mandarin fruit orchards. The developed mechanism will help growers for real-time monitoring orchards at different phenological stages and maximize fruit production in a precision agriculture setting.

TI  - Improved optical image matching time series inversion approach for monitoring dune migration in North Sinai Sand Sea: Algorithm procedure, application, and validation
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sand dune migration poses a potential threat to desert infrastructure, vegetation, and atmospheric conditions. Capturing the patterns of long-term dune migration is useful for predicting probable desertification issues and wind conditions across vast desert areas. In this study, we employed optical image matching and a singular value decomposition approach to estimate the rates of dune migration in the North Sinai Sand Sea using the free Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 archives. Our optical image matching time-series selection and inversion (OPTSI) algorithm limited the difference in the solar illumination of correlated pairs to decrease shadows and seasonal variability. We found that the maximum annual dune migration rates were 9.4 m/a and 15.9 m/a for Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data, respectively, and the results of time-series analysis revealed the existence of seasonal variations in dune migration controlled by wind regimes. The directions of sand movement extracted from the mean velocity solution agreed strongly with each other and with the drift directions estimated using wind data from meteorological stations. We assessed the uncertainty of each solution based on the variance of stable areas. Our results showed that the proposed inversion decreased uncertainty by up to 25% and increased the spatial coverage by up to 20%. This algorithm is also promising for the retrieval of historical time series on the ground displacements of glaciers and slow-moving landslides employing free archives that provide high-frequency images.

TI  - Retrieval of Turbidity on a Spatio-Temporal Scale Using Landsat 8 SR: A Case Study of the Ramganga River in the Ganges Basin, India
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, space-borne imaging spectro-radiometers are exploited for many environmental applications, including water quality monitoring. Turbidity is a standout amongst the essential parameters of water quality that affect productivity. The current study aims to utilize Landsat 8 surface reflectance (L8SR) to retrieve turbidity in the Ramganga River, a tributary of the Ganges River. Samples of river water were collected from 16 different locations on 13 March and 27 November 2014. L8SR images from 6 March and 17 November 2014 were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website. The algorithm to retrieve turbidity is based on the correlation between L8SR reflectance (single and ratio bands) and insitu data. The b2/b4 and b2/b3 bands ratio are proven to be the best predictors of turbidity, with R-2 = 0.560 (p < 0.05) and R-2 = 0.726 (p < 0.05) for March and November, respectively. Selected models are validated by comparing the concentrations of predicted and measured turbidity. The results showed that L8SR is a promising tool for monitoring surface water from space, even in relatively narrow river channels, such as the Ramganga River.

TI  - Ultrasound guided tattooing of axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients prior to neoadjuvant therapy, and identification of tattooed nodes at the time of surgery
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast cancer patients with lymph node (LN) metastases at diagnosis often undergo neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Identification of a LN which regressed after NAT remains a challenge.Objective: To evaluate marking of involved nodes by tattooing with carbon suspension, and identifying these nodes during surgery.Methods: A small amount (0.2-0.5 ml) of carbon suspension was injected into one or two axillary LNs under ultrasound guidance at the time of LN biopsy or before or shortly after starting NAT for LN positive breast cancer. During surgery an attempt was made to identify and remove the tattooed LN as a separate specimen. All patients underwent sentinel LN mapping and biopsy and/or axillary LN dissection as mandated by their clinical status.Results: Sixty three patients underwent tattooing of axillary LNs with no complications or adverse events. At surgery a tattooed node was identified in 60 patients (95%; 95% CI 87, 98). Of 56 patients who underwent sentinel mapping with Tc99, in 51 (91%; 95% CI 81, 96) at least one radioactive LN was identified. Of 50 patients in whom both radioactivity and tattoo were identified in axillary LNs, in 40 (80%; 95% CI 67, 89) LNs were radioactive and tattooed, however in 10 patients (20%; 95% CI 11, 33), the tattooed LN was not radioactive.Conclusions: Tattooing of axillary LNs is safe and easily performed. Tattooing was helpful in identifying the marked LN in the majority of cases. This technique helps to ensure that metastatic LNs are identified and removed at surgery after NAT.

TI  - Pathological process for sentinel lymph node
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel node is defined as the first node to receive drainage from a primary tumor and seems to reflect the nodal status in the lymphatic drainage of the tumor. Sentinel node technique has modified the pathological examination of lymph nodes, with intraoperative evaluation of sentinel node, allowing immediate lymph node dissection in case of positive sentinel node, and histological ultrastratification to detect occult metastases. This is a literature review of different histological protocols of sentinel node according to different organs. Except for sentinel node in breast cancer and melanoma, intraoperative examination of sentinel node is helpful using frozen section, more sensitive than touch imprint cytology. Sentinel node should be embedded in paraffin block entirely after gross sectioning at two millimeters intervals parallel to the long axis of the node. Histological ultrastaging with serial sections can be helpful, but the number of sections and the interval between them is not codified. Three sections at 200-250 microns can identify the majority of micrometastases (< 2 mm and > 200 microns). Systematic immunohistochemistry of sentinel node is not necessary for breast cancers, since isolated tumor cells do not modify the therapeutic strategy, but remains useful in other organs.

TI  - Improved Ice Velocity Measurements with Sentinel-1 TOPS Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the Sentinel-1 satellites have provided a data archive of unprecedented volume, delivering C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) acquisitions over most of the polar ice sheets with a repeat-pass period of 6-12 days using Interferometric Wide swath (IW) imagery acquired in Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode. Due to the added complexity of TOPS-mode interferometric processing, however, Sentinel-1 ice velocity measurements currently rely exclusively on amplitude offset tracking, which generates measurements of substantially lower accuracy and spatial resolution than would be possible with Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR). The main difficulty associated with TOPS interferometry lies in the spatially variable azimuth phase contribution arising from along-track motion within the scene. We present a Sentinel-1 interferometric processing chain, which reduces the azimuth coupling to the line-of-sight phase signal through a spatially adaptive coregistration refinement incorporating azimuth velocity measurements. The latter are based on available ice velocity mosaics, optionally supplemented by Burst-Overlap Multi-Aperture Interferometry. The DInSAR processing chain is demonstrated for a large drainage basin in Northeast Greenland, encompassing the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS), and integrated with state-of-the-art offset tracking measurements. In the ice sheet interior, the combined DInSAR and offset tracking ice velocity product provides a spatial resolution of50x50mand 1-sigma accuracies of 0.18 and 0.44 m/y in the x and y components respectively, compared to GPS.

TI  - Euphemistic substitution in linguistic worldview of peoples of Siberia (based on comparative material of the Yakut and Evenki languages)
T2  - TURISMO-ESTUDOS E PRATICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work, an attempt has been made to examine and compare the lexical material of the Yakut and Evenki languages which makes it possible to identify the common and different traits in the ethic groups' linguistic worldviews. Native peoples of Siberia have long lived together on the vast territory in the same severe climate and have such identical occupations as hunting and fishing. Hunting holds a special place in the lifestyle of Siberian ethnoses as it is the main occupation of the men, the source of food and the object of spiritual reflection, which is why it is a valuable fragment of the linguistic worldview. The semantic structure of euphemisms in the vocabulary of taboo speech is an essential matter in the study of linguistic prohibition. While encompassing certain areas of conventional vocabulary, the prohibition prevents certain levels of vocabulary from being used. This happens in the formal plane but in close connection to the semantic plane of lexis. The result of the prohibition is the need to find a new form to replace the prohibited one. The materials of the Yakut and the Evenki show the same type of euphemistic substitution means; there is the semantic and syntactical transposition. From the point of the semantic transposition, there are common methods of euphemism creation - the nominations based on metaphors are predominant. The usage of dialect words specific to a certain area is a distinct technique that reflects the differences in languages and cultures.

AB  - Many tribalistic conflicts today are driven by, or at least influenced by, the structure and function of the internet and online systems and cultures. This first paper (of two focused upon this issue) identifies several salient driving factors which underpin one such conflict - the "culture wars" in their online expression, predominantly in the United States context. For purposes of simplicity, the categories of Red and Blue tribes are used to frame the discussion, with the focus here upon unpacking salient aspects of the Blue tribalism in the United States. The paper also argues that the poststrcturalist foundations of Critical Futures Studies make that field more readily aligned with Blue tribe thinking, and that this may limit its capacity to help mediate in issues related to the tribal split. Critical Futurist Sohail Inayatullah's Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) is employed to identify factors which span the litany, social/systems, worldview and mythic levels of the problematique.

TI  - The Irrigation Cooling Effect as a Climate Regulation Service of Agroecosystems
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroecosystems provide a range of benefits to society and the economy, which we call ecosystem services (ES). These services can be evaluated on the basis of environmental and socioeconomic indicators. The irrigation cooling effect (ICE), given its influence on the land surface temperature (LST), is an indicator of climate regulation services from agroecosystems. In this context, the objective of this study is to quantify the ICE in agroecosystems at the local scale. The agroecosystem of citrus cultivation in Campo de Cartagena (Murcia, Spain) is used as a case study. Once the LST was retrieved by remote sensing images for 216 plots, multivariate regression methods were used to identify the factors that explain ICE. The use of a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is proposed, instead of ordinary least squares, as it offsets the spatial dependence and gives a better fit. The GWR explains 78% of the variability in the LST, by means of three variables: the vegetation index, the water index of the crop, and the altitude. Thus, the effects of the change in land use on the LST due to restrictions on the availability of water (up to 1.22 degrees C higher for rain-fed crops) are estimated. The trade-offs between ICE and the other ES are investigated by using the irrigation water required to reduce the temperature. This work shows the magnitude of the climate regulation service generated by irrigated citrus and enables its quantification in agroecosystems with similar characteristics.

The land surface temperature was estimated from the MCD11C1 product for the same period. The results corroborate the temperature anomalies retrieved from climate models and improve the comparison with global annual air temperatures estimated by the NOAA's National Climatic Data Center (NOAA-NCDC), with a correlation coefficient of 0.96. In addition, a trend of 0.021 +/- 0.001 degrees C/year increase was found for the Earth's surface temperature in this 17-year period.

TI  - Assessment and Quantification of the Accuracy of Low- and High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data for Shoreline Monitoring
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - tau he accuracy of low-resolution remote sensing data for monitoring shoreline evolution is the main issue that researchers have been trying to overcome in recent decades. The drawback of the Landsat satellite archive is its spatial resolution, which is appropriate only for low-scale mapping. The present study investigates the potentialities and limitations of remote sensing data and GIS techniques in shoreline evolution modeling, with a focus on two major aspects: (a) assessing and quantifying the accuracy of low- and high-resolution remote sensing data for shoreline mapping; and (b) calculating the divergence in the forecasting of coastline evolution based on low- and high-resolution datasets. Shorelines derived from diachronic Landsat images are compared with the corresponding shorelines derived from high-spatial-resolution airphotos or Worldview-2 images. The accuracy of each dataset is assessed, and the possibility of forecasting shoreline evolution is investigated. Two sandy beaches, named Kalamaki and Karnari, which are located in Northwestern Peloponnese, Greece, are used as test sites. It is proved that the shorelines derived from the Landsat data present a displacement error of between 6 and 11 m. The specific data are not suitable for the shoreline forecasting procedure and should not be used in related studies, as they yield less accurate results for the two study areas in comparison with the high-resolution data.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) based image data compression considering image restoration is proposed. An image data compression method based on the compression (DCT) featuring an image restoration method is proposed. DCT image compression is widely used and has four major image defects. In order to reduce the noise and distortions, the proposed method expresses a set of parameters for the assumed distortion model based on an image restoration method. The results from the experiment with Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) data of Saga show a good image compression performance of compression factor and image quality, namely, the proposed method achieved 25% of improvement of the compression factor compared to the existing method of DCT with almost comparable image quality between both methods.

TI  - Economic outlook and the gender gap in attitudes about climate change
T2  - POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Polling consistently shows that the USA is significantly polarized on the issue of climate change. Economic outlook and gender are frequently identified as two sources of this variation, as Americans often view the climate change issue as a tradeoff between economic and environmental risk, and women tend to express more concern than men about this issue. Much of the existing literature links the two by focusing on the role of economic outlook and worldview differences between genders to explain this gender gap. In short, economic concern overrides environmental concern, and males are more sensitive to economic concern, even with appropriate socioeconomic controls. However, little research has empirically investigated this interplay between gender and economic outlook. Using a large sample survey, this study investigates the relationships between economic outlook, gender, and support for climate change mitigation strategies. Findings suggest that economic outlook has a significant effect, and that it moderates gender effects. We find large gender effects among those who feel most economically vulnerable, but these differences dissipate as economic outlook improves.

TI  - A long-term assessment of fire regimes in a Brazilian ecotone between seasonally dry tropical forests and savannah
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a recurrent phenomenon in semiarid seasonal ecosystems. The study of the relationship between fire and climate could provide new approaches for understanding fire dynamics in semiarid regions, which could be useful for strategically managing the loss and recovery of natural resources under threat. Here, we evaluated the patterns of fires occurrence in a semiarid Caatinga-Cerrado ecotone in the Northeast Region of Brazil by characterizing their spatiotemporal dynamics associated with climatic conditions. Using a temporal series of 306 Landsat images, we mapped a burned area database at a fine spatial resolution (30 m) from 1999 to 2017 in the Capivara-Confusoes Mosaic of protected areas and their surroundings. Fire seasonality was analyzed through climatic seasons, distinguishing between the rainy season (RS), early dry season (EDS), middle dry season (MDS) and late dry season (LDS), by analysis of the daily precipitation of ground-based stations in the area. We created yearly, seasonal and recurrence maps of burned areas to assess fire regimes. The results showed that the 48% of the area was burned during the 19-year long period considered. Serra das Confusoes National Park (SCoNP) had 302,644 ha burned, Serra da Capivara National Park (SCaNP) had 2056 ha burned and the ecological corridor had 215,718 ha burned. Most of the burned area was registered during the MDS (36% of the study area), there was almost no burned area in the EDS (< 0.01%), while the LDS (7%) and the RS (4%) had similar dimensions burned. The years that burned the most (2001, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2015) were followed by years with considerably less burned area. We identified a multiple-year process, consisting of a climatological year with above-average precipitation and consequent low burned area, followed by a climatological year with below-average precipitation and resulting in large extensions of burned area (periods: 1999-2001, 2008-2010, 2010-2012). Fire recurrence reached a maximum value of ten, with 47% of the area burned presenting some degree of recurrence. SCaNP presented no fire recurrence, while SCoNP had a maximum recurrence parameter of four. Areas with moderate fire recurrence were near roads, settlements or cities. Some recurrently burned areas presented similar shapes, which were associated with topography limiting the spread of the fires. The patterns that we described here constitute the first step toward understanding the fire regimes of the region to establish directions for improving management strategies and orienting policies in the area.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy-an Indian Perspective
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone in early breast cancer is an established standard of care. However, the same results have not been replicated in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). We aim to examine the feasibility of SLNB in LABC patients post NACT to determine identification rates (IR) and false negative rates (FNR). This was a single tertiary cancer center-based prospective study from February 2017 to November 2018. Forty-four patients with LABC (T3, T4 with N0 or N1) were studied and response after NACT was assessed. Only those patients who were N0 or who converted from N1 to N0 after NACT were included. Those patients who remained node positive after NACT directly proceeded with axillary dissection without SLNB and were excluded from the study. Demographic and clinical data is expressed in ratios and percentage and presented in table format. The median age at the time of study was 45.18 years. Most of the patients had T3 and above (97.7%) and N1 (86.3%) disease at the start of neoadjuvant therapy. The mean number of axillary lymph nodes dissected was 13.97. Dual method of sentinel lymph node mapping (methylene blue dye and radiolabeled colloid) was used in 26 (59.1%) patients. At least 1 SLN was identified in 86.4% patients with 100% identification in those patients in whom the dual method of SLN mapping was used. Median of 2 SLN was removed. Overall, false negative rate was 21.4%. FNR was high with the single method of SLN mapping (50% and 33.3% with methylene blue and radioactive colloid respectively) while it was considerably low when both were used simultaneously (11%). An average of 2 (range 0-4) SLN were identified and FNR were zero when 2 or more SLN were identified. Our study shows that SLNB in patients with LABC post NACT though viable cannot be recommended at present due to unacceptable high FNR. However, this should not dissuade us from exploring recurrence-free survival and overall survival associated with such IR and FNR albeit strictly under a clinical trial setting.

TI  - Making the Most of Clinical Encounters Prevention of Child Abuse and Maltreatment
T2  - PEDIATRIC CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Child abuse is a public health concern with great costs to children, families, and society. Prevention of child abuse and maltreatment is an important clinical skill. Providers can take advantage of the opportunity to offer prevention interventions in the health care setting. Identification of risk factors and signs and symptoms of abuse, referral to local resources, parenting education, and application of the public health prevention framework should be integrated into clinical encounters. Identification of sentinel injuries enables tertiary interventions to save lives. Primary interventions during early childhood using effective parenting programs has been shown to reduce child maltreatment.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research was conducted to identify the most common equine stomach bot fly by using light and scanning electron microscopy. Third instar larvae (n = 200) of Gasterophilus intestinalis were collected from stomach of slaughtered donkeys (Equus asinus) at Giza Zoo abattoir, Egypt, in July 2017 (the donkeys chosen were from Giza; Egypt). One hundred only were full mature 3rd instar larvae (the mature 3rd instar was active and has brown bands on its dorsal surface) which were incubated at 32 degrees C and 80-85% Relative Humidity (RH), for the development of adult. The following pupal parameters were recorded: prepupal period, number of pupated larvae, pupal period, and number of emerged adult and determination of adult sex ratio. Morphological description of pupae, puparium and adults were provided using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The length of prepupal duration was five days and about 90% of the collected G. intestinalis larvae successfully pupated with pupal duration lasting for 21-25 days prior to emergence of the adult stage. Adults sorted according to sex show a female to male ratio of 8:1 (i.e. 80 females to 10 males). The pupae of G. intestinalis were brown to black in color. The adult head, thorax, abdomen, legs and wings of male and female were morphologically described using light and SEM. This research fully describes the adult G. intestinalis male; female and its puparium to distinguish it from other specific myiasis producing flies within its family.

TI  - Implications of land use transitions and climate change on local flooding in urban areas: An assessment of 42 Indian cities
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban development induced land transitions affect urban hydrology, resulting in increased flooding risks. Climate change-related precipitation changes are an added complexity to the flood risks of cities. This study examines the role of land use changes in determining the occurrence of urban flooding events across 42 Indian cities under current and future climate change scenarios. Landsat images for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017 have been processed using a hybrid classification technique to determine the land use shares for all cities. A typical event-count study using newspaper archives has been conducted to create a flooding event database. A multilevel model employing logistic mixed-effects approach was used. Future projections of the occurrence of flooding events for nine models under three climate change-related Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)-2.6, 4.5, and 8.5-and three urban development scenarios have been carried out. The results suggest that cities should preserve the land uses that act as a sponge-the green, open and blue spaces. As these spaces decrease, the projected flooding events increase. Under the RCP 2.6 scenario, the number of flooding events is significantly lower (95 % confidence) than under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. The expected flooding occurrences between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are not significantly different (95 % confidence) for many scenarios, suggesting that Indian cities should aim for a world temperature increase of below 2 degrees C, or devastating consequences are imminent. This study highlights the need for Indian cities to undertake integrated spatial planning measures for a resilient, sustainable urban future.

TI  - Combined Use of Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat Sensors Products for Residual Soil Moisture Retrieval over Agricultural Fields in the Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential of sentinel-1 SAR sensor products and the contribution of soil roughness parameters to estimate volumetric residual soil moisture (RSM) in the Upper Blue Nile (UBN) basin, Ethiopia. The backscatter contribution of crop residue water content was estimated using Landsat sensor product and the water cloud model (WCM). The surface roughness parameters were estimated from the Oh and Baghdadi models. A feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) method was tested for its potential to translate SAR backscattering and surface roughness input variables to RSM values. The model was trained for three inversion configurations: (i) SAR backscattering from vertical transmit and vertical receive (SAR VV) polarization only; (ii) using SAR VV and the standard deviation of surface heights (h(rms)), and (iii) SAR VV, h(rms), and optimal surface correlation length (l(eff)). Field-measured volumetric RSM data were used to train and validate the method. The results showed that the ANN soil moisture estimation model performed reasonably well for the estimation of RSM using the single input variable of SAR VV data only. The ANN prediction accuracy was slightly improved when SAR VV and the surface roughness parameters (h(rms) and l(eff)) were incorporated into the prediction model. Consequently, the ANN's prediction accuracy with root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.035 cm(3)/cm(3), mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.026 cm(3)/cm(3), and r = 0.73 was achieved using the third inversion configuration. The result implies the potential of Sentinel-1 SAR data to accurately retrieve RSM content over an agricultural site covered by stubbles. The soil roughness parameters are also potentially an important variable to soil moisture estimation using SAR data although their contribution to the accuracy of RSM prediction is slight in this study. In addition, the result highlights the importance of combining Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat images based on an ANN approach for improving RSM content estimations over crop residue areas.

TI  - Quad-Polarimetric Multi-Scale Analysis of Icebergs in ALOS-2 SAR Data: A Comparison between Icebergs in West and East Greenland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Icebergs are ocean hazards which require extensive monitoring. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites can help with this, however, SAR backscattering is strongly influenced by the properties of icebergs, together with meteorological and environmental conditions. In this work, we used five images of quad-pol ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 SAR data to analyse 1332 icebergs in five locations in west and east Greenland. We investigate the backscatter and polarimetric behaviour, by using several observables and decompositions such as the Cloude-Pottier eigenvalue/eigenvector and Yamaguchi model-based decompositions. Our results show that those icebergs can contain a variety of scattering mechanisms at L-band. However, the most common scattering mechanism for icebergs is surface scattering, with the second most dominant volume scattering (or more generally, clouds of dipoles). In some cases, we observed a double bounce dominance, but this is not as common. Interestingly, we identified that different locations (e.g., glaciers) produce icebergs with different polarimetric characteristics. We also performed a multi-scale analysis using boxcar 5 x 5 and 11 x 11 window sizes and this revealed that depending on locations (and therefore, characteristics) icebergs can be a collection of strong scatterers that are packed in a denser or less dense way. This gives hope for using quad-pol polarimetry to provide some iceberg classifications in the future.

TI  - remotIO: A Sentinel-1 Multi-Temporal InSAR Infrastructure Monitoring Service with Automatic Updates and Data Mining Capabilities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar interferometry (MT-InSAR) is nowadays a well-developed remote sensing technique for monitoring of Earth's surface deformation. The availability of regular and open Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite data with enhanced spatiotemporal coverage has recently stimulated several initiatives for development of new monitoring services which can help to respond to emergencies faster and apply resilience measures more accurately as compared to conventional ground-based techniques. In this paper, the alpha version of the remotIO (Retrieval of Motions and Potential Deformation Threats) system is presented. It is currently able to provide continuous and autonomous updates of MT-InSAR results and post-processing methodology over sites with active deformation hazards to ease the interpretation and facilitate decision-supporting tools for on-time situational awareness. Our post-processing approach implemented in remotIO's web application has proven to be useful in filtering the resultant deformation maps and in pinpointing problematic zones with potential ground deformation threats also over low-coherent areas.

TI  - Wire guided localisation for targeted axillary node dissection is accurate in axillary staging in node positive breast cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: This study investigated whether wire localisation of the histologically proven positive, clipped axillary lymph node (ALN) with subsequent targeted axillary dissection (TAD) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) improves axillary staging in breast cancer.Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients with primary breast cancer and core biopsy proven metastatic ALNs, that had an excellent nodal radiological response following NACT, treated at our centre between January 2016 and December 2018. The initial cohort of patients (Group 1) underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), with a minimum of three nodes were sampled. The subsequent cohort (Group 2) had a marker clip inserted in the metastatic ALN prior to NACT. This cohort underwent wire guided excision of the clipped node in addition to SLNB, with a minimum of three nodes sampled.Results: A total of 47 patients were identified. Group 1 comprised 22 patients with a sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification rate (IR) of 95%. 25 patients (Group 2) underwent wire guided clip location and the SLN IR was 100% with a 92% clipped node IR. Evidence of pathological complete response (pCR) in the clipped node was associated with pCR in other nodes.Conclusion: Targeted axillary dissection is a feasible technique following excellent response to NACT in selected patients with limited volume ALN metastasis, at diagnosis. The identification of the positive ALN during surgery is vital and the IR can be improved by clipping the node prior to NAG and wire guided localisation at the time of surgery.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage cervical cancer: current state of art
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor of survival in women with early stage cervical cancer. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is an accurate method for the assessment of lymph nodal involvement in early-stages cervical cancer and has been increasingly used instead of systematic pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). Less-radical lymph node dissection decreases the associated morbidity of PLND, especially the risk of lower-leg lymphoedema, which affects severely patient quality of life. SLN biopsy allows nodes ultrastaging and provides supplementary histological information by increasing the detection of tumor low-volume (isolated tumors cells and micrometastases). Moreover, SLN biopsy provides accurate anatomical information on pelvic lymphatic drainage pathway by identifying nodes outside of routine lymphadenectomy areas. Selection of a population at low-risk of nodal metastasis, a minimal training, and simple rules may ensure a low false negative rate. Several studies have shown that SLN mapping in these patients is feasible, with excellent detection rates and sensitivity. Combined detection with technetium-99 and blue dye has been widely used but recently, there has been increasing interest in the use of fluorescent dies such as indocyanine green (ICG) which would improve SLN detection. Although recent international guidelines recommend performing SLN biopsy in addition to PLND, SLN biopsy alone is not the gold-standard yet due to lack of prospective evidence, especially on long-term oncological safety. Some points remain controversial such as the low accuracy of intraoperative SLN status assessment by frozen section and the impact of micrometastasis on prognostic. The prospective randomized clinical trial SENTICOL III will answer to these problematics.

TI  - Religion, Creative Practice and Aestheticisation in Nick Cave's The Red Hand Files
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2018, Nick Cave launched The Red Hand Files website, where fans ask personal questions and the artist responds. This ongoing dialogue presents a unique iteration of religious visibility at the nexus of religion and the arts. Here, Cave articulates his personal religiosity in the wake of his son's death, detailing the role of creative practice, performance and communication. Cave's personal spirituality engages processes of aestheticisation that awaken experiences of inspiration and mystery. The epistemological orientation of alternative spirituality that values encounters with the ineffable and seeks to be free from static beliefs had previously found its antithesis in organised religion, but more recently, the fervent dogmatism of political correctness has applied its own pressure. As an example of religious aestheticisation within the tradition of alternative spirituality, The Red Hand Files exhibits the continued salience of this worldview despite the countervailing influence of politically correct culture.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are potentially dangerous areas where InSAR technology cannot be applied routinely in the absence of proper persistent or distributed scatterers. Here, we planned and investigated the use of truncated trihedral triangle corner reflectors (CRs) oriented to ascending and descending directions for Sentinel-1 orbit, which were mounted on the optimal concrete basement including an additional global navigation satellite system (GNSS) adapter. These integrated benchmarks were designed to produce a signal-to-clutter ratio of about 100 (i.e., 20 dB). The mechanical design allows optimal orientation of the reflectors and resistance against dynamic effects. We investigated 1:5 models of the CRs and integrated benchmarks in an anechoic chamber to estimate the effects of truncation and the interference of the twin reflectors. The main effect of the interference is the asymmetric monostatic radar cross section, which can be neglected. The integrated benchmarks were also investigated in two recent landslide areas in Hungary using Sentinel-1 single look complex (SLC) scenes, which confirmed that the preliminary requirements can be met.

TI  - Snail as sentinel organism for monitoring the environmental pollution; a review
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Environmental pollution, one of the most serious problems facing human health, ecosystems and biodiversity, is defined as the contamination of the physical and biological components of the atmosphere system which has harmful consequences for normal environmental processes. Animals, such as snails used as environmental pollution biomonitors, show multiple physiological mechanisms to counteract the effects of toxins in the environment due to their sensitivity to various contaminants and their ability to accumulate them through their tissues. The objective of this review is to explore the possibility of using different types of snails as potential and ideal monitoring matrices to assess air pollution and to detect heavy metal and POPs concentration by different extraction techniques including Soxhlet extraction, Accelerated Solvent Extraction, Solid Phase Extraction, Microwave-Assisted Extraction, Pressurized Hot Water extraction and Microwave Acid Digestion.

TI  - Dynamics of livestock -associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in pig movement networks: Insight from mathematical modeling and French data
T2  - EPIDEMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Livestock-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) colonizes livestock animals worldwide, especially pigs and calves. Although frequently carried asymptomatically, LA-MRSA can cause severe infections in humans. It is therefore important to better understand LA-MRSA spreading dynamics within pig farms and over pig movement networks, and to compare different strategies of control and surveillance. For this purpose, we propose a stochastic meta-population model of LA-MRSA spread along the French pig movement network (n = 10,542 farms), combining within- and between-farm dynamics, based on detailed data on breeding practices and pig movements between holdings. We calibrate the model using French epidemiological data. We then identify farm-level factors associated with the spreading potential of LA-MRSA in the network. We also show that, assuming control measures applied in a limited (n = 100) number of farms, targeting farms depending on their centrality in the network is the only way to significantly reduce LA-MRSA global prevalence. Finally, we investigate the scenario of emergence of a new LA-MRSA strain, and find that the farms with the highest indegree would be the best sentinels for a targeted surveillance of such a strain's introduction.

TI  - Effect of an injectable trace mineral supplement on the immune response of dairy calves
T2  - RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - On a spring calving, pastoral dairy farm, the first 40 heifer calves born after calving mid-point (50% of the herd calved) were blood sampled within 24 h. Thirty were selected, using stratified randomisation to form two equal groups (treatment and control) with the same distribution of serum total protein, copper, selenium, zinc, and manganese concentrations, age and breed. From the remaining 10 calves, five were randomly selected into a sentinel group to assess field exposure to Salmonella spp.All calves received two injections of a killed vaccine containing Salmonella spp. antigens at 2 and 6 weeks of age. Concurrently, the treatment group were injected with 1 mL/50 kg trace mineral supplement (TMS) containing 40 mg zinc, 10 mg manganese, 5 mg selenium, 15 mg copper per mL. Sentinel animals received no injections. All animals were bled from 2 to 9 weeks for assay of immune function. At three and four weeks, white blood cells from TMS calves had an increased percentage of cells phagocytosing (effect size = 9.36 and 4.35) and increased number of bacteria ingested per cell (effect size = 0.93 and 1.52). No differences were detected in gamma interferon response (effect size < 0.15) or Salmonella sp. antibody titres (effect size < 0.20).

TI  - The Cross-validation of Satellite OMI and OMPS Total Ozone with Pandora Measurement
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Korea launched Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Satellite (GEMS), a UV/visible spectrometer that measure pollution gases on 18 February 2020. Because satellite retrieval is an ill-posed inverse solving process, the validation with ground-based measurements or other satellite measurements is essential to obtain reliable products. For this purpose, satellite-based OMI and OMPS total column ozone (TCO), and ground-based Pandora TCO in Busan and Seoul were selected for future GEMS validation. First of all, the goal of this study is to validate the ground ozone data using characteristics that satellite data provide coherent ozone measurements on a global basis, although satellite data have a larger error than the ground-based measurements. In the cross validation between Pandora and OMI TCO, we have found abnormal deviation in ozone time series from Pandora #29 observed in Seoul. This shows that it is possible to perform inverse validation of ground data using satellite data. Then OMPS TCO was compared with verified Pandora TCO. Both data shows a correlation coefficient of 0.97, an RMSE of less than 2 DU and the OMPS-Pandora relative mean difference of >4%. The result also shows the OMPS-Pandora relative mean difference with SZA, TCO, cross-track position and season have insignificant dependence on those variables. In addition, we showed that appropriate thresholds depending on the spatial resolution of each satellite sensor are required to eliminate the impact of the cloud on Pandora TCO.

TI  - CorPhU: an algorithm based on phase closure for the correction of unwrapping errors in SAR interferometry
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is commonly used in Earth Sciences to study surface displacements or construct high resolution topographic maps. Recent satellites such as those of the Sentinel-1 constellation allow to derive dense deformation maps with millimetric precision with high revisit frequency. However, InSAR is still limited by interferometric coherence. Interferometric phase noise resulting from a loss of coherence, due to changes in scattering properties between repeated SAR acquisitions, may lead to unwrapping errors, which then in turn lead to centimetric errors in time-series reconstruction. We present an algorithm based on interferometric phase closure to automatically correct unwrapping errors. We describe the algorithm and highlight its performances with two case studies, in Lebanon with Envisat satellite data and in Central Turkey with Sentinel-1 data. The first data set is particularly affected by unwrapping errors because of long spatial (500 m) and temporal baseline interferograms (6 yr) and decorrelation due, in particular, to vegetation. The second data set contains unwrapping errors because of temporal changes in the scattering properties of the ground. For these two examples, the algorithm allows the correction of almost all detectable unwrapping errors, without requiring visual inspection or manual deletions. Our algorithm is efficient especially on large data sets, such as with Sentinel-1 constellation, where interferometric phase is redundant and improves eventually the reconstruction of time-series.

TI  - Crop nitrogen monitoring: Recent progress and principal developments in the context of imaging spectroscopy missions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Nitrogen (N) is considered as one of the most important plant macronutrients and proper management of N therefore is a pre-requisite for modern agriculture. Continuous satellite-based monitoring of this key plant trait would help to understand individual crop N use efficiency and thus would enable site-specific N management. Since hyperspectral imaging sensors could provide detailed measurements of spectral signatures corresponding to the optical activity of chemical constituents, they have a theoretical advantage over multi-spectral sensing for the detection of crop N. The current study aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview of crop N retrieval methods from hyperspectral data in the agricultural sector and in the context of future satellite imaging spectroscopy missions. Over 400 studies were reviewed for this purpose, identifying those estimating mass-based N (N concentration, N%) and area-based N (N content, N-area) using hyperspectral remote sensing data. Retrieval methods of the 125 studies selected in this review can be grouped into: (1) parametric regression methods, (2) linear nonparametric regression methods or chemometrics, (3) nonlinear nonparametric regression methods or machine learning regression algorithms, (4) physically-based or radiative transfer models (RTM), (5) use of alternative data sources (sun-induced fluorescence, SIF) and (6) hybrid or combined techniques. Whereas in the last decades methods for estimation of Narea and N% from hyperspectral data have been mainly based on simple parametric regression algorithms, such as narrowband vegetation indices, there is an increasing trend of using machine learning, RTM and hybrid techniques. Within plants, N is invested in proteins and chlorophylls stored in the leaf cells, with the proteins being the major nitrogen-containing biochemical constituent. However, in most studies, the relationship between N and chlorophyll content was used to estimate crop N, focusing on the visible-near infrared (VNIR) spectral domains, and thus neglecting protein-related N and reallocation of nitrogen to non-photosynthetic compartments. Therefore, we recommend exploiting the estimation of nitrogen via the proxy of proteins using hyperspectral data and in particular the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral domain. We further strongly encourage a standardization of nitrogen terminology, distinguishing between N% and Narea. Moreover, the exploitation of physically-based approaches is highly recommended combined with machine learning regression algorithms, which represents an interesting perspective for future research in view of new spaceborne imaging spectroscopy sensors.

T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatologic and anthropogenic pressures in coastal areas affect the coastal zone at different scales. With the development of new missions in open-access, satellites now represent an attractive solution for a broad public to capture local-scale coastal impacts at large scales. Here, the capability of the Sentinel 2 constellation to cover coastal areas and measure coastal processes -physical and biological. We show that Sentinel 2 enables high-frequency measurements across the globe. Cloud coverage at higher latitudes is overcome by decrease revisit time-intervals. Only around the equator, the longest revisit intervals and high cloud cover probability limits coastal measurements there. Sentinel 2 based methods are capable of estimating Digital Elevation Models for mid- to high-latitude coastal zones and sporadic spots for lower latitudes where 2 orbit swaths overlap. For the majority of the world's coastal bathymetries can be obtained with the Sentinel 2 imagery surpassing the depth of closure (beyond this offshore limit sediment transport is limited). Only in sheltered areas, wave-based bathymetry inversion is limited but at these areas inversion through colouring (light penetration) prevails. This works shows that Sentinel 2 enables coastal monitoring as never before, large spatial scale with revisits of a few days at most of the world. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - MAPPING VEGETATION COMMUNITIES INSIDE WETLANDS USING SENTINEL-2 IMAGERY IN IRELAND
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands provide habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal species and contribute significantly to overall biodiversity in Ireland. Despite these known ecosystem services, the total wetland area in Ireland has reduced significantly over the past few decades leading to an ongoing need to protect such environments. The EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) has recognised several wetlands types as "priority" habitats. This study concentrates on a subset of the priority habitats focussing on some groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems, (in particular calcareous fens and turloughs), as well as raised bogs. Monitoring these sites across the country by field visits is resource-intensive. Therefore, this study has evaluated remote sensing as a potentially cost-effective tool for monitoring the ecological health of the wetlands. Identification and presence of certain vegetation communities can indicate the condition of the wetland, which can be used for monitoring, for example, activities causing degradation or the progress of restoration attempts. The ecological composition of the wetlands has been analysed using open-source Sentinel-2 data. 10 bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2 data and 3 indices, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) were used to create vegetation maps of each wetland using Bagged Tree (BT) ensemble classifier and graph cut segmentation also known as MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimation. The proposed methodology has been validated on five raised bogs, five turloughs, and three fens at different times during 2017 and 2018 from which three case studies are presented. An overall classification accuracy up to 87% depending on the size of the vegetation community within each wetland has been achieved which suggests that the proposed method is appropriate for wetland health monitoring.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an extraction of valuable information with the help of trend analysis from a long time series of spatial data demands precision and the enormous amount of scientific computation. The trends themselves are exciting estimators of studying spatial and temporal changes in climate and its effects at global and regional scales. The present study was done to investigate the impact of the modifiable temporal unit problem (MTUP) which arises due to temporal aggregation. In this study, an attempt has been made in analysing vegetation change detection that took place between 2001 and 2016 using Terra MODIS13A3 monthly 1 km resolution time series data on a monthly basis. With the launch of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on-board aqua and terra platform, a new generation of satellite sensor data is now available. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index method has been employed for accurate classification of images and has proved to be successful. The results of this research work were the significant trend maps which were helpful in analysing spatial patterns in varying trends access different aggregation level to show the effect of MUTP on NDVI and climate forcing data over Nepal. The analysis showed that the average NDVI was higher during May to October in Nepal and lower during the rest of the months. While analysing the data from 2001 to 2016, the NDVI was least in 2001 and highest in 2015. Finally, the different type of session categorises and determines the NDVI of Nepali sessions and months.

TI  - Oil Spill Pollution and Fishery Resource Loss Assessment Based on GNOME.
T2  - Yuye Kexue Jinzhan
M3  - Article
AB  - By using the GNOME model of oil spillage, the drift trajectory and diffusion distribution of the "Century Light" oil spill were simulated. First, the FVCOM hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the tidal field, which was broadly consistent with the results of the tide tables. The wind field was determined by using the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis Data (CFSR) of the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The GNOME oil spill model was used for numerical simulation, and Tyson's method was used for the analysis of the contaminated area. The "minimum regret" trajectory and the best forecast region were obtained through numerical simulation. The comparison of the simulation results after 21 hours with the MODIS remote sensing monitoring data showed that the drift position was basically consistent. This paper describes the assessment criteria for various fishery resources and methods for determining marine ecological damage and loss compensation assessment. Combining the simulation results with the trawl survey data, the direct economic loss of swimming animals was calculated to be 61000 yuan, with the direct loss of fishery resources, within 4 days, reaching a value of 511900 yuan. The oil loss from the "Century Light" event reached a value of 2112600 yuan within 4 days. In this paper, the method of numerical simulation was related to the assessment of fishery resources, and the loss of fishery resources was estimated without on-site observation. The GNOME oil spill model can be applied to similar oil spill trajectories and for rapid prediction of flooding, to provide a method and reference for emergency response to oil spill accidents. The combination of numerical simulation of oil spills and on-site observations will be an important reference method for new ideas in future calculations of fishery resource losses and fishing losses, leading to more comprehensive and scientific handling of oil spills.

TI  - The declining trend of HIV-Infection among pregnant women in Cameroon infers an epidemic decline in the general population
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: HIV remains a generalised epidemic in Cameroon, with regular sentinel surveillance surveys (SSS) conducted among pregnant women to monitor the epidemiological dynamics, and for strategic policy making. Our main objective was to actualise data on HIV epidemiology and compare the trends overtime among pregnant women versus data from the general population in Cameroon.Methods: Sentinel surveillance was conducted in 2016 among pregnant women in the 10 regions (60 sites) of Cameroon, targeting 7,000 first antenatal care (ANC-1) attendees (4,000 in urban; 3,000 in rural). HIV testing was done following the serial national algorithm at the National Public Health Laboratory. Results of 2016 were compared with 2009 and 2012 dataset, alongside reports from the general population; with p < 0.05 considered statistical significant.Findings: A total of 6,859 ANC-1 (97.99% sampling) were enrolled in 2016, with 99.19% (6,513/6,566) acceptability for HIV testing; similar to performances in 2009 and 2012 (>99%). National prevalence of HIV was 5.70% (389/6,819), similar between urban (5.58%) and rural (5.87%) settings. HIV prevalence among pregnant women declined significantly from 2009 (7.6%), 2012 (7.8%) to 2016 (5.7%), p < 0.0001; with a similar declining trend in the general population: from 2004 (5.5%), 2011 (4.3%) to 2017 (3.4%), p < 0.0001. Difference between SSS and the population-based survey was non-significant (r = 0.6; p < 0.285). Following geographical settings, HIV prevalence was higher in urban vs. rural settings from 2009-2012 (p < 0.0001), followed by similar rates in 2016. Early-age infection (15-24 years) decreased from 6.7% in 2009 to 3.4% in 2016, with remarkable declines in new infections within the age ranges 15-19 years (5.1%-1.57%) and 20-24 years (7.8%-4.39%).Interpretation: With high acceptability in HIV testing, the prevalence of HIV-infection through SSS indicates a declining but generalised epidemic among pregnant women in Cameroon. Of note, as the declining prevalence among pregnant women also reflects an epidemic reduction in the g ral population, SSS represents an efficient strategy to understand the dynamics of HIV epidemics in the general Cameroonian population, pending validation by periodic population surveys.

TI  - A Comparison of Adult Mosquito Trapping Methods to Assess Potential West Nile Virus Mosquito Vectors in Greece during the Onset of the 2018 Transmission Season
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) threatens the health of humans and equines worldwide.Culex(Cx.)pipienscomplex mosquitoes are major vectors but numerous other species have been implicated. Due to variations in blood-feeding behaviour,Cx. pipiensbiotypes and hybrids influence transmission, from enzootic cycles (between mosquitoes and birds), to spill-over transmission to humans and equines. In this study, mosquitoes were collected in May-June 2018 during the early period of the transmission season from two regional units of Greece, where WNV cases had been reported in the previous four years (Palaio Faliro and Argolida). A total of 1062 mosquitoes were collected with Biogents Sentinel 2 traps collecting both a greater number of all mosquito species and theCx. pipienscomplex than CDC miniature light traps or Heavy Duty EVS traps. Molecular identification confirmed additional species includingAedes albopictus.The proportion ofCx. pipiensbiotypes in Palaio Faliro was 54.5%pipiens, 20.0%molestusand 25.5% hybrids. In Argolida, the collection comprised 68.1%pipiensbiotype, 8.3%molestusbiotype and 23.6% hybrids. Screening resulted in WNV detection in three females of thepipiensbiotype and in one hybrid. As hybrids play a role in spill-over transmission, these findings highlight the importance of entomological surveillance programs incorporating molecular xenomonitoring as an early warning before human cases at the onset of the transmission season.

TI  - Land-use-land-cover change detection and application of Markov model: A case study of Eastern part of Kolkata
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use change of a region acts as an indicator of human impact on the landscape. Increasing urban growth has induced adverse landscape alterations which need to be predicted and controlled, especially in the urban areas and 'rurban' fringes, to prevent the trends of urbanization from engulfing the ecology. The present discussion makes an attempt to address this issue by assessing the present and predicting the future spatio-temporal dynamisms in land use and land cover along the urban and rurban fringe area of eastern Kolkata, stretching from the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass to Bhangar areas in West Bengal, India. For the fulfilment of the work, Landsat imageries of 1991 and 2016 have been chosen to depict the present urban growth, following which the results have been predicted and validated to show how the various land-use categories might change, using the Markov model. The study has depicted that urban growth continues to shift eastwards, resulting in greater number of urban patches in eastwards. The validation of positive and negative growth of respective land-use patterns with Markov model is within 10%. So, if the current reclamation activities continue, the original land cover shall decrease by 70% of the study area and these shall be replaced by urban areas.

TI  - TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF DEFORESTATION IN THE HYDROGRAPHIC BASIN OF SORORO RIVER - CARAJAS INTEGRATION REGION, PA
T2  - REVISTA GEOARAGUAIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation caused by changes in land use and occupation in river basins, mainly associated with economically relevant activities, results in environmental, social and economic impacts. This problem is evident in the municipalities of Para, as in the Region of Integration of Carajas, in the southeast of the State, therefore the study in the area is justified, whose objective was to carry out an analysis of the deforestation in the hydrographic basin of the Sororo river, in the years of 1989, 1999, 2009 and 2016, with association of activities developed in the area. Therefore, the deductive method was used, with a quantitative approach, applied nature and exploratory procedure, linked to the bibliographic survey. As for the delimitation of the basin and quantification of deforestation, vectorized information and RGB images were collected from the Landsat 5 and 8 satellites, and the geoprocessing occurred using the ArcGIS and Envi software. The data obtained indicated for the years 1989, 1999, 2009 and 2016 the equivalent of 17,76%, 57,02%, 76,24% and 71,57% of deforestation of the total area of the basin, respectively. These high values are related to the opening of roads, settlements, the Grande Carajas Project and the considerable growth of regional cattle farming, where the greatest preservation was in the Sororo Indigenous Land. The reduction in deforestation may be linked to actions to remove the region from the list of Amazonian municipalities that most deforest. Therefore, the Sororo river basin reflects the degrading potential of economic activities, in which monitoring and detailing of deforested areas and causes of vegetation suppression are essential.

TI  - A Tale of Grass and Trees: Characterizing Vegetation Change in Payne's Creek National Park, Belize from 1975 to 2019
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The lowland savannas of Belize are important areas to conserve for their biodiversity. This study takes place in Payne's Creek National Park (PCNP) in the southern coastal plain of Belize. PCNP protects diverse terrestrial and coastal ecosystems, unique physical features, and wildlife. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification technique was used to classify the heterogeneous landscape of PCNP to characterize woody and non-woody conversion in a time-series of remotely sensed data from 1975, 1993, 2011 and 2019. Results indicate that the SVM classifier performs well in this small savanna landscape (average overall accuracy of 91.9%) with input variables of raw Landsat imagery, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), elevation, and soil type. Our change trajectory analysis shows that PCNP is a relatively stable landscape, but with certain areas that are prone to multiple conversions in the time-series. Woody vegetation mostly occurs in areas with variable slopes and riparian zones with increased nutrient availability. This study does not show extensive woody conversion in PCNP, contrary to widespread woody encroachment that is occurring in savannas on other continents. These high-performing SVM classification maps and future studies will be an important resource of information on Central American savanna vegetation dynamics for savanna scientists and land managers that use adaptive management for ecosystem preservation.

TI  - Source Model for Sabancaya Volcano Constrained by DInSAR and GNSS Surface Deformation Observation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sabancaya is the most active volcano of the Ampato-Sabancaya Volcanic Complex (ASVC) in southern Peru and has been erupting since 2016. The analysis of ascending and descending Sentinel-1 orbits (DInSAR) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) datasets from 2014 to 2019 imaged a radially symmetric inflating area, uplifting at a rate of 35 to 50 mm/yr and centered 5 km north of Sabancaya. The DInSAR and GNSS data were modeled independently. We inverted the DInSAR data to infer the location, depth, and volume change of the deformation source. Then, we verified the DInSAR deformation model against the results from the inversion of the GNSS data. Our modelling results suggest that the imaged inflation pattern can be explained by a source 12 to 15 km deep, with a volume change rate between 26 x 10(6) m(3)/yr and 46 x 10(6) m(3)/yr, located between the Sabancaya and Hualca Hualca volcano. The observed regional inflation pattern, concentration of earthquake epicenters north of the ASVC, and inferred location of the deformation source indicate that the current eruptive activity at Sabancaya is fed by a deep regional reservoir through a lateral magmatic plumbing system.

TI  - Hierarchical global plant biophysical regions as potential analysis units
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional and global vegetation simulations can be problematic when analysis units to which parameters are assigned do not align with plant productivity and phenology. Having a suite of predefined biophysical regions at a variety of scales that correspond to differences in plant productivity and phenology would allow analysts to select a set of analysis units at the scale needed. In other cases, environmental or social responses may be hypothesized to be related to differences in plant dynamics. One may compare the discrimination in such data that biophysical regions at different scales provide to determine which best distinguishes the responses in question, such that like responses fall within the same regions to the degree possible. If those relationships are significant, the responses may then be extrapolated based on the biophysical regions. I defined hierarchical biophysical regions based on plant productivity and phenology by clustering global 0.083 degree resolution normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) over a 10 year period. Agglomerative average-linkage distances based on squared error between clusters were conducted using an iterative sampling approach to merge more than 2 million clusters into fewer and fewer clusters based on NDVI greenness profiles comprised of 240 values over 10 years, until all cells were in a single cluster. Greater and greater differences in greenness profiles were ignored at higher levels of the hierarchy. Using a difference increment of 0.1, 253 non-duplicative sets of clusters were created, and 107 of those were included in animations that may be used to explore differences in global plant dynamics. Differences in clusters were quantified based on comparing the focal set of cluster results with 10 other cluster sets. Analysts may use the hierarchical clusters to improve the alignment of their parameter sets that inform plant growth and other dynamics with real-world plant dynamics.

TI  - Syndromic Surveillance of Acute Gastroenteritis Using the French Health Insurance Database: Discriminatory Algorithm and Drug Prescription Practices Evaluations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The French national public health agency (Sante publique France) has used data from the national health insurance reimbursement system (SNDS) to identify medicalised acute gastroenteritis (mAGE) for more than 10 years. This paper presents the method developed to evaluate this system: performance and characteristics of the discriminatory algorithm, portability in mainland and overseas French departments, and verification of the mAGE database updating process. Pharmacy surveys with certified mAGE from 2012 to 2015 were used to characterise mAGE and to estimate the sensitivity and predictive positive value (PPV) of the algorithm. Prescription characteristics from these pharmacy surveys and from 2014 SNDS prescriptions in six mainland and overseas departments were compared. The sensitivity (0.90) and PPV (0.82) did not vary according to the age of the population or year. Prescription characteristics were similar within all studied departments. This confirms that the algorithm can be used in all French departments, for both paediatric and adult populations, with stability and durability over time. The algorithm can identify mAGE cases at a municipal level. The validated system has been implemented in a national waterborne disease outbreaks surveillance system since 2019 with the aim of improving the prevention of infectious disease risk attributable to localised tap water systems.

TI  - Modelling and optimization of machining parameters during hardened steel AISID3 turning using RSM, ANN and DFA techniques: Comparative study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, the relationships linking the cutting conditions to the different technological parameters are becoming a major industrial objective. The present work deals with some machinability investigations involving surface roughness and cutting force in finish turning of AISI D3-hardened steel using carbide, ceramic and coated ceramic inserts. The combined effects of the cutting parameters represented by the cutting depth (ap), the cutting tool (Tool), the cutting speed (Vc), and the feed rate (f) on the output parameters illustrated by both the surface roughness (Ra) and the cutting force (Fy) are investigated using the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The modelling of surface roughness and cutting force is carried out using both Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). In order to determine the most efficient technique, the models developed are compared in terms of the coefficient of determination (R-2), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Model Predictive Error (MPE). Furthermore, a multiobjective optimization using the Desirability Function Analysis (DFA) has been performed. The obtained results show that the ANN models (For Ra: R-2=93%, RMSE=0.02%, MPE=4.99% and for Fy: R-2=94%, RMSE=2.52%, MPE=3.11%) performed better than those developed using the RSM approach (For Ra: R-2=90.4%, RMSE=0.051%, MPE=18.21% and for Fy: R-2=79%, RMSE=31.17%, MPE=55.92%). As a consequence, the achieved ANN models for (Ra) and (Fy) are exploited as objective function for the response optimization applying the DFA technique. The optimum level of the input parameters for the combined desirability is finally identified as ap1-Tool3-Vc3-f1 for both (Ra) and (Fy) with a maximum error of 2.94%.

TI  - Using Deep Learning to Count Albatrosses from Space: Assessing Results in Light of Ground Truth Uncertainty
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many wildlife species inhabit inaccessible environments, limiting researchers ability to conduct essential population surveys. Recently, very high resolution (sub-metre) satellite imagery has enabled remote monitoring of certain species directly from space; however, manual analysis of the imagery is time-consuming, expensive and subjective. State-of-the-art deep learning approaches can automate this process; however, often image datasets are small, and uncertainty in ground truth labels can affect supervised training schemes and the interpretation of errors. In this paper, we investigate these challenges by conducting both manual and automated counts of nesting Wandering Albatrosses on four separate islands, captured by the 31 cm resolution WorldView-3 sensor. We collect counts from six observers, and train a convolutional neural network (U-Net) using leave-one-island-out cross-validation and different combinations of ground truth labels. We show that (1) interobserver variation in manual counts is significant and differs between the four islands, (2) the small dataset can limit the networks ability to generalise to unseen imagery and (3) the choice of ground truth labels can have a significant impact on our assessment of network performance. Our final results show the network detects albatrosses as accurately as human observers for two of the islands, while in the other two misclassifications are largely caused by the presence of noise, cloud cover and habitat, which was not present in the training dataset. While the results show promise, we stress the importance of considering these factors for any study where data is limited and observer confidence is variable.

TI  - Near Real-Time Automated Early Mapping of the Perimeter of Large Forest Fires from the Aggregation of VIIRS and MODIS Active Fires in Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In contrast with current operational products of burned area, which are generally available one month after the fire, active fires are readily available, with potential application for early evaluation of approximate fire perimeters to support fire management decision making in near real time. While previous coarse-scale studies have focused on relating the number of active fires to a burned area, some local-scale studies have proposed the spatial aggregation of active fires to directly obtain early estimate perimeters from active fires. Nevertheless, further analysis of this latter technique, including the definition of aggregation distance and large-scale testing, is still required. There is a need for studies that evaluate the potential of active fire aggregation for rapid initial fire perimeter delineation, particularly taking advantage of the improved spatial resolution of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) 375 m, over large areas and long periods of study. The current study tested the use of convex hull algorithms for deriving coarse-scale perimeters from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire detections, compared against the mapped perimeter of the MODIS collection 6 (MCD64A1) burned area. We analyzed the effect of aggregation distance (750, 1000, 1125 and 1500 m) on the relationships of active fire perimeters with MCD64A1, for both individual fire perimeter prediction and total burned area estimation, for the period 2012-2108 in Mexico. The aggregation of active fire detections from MODIS and VIIRS demonstrated a potential to offer coarse-scale early estimates of the perimeters of large fires, which can be available to support fire monitoring and management in near real time. Total burned area predicted from aggregated active fires followed the same temporal behavior as the standard MCD64A1 burned area, with potential to also account for the role of smaller fires detected by the thermal anomalies. The proposed methodology, based on easily available algorithms of point aggregation, is susceptible to be utilized both for near real-time and historical fire perimeter evaluation elsewhere. Future studies might test active fires aggregation between regions or biomes with contrasting fuel characteristics and human activity patterns against medium resolution (e.g., Landsat and Sentinel) fire perimeters. Furthermore, coarse-scale active fire perimeters might be utilized to locate areas where such higher-resolution imagery can be downloaded to improve the evaluation of fire extent and impact.

TI  - Seagrass habitat in Tarawa Lagoon, Kiribati: Service benefits and links to national priority issues
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a review around seagrass habitat in Tarawa Lagoon, Kiribati and explores the links between seagrass occurrence and the national priority issues of climate change, urban development, human health, nearshore fisheries, threatened species, ocean policy, research capacity and awareness. The contribution of healthy seagrass habitats to many aspects of these national issues is often overlooked and there is need to establish the knowledge gaps and priority actions that can enable mitigation of issues that impact on valuable seagrass resources and their management. Research data on seagrass habitats in Kiribati, and the wider Pacific Island region, is limited and this hinders informed decisions at local, national and regional levels. We present a comprehensive review on seagrass within a national context to aid prioritisation and uptake of information for resource owners, and wider stakeholders, in Kiribati while acknowledging local expertise. The paper highlights data and knowledge gaps that if addressed, will provide information useful to Kiribati nationals, communities and government stakeholders. Recommendations for actions that fill these gaps and build understanding of seagrass resources in Kiribati are provided.

TI  - One for two: A novel and highly sensitive virulence factor-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the simultaneous detection of<i>Rodentibacter pneumotropicus</i>and<i>Rodentibacter heylii</i>in environmental sample material
T2  - LABORATORY ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hygienic monitoring of laboratory rodents has focused more and more on the analysis of environmental sample material by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. This approach requires profound knowledge of specific genetic sequences of the agents to be monitored and the assays need to be permanently adapted to take the latest research into account. [Pasteurella]pneumotropicawas recently reclassified into the new genusRodentibacter, withRodentibacter (R.) pneumotropicusandR. heyliias the most commonly detected species in laboratory mouse colonies. This study aimed at the development of a specific qPCR assay for the simultaneous detection of both agents. A novel primer probe set, based on detection of the specific virulence factor, 'inclusion body protein A' gene (ibpA), was confirmed by testing the assay on currently describedRodentibactertype species and otherPasteurellaceae. Furthermore, it was validated within four different barrier units and results were compared with the cultural analysis of sentinel mice. The assay was suitable to specifically detectR. pneumotropicusandR. heyliiand discriminate them from other murineRodentibacterspp. In addition, it revealed high sensitivity for the detection of both agents in environmental sampling material including exhaust air dust in individually ventilated cage systems. Altogether, higher pathogen prevalence was detected via qPCR of environmental samples compared with cultural diagnostics of sentinel mice. This study describes a qPCR assay for the simultaneous detection ofR. pneumotropicusandR. heylii. This assay was demonstrated to be beneficial during routine health monitoring, especially with regard to environmental sampling strategies.

TI  - Urban heat island effect of a polynuclear megacity Delhi - Compactness and thermal evaluation of four sub-cities
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Planning for sustainable cities generally focuses on compact, human-scale cities. The urban paradigms underlying each city produce morphologies which generate a distinctive local urban climate. In this paper, four sub-cities in Delhi NCR, India, are classified using local climate zone (LCZ), and then analysed for thermal performance and compactness. These sub-cities are broadly classified as a garden city (LCZ 5(A)), a resettlement colony (LCZ 3), a mixed land-use city (LCZ 5), and an industrial city (LCZ 5(6)). The surface UHI (UHISurf) is estimated using Google Earth Engine with MODIS, canopy layer UHI (UHIUCL) with meteorological data, and density using Spacematrix. The nighttime UHIUCL is 7.52 degrees C (LCZ 5 and LCZ(A)) and the UHI(Surf )is 5.2 degrees C (LCZ 5 and LCZ D). A major apprehension is the residual temperature at sunrise (5-8 degrees C) leading to high heat stress and detrimental health impacts. The heating and cooling rate, reduced by a factor of three is observed (LCZ 5-0.25 degrees C/h). The least UHI is experienced by LCZ 5(A) and the built density is highest in LCZ 3. The mixed-land use (LCZ 5) city performs poorly, whereas the industrial city (LCZ 5(6)) performs optimally on both thermal and density scales.

TI  - Along-Track Interferometric SAR Systems for Ground-Moving Target Indication: Achievements, Potentials, and Outlook
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Along-track interferometric (ATI) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has proven a powerful tool for ground-moving target indication (GMTI). ATI-SAR systems use more than one antenna (at least two), mounted on a moving platform and displaced along the moving direction. Each SAR antenna provides a complex image of the same ground scene acquired with a very small time delay, depending on the separation (baseline) between the antennas. Starting from these interferometric images, ground-moving targets can be detected and their radial velocity estimated.

TI  - Differences in direct costs of patients with stage I cutaneous melanoma: A real-world data analysis
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Clinical factors, such as tumor thickness, ulceration and growth phase have a role as prognostic factors for stage I melanoma. However, it is still under debate whether these variables influence the related direct costs. We aimed to investigate which clinical factors represent direct health care "cost drivers" for stage I melanoma.Materials and method: Analyses were conducted on a cohort of patients diagnosed with stage I melanoma. Differences in the costs incurred by different groups of patients were examined using Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric tests. Log linear multivariate analysis was used to identify the clinical drivers of the total direct costs one and two years after diagnosis. The study was conducted from the perspective of Italy's National Health care System.Results: One year after diagnosis, patients whose melanomas had a Breslow thickness >= 0.8 mmin (compared with those with lower thickness) and a vertical growth phase (compared with those with radial growth) incurred higher costs for hospitalization, as well as higher overall costs. One year after their diagnosis, treatment of patients with stage I melanoma in the vertical growth phase costs 50% more (95% CI: 22-85%) than their counterparts with a radial growth pattern, resulting in an estimated absolute increase of (sic) 256.23. Having a tumor thicker than 0.8 mm prompted an increase of 91% (95% CI: 43 -155%) in the costs ((sic)955.24 in absolute terms).Conclusion: Our data indicate a heterogeneity in the direct costs of stage I melanoma patients during the first year after diagnosis, which can be partly explained by clinical prognostic factors, like tumor thickness and growth pattern.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in a war-torn country: Lessons learned in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - ONE HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - There is no doubt that antibiotics have reduced the burden of bacterial infectious diseases. Antimicrobial resistance threatens the effectiveness of successful treatment of infections and constitutes a public health concern with national and global dimensions. This problem is worrisome in war-torn areas like the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The difficulties experienced by war-torn nations in addressing antimicrobial resistance are significant for the rest of the globe as microbes do not acknowledge boundaries and do not distinguish between peace and wartime. In this paper, we describe the impact of warfare on the social determinants of health, the environment and biodiversity, and its consequences on the antibiotic use and the host-pathogen interplay. Furthermore, we describe different pillars to be taken into account, learned in a war-torn area, in combating antimicrobial resistance. These lessons are summarized in terms of tools to be used for combating antimicrobial resistance, challenges to overcome in war-torn setting and core actions to be undertaken. Surveillance is a valuable tool to combat antimicrobial resistance as it helps to detect resistant bacteria, enables correct decisions to be taken, guides policy recommendations and tracks the antibiotic use and misuse. The challenges encountered in this region include the shortage of competent laboratories, poor infrastructure and data management, lack of standard protocols, low coverage of surveillance, lack of intersectoral cooperation, and inadequate national, regional and international collaboration. Regarding this situation, the core actions to be undertaken include the establishment of ABR surveillance and monitoring systems, building laboratory capacity for rapid and reliable diagnostic testing, and engagement in national, regional and global surveillance networks. Therefore, this study showed an urgent need for establishing and implementing sentinel site surveillance laboratories and elaborating and implementing national action plans for combating antimicrobial resistance.

TI  - A Comparison of Three Trapezoid Models Using Optical and Thermal Satellite Imagery for Water Table Depth Monitoring in Estonian Bogs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored the potential of optical and thermal satellite imagery to monitor temporal and spatial changes in the position of the water table depth (WTD) in the peat layer of northern bogs. We evaluated three different trapezoid models that are proposed in the literature for soil moisture monitoring in regions with mineral soils. Due to the tight capillary connection between water table and surface soil moisture, we hypothesized that the soil moisture indices retrieved from these models would be correlated with WTD measured in situ. Two trapezoid models were based on optical and thermal imagery, also known as Thermal-Optical TRApezoid Models (TOTRAM), and one was based on optical imagery alone, also known as the OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM). The models were applied to Landsat imagery from 2008 to 2019 and the derived soil moisture indices were compared with in-situ WTD from eight locations in two Estonian bogs. Our results show that only the OPTRAM index was significantly (p-value < 0.05) correlated in time with WTD (average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.41 and 0.37, for original and anomaly time series, respectively), while the two tested TOTRAM indices were not. The highest temporal correlation coefficients (up to 0.8) were observed for OPTRAM over treeless parts of the bogs. An assessment of the spatial correlation between soil moisture indices and WTD indicated that all three models did not capture the spatial variation in water table depth. Instead, the spatial patterns of the indices were primarily attributable to vegetation patterns.

TI  - Risk factors associated with failing pre-transmission assessment surveys (pre-TAS) in lymphatic filariasis elimination programs: Results of a multi-country analysis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) as a public health problem requires a minimum of five effective rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) and demonstrating low prevalence in subsequent assessments. The first assessments recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) are sentinel and spot-check sites-referred to as pre-transmission assessment surveys (pre-TAS)-in each implementation unit after MDA. If pre-TAS shows that prevalence in each site has been lowered to less than 1% microfilaremia or less than 2% antigenemia, the implementation unit conducts a TAS to determine whether MDA can be stopped. Failure to pass pre-TAS means that further rounds of MDA are required. This study aims to understand factors influencing pre-TAS results using existing programmatic data from 554 implementation units, of which 74 (13%) failed, in 13 countries. Secondary data analysis was completed using existing data from Bangladesh, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Haiti, Indonesia, Mali, Nepal, Niger, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Uganda. Additional covariate data were obtained from spatial raster data sets. Bivariate analysis and multilinear regression were performed to establish potential relationships between variables and the pre-TAS result. Higher baseline prevalence and lower elevation were significant in the regression model. Variables statistically significantly associated with failure (p-value <= 0.05) in the bivariate analyses included baseline prevalence at or above 5% or 10%, use of Filariasis Test Strips (FTS), primary vector of Culex, treatment with diethylcarbamazine-albendazole, higher elevation, higher population density, higher enhanced vegetation index (EVI), higher annual rainfall, and 6 or more rounds of MDA. This paper reports for the first time factors associated with pre-TAS results from a multi-country analysis. This information can help countries more effectively forecast program activities, such as the potential need for more rounds of MDA, and prioritize resources to ensure adequate coverage of all persons in areas at highest risk of failing pre-TAS.

TI  - Damage Analysis of Three Long-Track Tornadoes Using High-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of tornado damage can provide valuable observations for post-event surveys and reconstructions. The tornadoes of 3 March 2019 in the southeastern United States are an ideal opportunity to relate high-resolution satellite imagery of damage with estimated wind speeds from post-event surveys, as well as with the Rankine vortex tornado wind field model. Of the spectral metrics tested, the strongest correlations with survey-estimated wind speeds are found using a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, used as a proxy for vegetation health) difference image and a principal components analysis emphasizing differences in red and blue band reflectance. NDVI-differenced values across the width of the EF-4 Beauregard-Smiths Station, Alabama, tornado path resemble the pattern of maximum ground-relative wind speeds across the width of the Rankine vortex model. Maximum damage sampled using these techniques occurred within 130 m of the tornado vortex center. The findings presented herein establish the utility of widely accessible Sentinel imagery, which is shown to have sufficient spatial resolution to make inferences about the intensity and dynamics of violent tornadoes occurring in vegetated areas.

TI  - Temperature and Humidity Profile Retrieval from FY4-GIIRS Hyperspectral Data Using Artificial Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a new technique for retrieving temperature and humidity profiles based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using data acquired from the GIIRS (Geosynchronous Interferometric Infrared Sounder) L1 and ERA-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis). The approach is also compared against another method that uses simulated data from the radiative transfer model to construct the retrieval network. Furthermore, the two methods of network construction are evaluated in the North China Plain for July and August 2018, for which ground validated observations concurrent to the satellite data were available. In summary, the results showed that: (1) the ANN built with the GIIRS L1 and the EC data is superior to that built with the forward simulation and EC data in retrieval accuracy; (2) the retrieval accuracy for the troposphere exceeds that for the stratosphere; (3) the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the relative humidity in the troposphere as retrieved by the two ANNs are 6.003% and 10.608%, respectively; (4) a relatively low correlation (R) between the simulated and observed radiance of the GIIRS is found, ranging between 720 and 736.875 cm(-1), and the correlation between the simulated and observed radiance of the water vapor channels exceeds that between the temperature channels; (5) compared with Atmospheric Infrared Sounder's (AIRS') products, our retrieved temperature profiles exhibit preferable consistency and the humidity retrievals also show an acceptable accuracy. Our study offers important insights towards improving our ability to retrieve atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles from the most sophisticated Earth Observation instruments such as the GIIRS of the FY-4 satellite, which could assist in expanding the use of those products globally.

TI  - Monitoring the Vegetation Dynamics in the Dongting Lake Wetland from 2000 to 2019 Using the BEAST Algorithm Based on Dense Landsat Time Series
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic monitoring and analysis of wetland vegetation play important roles in revealing the change, restoration and reconstruction of the ecosystem environment. The increasing availability of high spatial-temporal resolution remote sensing data provides an unprecedented opportunity for wetland dynamic monitoring and change detection. Using the reconstructed dense monthly Landsat time series, this study focuses on the continuous monitoring of vegetation dynamics in Dongting Lake wetland, south China, in the last two decades (2000-2019) by using the Bayesian estimator of abrupt change, seasonal change, and trend (BEAST) method. Firstly, the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) model is applied to blend Landsat and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images on the basis of the input image pair selection strategy named "cross-fusion" to generate the monthly time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with the spatial resolution of 30 m. Then, the abrupt changes, trend, and seasonality of the vegetation in the study area as well as the uncertainties of change detection are estimated by the BEAST method. Results show that there is a close relationship between the ground true data and the estimated changepoints. A high overall accuracy (OA) of 87.37% and Kappa coefficient of 0.85 were achieved by the proposed framework. Additionally, the temporal validation got the interval intersection of 86.57% and the absolute difference of mean interval length of 6.8 days. All of the results demonstrate that the vegetation changes in the Dongting Lake wetland varied spatially and temporally in the last two decades, because of extreme weathers and anthropogenic factors. The presented approach can accurately identify the vegetation changes and time of disturbance in both the spatial and temporal domains, and also can retrieve the evolution process of wetland vegetation under the influence of climate changes and human activities. Therefore, it can be used to reveal potential causes of the degradation and recovery of wetland vegetation in subtropical areas.

TI  - Industrial Mobilization-Assessing Surge Capabilities, Wartime Risk, and System Brittleness
T2  - NAVAL ENGINEERS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - With the shift of US strategic focus to great power competition, interest in industrial mobilization for a long duration, high-intensity conflict has returned. However, the highly consolidated and fragile US defense industrial base is not designed to meet this challenge.To gain insight into the ability of the defense industrial base to meet the demands of great power conflict, the project analyzed the time needed to replace weapon systems' inventory at peacetime and surge production rates. The project found that to replace MDAP inventories at surge production rates would take an average of 8.7 years. Some investment categories are at more risk than others, Navy shipbuilding being uniquely challenged. Programs with analogs in the civilian economy appear to have fa replacement rates than military unique systems. Finally, the industrial base has become more brittle over time m that that it would take longer to replace inventories at FY 2020 production rates than at FY 1999 production rates. These findings indicate that existing surge capacities for major defense acquisition programs fall short of what will be needed for a long duration great power conflict. More research is needed to provide decision-makers with options to cope with this shortfall.

TI  - Long-term analysis of clear nights using satellite data considering astronomical sites in western China
T2  - RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A large ground-based optical/infrared telescope is being planned for a world-class astronomical site in China. The cloud-free night percentage is the primary meteorological consideration for evaluating candidate sites. The data from GMS and NOAA satellites and the MODIS instrument were utilized in this research, covering the period from 1996 to 2015. Our data analysis benefits from overlapping results from different independent teams as well as a uniform analysis of selected sites using GMS+NOAA data. Although significant ground-based monitoring is needed to validate these findings, we identify three different geographical regions with a high percentage of cloud-free conditions (similar to 83% on average), which is slightly lower than at Mauna Kea and Cerro Armazones (similar to 85% on average) and were chosen for the large international projects TMT and ELT respectively. Our study finds evidence that cloud distributions and the seasonal changes affected by the prevailing westerly winds and summer monsoons reduce the cloud cover in areas influenced by the westerlies. This is consistent with the expectations from climate change models and is suggestive that most of the identified sites will have reduced cloud cover in the future.

TI  - The role of EcoTypes in engagement across difference
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In our current political context, engagement across difference appears to be more difficult, yet more necessary, than ever before. Engagement does not require total agreement, but rather a commitment to open communication and respect across ideological divides, skills that can and should be taught in higher education. EcoTypes is a new survey instrument designed to disaggregate environmental ideas in order to uncover and articulate both agreement and disagreement in environmental thought. Within Environmental Studies and Sciences programs, a tool like EcoTypes can help identify ideological divides within a student population that sees itself (either accurately or not) as relatively monolithic in their beliefs and worldview. More broadly, EcoTypes can be used to move populations away from their initial perceptions of each other as "for" or "against" environmentalism toward more nuanced understandings of diverse environmental ideas. I describe in detail my experiences using the EcoTypes survey in the classroom and explore how this tool could also be useful at various scales outside of the Environmental Studies and Sciences classroom context.

TI  - Novel preoperative predictive score to evaluate lymphovascular space involvement in endometrial cancer: an aid to the sentinel lymph node algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionSentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection has been recognized as a valid tool for staging in patients with endometrial cancer. Several factors are predictors of recurrence and survival in endometrial cancer, including positive lymphovascular space invasion. The aim of this study is to formulate a pre-operative score that, in the event of no-SLN identification, may give an estimate of the true probability of lymphovascular space invasion and guide management.MethodologyThis was a multi-institutional retrospective study conducted from January 2007 to December 2017. We included all patients with any grade endometrial tumor with a complete pathological description of the surgical specimen and with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. All patients underwent a class A hysterectomy according to Querleu and Morrow and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Lymphadenectomy was performed based on patient risk of node metastases. In order to verify the predictive capacity of the parameters associated with lymphovascular space invasion status, grading, abnormal CA125 (>35 units/ml), myometrial invasion, and tumor size, a synthetic score was calculated. The score was introduced in the receiver operating characteristic curve model in which the binary classifier was represented by the lymphovascular space invasion status. The ideal cut-off was calculated with the determination of the Youden index. Sensitivity and negative predictive value of lymphovascular space invasion score was calculated in patients with lymph node metastasis.ResultsSix hundred and fourteen patients were included in the study. The average age and BMI of patients were 64.8 (range 33-88) years and 30.1 (range 17-64) respectively. Of the 284 patients who underwent lymphadenectomy, 231 (81.3%) patients had no lymph node metastases, 33 (11.6%) patients had metastatic pelvic lymph nodes, 12 (4.2%) patients had metastatic aortic lymph nodes, and eight (2.8%) patients had both pelvic and aortic metastatic lymph nodes. Lymphovascular space invasion was associated with deep myometrial infiltration (P<0.001), G3 grading (P<0.001), tumor size >= 25 mm (P=0.012), abnormal CA125 (P<0.001), recurrence (P<0.001), overall survival (P<0.001), and disease-free survival (P<0.01). Of all patients with lymphovascular space invasion, 79% had an lymphovascular space invasion score >= 5. The score ranged from a minimum score of 1 to a maximum of 7. The score shows 78.9% sensitivity (95% CI 0.6971 to 0.8594), 65.3% specificity (95% CI 0.611 to 0.693), 29.4% positive predictive value (95% CI 0.241 to 0.353), and 94.4% negative predictive value (95% CI 0.916 to 0.964).ConclusionWe found that when lymphovascular space invasion score <= 4, there is a very low possibility of finding lymph nodal involvement. The preoperative lymphovascular space invasion score could complement the SLN algorithm to avoid unnecessary lymphadenectomies.

TI  - Influence of climate variations on primary production indicators and on the resilience of forest ecosystems in a future scenario of climate change: Application to sweet chestnut agroforestry systems in the Iberian Peninsula
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sweet chestnut agroforestry systems make valuable contributions to the landscape and environment, fulfilling fundamental functions and processes. Net primary production (NPP) and carbon use efficiency (CUE) are commonly used as ecological indicators to evaluate the responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle to climate change. Nonetheless, although climate-induced primary production changes have been widely documented at the global scale, few studies have addressed this issue at local scale in relation to sweet chestnut forests. Data from 65 climate maps and MODIS remote-sensed data captured in the Iberian Peninsula between 2000 and 2015 were analysed in this study. Different statistical methods (Linear Regression and Classification and Regression Trees) were used to analyse the potential influence of climate change on sweet chestnut primary production, thus enabling assessment of ecosystem and ecosystem service (ES) supply and of the resilience of these systems in a future scenario of climate change in the Iberian Peninsula. The findings for the whole of the Iberian Peninsula show that NPP and CUE are negatively correlated with temperature variables and positively correlated with latitude. High NPP values mainly corresponded to northern Spain, which is characterised by cold, humid conditions. The CUE values were highest in northern Portugal, mainly in managed, monospecific forest. Overall, the fitted models showed a temporary response in which the monthly variables were particularly important and water availability was more important than temperature. The findings suggest that precipitation is not a limiting factor in Atlantic areas, but that water availability tends to be a limiting factor in Mediterranean areas. However, mean annual temperature (MAT) is also an important driver of sweet chestnut production and may be a limiting factor in a future scenario of climate change. Regions of Provenance (RoP) proved useful for explaining NPP and CUE and classifying the sweet chestnut agroforestry systems. Finally, the study findings also revealed that Iberian sweet chestnut ecosystems and the associated ES supplies are at risk of being seriously affected or even disappearing as a result of climate change, especially in some Mediterranean areas of southern and central Spain.

TI  - Monitoring the Seasonal Hydrology of Alpine Wetlands in Response to Snow Cover Dynamics and Summer Climate: A Novel Approach with Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change in the European Alps during recent years has led to decreased snow cover duration as well as increases in the frequency and intensity of summer heat waves. The risk of drought for alpine wetlands and temporary pools, which rely on water from snowmelt and provide habitat for specialist plant and amphibian biodiversity, is largely unknown and understudied in this context. Here, we test and validate a novel application of Sentinel-2 imagery aimed at quantifying seasonal variation in water surface area in the context of 95 small (median surface area <100 m(2)) and shallow (median depth of 20 cm) alpine wetlands in the French Alps, using a linear spectral unmixing approach. For three study years (2016-2018), we used path-analysis to correlate mid-summer water surface area to annual metrics of snowpack (depth and duration) and spring and summer climate (temperature and precipitation). We further sought to evaluate potential biotic responses to drought for study years by monitoring the survival of common frog (Rana temporaria) tadpoles and wetland plant biomass production quantified using peak Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We found strong agreement between citizen science-based observations of water surface area and Sentinel-2 based estimates (R-2= 0.8-0.9). Mid-summer watershed snow cover duration and summer temperatures emerged as the most important factors regulating alpine wetland hydrology, while the effects of summer precipitation, and local and watershed snow melt-out timing were not significant. We found that a lack of summer snowfields in 2017 combined with a summer heat wave resulted in a significant decrease in mid-summer water surface area, and led to the drying up of certain wetlands as well as the observed mortality of tadpoles. We did not observe a negative effect of the 2017 summer on the biomass production of wetland vegetation, suggesting that wetlands that maintain soil moisture may act as favorable microhabitats for above treeline vegetation during dry years. Our work introduces a remote sensing-based protocol for monitoring the surface hydrology of alpine wetland habitats at the regional scale. Given that climate models predict continued reduction of snow cover in the Alps during the coming years, as well as particularly intense warming during the summer months, our conclusions underscore the vulnerability of alpine wetlands in the face of ongoing climate change.

TI  - An Interdisciplinary Approach to the Sustainable Management of Territorial Resources in Hodh el Chargui, Mauritania
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study proposes an analytical investigation of the natural resources and social framework of the Hodh el Chargui region (Mauritania), aiming to offer a useful instrument for planning and management to the local authorities. The situation of the region was evaluated by means of a participatory survey carried out among the local inhabitants. The obtained results include a collection of data about population, territorial organization, access to basic education and health services, infrastructure, main economic activities, and natural resources (in terms of water, both surface and groundwater, duration and intensity of rainfalls, soil types, and vegetal resources). The survey outcomes were completed with an integrated approach based on Earth Observation (EO) data supports, such as digital elevation models (DEMs) and Landsat8 imagery. The interdependence among the different data was evaluated and discussed, with regard to the influence of the availability of natural resources on the development of agricultural activities and on the general social welfare. The results are organized in the form of digital maps and a user-friendly webmap platform to facilitate access for all the technical and nontechnical actors involved in the project.

TI  - The post-9/11 American political thriller film: Hollywood's dissident screenplays
T2  - JOURNAL OF SCREENWRITING
M3  - Article
AB  - The American political thriller, from its cinematic beginnings in the 1960s until its most recent period of popularity in the late 2000s and the early 2010s, has consistently displayed two salient characteristics: on an extra-textual level, it tends to keep a close relationship with the (geo)political environment at the time of production, with themes that resonate with the cultural moment, sometimes even referencing current events, and frequently challenging traditionally upheld American values with mistrustful attitudes towards the State, its institutions, the military and a suspect corporate establishment. On the other hand, the textual configuration of these films reveals a certain nonconformity with the traditionally dominant narrative-aesthetic norms of Hollywood cinema, featuring reactive agency in its protagonists, an unusual degree of subjectivity in its narration and a remarkable degree of ambiguity in the dramatic resolutions of some storylines. These formal features enhance the thematic concerns and cinematic worldview of the political thriller genre, both creating and exploiting perplexity and paranoia in the audience, through highly demanding narratives that remove the feeling of control from the viewer, and with a specific political intent that becomes exceptionally effective thanks to its entertainment value. The works analysed to illustrate this trend covers theatrically released Hollywood films of the genre from 2001 until the present day, with special attention on the impact of 9/11 and the War on Terror in their narrative premises and themes.

TI  - Progress in Local Treatment of Breast Cancer: A Narrative Review
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GINECOLOGIA E OBSTETRICIA
M3  - Review
AB  - The present paper reports on the local treatment of breast cancer from a historical perspective. A search for articles written in English was made in the Medline and EMBASE databases, and 40 papers were selected. Over the past 10 years, various randomized, controlled clinical trials on the local treatment of breast cancer indicated that patients with the same molecular subtype may receive different individualized surgical treatments aimed at optimizing systemic adjuvant therapy. With a view to retaining the gains made in disease-free and overall survival, surgical techniques have advanced from radical surgery to conservative mastectomies, thus reducing sequelae, while adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies have contributed toward controlling the disease, both distant metastases and local recurrence. Current studies evaluate whether future breast cancer therapy may even succeed in eliminating surgery to the breast and axilla altogether.

TI  - Monitoring ocean biogeochemistry with autonomous platforms
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Traditional methods for ocean observation are often inadequate for detecting large-scale biogeochemical processes. This Perspective discusses the advantages of implementing autonomous observation platforms in complementing traditional observation methods and generating global biogeochemical data sets.Human activities have altered the state of the ocean, leading to warming, acidification and deoxygenation. These changes impact ocean biogeochemistry and influence ecosystem functions and ocean health. The long-term global effects of these changes are difficult to predict using current satellite sensing and traditional in situ observation techniques. Autonomous platforms equipped with biogeochemical sensors allow for the observation of marine biogeochemical processes and ecosystem dynamics, covering a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The international Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) project is currently building a global, multidisciplinary ocean-observing network of autonomous Argo floats equipped with an extensive range of biogeochemical sensors. Other autonomous platforms, such as gliders and surface vehicles, have also incorporated such sensors, mainly operating on regional scales and near the ocean surface. Autonomous mobile assets, along with remotely sensed data, will provide the 4D information required to improve model simulations and forecasts of ocean conditions and ecosystem health.

TI  - Assessing the Accuracy of Multiple Classification Algorithms for Crop Classification Using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The launch of Sentinel-2A and B satellites has boosted the development of many applications that could benefit from the fine resolution of the supplied information, both in time and in space. Crop classification is a necessary task for efficient land management. We evaluated the benefits of combining Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A information for irrigated crop classification. We also assessed the robustness and efficiency of 22 nonparametric classification algorithms for classifying irrigated crops in a semiarid region in the southeast of Spain. A parcel-based approach was proposed calculating the mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of each plot and the standard deviation to generate a calibration-testing set of data. More than 2000 visited plots for 12 different crops along the study site were utilized as ground truth. Ensemble classifiers were the most robust algorithms but not the most efficient because of their low prediction rate. Nearest neighbor methods and support vector machines have the best balance between robustness and efficiency as methods for classification. Although the F1 score is close to 90%, some misclassifications were found for spring crops (e.g., barley, wheat and peas). However, crops with quite similar cycles could be differentiated, such as purple garlic and white garlic, showing the powerfulness of the developed tool.

TI  - Axillary Nodal Evaluation in Breast Cancer: State of the Art
T2  - RADIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Axillary lymph node (LN) metastasis is the most important predictor of overall recurrence and survival in patients with breast cancer, and accurate assessment of axillary LN involvement is an essential component in staging breast cancer. Axillary management in patients with breast cancer has become much less invasive and individualized with the introduction of sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB). Emerging evidence indicates that axillary LN dissection may be avoided in selected patients with node-positive as well as node-negative cancer. Thus, assessment of nodal disease burden to guide multidisciplinary treatment decision making is now considered to be a critical role of axillary imaging and can be achieved with axillary US, MRI, and US-guided biopsy. For the node-positive patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, restaging of the axilla with US and MRI and targeted axillary dissection in addition to SLNB is highly recommended to minimize the false-negative rate of SLNB. Efforts continue to develop prediction models that incorporate imaging features to predict nodal disease burden and to select proper candidates for SLNB. As methods of axillary nodal evaluation evolve, breast radiologists and surgeons must work closely to maximize the potential role of imaging and to provide the most optimized treatment for patients.

TI  - Outcomes Comparison of the Veterans' Choice Program With the Veterans Affairs Health Care System for Hepatitis C Treatment.
T2  - Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been stressed by the large number of veterans requiring direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medications for hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. The Veterans Choice Program provides VA patients more options to receive treatment. This study compared the experience of veterans who received HCV treatment through the Veterans Choice Program and those that received treatment at the VA Loma Linda Healthcare System (VALLHCS) in fiscal year (FY) 2016.METHODS: A chart review was performed on all veterans referred by VALLHCS to Choice for HCV treatment during FY 2016, and matched to veterans who received treatment at VALLHCS. Data collected included Fibrosis-4 score (Fib-4), platelet count, days elapsed between time of referral and time of appointment (wait time), rate of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12), reason for treatment failure, and cost effectiveness.RESULTS: One hundred veterans were referred to Choice; 71 were seen at least once by a Choice provider, and 61 completed a treatment course. Mean Fib-4 and platelet count was 1.9 and 228,000 for the Choice population and 3.4 and 158,000 for the VALLHCS population, respectively. There was no difference in SVR12 rate. Mean wait time was 42 days for Choice vs 29 days for VALLHCS (P < .001). Choice health care providers incurred a mean $8,561.40 in additional costs per veteran seen.CONCLUSIONS: While treatment success rates were similar between Choice and VALLHCS, the degree of liver fibrosis was more advanced in the VALLHCS population. The wait time for care was longer with Choice compared with a direct referral within the VA. While Choice offers a potential solution to providing care for veterans, the current program has unique problems that must be considered.

TI  - Effects of Different Urbanization Levels on Land Surface Temperature Change: Taking Tokyo and Shanghai for Example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of different urbanization levels on land surface temperature (LST) has attracted extensive attention. Though both are world megacities, Shanghai and Tokyo have gone through different urbanization processes that urban sprawl characterized by impervious surfaces was more notable in Shanghai than in Tokyo over the past years. Here, annual and seasonal mean LST in daytime (LSTday), in nighttime (LSTnight), and LSTdiff (annual and seasonal mean difference of LST in daytime and nighttime) were extracted from the MODIS LST product, MYD11A2 006, for 9 typical sites in Shanghai and Tokyo from 2003 to 2018, respectively. Then the effects of the urbanization levels were analyzed through Mann-Kendall statistics and Sen's slope estimator. The trends of change in LSTday and LSTdiff for most sites in Shanghai, an urbanizing region, rose. In addition, there was no obvious regularity when considering seasonal factors, which could be due to the increasing fragmentized landscapes and scattered water bodies produced by urbanization. By comparison, the change in LST in Tokyo, a post-urbanizing region, was regular, especially in the spring. In other seasons, there was no obvious trend in temperature change regardless of whether the land cover was impervious surface or mountain forest. On the whole, vegetation cover and water bodies can mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect in urban regions. For more scientific urban planning, further analysis about the effect of urbanization on LST should focus on the compound stress from climate change and urbanization.

TI  - An assessment of oil spill detection using Sentinel 1 SAR-C images
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of an oil spill is additionally essential to evaluate the potential spread and float from the source to the adjacent coastal terrains. In such manner, usage of Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) information for the recognition and checking of oil spills has gotten extensive consideration as of late, because of their wide zone inclusion, day-night and all-weather capabilities. The present examination studies an oil spill occurred in the Al Khafji region by applying Sentinel 1 SAR-C images. Al Khafji is on the borderline between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in the Persian Gulf and it is detected as an unbiased zone. Al Khafji region can possibly deliver in excess of 7472.403 m(3) barrels of oil for every day (m(3)/d). Approaches dependent on multi-sensor satellite images examination have been produced for distinguishing oil spills from referred to common leaks just as oil slick procedures. In this paper, one of these techniques is associated with Sentinel 1 images of a known region of natural oil leakage and of an ongoing oil slick incident in Al Khafji zone. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is perceived as the most significant remote sensing apparatus for the ocean and ocean waters oil slick examination, recording, documentation and propagation. Specifically, this paper examines oil spills recognition in the Persian Gulf surveyed by utilizing Sentinel-1 (SAR-C) imageries. Results demonstrated the significance of the VV polarization of the Sentinel-1 for recognizing oil-spills just as the diminished utility of the VH polarization in this sole circumstance.

AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to renewed ambitions of developing artificial general intelligence. Alongside this has been a resurgence in the development of virtual and augmented reality (V/AR) technologies, which are viewed as "disruptive" technologies and the computing platforms of the future. V/AR effectively bring the digital world of machines, robots, and artificial agents to our senses while entailing the transposition of human activity and presence into the digital world of artificial agents and machine forms of intelligence. The intersection of humans and machines in this shared space brings humans and machines into ontological continuity as informational entities in a totalizing informational environment, which subsumes both cyber and physical space in an artificially constructed virtual world. The reconstruction of mind (through AI) and world (through V/AR) thus has significant epistemological, ontological, and anthropological implications, which constitute the underlying features in the artificialization of mind and world.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an important viral zoonotic disease in Asia, especially in rural and suburban areas where rice cultivation and pig farming coexist. Pigs serve as a suitable sentinel model, the surveillance of which could predict a potential JE outbreak in human population in the immediate vicinity. However, existing diagnostics like ELISA and VNT require sophisticated laboratory facilities which are more often not available in field conditions. In the present study, we aimed at developing recombinant non-structural (NS1) protein-based dipsuck IgG ELISA as an on-site assay for sero-diagnosis of JE in swine. The assay was standardized by optimizing various parameters and the following conditions were found to be ideal including 1 mu g of rNS1 protein in carbonate buffer per strip of nitrocellulose membrane comb; bovine serum albumin as blocking agent at 4 degrees C overnight; serum dilution of 1:10 and conjugate dilution of 1:5000 in skimmed milk powder. Relative diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of dipstick IgG ELISA was 100% and 92.9%, respectively. The dipstick assay was validated in three laboratories as per OIE guidelines. The storage life of dipstick was up to 7 months at 4 degrees C. The assay is easy to perform and the results can be interpreted with visual observation that precludes the need for absorbance reading equipment. The standardized dipstick assay was found promising for screening swine serum samples in field conditions. Timely detection of JE virus in swine will aid in predicting the outbreak in humans and thus in taking suitable preventive and control measures.

TI  - Discriminant analysis for lodging severity classification in wheat using RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop lodging - the bending of crop stems from their upright position or the failure of root-soil anchorage systems - is a major yield-reducing factor in wheat and causes deterioration of grain quality. The severity of lodging can be measured by a lodging score (LS)- an index calculated from the crop angle of inclination (CAI) and crop lodged area (LA). LS is difficult and time consuming to measure manually meaning that information on lodging occurrence and severity is limited and sparse. Remote sensing-based estimates of LS can provide more timely, synoptic and reliable information on crop lodging across vast areas. This information could improve estimates of crop yield losses, inform insurance loss adjusters and influence management decisions for subsequent seasons.This research - conducted in the 600 ha wheat sown area in the Bonifiche Ferraresi farm, located in Jolanda di Savoia, Ferrara, Italy - evaluated the performance of RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 data to discriminate and classify lodging severity based on field measured LS. We measured temporal crop status characteristics related to lodging (e.g. lodged area, CAI, crop height) and collected relevant meteorological data (wind speed and rainfall) throughout May-June 2018. These field measurements were used to distinguish healthy (He) wheat from lodged wheat with different degrees of lodging severity (moderate, severe and very severe). We acquired multi-incidence angle (FQ8-27 degrees and FQ21-41 degrees) RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 (40 degrees) images and derived multiple metrics from them to discriminate and classify lodging severity. As a part of our data exploration, we performed a correlation analysis between the image-based metrics and LS. Next, a multi-temporal discriminant analysis approach, including a partial least squares (PLS-DA) method, was developed to classify lodging severities. We used the area under the curve-receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) and confusion matrices to evaluate the accuracy of the PLS-DA classification models.Results show that (1) volume scattering components were highly correlated with LS at low incidence angles while double and surface scattering was more prevalent at high incidence angles; (2) lodging severity was best classified using low incidence angle R-FQ8 data (overall accuracy 72%) and (3) the Sentinel-1 data-based classification model was able to correctly identify 60% of the lodging severity cases in the study site. The results from this first study on classifying lodging severity using satellite-based SAR platforms suggests that SAR-based metrics can capture a substantial proportion of the observed variation in lodging severity, which is important in the context of operational crop lodging assessment in particular, and sustainable agriculture in general.

TI  - Reduction of global warming potential vis-a-vis greenhouse gases through traditional agroforestry systems in Rajasthan, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree-based systems in arid region of India are an integral part of livelihood and environment security. Traditionally, the maintenance of scattered trees on farm to reap several tangible and intangible benefits is a way of life. Presently, these systems are often known as low-hanging fruit and become a key weapon to fight climate change evil by offsetting greenhouse gas (GHG) emission through carbon sequestration. Therefore, to quantify the offsetting potential of GHG emission and area occupied by these tree-based systems in Rajasthan was undertaken. The study was carried out into two major aspects: estimation of agroforestry area using satellite remote sensing data, and to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of existing agroforestry by using dynamic CO2FIXv3.1 model for a simulation period of 30-years in five districts (20% sampling), namely, Bikaner, Dausa, Jhunjhunu, Pali and Sikar from Rajasthan, India. The estimated area under agroforestry in Rajasthan was 1.49 million ha. The findings revealed that the major tree species existing on farmer's field were Prosopis cineraria, Tecomella undulata, Capparis decidua, Acacia tortilis, Prosopis juliflora, Azadirachta indica and Ziziphus mauritiana with an observed number of trees in selected districts varied from 1.40 to 14.90 ha(-1)(with average tree density of 9.71 ha(-1)). The total biomass (tree + Crop) varied from 2.22 to 19.19 Mg ha(-1), whereas the total biomass carbon ranged from 1.00 to 8.64 Mg C ha(-1). The soil organic carbon ranged from 4.51 to 16.50 Mg C ha(-1). The average estimated carbon sequestration and mitigation potential of the agroforestry were 0.26 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)and 0.95 Mg CO2 eq ha(-1) year(-1) on farmers' field of Rajasthan. At the state level, the reduction of GHG emission potential of agroforestry was found to be 1.42 million tonnes annually, which helps to cut carbon footprint and achieve targets of Paris agreement.

TI  - A review of remote sensing applications for water security: Quantity, quality, and extremes
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Water resources are critical to the sustainability of life on Earth. With a growing population and climate change, it is imperative to assess the security of these resources. Over the past five decades, satellite remote sensing has become indispensable in understanding the Earth and atmospheric processes. Satellite sensors have the capability of providing data at global scales, which is economical compared to the ground or airborne sensor acquisitions. The science community made significant advances over recent years with the help of satellite remote sensing. In view of these efforts, the current review aims to present a comprehensive review of the role of remote sensing in assessing water security. This review highlights the role of remote sensing applications to assess water quality, quantity, and hydroclimatic extreme events that play an important role in improving water security. Four water quality parameters, namely, chlorophyll-a, turbidity and Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Secchi Disk Depth (SDD), and Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), are considered. Under water quantity assessment, we review three aspects, streamflow estimation, terrestrial water storage, and reservoir operations. Remote sensing applications in quantifying floods and droughts extremes are reviewed in this work. We present how satellite sensor information acquired from different spectral bands, including optical, thermal, and microwave ranges, along with gravity field measurements, have contributed towards the applications in the above areas. We also assess the role of physical models, empirical models, and data assimilation strategies, among others, in the above areas. Finally, possible future research pathways needed to address the issues faced by the science community are discussed. This work is the second of the two-part review series, wherein the first part deals with the applications of satellite remote sensing for agriculture management.

TI  - A novel method to extract urban human settlements by integrating remote sensing and mobile phone locations
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based human settlement extraction methods have limited practical applications, due to merely studying the difference between human settlements and other land cover/use types in physical attributes (e.g., spectral signature and land surface temperature) instead of considering basic anthropogenic attributes (e.g., human distribution and human activities). To deal with this challenge, we proposed a novel method to accurately extract human settlements by integrating mobile phone locating-request (MPL) data and remotely sensed data. In this study, human settlements for selected cities were mapped at a medium resolution (30 m) by redistributing the MPL data using Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) adjusted weights, with an overall accuracy of above 90.0%. Additionally, by extending the proposed method to the MPL and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, a coarse-resolution (250 m) map of human settlements in China was created with an overall accuracy of 95.2%. Compared with the widely used nighttime light based methods, the proposed method could solve the long-existing problems such as data saturation and blooming effects, as well as characterizing human settlements with fine spatial details. Our study provides an alternative approach to human settlement extraction by combining its physical and anthropogenic attributes, and it can be easily adjusted with multi-scale remotely sensed data and applied to human settlement extraction at different scales.

TI  - Application of Landsat Time-Series Data in Island Ecological Environment Monitoring: A Case Study of Zhoushan Islands, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An ecological environment is a complex system fundamental to the sustainable development of societies and economies. Landsat series satellites are widely used for monitoring the changes in Earth's surface morphology. With long timeseries data, Landsat can provide new methods and technical support for eco-environmental monitoring. This study developed remote-sensing monitoring methods based on Landsat data to observe the changes in the ecological environment in the Zhoushan region, China. The regional environmental changes in vegetation, water, and other key ecological factors were analyzed using multitemporal remote-sensing data. This study shows the effectiveness of this method for the extraction of key eco-environmental factors such as vegetation and water body area and the evaluation of regional eco-environmental quality. This study also reveals ecological patterns in the Zhoushan region and provides data support for regional eco-environmental assessment and management.

TI  - Downscaling of Satellite Remote Sensing Soil Moisture Products Over the Tibetan Plateau Based on the Random Forest Algorithm: Preliminary Results
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an important index of soil drought, and it directly controls the energy balance and water cycle of the land surface. As an indicator and amplifier of global warming, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is becoming warmer and wetter. Because of its particular geographical environment, large-scale measurements of SM on the TP can only be achieved by satellite remote sensing. The resolution of current SM product of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite is 36 lcm, which is insufficient for many practical applications. In this study, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are applied to increase the resolution of SM down to 1 km using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The preliminary results of the proposed algorithm are evaluated by station observations and other reanalysis products. The downscaled results are more consistent with the in situ observations, the Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) from China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) than the original SMAP product. The downscaling algorithm is most effective for grasslands. It is demonstrated that high-resolution SM products can be generated by fusing various features using machine-learning algorithms.

TI  - A new method to improve the accuracy of remotely sensed data for wetland water balance estimates
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: Thirlmere Lakes National Park, New South Wales, AustraliaStudy focus: Uncertainties in water balance calculations can arise from errors associated with each of the budget input terms: precipitation, evapotranspiration, and inflows/outflows. However, uncertainties associated with the accuracy of the surface storage calculation have seldom been the focus of previous water balance studies. Digital elevation models (DEMs) used in water balance studies typically rely on bathymetric/topographic surveys, with remote-sensing techniques including satellite imaging processing, Light-Detection-and-Ranging (LiDAR), and unmanned-aerial-vehicle photogrammetry. This study investigates the vertical errors in bathymetric DEMs obtained from various remote-sensing techniques and its implication on water balance estimates in an intermittent wetland under drying conditions with vegetation encroachment.New hydrological insights: When bathymetry data obtained from different remote-sensing survey methods were adopted to calculate the water balance of a lake, variations in the model-predicted levels were attributed to the poor quality of photogrammetric DEMs. To improve the photogrammetric data, a new ground-filtering approach is developed, which reduces vertical errors induced by vegetation interference. The correlation (R-2) of the DEMs, as compared to ground-truthed elevations, was improved from 0.5 before ground filtering to 0.9 after ground filtering. Using the ground-filtered DEM in the water balance calculation, a 70 % improvement was achieved in the water balance residuals. As such, uncertainties in lake and wetland bathymetry should be assessed in future water balance studies.

TI  - Dynamics of Dalk Glacier in East Antarctica Derived from Multisource Satellite Observations Since 2000
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring variability in outlet glaciers can improve the understanding of feedbacks associated with calving, ocean thermal forcing, and climate change. In this study, we present a remote-sensing investigation of Dalk Glacier in East Antarctica to analyze its dynamic changes. Terminus positions and surface ice velocities were estimated from Landsat and Sentinel-1 data, and the high-precision Worldview digital elevation model (DEM) was generated to determine the location of the potential ice rumple. We detected the cyclic behavior of glacier terminus changes and similar periodic increases in surface velocity since 2000. The terminus retreated in 2006, 2009, 2010, and 2016 and advanced in other years. The surface velocity of Dalk Glacier has a 5-year cycle with interannual speed-ups in 2007, 2012, and 2017. Our observations show the relationship between velocity changes and terminus variations, as well as the driving role of the ice rumple. Ice velocity often increases after calving events and continuous retreats. The loss of buttressing provided by an ice rumple may be a primary factor for increases in ice velocity. Given the restriction of the ice rumple, the surface velocity remains relatively stable when the glacier advances. The calving events may be linked to the unstable terminus caused by the ice rumple.

TI  - A challenging therapeutic method for breast cancer: Non-lipolytic endoscopic axillary surgery through periareolar incisions
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgical treatment of breast cancer is becoming increasingly precise, less invasive, and more cosmetically pleasing. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) remain the standard treatment methods for breast cancer. However, these methods still require incisions in the breasts or axilla. Mastoscopic axillary lymph node dissection (MALND) surgery, although first reported several years ago, has not been widely used as it involves lipolysis. Non-lipolytic mastoscopy may be more appealing; however, the lack of a cavity in the breast and the abundant fat and glands make this procedure challenging. In addition, incision of the trocar in the axilla has been shown to have no advantage over traditional breast-conserving surgery. The present study describes 16 cases of non-lipolytic endoscopic axillary surgery without incisions in the axilla.

TI  - Characterizing marsh wetlands in the Great Lakes Basin with C-band InSAR observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is limited research focusing on Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) applications in the Great Lakes coastal wetlands with large water level fluctuations. In this study, we investigated the potential of using C-band SAR data to characterize marsh wetland and monitor water level changes along the coast of the Great Lakes. InSAR analysis was conducted using Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 data collected at Long Point, Ontario, Canada over the period of 2016-2018. Observations indicated that both backscattering coefficients and coherence from tall plants (e.g. cattail/Phragmites), short plants (e.g. grass), and water varied with different sensor modes (incidence angles and polarizations) in response to changes in phenology, disturbance, and water level. InSAR phase changes were closely related to fluctuations in water level and flow direction. We evaluated InSAR time series observations using measurements from water level loggers based on correlation and root mean square error (RMSE). It was found that correlation between InSAR measurements and water level changes in the field varied depending on the site, type of wetland vegetation, incidence angle and polarization. Although results from some sensor modes provided good correlation at a few locations, the low fringe rate and RMSE between 9 and 28 cm indicated that InSAR observations of water level changes were generally underestimated.

TI  - Earth Observation and Artificial Intelligence for Improving Safety to Navigation in Canada Low-Impact Shipping Corridors
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2014, through the World-Class Tanker Safety System (WCTSS) initiative, the Government of Canada launched the Northern Marine Transportation Corridors (NMTC) concept. The corridors were created as a strategic framework to guide Federal investments in marine transportation in the Arctic. With new government investment, under the Oceans Protection Plan (OPP), the corridors initiative, known as the Northern Low-Impact Shipping Corridors, will continue to be developed. Since 2016, the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) has been using the corridors as a key layer in a geographic information system (GIS) model known as the CHS Priority Planning Tool (CPPT). The CPPT helps CHS prioritize its survey and charting efforts in Canada's key traffic areas. Even with these latest efforts, important gaps in the surveys still need to be filled in order to cover the Canadian waterways. To help further develop the safety to navigation and improve survey mission planning, CHS has also been exploring new technologies within remote sensing. Under the Government Related Initiatives Program (GRIP) of the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), CHS has been investigating the potential use of Earth observation (EO) data to identify potential hazards to navigation that are not currently charted on CHS products. Through visual interpretation of satellite imagery, and automatic detection using artificial intelligence (AI), CHS identified several potential hazards to navigation that had previously gone uncharted. As a result, five notices to mariners (NTMs) were issued and the corresponding updates were applied to the charts. In this study, two AI approaches are explored using deep learning and machine learning techniques: the convolution neural network (CNN) and random forest (RF) classification. The study investigates the effectiveness of the two models in identifying shoals in Sentinel-2 and WorldView-2 satellite imagery. The results show that both CNN and RF models can detect shoals with accuracies ranging between 79 and 94% over two study sites; however, WorldView-2 images deliver results with higher accuracy and lower omission errors. The high processing times of using high-resolution imagery and training a deep learning model may not be necessary in order to quickly scan images for shoals; but training a CNN model with a large training set may lead to faster processing times without the need to train individual images.

TI  - 35 Years of Vegetation and Lake Dynamics in the Pechora Catchment, Russian European Arctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-latitude regions are a hot spot of global warming, but the scarce availability of observations often limits the investigation of climate change impacts over these regions. However, the utilization of satellite-based remote sensing data offers new possibilities for such investigations. In the present study, vegetation greening, vegetation moisture and lake distribution derived from medium-resolution satellite imagery were analyzed over the Pechora catchment for the last 35 years. Here, we considered the entire Pechora catchment and the Pechora Delta region, located in the northern part of European Russia, and we investigated the vegetation and lake dynamics over different permafrost zones and across the two major biomes, taiga, and tundra. We also evaluated climate data records from meteorological stations and re-analysis data to find relations between these dynamics and climatic behavior. Considering the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) in the summer, we found a general greening and moistening of the vegetation. While vegetation greenness follows the evolution of summer air temperature with a delay of one year, the vegetation moisture dynamics seems to better concur with annual total precipitation rather than summer precipitation, and also with annual snow water equivalent without lag. Both NDVI and NDMI show a much higher variability across discontinuous permafrost terrain compared to other types. Moreover, the analyses yielded an overall decrease in the area of permanent lakes and a noticeable increase in the area of seasonal lakes. While the first might be related to permafrost thawing, the latter seems to be connected to an increase of annual snow water equivalent. The general consistency between the indices of vegetation greenness and moisture based on satellite imagery and the climate data highlights the efficacy and reliability of combining Landsat satellite data, ERA-Interim reanalysis and meteorological data to monitor temporal dynamics of the land surface in Arctic areas.

TI  - A Study of CNN-based Super-Resolution Method for Remote Sensing Image
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Super-resolution is a technique used to reconstruct an image with low-resolution into that of high-resolution. Recently, deep-learning based super resolution has become the mainstream, and applications of these methods are widely used in the remote sensing field. In this paper, we propose a super-resolution method based on the deep back-projection network model to improve the satellite image resolution by the factor of four. In the process, we customized the loss function with the edge loss to result in a more detailed feature of the boundary of each object and to improve the stability of the model training using generative adversarial network based on Wasserstein distance loss. Also, we have applied the detail preserving image down-scaling method to enhance the naturalness of the training output. Finally, by including the modified-residual learning with a panchromatic feature in the final step of the training process. Our proposed method is able to reconstruct fine features and high frequency information. Comparing the results of our method with that of the others, we propose that the super-resolution method improves the sharpness and the clarity of WorldView-3 and KOMPSAT-2 images.

TI  - EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF LAND COVER CHANGES AND URBANIZATION ON LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE: A REMOTE SENSING STUDY OF SUB-WATERSHED OF OUED FEKAN, NORTHWEST ALGERIA
T2  - SIGMA JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND NATURAL SCIENCES-SIGMA MUHENDISLIK VE FEN BILIMLERI DERGISI
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth is a worldwide phenomenon. The rate of urbanisation in developing countries such as Algeria is speedy. Sub-watershed of Oued Fekan is included in the large watershed of Macta which is located in northwestern Algeria and is one of the most important sites of this country characterized by an abundant amount of biodiversity as well as a highly productive ecosystem. The valuable landscape undergoes a radical change in the form of a sub-watershed recently due to anthropogenic change on land use and land cover. The exponential increase in population and human activities are increasing the demand for land and soil resources for agriculture, urban and industrial uses. Anthropogenic factors, especially urban sprawl, have a significant role in controlling the temperature change.In this paper, four Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS images of 2018 have been used from different seasons to estimate land surface temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in order to study the phenomenon of difference distribution temperature in urban with the surrounding rural areas. Analysis based on linear regression was used to generate relationships between LST with NDVI and NDBI. Our analysis indicates that for the four seasons, a strong linear relationship between NDBI and LST was marked compared with the relationship between NDVI and LST, which was less intense and varied by seasons. We suggest that NDBI is a visible indicator for studying surface Urban Heat Island phenomenon (UHI). Useful information that occurs as a consequence of land-use changes and urbanization are then provided for understanding the local climate and environmental changes of our study area.

TI  - Global Distribution of Column Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth to Surface PM<sub>2.5</sub>Relationships
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a combined Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) mid-visible aerosol optical depth (AOD) product at 0.1 x 0.1-degree spatial resolution and collocated surface PM2.5(particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m) monitors, we provide a global five-year (2015-2019) assessment of the spatial and seasonal AOD-PM(2.5)relationships of slope, intercepts, and correlation coefficients. Only data from ground monitors accessible through an open air-quality portal that are available to the worldwide community for air quality research and decision making are used in this study. These statistics that are reported 1 x 1-degree resolution are important since satellite AOD is often used in conjunction with spatially limited surface PM(2.5)monitors to estimate global distributions of surface particulate matter concentrations. Results indicate that more than 3000 ground monitors are now available for PM(2.5)studies. While there is a large spread in correlation coefficients between AOD and PM(2.5,)globally, averaged over all seasons, the correlation coefficient is 0.55 with a unit AOD producing 54 mu gm(-3)of PM2.5(Slope) with an intercept of 8 mu gm(-3). While the number of surface PM(2.5)measurements has increased by a factor of 10 over the last decade, a concerted effort is still needed to continue to increase these monitors in areas that have no surface monitors, especially in large population centers that will further leverage the strengths of satellite data.

TI  - The Use of Common Knowledge in Fuzzy Logic Approach for Vineyard Site Selection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A multitude of factors considered necessary for an informed choice of the location of the vineyard can be overwhelming for the decision-maker. Is there still a place for knowledge valuable from the perspective of an experienced winegrower in the era of precise measurements? The informative use of so-called common knowledge is possible owing to fuzzy-based techniques, which allow for the representation of intuitive notions in terms of quantitative measures. The work uses tools based on fuzzy logic to cover the scope of common knowledge within the decision-making process. Owing to its flexibility and ability to deal with imprecise input data while maintaining the simple construction, the fuzzy logic solution filled the gap between GIS data and wine grower's experience. Based on the data from the thematic literature, a set of rules was created to interpret the relationships between popular site selection criteria. The dynamics and manner of interaction between variables were determined using adequate membership functions. Pre-processing using GIS with remote sensing data was considered as a preliminary stage for the analysis. By using the graphical interface, the system operation facilitates the work of a potential user. The obtained results indicated the possibility of an alternative approach to classical analyses by replacing or extending the meaning of some variables using information based on feelings and perceptions. Research constitutes a premise for the further development of expert systems using widely understood domain knowledge.

TI  - MODIS-Based Remote Estimation of Absorption Coefficients of an Inland Turbid Lake in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical complexity and various properties of Case 2 waters make it essential to derive inherent optical properties (IOPs) through an appropriate method. Based on field measured data of Lake Chaohu between 2009 and 2018, the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) was modified for the particular scenario of that lake to derive absorption coefficients based on the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) bands. By changing the reference wavelength to longer ones and building a relationship between the value of spectral power for particle backscattering coefficient (Y), suspended particulate matter (SPM), and above-surface remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs), we improved the accuracy of the retrieval of total absorption coefficients. The absorption coefficients of gelbstoff and non-algal particulates (a(dg)) and absorption coefficients of phytoplankton (a(ph)) in Lake Chaohu were also derived by changing important parameters according to Lake Chaohu. The derived a(ph)tend to be bigger than measured a(ph)in this study, while derived a(dg)tend to be smaller than measured data. We also used the corrected MODIS surface reflectance product (MOD09/MYD09) to calculate the a(ph)(443), a(ph)(645), and a(ph)(678) by the model proposed in this study. It shows that in summer and autumn, a(ph)tended to be higher in the northwestern part of Lake Chaohu, and were relatively lower in the spring and winter, which is similar to previous studies. Overall, our study provides an algorithm that is effectively used in the case of Lake Chaohu and applicable to the data obtained by MODIS, which can be used for further study to investigate the change law of absorption coefficients in long time series by applying MODIS data.

TI  - From Occupation to War: <i>Cold War Legacies of US Army Historical Studies of the Occupation and Korean War</i>
T2  - KOREA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The History of the US Army Forces in Korea and the official history series of the Korean War were written in the context of the emerging Cold War with the Soviet Union and during the formation and establishment of the global Cold War, respectively. They served to diffuse a Cold War-centered worldview of vested interests at the American and global level. Meanwhile, Robinson's "Betrayal of a Nation" could not find a publisher for its severe criticism of American occupational policy and was passed on to later researchers in manuscript form. And I.F. Stone's The Hidden History of the Korean War (1952), which raised, "the theory that North Korea was provoked to attack South Korea" and denounced the US government's military conduct of the war, was removed from many libraries.As the understanding of the nature of the Cold War and its culture has deepened, the awareness is widespread that the efforts to resolve postcolonial issues failed due to the advent of the Cold War. It emerged in the process that world powers' dominance strategies violently deterred and sealed postcolonial challenges in the places concerned.As witnessed in the cases of Robinson and Stone, a divergent understanding of the epoch which countered the dominant one was repressed or rooted out by force in the US and around the 'free world.' The Cultural Cold War did not unravel in a way that different views and modes of understanding engaged in free competition; conversely, it had the characteristic of being deployed as one side excluded and suppressed the other unilaterally.

TI  - Medium-Resolution Multispectral Data from Sentinel-2 to Assess the Damage and the Recovery Time of Late Frost on Vineyards
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In a climate-change context, the advancement of phenological stages may endanger viticultural areas in the event of a late frost. This study evaluated the potential of satellite-based remote sensing to assess the damage and the recovery time after a late frost event in 2017 in northern Italian vineyards. Several vegetation indices (VIs) normalized on a two-year dataset (2018-2019) were compared over a frost-affected area (F) and a control area (NF) using unpaired two-sample t-test. Furthermore, the must quality data (total acidity, sugar content and pH) of F and NF were analyzed. The VIs most sensitive in the detection of frost damage were Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (CARI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Modified Triangular Vegetation Index 1 (MTVI1) (-5.26%, -16.59%, and -5.77% compared to NF, respectively). The spectral bands Near-Infrared (NIR) and Red Edge 7 were able to identify the frost damage (-16.55 and -16.67% compared to NF, respectively). Moreover, CARI, EVI, MTVI1, NIR, Red Edge 7, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Modified Simple Ratio (MSR) provided precise information on the full recovery time (+17.7%, +22.42%, +29.67%, +5.89%, +5.91%, +16.48%, and +8.73% compared to NF, respectively) approximately 40 days after the frost event. The must analysis showed that total acidity was higher (+5.98%), and pH was lower (-2.47%) in F compared to NF. These results suggest that medium-resolution multispectral data from Sentinel-2 constellation may represent a cost-effective tool for frost damage assessment and recovery management.

TI  - Drought monitoring in El Salvador through remotely sensed variables using the Google Earth Engine platform
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a phenomenon that causes great economic losses in the society and is being observed more frequently due to climate change. In Central America this event is related to the anomalous distribution of precipitation (P) in a short period, within the rainy season. Specifically, in El Salvador, the phenomenon so-called "canicule" is associated to a significant decrease in P that lasts few days, making difficult to monitor it with P alone, as it is currently done. At present, many indicators have been developed to characterize droughts. In particular, the standardized precipitation and the condition indices proposed by Kogan (1995) that use various sources of information, stand out. In this work, five indicators of water deficit were applied - the standardized P, evapotranspiration (ET), the soil moisture condition index (HSCI), the vegetation condition index (VCI) and water stress (EH)- to assess droughts in El Salvador. For this, satellite information, climate database and the application programming interface available on the Google Earth Engine platform were used. The behaviour of the indexes in the period 2015-2019 was analysed, particularly the extremely dry year 2015, to determine the monitoring capacity of the indicators used. The results obtained suggest that the proposed set of indicators allows monitoring the drought, by identifying the onset, impact and territorial extension of it in El Salvador.

TI  - Validation of a Novel Nomogram for Prediction of Local Relapse after Surgery for Invasive Breast Carcinoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Around 7% of women who undergo breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or mastectomy are at risk of developing ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). When assessing risks that, like that of IBTR, depend on multiple clinicopathological variables, nomograms are the predictive tools of choice. In this study, two independent nomograms were constructed to estimate the individualized risk of IBTR after breast surgery. Patients and Methods In this retrospective study, 18,717 consecutive patients with primary invasive breast cancer were enrolled. The training set used for building the nomograms comprised 15,124 patients (11,627 treated with BCS and 3497 with mastectomy), while the validation set included 3593 women (2565 BCS and 1028 mastectomy). Median follow-up time was 8 years in the training set and 6 years in the validation set. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent factors for IBTR. Two separated nomograms were constructed on multivariate models for BCS and mastectomy. Results The factors that associated with IBTR after either BCS or mastectomy were identified. The two multivariable models were used to build nomograms for the prediction of IBTR 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years after BCS or after mastectomy. Five-year and 10-year IBTR rates in the BCS training set were equal to 3.50% and 7.00%, respectively, and to 5.39% and 7.94% in the mastectomy training set. The nomograms were subsequently validated with c-index values of 0.77 and 0.69 in the BCS and mastectomy validation sets, respectively. Conclusions The nomograms presented in this study provide clinicians and patients with a valuable decision-making tool for choosing between different treatment options for invasive breast cancer.

TI  - Strategies in case of metastatic sentinel lymph node in breast cancer
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Management strategy of micro or macro metastatic sentinel lymph node(s) (SLNs) in breast cancer has dramatically changed over the past ten years and the publication of five randomized trials results: ACOSOG Z0011, IBCSG 23- 01, and AATRM comparing axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) versus SLNs biopsy alone; and AMAROS and OTOASOR comparing ALND versus axillary radiotherapy. Despite methodological limitations of several of these trials, notably ACOSOG Z0011, the international recommendations (ASCO, NCCN) and the expert consensus of St Gallen do not recommend the performance of a complementary ALND in case of macro or micro metastatic SLN, if all ACOSOG Z0011 inclusion criteria are met. Moreover, in the context of a mastectomy, with one or two positive SLN and a wall irradiation indication, an axillary radiotherapy can be proposed as an alternative to ALND. Additionally, ALND is also indicated in extracapsular involvement or when three or more SLNs are metastatic. This change in strategy led to a significant decrease on the number of ALNDs performed and resulted on the abandon of SLNs extemporaneous examination. In France, there are no national recommendations on axillary management in the context of SLN involvement. Moreover, a multitude of different local guidelines, led to very heterogeneous practices in our country. The next evolution on axillary management strategy will be the implementation of a SLNs procedure after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for patients with lymph node involvement proven before NAC and for whom NAC has allowed axillary downstaging.

T2  - CUATERNARIO Y GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The absence of urban sustainability is a widespread deficit in urban agglomerations. In the present work we present a methodology to identify the impacts caused by urban expansion over time, taking as a study area the city of Salamanca and surroundings (Spain). A multi-temporal assessment of land cover changes is carried out using Landsat images and remote sensing, while sustainability criteria (ecological, agricultural, cultural and natural risks) are analysed by means of multi-criteria analysis (MCA) using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The results show an increase in the urbanized area of 593% in the period studied (1956-2018), with up to 15% of buildings identified in restricted areas. In 71% of the cases, urbanization caused the sealing of fertile agricultural soils (2,519 ha), of which almost 20% were of the highest quality. A disproportionate increase in the urbanized area was identified in comparison to the population dynamics in recent years, causing an excessive sealing of soils that has repercussions on food production.

TI  - The Evolution of Wide-Area DInSAR: From Regional and National Services to the European Ground Motion Service
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This study is focused on wide-area deformation monitoring initiatives based on the differential interferometric SAR technique (DInSAR). In particular, it addresses the use of advanced DInSAR (A-DInSAR) techniques, which are based on large sets of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Copernicus Sentinel-1 images. Such techniques have undergone a dramatic development in the last twenty years: they are now capable to process big sets of SAR images and can be exploited to realize a wide-area A-DInSAR monitoring. The study describes several initiatives to establish wide-area ground motion services (GMS), both at county- and region-level. In the second part of the study, some of the key technical aspects related to wide-area A-DInSAR monitoring are discussed. Finally, the last part of the study is devoted to the European ground motion service (EGMS), which is part of the Copernicus land monitoring service. It represents the most important wide-area A-DInSAR deformation monitoring system ever developed. The study describes its main characteristics and its main products. The end of the production of the first EGMS baseline product is foreseen for the last quarter of 2021.

TI  - Local habitat measures derived from aerial pictures are not strong predictors of amphibian occurrence or abundance
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Species monitoring plays an important role in determining whether conservation targets are being met. However, monitoring programs can be costly and logistically demanding. When site characteristics are strongly linked to species' status, managers may instead choose to monitor the site characteristics themselves as a surrogate of species status. In this study, we modelled the occupancy status and abundance of pond-breeding amphibians in a network of protected areas across Switzerland. We incorporated remotely-sensed data describing habitat within breeding sites in order to identify any characteristics which could act as monitoring surrogates for amphibian species' status. We found that connectivity between amphibian breeding sites was an important predictor of occupancy patterns for all species, but that abundance patterns were poorly predicted. Despite expectations that the habitat characteristics assessed from aerial images were important for the species studied, we found that these variables were rarely strong predictors of occupancy patterns. These results highlight the importance of caution in identifying species monitoring surrogates, and the need to explicitly demonstrate strong relationships between surrogates and state variables of interest before surrogates are used.

TI  - Work-related adverse respiratory health outcomes at a machine manufacturing facility with a cluster of bronchiolitis, alveolar ductitis and emphysema (BADE)
T2  - OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesFour machine manufacturing facility workers had a novel occupational lung disease of uncertain aetiology characterised by lymphocytic bronchiolitis, alveolar ductitis and emphysema (BADE). We aimed to evaluate current workers' respiratory health in relation to job category and relative exposure to endotoxin, which is aerosolised from in-use metalworking fluid.MethodsWe offered a questionnaire and spirometry at baseline and 3.5 year follow-up. Endotoxin exposures were quantified for 16 production and non-production job groups. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) decline >= 10% was considered excessive. We examined SMRs compared with US adults, adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for health outcomes by endotoxin exposure tertiles and predictors of excessive FEV1 decline.ResultsAmong 388 (89%) baseline participants, SMRs were elevated for wheeze (2.5 (95% CI 2.1 to 3.0)), but not obstruction (0.5 (95% CI 0.3 to 1.1)). Mean endotoxin exposures (range: 0.09-28.4 EU/m(3)) were highest for machine shop jobs. Higher exposure was associated with exertional dyspnea (aPR=2.8 (95% CI 1.4 to 5.7)), but not lung function. Of 250 (64%) follow-up participants, 11 (4%) had excessive FEV1 decline (range: 403-2074 mL); 10 worked in production. Wheeze (aPR=3.6 (95% CI 1.1 to 12.1)) and medium (1.3-7.5 EU/m(3)) endotoxin exposure (aPR=10.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 83.1)) at baseline were associated with excessive decline. One production worker with excessive decline had BADE on subsequent lung biopsy.ConclusionsLung function loss and BADE were associated with production work. Relationships with relative endotoxin exposure indicate work-related adverse respiratory health outcomes beyond the sentinel disease cluster, including an incident BADE case. Until causative factors and effective preventive strategies for BADE are determined, exposure minimisation and medical surveillance of affected workforces are recommended.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing for the Analysis of the Micia and Germisara Archaeological Sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The capabilities of satellite remote sensing technologies and their derived data for the analysis of archaeological sites have been demonstrated in a large variety of studies over the last decades. Likewise, the Earth Observation (EO) data contribute to the disaster management process through the provision of updated information for areas under investigation. In addition, long term studies may be performed for the in-depth analysis of the disaster-prone areas using archive satellite imagery and other cartographic materials. Hence, satellite remote sensing represents an essential tool for the study of hazards in cultural heritage sites and landscapes. Depending on the size of the archaeological sites and considering the fact that some parts of the site might be covered, the main concern regards the suitability of satellite data in terms of spatial and spectral resolution. Using a multi-temporal Sentinel-2 dataset between 2016 and 2019, the present study focuses on the hazard risk identification for the Micia and Germisara archaeological sites in Romania as they are endangered by industrialisation and major infrastructure works and soil erosion, respectively. Furthermore, the study includes a performance assessment of remote sensing vegetation indices for the detection of buried structures. The results clearly indicate that Sentinel-2 imagery proved to be fundamental in meeting the objectives of the study, particularly due to the extensive archaeological knowledge that was available for the cultural heritage sites. The main conclusion to be drawn is that satellite-derived products may be enhanced by integrating valuable archaeological context, especially when the resolution of satellite data is not ideally fitting the peculiarities (e.g., in terms of size, underground structures, type of coverage) of the investigated cultural heritage sites.

TI  - Spatiotemporal effects of wastewater ponds from a geoenvironmental perspective in the Kharga region, Egypt
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major geoenvironmental problems in the Kharga region arises from the haphazard exploitation of groundwater resources and sewage dumping, which have resulted in wastewater accumulation in the form of ponds. The impact of the spatial expansion of wastewater ponds in Kharga and the surrounding area has been so pervasive that ponds have become a source of environmental degradation. These ponds are distributed throughout the area, but the major lakes are located in the eastern and southeastern provinces. The water levels of these ponds are rising at a remarkable rate, especially in the winter, when there is no evaporation and rainfall can lead to overflows that flow towards cities, villages and farmlands. As a result of untreated sewage inflows, all the low surrounding spaces are at high risk of being influenced by these ponds. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the spatiotemporal threats posed by wastewater ponds and develop a conceptual model to estimate the geoenvironmental impacts on the surrounding areas. GIS and remote sensing were used to process all available geological, topographical, hydrogeological, hydrological, land use and environmental data. The pond expansion trend was estimated from Landsat time series from 1984 to 2018, and the results indicated that the wastewater bodies continuously increased and the land cover percentage decreased. The encroachment of wastewater ponds has resulted in extensive land cover disturbances in recent years, and land use change has affected nearly 2.5% of the region. The complexity of the problems associated with wastewater ponds in the Kharga district requires a comprehensive management plan that is effective in not only maintaining the stability of the ponds but also in improving the sociocultural and economic conditions around the ponds. Specifically, the wastewater drainage and accumulation system should be managed according to the surrounding functional context.

TI  - FDA's Unimproved Enforcement of Postmarketing Requirements and Commitments: Implications for Providers and Patients
T2  - RESEARCH IN SOCIAL & ADMINISTRATIVE PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The 2007 reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act empowered the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require and enforce postmarketing studies to monitor the safety of prescription drugs, an increasing number of which are approved under expedited development or review programs. However, compliance rates for postmarketing requirements are low, and the FDA has not exercised its enforcement authority, allowing the very safety concerns that prompted the expansion of its power to continue. Prior evaluations have found that the FDA lacks reliable, timely, and readily accessible data for tracking postmarket safety issues, and that it has failed to enforce the postmarket surveillance measures it requires of the pharmaceutical industry.Objective: This study provides an updated evaluation of FDA oversight of postmarketing requirements and commitments and assesses whether there have been improvements since 2010.Methods: This study utilized data from the FDA's annual Report on the Performance of Drug and Biologics Firms in Conducting Postmarketing Requirements and Commitments. It evaluated studies opened in FY 2011-2014 and tracked their status through the FDA's FY 2018 report (data as of September 30, 2018), thereby allowing the pharmaceutical industry 4-7 years to complete a given PMR/PMC.Descriptive statistics were calculated, and differences in the status of postmarketing requirements and postmarketing commitments between FYs 2011-2014 and FY 2009-2010 were evaluated.Results: During fiscal years 2011-2014, there was little difference in the FDA's oversight of postmarketing studies compared to fiscal years 2009-2010. While there were some year-to-year significant differences, the overall trend indicated no change.Conclusions: The FDA's oversight of postmarketing studies has not improved since 2010. This paper discusses implications for providers and patients who unduly assume the responsibility of postmarketing surveillance due to the lack of FDA oversight.

TI  - CONTEXT-DEPENDENT ACCURACY OF THE BG-COUNTER REMOTE MOSQUITO SURVEILLANCE DEVICE IN NORTH CAROLINA
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a clear need for improved vector surveillance approaches that are affordable, labor efficient, and safer than traditional methods. The BG-Counter (Biogents USA, Moorefield, WV) is a device for remotely monitoring mosquito activity in combination with the BG-Sentinel (Biogents USA), a widely used trap for the collection of host-seeking mosquitoes. The BG-Counter uses a wireless connection to provide real-time counts of mosquitoes captured by the BG-Sentinel, allowing users to remotely monitor mosquito populations. This study tested the effectiveness of the BG-Counter in 5 North Carolina counties. A total of 96 trap-days resulted in the collection of >45,000 individual mosquitoes representing 35 species. Aedes albopictus was the most common species collected in all counties, except for New Hanover County where Culex nigripalpus was the most common. The mean daily accuracy ranged from 80.1% (New Hanover County) to 9.4% (Jackson County). There was a significant linear relationship between the actual number of mosquitoes collected and the device counts at all sites except Jackson County, the site with the lowest relative mosquito abundance compared with nontarget organisms. A linear regression of daily BG-Counter accuracy and the daily proportion of mosquitoes to the total number of arthropods collected revealed a significant positive linear relationship, supporting the premise that the BG-Counter is less effective when the relative abundance of mosquitoes is low. Mosquito surveillance programs using the BG-Counter should recognize its context-dependent accuracy and routinely evaluate the accuracy of the device based on local conditions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal forecast with local temporal drift applied to weather patterns in Patagonia
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostatistics was developed to generate maps or 3D models interpolating observed values in space. The so-called spatiotemporal geostatistic applies the same principles to estimate observed values that have both spatial and temporal distribution. Moreover, time series analysis can decompose and extrapolate its main trends and seasonality, preparing data for geostatistical assumptions. Using this principle, this study aims to decompose the time series of a spatiotemporal dataset as external drifts and estimate its residuals by spatiotemporal kriging. Since each observation point is a time series, it is possible to decompose its trend and seasonality locally and map its parameters, preferable, by traditional geostatistics. Aftermath, it is possible to extrapolate the trend and seasonality at each pixel. This procedure can achieve great long-term forecasting maps even in regions with poor sampling due to its time series analysis. As well as, the geostatistics guarantee that the spatio-temporal correlation is maintained. This method is especially good for prediction in regions that the time series pattern depends on its location, which is a common problem in large areas and the problem is worsened in poorly sampled regions. This study presents a 10 years map forecast (2008-2017) comparison by spatiotemporal geostatistics, the first with original data, with ARIMA Models Panels, then with global decomposition, finally, with the local decomposition approach. The target variable is temperature captured by the 18 active weather stations in Patagonia between 1973 and 2007. To validate the results, they are compared to Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is an image product MOD11C3 derived from the MODIS sensor onboard on Terra/Aqua satellites. The proposed method can make long-term forecasts with low error, low smoothing effect and similar spatiotemporal statistics (mean and variance) of the stations and the LST product. Finally, its results are comparable with the ARIMA Models Panels with the advantage that it can generate maps with spatiotemporal correlation and better than the often-used methods (stkriging and global decomposition) to forecast large areas maps.

TI  - The potentiality of Sentinel-2 to assess the effect of fire events on Mediterranean mountain vegetation
T2  - Plant Sociology
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are currently one of the most important environmental problems, as they cause disturbance in ecosystems generating environmental, economic and social costs. The Sentinel-2 from Copernicus Program (Sentinel satellites) offers a great tool for post-fire monitoring. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-2 in a peculiar mountainous landscape by measuring and identifying the burned areas and monitor the short-term response of the vegetation in different 'burn severity' classes. A Sentinel-2 dataset was created, and pre-processing operations were performed. Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR) was calculated to identify 'burn scar' and discriminate the 'burn severity' classes. A two-year monitoring was carried out with areas identified based on different severity classes, using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the short-term vegetation dynamics of the burned habitats; habitats refer to Annex I of the European Directive 92/43/EEC. The study area is located in 'Campo Imperatore' within the Gran Sasso - Monti della "Aga National Park (central Italy). The first important result was the identification and quantification of the area affected by fire. The RBR allowed us to identify even the less damaged habitats with high accuracy. The survey highlighted the importance of these Open-source tools for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of fires and the short-term assessment of vegetation recovery dynamics. The information gathered by this type of monitoring can be used by decision-makers both for emergency management and for possible environmental restoration of the burned areas.

TI  - Remote sensing for mapping ecosystem services to support evaluation of ecological restoration interventions in an arid landscape
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Considerable efforts and resources are being invested in integrated conservation and restoration interventions in rural arid areas. Empirical research for quantifying ecosystem services - nature's benefits to people - is essential for evaluating the range of benefits of ecological restoration and to support its use in natural resource management. Satellite remote sensing (RS) can be used to monitor interventions, especially in large and remote areas. In this study we used field measurements, RS-based information from Sentinel-2 imagery together with soil and terrain data, to estimate ecosystem service supply and evaluate integrated ecological restoration interventions. We based our research on the arid, rural landscape of the Baviaanskloof Hartland Bawarea Conservancy, South Africa, where several integrated interventions have been implemented in areas where decades of small livestock farming has led to extensive land degradation. Interventions included i) long term livestock exclusion, ii) revegetating of degraded areas, iii) a combination of these two, and iv) essential oil production as alternatives to goat and sheep farming. We assessed six ecosystem services linked to the objectives of the interventions: erosion prevention, climate regulation, regulation of water flows, provision of forage, biomass for essential oil production, and the sense of place through presence of native species. We first estimated the ecosystem service supply based on field measurements. Secondly, we explored the relationships between ecosystem services quantities derived from the field measurements with 13 Sentinel-2 indices and four soil and terrain variables. We then selected the best fitting model for each ecosystem service. Finally, we compared the supply of ecosystem services between intervened and non-intervened sites. Results showed that models based on Sentinel-2 indices, combined with slope information, can estimate ecosystem services supply in the study area even when the levels of field-based ecosystem services supplies are low. The RS-based models can assess ecosystem services more accurately when their indicators mainly depend on green vegetation, such as for erosion prevention and provision of forage. The agricultural fields presented high variability between plots on the provision of ecosystem services. The use of Sentinel-2 vegetation indices and terrain data to quantify ecosystem services is a first step towards improving the monitoring and assessment of restoration interventions. Our results showed that in the study area, livestock exclusion lead to a consistent increase in most ecosystem services.

TI  - Recursive Feature Elimination and Random Forest Classification of Natura 2000 Grasslands in Lowland River Valleys of Poland Based on Airborne Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of hyperspectral (HS) and LiDAR acquisitions has a great potential to enhance mapping and monitoring practices of endangered grasslands habitats, beyond conventional botanical field surveys. In this study we assess the potentiality of recursive feature elimination (RFE) in combination with random forest (RF) classification in extracting the main HS and LiDAR features needed to map selected Natura 2000 grasslands along Polish lowland river valleys, in particular alluvial meadows 6440, lowland hay meadows 6510, and xeric and calcareous grasslands 6120. We developed an automated RFE-RF system capable to combine the potentials of both techniques and applied it to multiple acquisitions. Several LiDAR-based products and different spectral indices (SI) were computed and used as input in the system, with the aim of shedding light on the best-to-use features. Results showed a remarkable increase in classification accuracy when LiDAR and SI products are added to the HS dataset, strengthening in particular the importance of employing LiDAR in combination with HS. Using only the 24 optimal features selection generalized over the three study areas, strongly linked to the highly heterogeneous characteristics of the habitats and landscapes investigated, it was possible to achieve rather high classification results (K around 0.7-0.77 and habitats F1 accuracy around 0.8-0.85), indicating that the selected Natura 2000 meadows and dry grasslands habitats can be automatically mapped by airborne HS and LiDAR data. Similar approaches might be considered for future monitoring activities in the context of habitats protection and conservation.

TI  - Satellite observations of phytoplankton enrichments around seamounts in the South West Indian Ocean with a special focus on the Walters Shoal
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial anomalies associated with seamounts and islands have been detected in the South West Indian Ocean using a new surface chlorophyll-a based enrichment index (EI). Calculated from daily L3 4-km MODIS chl-a data from 2003 to 2018, the EI was used to quantify recurrent (seasonal) surface enrichment associated with these features. Most notable were the shallow Walters Shoal (18 m) and nearby deeper WS-2 seamount (480 m), both located on the southern Madagascar Ridge, which showed high EI values of 40% and 15% local enhancement. Tmmelin Island, east of Madagascar, exhibited more moderate values of 15% local increase. Other shallower seamounts including La Perouse (60 m) and MAD-Ridge (240 m) exhibited sporadic or no measurable surface maxima. Regions of strong mesoscale activity such as south of Madagascar where the South East Madagascar Current detaches from the continent also revealed high EI values. A marked seasonality of the EI was observed over the Walters Shoal, with higher values during the oligotrophic season than in the austral winter. The seasonal variability of the MLD in combination with the seamount bathymetry appears to induce the thermal and biological anomalies observed there, possibly favoured by the presence of a Taylor cap at the summit. Ship-collected in situ measurements showed the satellite observed enrichment to be associated with shallowing of the deep chlorophyll maximum, as well as a shift of phytoplankton groups towards diatoms and small flagellates. No net increase of integrated chl-a was measured but a potential doubling in primary productivity is expected. The EI developed in this study, designed to reveal sporadic, small localised chl-a maxima, is likely applicable to other areas in the ocean where there is local enrichments.

TI  - Remote sensing estimation of catchment-scale reservoir water impoundment in the upper Yellow River and implications for river discharge alteration
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The impoundment and regulation information of reservoirs is essential for water resource management and hydrological analysis. Along the upper reach of Yellow River in northern China, a large number of reservoirs have been built or are being built, while information about the distribution and impoundment of these reservoirs is rather limited. Here we compiled an inventory of reservoirs ( > 0.01 km(2)) in two catchments in the upper reach of the Yellow River and estimated the seasonal water storage variations of reservoirs associated with impoundment during 2000 and 2018, by using a suite of remote sensing observations. The inventory of 149 reservoirs in the study region consists of 102 existing reservoirs (built before 2000) retrieved from Google Earth high-resolution imagery or available publications and 47 new reservoirs (constructed during 2000-2018) which we detected by using time-series analysis of NDWI derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data. To estimate water storage changes of all reservoirs associated with impoundment, we combined representative inundation extents of reservoirs in each season of the year retrieved from sequential Landsat images on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and shoreline topography information derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM data. The results demonstrate significant seasonal variations (mostly impoundment in autumn/winter and release in spring/summer) as well as a rapid increasing trend of water storage held in reservoirs. Particularly in Catchment A - the headwater of the Yellow River, the total water storage increased by about 16 Gt from 2000 to 2018, about 25% percent of which is due to impoundment of newly constructed reservoirs. The remote sensing-based results were validated by long-term in-situ water level data of 2 reservoirs and construction information of 14 new reservoirs. Uncertainty analysis shows acceptable accuracy in monitoring storage changes on the annual scale, indicated by high confidence in area-volume curves for most reservoirs (102 reservoirs with R-2 of area-volume curve higher than 0.9), while uncertainty is unneglectable on the seasonal scale. In accordance with streamflow variation data from 2000 to 2016 provided by published literature, our estimation indicates that the water resource in the upper Yellow River has been more highly regulated by reservoir impoundment and the seasonal regulation exerts significant impact on catchment runoff process (averagely about 17% of annual discharge).

TI  - Developing Shopping and Dining Walking Indices Using POIs and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Walking is one of the most commonly promoted traveling methods and is garnering increasing attention. Many indices/scores have been developed by scholars to measure the walkability in a local community. However, most existing walking indices/scores involve urban planning-oriented, local service-oriented, regional accessibility-oriented, and physical activity-oriented walkability assessments. Since shopping and dining are two major leisure activities in our daily lives, more attention should be given to the shopping or dining-oriented walking environment. Therefore, we developed two additional walking indices that focus on shopping or dining. The point of interest (POI), vegetation coverage, water coverage, distance to bus/subway station, and land surface temperature were employed to construct walking indices based on 50-m street segments. Then, walking index values were categorized into seven recommendation levels. The field verification illustrates that the proposed walking indices can accurately represent the walking environment for shopping and dining. The results in this study could provide references for citizens seeking to engage in activities of shopping and dining with a good walking environment.

TI  - Data Reduction Using Statistical and Regression Approaches for Ice Velocity Derived by Landsat-8, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decade, the number of available satellite observations has increased significantly, allowing for far more frequent measurements of the glacier speed. Appropriate methods of post-processing need to be developed to efficiently deal with the large volumes of data generated and relatively large intrinsic errors associated with the measurements. Here, we process and combine together measurements of ice velocity of Russell Gletscher in Greenland from three satellites-Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8, creating a multi-year velocity database with high temporal and spatial resolution. We then investigate post-processing methodologies with the aim of generating corrected, ordered, and simplified time series. We tested rolling mean and median, cubic spline regression, and linear non-parametric local regression (LOWESS) smoothing algorithms to reduce data noise, evaluated the results against ground-based GPS in one location, and compared the results between two locations with different characteristics. We found that LOWESS provides the best solution for noisy measurements that are unevenly distributed in time. Using this methodology with these sensors, we can robustly derive time series with temporal resolution of 2-3 weeks and improve the accuracy on the ice velocity to about 10 m/yr, or a factor of three compared to the initial measurements. The presented methodology could be applied to the entire Greenland ice sheet with an aim of reconstructing comprehensive sub-seasonal ice flow dynamics and mass balance.

TI  - In-season crop classification using elements of the Kennaugh matrix derived from polarimetric RADARSAT-2 SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatio-temporal classification of crops is of prime importance for in-season crop monitoring. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data provides diverse physical information about crop morphology. In the present work, we propose a day-wise and a time-series approach for crop classification using full-polarimetric SAR data. In this context, the 4 x 4 real Kennaugh matrix representation of a full-polarimetric SAR data is utilized, which can provide valuable information about various morphological and dielectric attributes of a scatterer. The elements of the Kennaugh matrix are used as the parameters for the classification of crop types using the random forest and the extreme gradient boosting classifiers.The time-series approach uses data patterns throughout the whole growth period, while the day-wise approach analyzes the PolSAR data from each acquisition into a single data stack for training and validation. The main advantage of this approach is the possibility of generating an intermediate crop map, whenever a SAR acquisition is available for any particular day. Besides, the day-wise approach has the least climatic influence as compared to the time series approach. However, as time-series data retains the crop growth signature in the entire growth cycle, the classification accuracy is usually higher than the day-wise data.Within the Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) initiative, in situ measurements collected over the Canadian and Indian test sites and C-band full-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data are used for the training and validation of the classifiers. Besides, the sensitivity of the Kennaugh matrix elements to crop morphology is apparent in this study. The overall classification accuracies of 87.75% and 80.41% are achieved for the time-series data over the Indian and Canadian test sites, respectively. However, for the day-wise data, a similar to 6% decrease in the overall accuracy is observed for both the classifiers.

TI  - Accounting for Uncertainty and Reconstruction of Flooding Patterns Based on Multi-Satellite Imagery and Support Vector Machine Technique: A Case Study of Can Tho City, Vietnam
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most frequent natural perils affecting the world today is flooding, and over the years, flooding has caused a large loss of life and damage to property. Remote sensing technology and satellite imagery derived data are useful in mapping the inundated area, which is useful for flood risk management. In the current paper, commonly used satellite imagery from the public domain for flood inundated extent capturing are studied considering Can Tho City as a study area. The differences in the flood inundated areas from different satellite sensors and the possible reasons are explored. An effective and relatively advanced method to address the uncertainties-inundated area capture from different remote sensing sensors-was implemented while establishing the inundated area pattern between the years 2000 and 2018. This solution involves the usage of a machine learning technique, Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR) which further helps in filling the gaps whenever there is lack of data from a single satellite data source. This useful method could be extended to establish the inundated area patterns over the years in data-sparse regions and in areas where access is difficult. Furthermore, the method is economical, as freely available data are used for the purpose.

TI  - Modelling Crop Biomass from Synthetic Remote Sensing Time Series: Example for the DEMMIN Test Site, Germany
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compares the performance of the five widely used crop growth models (CGMs): World Food Studies (WOFOST), Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES)-Wheat, AquaCrop, cropping systems simulation model (CropSyst), and the semi-empiric light use efficiency approach (LUE) for the prediction of winter wheat biomass on the Durable Environmental Multidisciplinary Monitoring Information Network (DEMMIN) test site, Germany. The study focuses on the use of remote sensing (RS) data, acquired in 2015, in CGMs, as they offer spatial information on the actual conditions of the vegetation. Along with this, the study investigates the data fusion of Landsat (30 m) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (500 m) data using the spatial and temporal reflectance adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) fusion algorithm. These synthetic RS data offer a 30-m spatial and one-day temporal resolution. The dataset therefore provides the necessary information to run CGMs and it is possible to examine the fine-scale spatial and temporal changes in crop phenology for specific fields, or sub sections of them, and to monitor crop growth daily, considering the impact of daily climate variability. The analysis includes a detailed comparison of the simulated and measured crop biomass. The modelled crop biomass using synthetic RS data is compared to the model outputs using the original MODIS time series as well. On comparison with the MODIS product, the study finds the performance of CGMs more reliable, precise, and significant with synthetic time series. Using synthetic RS data, the models AquaCrop and LUE, in contrast to other models, simulate the winter wheat biomass best, with an output of high R-2 (>0.82), low RMSE (<600 g/m(2)) and significant p-value (<0.05) during the study period. However, inputting MODIS data makes the models underperform, with low R-2 (<0.68) and high RMSE (>600 g/m(2)). The study shows that the models requiring fewer input parameters (AquaCrop and LUE) to simulate crop biomass are highly applicable and precise. At the same time, they are easier to implement than models, which need more input parameters (WOFOST and CERES-Wheat).

TI  - Aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma and sentinel node biopsy: A case report and literature review
T2  - JPRAS OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinomas (ADPA) are malignant tumours of the sweat gland. Due to the high tendency to recur and metastasise, wide local resection of the lesion is recommended. However, there are a limited number of cases reporting the use of sentinel node biopsy in the management of ADPA, thus its effectiveness remains unclear. We present a case of ADPA of the right middle finger treated with digital amputation and sentinel node biopsy, and review the current literature focusing on the usefulness of sentinel node biopsy.

TI  - Is Radar Phase Information Useful for Sea Ice Detection in the Marginal Ice Zone?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With continuing sea ice reductions in the Arctic, dynamic physical and ecological processes have more active roles compared to the ice-locked, isolated Arctic Ocean of previous decades. To better understand these changes, observations of high-resolution sea ice conditions are needed. Remote sensing is a useful tool for observations in the harsh Arctic environment. For unsupervised ice detection, we demonstrate the promising value of radar phase difference from polarimetric radar measurements in this study, based on full polarimetric complex RADARSAT-2 SAR images in the marginal ice zone. It is demonstrated that the phase difference from co-polarized and cross-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images show promising capability for high resolution sea ice discrimination from open water. In particular, the phase difference shows superior potential for the detection of frazil ice compared to the traditional methodology based on the radar intensity ratio. The relationship between phase difference and radar incidence angle is also analyzed, as well as the potential influence of high sea state. The new methodology provides an additional tool for ice detection. In order to make the best use of this tool, directions for further studies are discussed for operational ice detection and possible ice classification.

TI  - Vegetation Phenology Influenced by Rapid Urbanization of The Yangtze Delta Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impacts of urbanization and climate change on ecosystems are widely studied, but these drivers of change are often difficult to isolate from each other and interactions are complicated. Ecosystem responses to each of these drivers are perhaps most clearly seen in phenology changes due to global climate change (warming climate) and urbanization (heat island effect). The phenology of vegetation can influence many important ecological processes, including primary production, evapotranspiration, and plant fitness. Therefore, evaluating the interacting effects of urbanization and climate change on vegetation phenology has the potential to provide information about the long-term impact of global change. Using remotely sensed time series of vegetation on the Yangtze River Delta in China, this study evaluated the impacts of rapid urbanization and climate change on vegetation phenology along an urban to rural gradient over time. Phenology markers were extracted annually from an 18-year time series by fitting the asymmetric Gaussian function model. Thermal remote sensing acquired at daytime and nighttime was used to explore the relationship between land surface temperature and vegetation phenology. On average, the spring phenology marker was 9.6 days earlier and the autumn marker was 6.63 days later in urban areas compared with rural areas. The spring phenology of urban areas advanced and the autumn phenology delayed over time. Across space and time, warmer spring daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures were related to earlier spring, while autumn daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures were related to later autumn phenology. These results suggest that urbanization, through surface warming, compounds the effect of climate change on vegetation phenology.

TI  - Semi-annual variations of chlorophyll concentration on the Eastern Tropical Pacific coast of Mexico
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An analysis of the main remotly sensed oceanographic variables was conducted to characterize the dominant drivers that modulate the spatial-temporal variability of coastal phytoplankton biomass in the northern limit of the Eastern Tropical Pacific. The phytoplankton biomass was analyzed using monthly average satellite chlorophyll (Chlo) concentration data from MODIS sensors for the period 2003-2017. Oceanographic conditions were analyzed by considering (i) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) high-resolution data from the GHRSST project, (ii) wind stress calculated with data from the zonal and meridional components of the CCMP product, (iii) climatological precipitation, and (iv) climatological river flow. Chlo time series and spatial variability were analyzed using Hovmoller diagrams and Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF), respectively. A strong semi-annual signal in Chlo concentration along the coast was observed: the first peak occurs in winter-spring (5.0 mg.m(-3)) and a second one in summer-autumn (6.5 mg.m(-3)). A high year-round average of Chlo concentration (3.0-15.0 mg.m(-3)) was maintained by a 10 km wide along-shore coast, with maximum values spatially associated with river mouths, of which Santiago river registered the highest Chlo values (20.0 mg.m(-3)). Surface oceanographic conditions showed a marked annual cycle with warmer conditions (30-31 degrees C) from July to October and colder ones (23-24 degrees C) from December to April; during the cold period, seasonal wind stress stimulated coastal upwelling. The EOF showed that 70% of Chlo concentration variability was controlled by the semi-annual pattern, which responded to coastal upwelling conditions during cold period, while rivers outflows influenced high Chlo concentration during the warm period. These results highlighted the importance for land-ocean interface to sustain coastal ecosystems' biological production and the major role of watersheds as sources of nutrients to maintain high biological production during warm periods in transitional tropical-subtropical zones.

TI  - Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Remote Sensing Image Change Detection Based on Temporal Prediction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional change detection (CD) methods operate in the simple image domain or hand-crafted features, which has less robustness to the inconsistencies (e.g., brightness and noise distribution, etc.) between bitemporal satellite images. Recently, deep learning techniques have reported compelling performance on robust feature learning. However, generating accurate semantic supervision that reveals real change information in satellite images still remains challenging, especially for manual annotation. To solve this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised representation learning method based on temporal prediction for remote sensing image CD. The main idea of our algorithm is to transform two satellite images into more consistent feature representations through a self-supervised mechanism without semantic supervision and any additional computations. Based on the transformed feature representations, a better difference image (DI) can be obtained, which reduces the propagated error of DI on the final detection result. In the self-supervised mechanism, the network is asked to identify different sample patches between two temporal images, namely, temporal prediction. By designing the network for the temporal prediction task to imitate the discriminator of generative adversarial networks, the distribution-aware feature representations are automatically captured and the result with powerful robustness can be acquired. Experimental results on real remote sensing data sets show the effectiveness and superiority of our method, improving the detection precision up to 0.94-35.49%.

TI  - Geosynchronous Spaceborne-Airborne Bistatic Moving Target Indication System: Performance Analysis and Configuration Design
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geosynchronous spaceborne-airborne bistatic synthetic aperture radar (GEO SA-BSAR), consisting of GEO transmitter and airborne receiver, has stable coverage for a long time and benefits moving target detection. However, the performance of GEO SA-BSAR moving target indication (MTI) system varies widely between bistatic configurations. The traditional configuration design for GEO SA-BSAR system only considers the imaging performance, which may cause the poor MTI performance. In this paper, we propose a bistatic configuration design method to jointly optimize the MTI and SAR imaging performance for GEO SA-BSAR MTI system. The relationship between the MTI performance and bistatic configuration parameters is derived analytically and analyzed based on the maximum output signal to clutter and noise ratio (SCNR) criterion. Then, the MTI performance and SAR imaging performance are jointly considered to model the configuration design problem as a multi-objective optimization problem under the constrained condition. Finally, the optimal configuration for GEO SA-BSAR MTI system is given.

TI  - System Definition, System Worldviews, and Systemness Characteristics
T2  - IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The definition and characteristics of system have eluded humans for a very long time, as different people refer to the concept of system in various ways. A set of surveys conducted by us revealed seven distinct worldviews on system. We describe the surveys, analyze their results, and comment on differences between the responses. Based on the outcomes, we offer a comprehensive definition of system that can be accepted by the various worldview holders as an arrangement of parts or elements that together exhibit behavior or meaning that the individual constituents do not. Further, we present a compiled list of systemness characteristics-features that different worldview holders expect any system to exhibit. Then we present and describe the different worldviews on system, compare them with previous system definitions, and map them to five system domains. We conclude that the various system worldviews offer useful perspectives for systems engineers, who should have the flexibility to accept the fact that different worldviews may be appropriate for different situations and be ready to adopt them as necessary.

TI  - Estimating spatio-temporal air temperature in London (UK) using machine learning and earth observation satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation generates greater population densities and an increase in anthropogenic heat generation. These factors elevate the urban-rural air temperature (T-a) difference, thus generating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. T-a is used in the fields of public health and epidemiology to quantify deaths attributable to heat in cities around the world: the presence of UHI can exacerbate exposure to high temperatures during summer periods, thereby increasing the risk of heat-related mortality. Measuring and monitoring the spatial patterns of T-a in urban contexts is challenging due to the lack of a good network of weather stations. This study aims to produce a parsimonious model to retrieve maximum T-a (T-max) at high spatio-temporal resolution using Earth Observation (EO) satellite data. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) it will produce daily estimations of T-max for London at 1 km(2) during the summertime between 2006 and 2017 using advanced statistical techniques and satellite-derived predictors, and (ii) it will investigate for the first time the predictive power of the gradient boosting algorithm to estimate T-max for an urban area. In this work, 6 regression models were calibrated with 6 satellite products, 3 geospatial features, and 29 meteorological stations. Stepwise linear regression was applied to create 9 groups of predictors, which were trained and tested on each regression method. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms to predict T-max: the gradient boosting model with a group of five predictors (land surface temperature, Julian day, normalised difference vegetation index, digital elevation model, solar zenith angle) was the regression model with the best performance (R-2 = 0.68, MAE = 1.60 degrees C, and RMSE = 2.03 degrees C). This methodological approach is capable of being replicated in other UK cities, benefiting national heat-related mortality assessments since the data (provided by NASA and the UK Met Office) and programming languages (Python) sources are free and open. This study provides a framework to produce a high spatio-temporal resolution of T-max, assisting public health researchers to improve the estimation of mortality attributable to high temperatures. In addition, the research contributes to practice and policy-making by enhancing the understanding of the locations where mortality rates may increase due to heat. Therefore, it enables a more informed decision-making process towards the prioritisation of actions to mitigate heat-related mortality amongst the vulnerable population.

TI  - Impact of sentinel lymph node frozen section evaluation to avoid combined treatment in early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe need for radical surgery followed by adjuvant chemoradiation may be reduced by abandoning radical surgery in patients in whom lymph node involvement is detected intra-operatively.ObjectivesTo analyze, in a retrospective cohort study, the efficacy of the algorithm using intra-operative pathological assessment of sentinel lymph nodes.MethodsA retrospective single-institution study was carried out, which analyzed data from all consecutive patients with cervical cancer who were referred for primary surgical treatment between May 2005 and December 2015. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) TNM stage T1a1 with lymphovascular space invasion, T1a2, T1b, T2a, and selected T2b with incipient parametrial invasion; (2) adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma; (3) no evidence of enlarged suspicious nodes or distant metastases on pre-operative imaging; (4) primary surgery with curative intent; (5) successful detection of sentinel lymph node, at least, unilaterally. All patients had at least one sentinel lymph node detected and submitted for frozen section evaluation. When sentinel lymph node involvement was detected intra-operatively, the cervical procedure was abandoned and the patient was referred for definitive chemoradiation. Radical surgery was completed in patients with intra-operative negative sentinel lymph nodes. The reliability of intra-operative sentinel lymph node assessment was evaluated by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio.ResultsThe study included a total of 309 patients. Sentinel lymph nodes were detected bilaterally in 86% of the patients. Lymph node positivity was detected intra-operatively in 18 (6%) patients in whom the cervical procedure was abandoned. Adjuvant radiotherapy after completed radical surgery was given to 29 (9%) patients, including 20 patients with macrometastases (8) or micrometastases (12) reported from the final histology, eight patients with positive parametria (all <= 3 mm), and one patient with a positive vaginal resection margin. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the intra-operative detection of lymph node positivity (macrometastases or micrometastases) was 47% (95% CI 31% to 64%), 100%, 100%, and 93% (95% CI 90% to 96%), respectively. A total of 18 (6%) patients were spared combined treatment owing to the intra-operative sentinel lymph node triage; 29 patients (9%) received combined treatment with both radical surgery and adjuvant radiotherapyConclusionsOf 47 patients with high-risk prognostic risk factors (lymph node, parametria, or surgical margin involvement), combined treatment was successfully avoided in 18 (38%). Despite an effort to triage the patients intra-operatively, 9% received a combination of cervical procedure and adjuvant chemoradiation, mostly owing to the low sensitivity of the frozen section in the detection of micrometastases and macrometastases.

T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are widely distributed in soils across all continents except Antarctica. Assessing the EPN community structure in an ecoregion can help reveal their biological control potential against important crop pests. Common methods for detecting EPNs in soil samples include baiting with sentinel insects, direct observation of extracted nematodes, or use of species-specific primer-probe combinations using qPCR. Less well studied is the use of high throughput sequencing (HTS), which has tremendous potential to characterize soil communities of EPNs and natural enemies of EPNs. Here, for the first time, we compared qPCR and HTS to characterize EPN food webs. The frequency and abundance of 10 EPN species and 13 organisms associated with EPNs from 50 orchard and natural area sites in two ecoregions of Portugal were evaluated using qPCR tools, and results were published in 2019. We applied an HTS approach to analyze frozen DNA samples from 36 sites in that study. Universal primers targeting ITS1 were used for nematode detection. All EPN species detected by qPCR were also detected by HTS. The EPN species and nearly all free-living nematodes detected by both processes were highly correlated (P < 0.01). Steinernema fehiae, the dominant EPN species, was detected by HTS in 55% more sites than by qPCR. HTS also detected more EPN species than did qPCR. Sample accuracy, measured by the fit of Taylor's Power Law to data from each method, was significantly better using HTS (r(2) = 0.95, P < 0.01) than qPCR (r(2) = 0.76, P < 0.01). The effect of biotic and abiotic variables on individual EPN species did not differ according to ANOVA and multiple regression analyses of both data sets while the drivers of EPN community structure did not differ when analyzing either data set with CCA. Our results combined with decreasing costs of metabarcoding, suggest that HTS may provide the most cost-effective and accurate means of assessing soil food webs of methods currently available.

TI  - Indicatory bacteria and chemical composition related to sulfur distribution in the river-lake systems
T2  - MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfate related water quality and trophic status are crucial to operation of water diversion. Though the sulfur geochemistry in the lake sediment have been well studied, the effective indicator of surrounding environment conditions related to sulfur in river-lake systems are still unknown. In this study, Dongping Lake (DPH), Weishan Lake (WSH), and Hanzhuang trunk canal (HZQ) were selected as the typical river-lake systems in the eastern of China. Different spatial variations in sedimentary sulfate, total sulfur, and elemental composition of sediments were investigated in these areas. The relatively high sulfate in surface water and sediments appeared in portions of WSH. The biodiversity of HZQ and WSH surface sediments was much higher than that of DPH. Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Thiobacillus were the dominant genera of the river-lake systems. Among the different genera in distribution, genera such as Malikia, Sulfurovum and Lysinibacillus were significantly negatively correlated with sulfur related environmental factors. While the genera such as Pseudomonas, Vogesella and Acinetobacter were significantly positively correlated with these factors. Compared with connectivity in the largest interaction network, bacteria such as Proteus, Acidobacter and Chlorobacteria were identified as indicatory taxa to infer sulfate related conditions in the river-lake systems.

TI  - Analyzing Urban Agriculture's Contribution to a Southern City's Resilience through Land Cover Mapping: The Case of Antananarivo, Capital of Madagascar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High urbanization rates in cities lead to rapid changes in land uses, particularly in southern cities where population growth is fast. Urban and peri-urban agricultural land is often seen as available space for the city to expand, but at the same time, agricultural land provides many benefits to cities pertaining to food, employment, and eco-services. In this context, there is an urgent need to provide spatial information to support planning in complex urban systems. The challenge is to integrate analysis of agriculture and urban land-cover classes, and of their spatial and functional patterns. This paper takes up this challenge in Antananarivo (Madagascar), where agricultural plots and homes are interlocked and very small. It innovates by using a methodology already tested in rural settings, but never applied to urban environments. The key step of the analysis is to produce landscape zoning based on multisource satellite data to identify agri-urban functional areas within the city, and to explore their relationships. Our results demonstrate that the proposed classification method is well suited for mapping agriculture and urban land cover (overall accuracy = 76.56% for the 20 classes of level 3) in such a complex setting. The systemic analysis of urban agriculture patterns and functions can help policymakers and urban planners to design and build resilient cities.

TI  - A bark beetle infestation predictive model based on satellite data in the frame of decision support system TANABBO
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus L. causes significant economic losses in managed coniferous forests in Central and Northern Europe. New infestations either occur in previously undisturbed forest stands (i.e., spot initiation) or depend on proximity to previous years' infestations (i.e., spot spreading). Early identification of newly infested trees over the forested landscape limits the effective control measures. Accurate forecasting of the spread of bark beetle infestation is crucial to plan efficient sanitation felling of infested trees and prevent further propagation of beetle-induced tree mortality. We created a predictive model of subsequent year spot initiation and spot spreading within the TANABBO decision support system. The algorithm combines open-access Landsat-based vegetation change time-series data, a digital terrain model, and forest stand characteristics. We validated predicted susceptibility to bark beetle attack (separately for spot initiation and spot spreading) against beetle infestations in managed forests in the Bohemian Forest in the Czech Republic (Central Europe) in yearly time steps from 2007 to 2010. The predictive models of susceptibility to bark beetle attack had a high degree of reliability (area under the ROC curve - AUC: 0.75-0.82). We conclude that spot initiation and spot spreading prediction modules included within the TANABBO model have the potential to help forest managers to plan sanitation felling in managed forests under pressure of bark beetle outbreak.

TI  - Domoic acid depuration by intertidal bivalves fed on toxin-producing Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries.
T2  - Toxicon: X
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Domoic acid (DA), a neurotoxin produced by certain species within the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia, has caused numerous persistent harvest closures for razor clam Siliqua patula along the outer coast of Washington State (USA) over the last three decades. In comparison, bivalve harvest closures for DA have only occurred three times in Washington's largest inland estuary, Puget Sound, which has a variety of bivalve species excluding razor clam. While differing bloom dynamics in the two locations are responsible for much of the disparity in shellfish harvest closures, species-specific differences in DA depuration may affect the duration of harvest closures in the two regions. Toxin-producing Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries were fed to four species of bivalves, followed by measurement of tissue DA content over time to estimate depuration rate. Experimental species include razor clam and three species of intertidal Puget Sound bivalves: soft-shell clam Mya arenaria, purple varnish clam Nuttallia obscurata and Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum. Using an exponential decay model, DA depuration rates were estimated as: 0.02·day-1 ±0.08 for razor clam, 0.10·day-1 ±0.07 for purple varnish clam, 0.37·day-1 ±0.03 for soft-shell clam, and 0.44·day-1 ±0.02 for Manila clam. Puget Sound species depurated DA between five and 22 times as fast as outer coast razor clam. Within Puget Sound species, slow DA depuration rates in purple varnish clam indicate that it may be a good sentinel organism for assessing beach-wide maximum DA concentrations in Puget Sound bivalves.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon Mapping from Remote Sensing: The Effect of Crop Residues
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the onset of agriculture, soils have lost their organic carbon to such an extent that the soil functions of many croplands are threatened. Hence, there is a strong demand for mapping and monitoring critical soil properties and in particular soil organic carbon (SOC). Pilot studies have demonstrated the potential for remote sensing techniques for SOC mapping in croplands. It has, however, been shown that the assessment of SOC may be hampered by the condition of the soil surface. While growing vegetation can be readily detected by means of the well-known Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the distinction between bare soil and crop residues is expressed in the shortwave infrared region (SWIR), which is only covered by two broad bands in Landsat or Sentinel-2 imagery. Here we tested the effect of thresholds for the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), on the performance of SOC prediction models for cropland soils. Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) hyperspectral images covering an area of 240 km(2)in the Belgian Loam Belt were used together with a local soil dataset. We used the partial least square regression (PLSR) model to estimate the SOC content based on 104 georeferenced calibration samples (NDVI < 0.26), firstly without setting a CAI threshold, and obtained a satisfactory result (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.49, Ratio of Performance to Deviation (RPD) = 1.4 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 2.13 g kgC(-1)for cross-validation). However, a cross comparison of the estimated SOC values to grid-based measurements of SOC content within three fields revealed a systematic overestimation for fields with high residue cover. We then tested different CAI thresholds in order to mask pixels with high residue cover. The best model was obtained for a CAI threshold of 0.75 (R-2= 0.59, RPD = 1.5 and RMSE = 1.75 g kgC(-1)for cross-validation). These results reveal that the purity of the pixels needs to be assessed aforehand in order to produce reliable SOC maps. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2) index based on the SWIR bands of the MSI Sentinel 2 sensor extracted from images collected nine days before the APEX flight campaign correlates well with the CAI index of the APEX imagery. However, the NBR2 index calculated from Sentinel 2 images under moist conditions is poorly correlated with residue cover. This can be explained by the sensitivity of the NBR2 index to both soil moisture and residues.

AB  - The paper studies seasonal and long-term variability of the number of positive and negative anomalies of total ozone (TO) for the whole globe, the Northern Hemisphere, Russia, and the latitude zone it belongs. Satellite data are used for the research. It is found that the long-term variability of TO is significantly higher than the seasonal one and is caused by the slowest tidal oscillation with a period of 18.6 years and by the parametric resonance with it. The analysis of the residuals of results of seasonal and long-term simulations for similarity to white noise demonstrates that other contributions to these values, if present, are significantly below the detection threshold for modern global monitoring tools.

TI  - Role of River Runoff and Sea Ice Brine Rejection in Controlling Stratification Throughout Winter in Southeast Hudson Bay
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hudson Bay system is undergoing climate-driven changes in sea ice and freshwater inflow and has seen an increase in winter river inflow since the 1960s due in part to flow regulation for hydropower production. Southeast Hudson Bay and adjacent James Bay are at the forefront of these changes, with more than 1-month shortening of the season of sea ice cover as defined using satellite data, increases in winter inflow from the regulated La Grande River complex, and changes in coastal ice and polynya behavior described by Belcher Islands' Inuit. In summer, there is a fresh coastal domain in southeast Hudson Bay fueled by river runoff and sea ice melt. To investigate winter oceanographic conditions and potential interactions between runoff and ice melt or brine in southeast Hudson Bay, we initiated the first winter study of the shallow waters surrounding the Belchers, collecting conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiles and conductivity-temperature (CT) time series using under-ice moorings, and collecting water samples and ice cores during four campaigns between January 2014 and March 2015. Tandem measurements of salinity and delta O-18 were made for the water and ice samples to discriminate between freshwater sources (river runoff and sea ice melt). We find that southeast Hudson Bay, and particularly the nearshore domain southeast of the Belchers, is distinguished in winter by the presence of river water and strong surface stratification, which runs counter to expectations for a system in which local freshwater remains frozen on land until spring freshet (May-June) and sea ice growth is adding brine to surface waters. The amount of river water around the Belcher Islands increased significantly from fall through to late winter according to delta O-18 records of ice. The accumulation of river water in surface waters during the winter is directly associated with an accumulation of brine, which considerably exceeds the capacity of local ice formation to produce brine. We therefore infer that brine is advected into the study area together with river water, and that interplay between these properties establishes and maintains the level of surface stratification throughout winter. With reference to a NEMO ocean model simulation of winter circulation in the study area, we propose a conceptual model in which winter river inflow into James Bay drives the northward transport of both river water and brine captured near the surface, with reductions in brine-driven deep convection in the area's flaw leads. While past changes in winter oceanographic conditions and sea ice cannot be reconstructed from the few available scientific data, the presence of significant runoff in winter in southeast Hudson Bay implies heightened sensitivity to delayed freeze-up under a warmer climate, which will have the effect of reducing brine early in the winter, also promoting increased stratification and river plume transport.

TI  - Developing the seismic fragility analysis with fuzzy random variables using Mouth Brooding Fish algorithm
T2  - APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work proposes a fuzzy-random fragility assessment framework for evaluating 2D reinforced concrete moment frame buildings in the presence of various sources of uncertainty, most notably aleatory and epistemic. Such uncertainties exert a powerful influence on the nonlinear behavior of structural systems and consequently affect the seismic response of these structures. For this reason, a number of effective techniques including Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) simulation, fuzzy set theory, and a well-known alpha-cut approach have been used to quantify the median of the collapse fragility curve as the fuzzy-random response. As a major step in the alpha-cut approach, metaheuristic evolutionary algorithms including modified genetic algorithm (MGA), and a novel global optimization algorithm inspired by Mouth Brooding Fish (MBF) in nature have been adopted to explore the maximum and minimum of such median in each membership degree, alpha. The results demonstrate that the merit of new MBF algorithm is its greater efficiency in specifying the alpha-cut boundaries compared with MGA. Herein, for the sake of more simplicity and efficiency, a new equation is proposed for the prediction of the median of collapse fragility curve of the case-study building, using the gene expression programming (GEP) methodology. This median is formulated in terms of several effective parameters such as steel modulus of elasticity E-s, steel yield stress f(y), and concrete strength f(c)', which regarded as the input fuzzy-random variables. The performance and validity of the GEP model are further tested using several criteria. The results indicate that analyzing the proposed GEP model in terms of fuzzy-random variables thru the MBF algorithm significantly improves efficiency and reduces computational time by 75%.

TI  - Detecting Land Subsidence Due to Groundwater Withdrawal in Aliabad Plain, Iran, Using ESA Sentinel-1 Satellite Data
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, ground subsidence in the Aliabad plain (central Iran) was investigated using differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry. The data used for this purpose were Sentinel 1 images acquired during the time range from 24/03/2015 to 8/09/2016. Four interferogram pairs with high coherence were selected to minimize temporal decorrelation. The final analysis was performed in an area where there is sufficient hydrological and geological information. The results revealed that subsidence is a continuous phenomenon in the study area. The vertical displacement rate during the investigated period was estimated to be 178 mm/year. It was also noticed that the subsidence rate in the western part of the plain was higher than in other parts. Moreover, the effects of groundwater level decline, alluvium thickness, and transmissivity on the subsidence level were investigated. Overall, this research provides a correlation between the amount and distribution of land subsidence and effective factors for accurate detection of this phenomenon.

TI  - Plague, pumas and potential zoonotic exposure in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We tested for plague (Yersinia pestis) in a puma population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) over 9 years, overlapping a case when a boy in the area became infected with plague. Antibodies to Y. pestis were detected in 8 of 17 (47%) pumas tested by complement-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the organism itself was detected in 4 of 11 (36%) pumas tested after necropsy. Neither puma sex nor age was significantly associated with Y. pestis exposure or mortality, although our sample size was small. The overall prevalence of exposure we recorded was similar to that found along the western slope of Colorado, which is adjacent to the Four Corners region, a known plague hotspot in the USA. This suggests that: (1) Y. pestis may be present at higher levels in the GYE than previously assumed; (2) plague is a significant source of mortality for local pumas (6.6% of sub-adult and adult mortality); and (3) pumas may be a useful sentinel for potential risk of plague exposure to humans throughout the West. We would also emphasize that hunters and others handling pumas in this region should be made aware of the possibility of exposure.

TI  - Satellite imaging of the 2015 <i>M</i>7.2 earthquake in the Central Pamir, Tajikistan, elucidates a sequence of shallow strike-slip ruptures of the Sarez-Karakul fault
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - On 7 December 2015, a shallow M-w 7.2 strike-slip earthquake struck the Murghab River Valley in the Central Pamirs of Tajikistan. Seismologically this event was similar to a large seismic event in 1911 whose causative fault has never been identified. We measure the displacement field of the 2015 event from satellite observations using Sentinel-1 radar interferometry, Landsat-8 optical pixel-tracking, and surface rupture mapping from high resolution SPOT-6/7 imagery to characterize the role this earthquake rupture plays in the accommodation of strain on its causative structure, the Sarez-Karakul fault. We present geomorphic mapping and interpretations o f other Quaternary-active reaches of this fault system, which highlight variable rupture history of the different sections. These sections appear to be separated by inherited bedrock structural boundaries. Significantly, the reaches of the fault northeast and southwest of the 2015 rupture exhibit the freshest morphology prior to 2015, indicative of a more recent rupture than elsewhere. Using new high resolution imagery we map fresh scarps at the northern and southern ends of the Sarez-Karakul fault which may represent this 1911 rupture. To test which of these reaches could have been the source of the elusive 1911 event, we compare synthetic seismograms from three plausible fault sources determined from geomorphology, with observed seismic traces from 1911 at early recording stations throughout Europe. We find that the best fitting fault source is in fact southwest of the 2015 rupture, meaning that we have a record of three distinct recent events on the Sarez-Karakul fault system-two of them instrumentally recorded. Our mapping of these separate events reveals a correlation between their boundaries and the active and inherited thrust and suture systems that intersect the northeast striking left-lateral fault, suggesting structural control over the extents of individual ruptures on the active strike-slip fault.

All Landsat images (1990, 2000, 2010, and 2018) were classified using a support vector machine (SVM) and spectral analysis mapper (SAM) classifiers. The result of validation metrics, including precision, recall, and F1, indicated that the SVM classier has a better performance than SAM. The obtained LULC maps have an overall accuracy of more than 90%. Each pair of enhanced LULC maps (1990-2000, 2000-2010, 2010-2018, and 1990-2018) were used as input data for an image difference algorithm to monitor LULC changes. Maps of change detection were then imported into a GIS environment and spatially correlated against the spatiotemporal maps of groundwater level and groundwater quality. The results also show that the approximate built-up area increased from 227.26 km(2) (1.39%) to 869.77 km(2) (7.41%), while vegetated areas (farmlands, parks and gardens) increased from about 76.70 km(2) (0.65%) to 290.70 km(2) (2.47%). The observed changes in LULC are highly linked to the depletion in groundwater level and quality across the study area from the Oman Mountains to the coastal areas.

TI  - Wetland Surface Water Detection from Multipath SAR Images Using Gaussian Process-Based Temporal Interpolation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands provide society with a myriad of ecosystem services, such as water storage, food sources, and flood control. The ecosystem services provided by a wetland are largely dependent on its hydrological dynamics. Constant monitoring of the spatial extent of water surfaces and the duration of flooding of a wetland is necessary to understand the impact of drought on the ecosystem services a wetland provides. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the potential to reveal wetland dynamics. Multitemporal SAR image analysis for wetland monitoring has been extensively studied based on the advances of modern SAR missions. Unfortunately, most previous studies utilized monopath SAR images, which result in limited success. Tracking changes in individual wetlands remains a challenging task because several environmental factors, such as wind-roughened water, degrade image quality. In general, the data acquisition frequency is an important factor in time series analysis. We propose a Gaussian process-based temporal interpolation (GPTI) method that enables the synergistic use of SAR images taken from multiple paths. The proposed model is applied to a series of Sentinel-1 images capturing wetlands in Okanogan County, Washington State. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the multiple path analysis based on the proposed method can extract seasonal changes more accurately than a single path analysis.

TI  - Mapping Land Cover and Tree Canopy Cover in Zagros Forests of Iran: Application of Sentinel-2, Google Earth, and Field Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zagros forests in Western Iran are valuable ecosystems that have been seriously damaged by human interference (harvesting the wood and forest sub-products, converting the forests to the agricultural lands, and grazing) and natural events (drought events and fire). In this study, we generated accurate land cover (LC), and tree canopy cover percentage (TCC%) maps for the forests of Shirvan County, a part of Zagros forests in Western Iran using Sentinel-2, Google Earth, and field data for protective management. First, we assessed the accuracy of Google Earth data using 300 random field plots in 10 different land cover types. For land cover mapping, we evaluated the performance of four supervised classification algorithms (minimum distance (MD), Mahalanobis distance (MaD), neural network (NN), and support vector machine (SVM)). The accuracy of the land cover maps was assessed using a set of 150 stratified random plots in Google Earth. We mapped the forest canopy cover by using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map, and field plots. We calculated the Pearson correlation between the NDVI values and the TCC% (obtained from field plots). The linear regression between the NDVI values and the TCC% was used to obtain the predictive model of TCC% based on the NDVI. The results showed that Google Earth data yielded an overall accuracy of 94.4%. The SVM algorithm had the highest accuracy for the classification of Sentinel-2 data with an overall accuracy of 81.33% and a kappa index of 0.76. The results of the forest canopy cover analysis showed a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.93 between the NDVI and TCC%, which is highly significant. The results also showed that the linear regression model is a good predictive model for TCC% estimation based on the NDVI (r(2)= 0.864). The results can be used as a baseline for decision-makers to monitor land cover change in the region, whether produced by human activities or natural events and to establish measures for protective management of forests.

TI  - The Impact of System Noise in Polarimetric SAR Imagery on Oil Spill Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of both system additive and multiplicative noise on the X-, C-, and L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data covering oil slicks are examined. Prior studies have attempted to characterize such oil slicks, primarily through analysis of polarimetric SAR data. In this article, we factor in system noise that is added to the backscattered signal, introducing artifacts that can easily be confused with random and volume scattering. This confusion occurs when additive and/or multiplicative system noise dominates the measured backscattered signal. Polarimetric features used in this article are shown to be affected by both additive and multiplicative system noise, some more than others. This article highlights the importance of considering specifically multiplicative noise in the estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR based on additive noise should at least be above 10 dB and the SNR involving both additive and multiplicative noise should at least be above 0 dB. The SNR from TerraSAR-X (TS-X) and Radarsat-2 (RS-2) is below 0 dB for the majority of the oil slick pixels when considering both the additive and multiplicative noise, rendering these data unsuitable for any analysis of the scattering properties and characterization. These results are in contrast to the reduced impact of noise on oil slicks detected by the L-band UAVSAR system. In particular, we find that there is no need to invoke exotic scattering mechanisms to explain the characteristics of the data. We also recommend a noise subtraction for any polarimetric scattering analysis.

AB  - In the light of the ongoing interest in the events of the Great Patriotic War, and everything connected with it, wartime prose is seen as an incredibly important layer for literary research. The article discusses the characteristic features of the works of the war years in the aspect of new trends in literary criticism. The paper proposes a new concept of analysis of fiction. The tragic events of the Great Patriotic War, its colossal impact on the public worldview alter the somewhat dogmatic nature of the socialist-realist method, introducing new themes, problems, conflicts, oppositions (of war / peaceful life, the enemy/defender of the Motherland, foreign land/ native land, life/death) into the semantic and visual-verbal structure of works of fiction. Simultaneously, with the development of various artistic techniques, socialist realism is experiencing, especially in wartime, a rapid division on the vertical scale of literary values. Gradually, such an internal element of the work as the local-temporal characteristics - the chronotope - comes to the forefront, the system-forming plan.

TI  - Integrated Application of Remote Sensing and GIS in Crop Information System-A Case Study on Aman Rice Production Forecasting Using MODIS-NDVI in Bangladesh
T2  - AGRIENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research work studies the integrated application of satellite Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) for the monitoring and forecasting of rice crop (Aman) production in Bangladesh. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images of Terra MODIS products MOD13A1 (h25v06 and h26v06) with 500 m spatial resolution, composed using Maximum Value Composite (MVC) techniques, were used to cover Bangladesh for the period of 2011-2017. Country scale NDVI (district-wise summation) was calculated pixel-by-pixel to draw a regression curve while using Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) estimations of Aman production for the months of September-November. The regression study of district-wise pixel-based summation of MODIS-NDVI and ground-based BBS-estimated Aman production shows a strong correlation (R-2 = 0.54-0.78); for the months of September and October, most of the regression coefficient indicates significant correlation due to maximum photosynthetic activities. Therefore, based on the highest regression coefficient value of September and October, Aman Crop Production (ACP) models were developed and the ACP Model-2 was exploited (from the derived set of coefficient values) to acquire year-wise rice production for all the years (2011-2017). The simulated ACP Model-2 demonstrates good agreement between the estimated and predicted yearly Aman rice production for the 2011-2017 time period with Mean Bias Error (MBE) = (-9435 to 23,156) M.Ton; Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 253-4426 M.Ton; Model Efficiency (ME) = (0.89-0.93); and, Correlation Coefficients = (0.72-0.94). Hence, the MODIS-NDVI-based regression model seems to be effective for Aman crop production forecasting in the context of food security issues in Bangladesh. The applied system is simple, rationally accurate, and fit for the generation of nationwide crop statistics.

TI  - Vitamin D and intestinal homeostasis: Barrier, microbiota, and immune modulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF STEROID BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Vitamin D plays a pivotal role in intestinal homeostasis. Vitamin D can impact the function of virtually every cell in the gut by binding to its intracellular receptor (VDR) and subsequently transcribing relevant genes. In the lumen, the mucus layer and the underlying epithelium serve to keep resident microbiota at bay. Vitamin D ensures an appropriate level of antimicrobial peptides in the mucus and maintains epithelial integrity by reinforcing intercellular junctions. Should bacteria penetrate the epithelial layer and enter the interstitium, immune sentinel cells (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells, and innate lymphoid cells) elicit inflammation and trigger the adaptive immune response by activating Thl/Th17 cells. Vitamin D/VDR signaling in these cells ensures clearance of the bacteria. Subsequently, vitamin D also quiets the adaptive immune system by suppressing the Thl/Th17 cells and favoring Treg cells. The importance of vitamin D/VDR signaling in intestinal homeostasis is evidenced by the development of a chronic inflammatory state (e.g. IBD) when this signaling system is disrupted.

TI  - Double-Step U-Net: A Deep Learning-Based Approach for the Estimation of Wildfire Damage Severity through Sentinel-2 Satellite Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire damage severity census is a crucial activity for estimating monetary losses and for planning a prompt restoration of the affected areas. It consists in assigning, after a wildfire, a numerical damage/severity level, between 0 and 4, to each sub-area of the hit area. While burned area identification has been automatized by means of machine learning algorithms, the wildfire damage severity census operation is usually still performed manually and requires a significant effort of domain experts through the analysis of imagery and, sometimes, on-site missions. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised learning approach for the automatic estimation of the damage/severity level of the hit areas after the wildfire extinction. Specifically, the proposed approach, leveraging on the combination of a classification algorithm and a regression one, predicts the damage/severity level of the sub-areas of the area under analysis by processing a single post-fire satellite acquisition. Our approach has been validated in five different European countries and on 21 wildfires. It has proved to be robust for the application in several geographical contexts presenting similar geological aspects.

TI  - Landscape as Symbolic Nature Contemplation of the Representative Role of Natural Elements in the Formation of the Landscape of Kamu Village
T2  - MANZAR-THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL OF LANDSCAPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape is a historical approach for experiencing and recognizing the world, and like cultural text and picture, it is capable of conveying the worldview of the people. Rural landscapes are known as both natural and cultural landscapes that represent the socialization of nature through the possession of a cultural and ethnic assembly. The landscape of Kamu village stems from the organization of the environment and natural components based on the shared beliefs, semantics, and values of the inhabitants. In this village, natural elements account for the communication and information tools that, in the form of cultural tenets, conduct concepts and definitions and exhibit the rural landscape as a single and figurative whole being with a transparent mechanism. This paper intends to examine the symbolic role of the environment and natural elements in the formation of the landscape of Kamu village and the ways in which this subject has been affected by the main semantics, dogmas, and definitions of residents, and stirs their' knowledge of the environment and how to regulate and manage it. The methodology in the present research is qualitative and ethnographic. With the scientific approach and analysis of the semantics of ethnic landscape and landscape understanding, a conceptual model of symbolic landscape perception is expressed, and the role of natural elements in shaping the landscape of Kamu village is illuminated. Data collection at the stage of explaining theoretical grounds is of the library type, and at the stage of the case study, it is of the field type. The representative nature of the rural landscape is seen in the environment to the landscape, the natural components to the cultural figures, and the interactors to the cultural group developments. Beyond their functional role in a representative way, natural details refer to a blend of values and beliefs that promote the audience's comprehension of the rural environment, beyond collecting information from the physical environment, to the symbolic understanding of the landscape in the landscape of Kamu village. This subject is developed in the environment's answer to the material and semantic needs of the inhabitants: Satisfying the material needs, such as livelihood and shelter, relying on the narrative role of the landscape, has exhibited the potential of the natural setting. Further, responding to semantic needs, including social and aesthetic needs, relying on the poetic regard of the landscape, conveys the naturalistic beliefs of the residents.

TI  - A systematic review of chyle leaks and their management following axillary surgery
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Chyle leaks following surgery to the axilla are seldom encountered with an incidence <0.7%. Management varies with no consensus in the literature. Injury to branching tributaries of the thoracic duct may require lengthy management at significant cost to patient and clinical team. This paper aims to provide an up-to-date review to support clinical management.Methods: The term 'chyle' was combined with 'breast' or 'axilla.' EMBASE, Medline and PubMed database searches were conducted. All papers published in English were included with no exclusion date limits.Results: 51 cases from 31 papers. All were female (mean age = 53.3yrs). 47/51 leaks were left-sided. 5/51 underwent sentinel node biopsy, 19/51 level II axillary node clearance (ANC), 23/51 level III ANC, 5/51 not specified. 59% (30/51) of leaks were identified within 2 postoperative days (mean = 3.3days). 96% initially managed conservatively: Drain = 38/51; low-fat diet = 34/51; compression bandaging = 20/51; Aspiration = 6/51. 40/51 (78%) were successfully managed conservatively, 11 patients returned to theater for secondary management. 7/11 recorded volumes >500mls/24 hrs before secondary surgery. Mean resolution time from initial surgery was 17.3days (range = 4-64 days). No statistically significant difference (p = 0.72) in time to resolution between conservatively and surgically managed patients.Conclusions: Chyle leaks are rarely seen following axillary surgery. Aberrant thoracic duct anatomy represents the likeliest aetiology. We advocate early recognition and tailored individual management. Conservative management with non-suction drainage, low-fat diet and axillary compression bandaging appear effective where output <500ml/24 hrs. Secondary surgical management should be considered in high chylous output (<500mls/24 hrs) patients unresponsive to conservative measures. We propose a management algorithm to aide clinicians.

TI  - Does sentinel lymph node identification has indication in digestive cancers?
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite being a standard of care in several cancers, sentinel lymph node (SLN) is not widespread in digestive cancers. European guidelines do not recommend its use for any digestive cancers. Particularity of the lymphatic vessel, intimately linked to blood vessel, may explain part of this phenomenon. Nevertheless, more indication could arise in the near future with the early diagnosis of tumor induced by cancer screening. Ruling out the lymphatic invasion could allow preserving the organ currently resected because of risk of lymph node positivity. This procedure is well studied in early gastric cancer in Korea and Japan. Several study have demonstrated that, a dual-tracer (isotopic and dye) allows to accurately identify the SLN. A randomized phase 3 trial is currently active in Korea to evaluate the oncological results of the procedure. Similar indication could arise for T1 tumor of the low-rectum, but currently available data are insufficient to recommend its use outside of a study. SLN may also be used to detect aberrant lymphatic drainage (rectum, ileum) but have been tested so far only in a few dozen of patients. Finally, SLN is disappointing in colon cancer, due to its low sensitivity and the absence of modification of the surgical procedure induced.

TI  - Habitat heterogeneity captured by 30-m resolution satellite image texture predicts bird richness across the United States
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Species loss is occurring globally at unprecedented rates, and effective conservation planning requires an understanding of landscape characteristics that determine biodiversity patterns. Habitat heterogeneity is an important determinant of species diversity, but is difficult to measure across large areas using field-based methods that are costly and logistically challenging. Satellite image texture analysis offers a cost-effective alternative for quantifying habitat heterogeneity across broad spatial scales. We tested the ability of texture measures derived from 30-m resolution Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data to capture habitat heterogeneity and predict bird species richness across the conterminous United States. We used Landsat 8 satellite imagery from 2013-2017 to derive a suite of texture measures characterizing vegetation heterogeneity. Individual texture measures explained up to 21% of the variance in bird richness patterns in North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data during the same time period. Texture measures were positively related to total breeding bird richness, but this relationship varied among forest, grassland, and shrubland habitat specialists. Multiple texture measures combined with mean EVI explained up to 41% of the variance in total bird richness, and models including EVI-based texture measures explained up to 10% more variance than those that included only EVI. Models that also incorporated topographic and land cover metrics further improved predictive performance, explaining up to 51% of the variance in total bird richness. A texture measure contributed predictive power and characterized landscape features that EVI and forest cover alone could not, even though the latter two were overall more important variables. Our results highlight the potential of texture measures for mapping habitat heterogeneity and species richness patterns across broad spatial extents, especially when used in conjunction with vegetation indices or land cover data. By generating 30-m resolution texture maps and modeling bird richness at a near-continental scale, we expand on previous applications of image texture measures for modeling biodiversity that were either limited in spatial extent or based on coarse-resolution imagery. Incorporating texture measures into broad-scale biodiversity models may advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying species richness patterns and improve predictions of species responses to rapid global change.

TI  - Near Real-Time Freeze Detection over Agricultural Plots Using Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Short-term freeze/thaw cycles, which mostly occur in the northern hemisphere across the majority of land surfaces, are reported to cause severe economic losses over broad areas of Europe and North America. Therefore, in order to assess the extent of frost damage in the agricultural sector, the objective of this study is to build an operational approach capable of detecting frozen plots at the plot scale in a near real-time scenario using Sentinel-1 (S1) data. C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data show high potential for the detection of freeze/thaw surface states due to the significant alterations to the dielectric properties of the soil, which are distinctly observable in the backscattered signal. In this study, we propose an approach that relies on change detection in the high-resolution Sentinel-1 C-band SAR backscattered coefficients, to determine surface states at the plot scale as either frozen or unfrozen. A threshold analysis is first performed in order to determine the best thresholds for three distinct land cover classes, and for each polarization mode (VH, and VV). S-1 SAR data are then used to detect a plot's surface state as either unfrozen, mild-to-moderately frozen or severely frozen. A temperature-based filter has also been applied at the end of the detection chain to eliminate false detections in the freezing detection algorithm due mainly to rainfall, irrigation, tillage, or signal noise. Our approach has been tested over two study sites in France, and the output results, using either VH or VV, compared qualitatively well with both in situ air temperature data and soil temperature data provided by ERA5-Land. Overall, our algorithm was able to detect all freezing episodes over the analyzed S-1 SAR time series, and with no false detections. Moreover, given the high-resolution aspect of S-1 SAR data, our algorithm is capable of mapping the local variation of freezing episodes at plot scale. This is in contrast with previous products that only offer coarser results across larger areas (low spatial resolution).

TI  - Study on Changes and Driving Forces of the Ecological Assets in Urban Areas in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River from 2000 to 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the quantitative evaluation model of ecological assets and economic evaluation method, this article selected downtown Chengdu as the research region, and studied changes of the ecological assets in urban areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River from 2000 to 2016 by using Landsat ETM and OLI remote sensing data from 2000 to 2016 and other auxiliary data. The results showed that the total amount of the ecological assets in downtown Chengdu from 2000 to 2016 demonstrated a continuous downward trend, from 14771.04x104 yuan in the year of 2000 to 9800.36x104 yuan in the year of 2016, with a decline of 33.65% and a coefficient of variation of 15.02%. There were three main characteristics of the changes of the ecological assets in downtown Chengdu, including temporal characteristics, component characteristics, and spatial characteristics. According to the circle analysis, the the spatial distribution of ecological assets presented a circle-shaped distribution characteristic, which decreased with the increase of the linear distance from the urban center. On the basis of the principal component analysis, population, urbanization level and GDP were the most important driving factors. This study is useful for providing a strong guarantee for the sustainable development of downtown Chengdu, as well as a scientific basis for the management of urban ecological assets in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

TI  - Validation of MODIS Aerosol Products with AERONET Measurements of Different Land Cover Types in Areas over Eastern Europe and China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 and 6.1 Dark Target, Deep Blue and Dark Target, and Deep Blue combined aerosol products with a spatial resolution of 10 km over Eastern Europe and China within the period 2001-2018. The data obtained for aerosol optical depth (AOD) was verified with 10 a stations located in various regions. Uncertainty and sample precision was assessed with the use of expected error (EE) over land (+/- (0.05+15%x AOD(AERONET)) and +/- (0.05+20%x AOD(AERONET))), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and relative mean bias (RMB). The results showed that Collection 6.1 Dark Target retrieval algorithm surpassed Collection 6, where 58.5-75% retrievals fell within the EE as compared with Collection 6 (36.9-69.8%), with values of RMSE=0.098-0.297 and MAE=0.087-0.24. In Collection 6.1, Deep Blue and Dark Target and Deep Blue combined retrieval algorithms operate better; the retrieval results have been improved as compared with Collection 6: the retrieval results improved from 49.2-70.8% and 53.4-73.6% to 52.3-76.3 and 70.6-87.7% with RMSE=0.101-0.17 and 0.101-0.258, and MAE=0.087-0.127 and 0.078-0.146, respectively. The best results were obtained over the stations in Eastern Europe, and the worst ones over the coastal regions. The results of assessment vary wildly depending on the changes of different types of surface, surface reflectivity, and aerosol models at all areas.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Urban Surface Ecological Index (RSUSEI): An Analytical Framework for Assessing the Surface Ecological Status in Urban Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Surface Ecological Status (USES) reflects the structure and function of an urban ecosystem. USES is influenced by the surface biophysical, biochemical, and biological properties. The assessment and modeling of USES is crucial for sustainability assessment in support of achieving sustainable development goals such as sustainable cities and communities. The objective of this study is to present a new analytical framework for assessing the USES. This analytical framework is centered on a new index, Remotely Sensed Urban Surface Ecological index (RSUSEI). In this study, RSUSEI is used to assess the USES of six selected cities in the U.S.A. To this end, Landsat 8 images, water vapor products, and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) land cover and imperviousness datasets are downloaded for use. Firstly, Land Surface Temperature (LST), Wetness, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI) are derived by remote sensing methods. Then, RSUSEI is developed by the combination of NDVI, NDSI, Wetness, LST, and Impervious Surface Cover (ISC) with Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Next, the spatial variations of USES across the cities are evaluated and compared. Finally, the association degree of each parameter in the USES modeling is investigated. Results show that the spatial variability of LST, ISC, NDVI, NDSI, and Wetness is heterogeneous within and between cities. The mean (standard deviation) value of RSUSEI for Minneapolis, Dallas, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle yielded 0.58 (0.16), 0.54 (0.17), 0.47 (0.19), 0.63 (0.21), 0.50 (0.17), and 0.44 (0.19), respectively. For all the cities, PC1 included more than 93% of the surface information, which is contributed by greenness, moisture, dryness, heat, and imperviousness. The highest and lowest mean values of RSUSEI are found in "Developed, High intensity" (0.76) and "Developed, Open Space" (0.35) lands, respectively. The mean correlation coefficient between RSUSEI and LST, ISC, NDVI, NDSI, and Wetness, is 0.47, 0.97, -0.31, 0.17, and -0.27, respectively. The statistical significance of these correlations is confirmed at 95% confidence level. These results suggest that the association degree of ISC in USES modeling is the highest, despite the differences in land cover and biophysical characteristics in the cities. RSUSEI could be very useful in modeling and comparing USES across cities with different geographical, climatic, environmental, and biophysical conditions and can also be used for assessing urban sustainability over space and time.

TI  - Surface anthropogenic heat islands in six megacities: An assessment based on a triple-source surface energy balance model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) is a main contributor to the formation of surface urban heat islands (SUHI). Megacities in particular are facing severe problems due to excessive population growth, urban area expansion, human activity, increased energy consumption, and increased anthropogenic heat. In this study, a physical modeling approach based on a triple-source surface energy balance (triple-SEB) model was developed to uncover the effect of AHF on land surface temperature (LST) and surface anthropogenic heat island (SAHI) intensity. For this purpose, satellite imagery along with climatic and meteorological data from 1985 to 2019 were studied for six selected megacities: Los Angeles, Atlanta, Athens, Istanbul, Tehran, and Beijing. First, LST and the fraction of different surface covers were calculated by using a single-channel algorithm and a normalized spectral mixture analysis model, respectively. In the second step, impervious surface cover (ISC) and the urban main boundary area (UMBA) of each city were extracted based on the biophysical composite index and city clustering algorithm, respectively. In the third step, anthropogenic LST (ALST) was modeled using a triple-SEB model. In the fourth step, the ALST and UMBA were used together to model SAHI intensity at different dates. Finally, the relationship between the estimated ALST and ISC, as well as between SAHI and ISC, was examined. Results show that the average value of estimated ALST for the megacities increased from 2.02, 0.55, 0.61, 0.64, 0.58, and 0.72 to 2.99, 1.73, 1.66, 1.19, 2.32, and 2.76 degrees C, respectively. The coefficient of determination between the mean value of ISC and the estimated ALST for all megacities yielded 0.8, which was higher than that between ISC and satellite-derived LST. Moreover, the SAHI intensity for these megacities was found to have increased to 0.73, 0.92, 0.95, 0.98, 0.95 and 1.32 degrees C, respectively, which can be predicted by ISC with a coefficient of determination of 0.78, 0.79, 0.79, 0.73, 0.71 and 0.52, respectively. This suggests that the triple-SEB model proposed by this study allowed for independent modeling of AHF's influence on SUHI and a better determination of the effect of ISC on LST and SUHI intensity. This approach facilitated comparative analysis of LST and SAHI for a city at different times as well as SAHIs in different cities with different geographic and climate settings.

TI  - A new approach for modeling near surface temperature lapse rate based on normalized land surface temperature data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The modeling of Near-Surface Temperature Lapse Rate (NSTLR) is of great importance in various environmental applications. This study proposed a new approach for modeling the NSTLR based on the Normalized Land Surface Temperature (NLST). A set of remote sensing imagery including Landsat images, MODIS products, and ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM), land cover maps, and climatic data recorded in meteorological stations and self-deployed devices located in the three study area were used for modeling and evaluation of NSTLR. First, the Split Window (SW) and Single Channel (SC) algorithms were used to estimate LST, and the spectral indices were used to model surface biophysical characteristics. The solar local incident angle was obtained based on topographic and time conditions for different dates. In the second step, the NSTLR value was calculated based on the LST-DEM feature space at the regional scale. The LST was normalized relative to the surface characteristics based on Random Forest (RF) regression and the NSTLR was calculated based on the NLST-DEM feature space. Finally, the coefficient of determination (R-2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the modeled NSTLR and the observed NSTLR were calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the modeled NSTLR. The mean values of R-2 between DEM and NLST were improved 0.3, 0.42 and 0.35, rather than between DEM and LST for the study area A, B and C, respectively. The R-2 and RMSE between the observed NSTLR and the Landsat derived NSTLR based on NLST for the study area A (B, C) were improved 0.30 (0.26, 0.35) and 0.81 (0.80, 0.94) degrees C Km(-1), respectively, rather than the Landsat derived NSTLR based on LST. Also, for the study area A, the R-2 and RMSE between the observed NSTLR and the MODIS derived NSTLR based on NLST in spring, summer, autumn and winter were improved 0.17, 0.12, 0.10, and 0.22; and 0.51, 0.44, 0.27, and 0.51 degrees C Km(-1), respectively, rather than the MODIS derived NSTLR based on LST. Model assessment results (R-2 and RMSE) and comparing modeled NSTLR (all strategies) with observed NSTLR, for both Landsat and MODIS, showed that the use of NLST instead of LST, significantly improved the accuracy of the obtained NSTLR in the mountainous regions.

TI  - Refining information literacy practice:: Examining the foundations of information literacy theory
T2  - IFLA JOURNAL-INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are many ways for an academic librarian to contribute to the teaching and learning mission of an institution ranging from direct instruction to assignment design. Given this plethora of information literacy educational practices, what should academic librarians and educators focus time, labor, and resources on, and why should they do so? With an eye towards improving information literacy educational practice and addressing these fundamental questions, we examine the foundational philosophical commitments of two information literacy theories, Critical Information Literacy and Informed Learning. We find that these information literacy theories may be biased towards a 20th-century European worldview. This finding supports the idea that "good" IL educational practice in higher education requires active engagement with information literacy theory to justify what one does as an educator and to demonstrate why information literacy can be integral to learning in higher education.

TI  - Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Neurotoxicity in Sentinel and Non-Traditional Laboratory Model Systems: Potential Utility in Predicting Adverse Outcomes in Human Health
T2  - TOXICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of chemicals that were widely used in manufacturing and are now present in the environment throughout the world. It is known that various PFAS are quantifiable in human in blood, but potential adverse health outcomes remain unclear. Sentinel and non-traditional model species are useful to study potential toxicity of PFAS in order to understand the relationship between environmental and human health. Here, we present a critical review of studies on the neurotoxicity of PFAS in sentinel and non-traditional laboratory model systems, including Caenorhabditis elegans(nematode),Dugesia japonica(planarian),Rana pipiens(frogs),Danio rerioand Oryzias melastigma(fish), and Ursus maritimus(polar bears). PFAS have been implicated in developmental neurotoxicity in non-traditional and traditional model systems as well as sentinel species, including effects on neurotransmitter levels, especially acetylcholine and its metabolism. However, further research on the mechanisms of toxicity needs to be conducted to determine if these chemicals are affecting organisms in a similar manner. Overall, findings tend to be similar among the various species, but bioaccumulation may vary, which needs to be taken into account in future studies by quantifying target organ concentrations of PFAS to better compare different species. Furthermore, data on the majority of PFAS is lacking in neurotoxicity testing, and additional studies are needed to corroborate findings thus far.

TI  - Water Balance Standardization Approach for Reconstructing Runoff Using GPS at the Basin Upstream
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While in-situ estuarine discharge has been correlated and reconstructed well with localized remotely-sensed data and hydraulic variables since the 1990s, its correlation and reconstruction using averaged GPS-inferred water storage from satellite gravimetry (i.e., GRACE) at the basin upstream based on the water balance standardization (WBS) approach remains unexplored. This study aims to illustrate the WBS approach for reconstructing monthly estuarine discharge (in the form of runoff (R)) at Mekong River Delta, by correlating the averaged GPS-inferred water storage from GRACE of the upstream Mekong Basin with the in-situ R at the Mekong River Delta estuary. The resulting R based on GPS-inferred water storage is comparable to that inferred from GRACE, regardless of in-situ stations within Mekong River Delta being used for the R reconstruction. The resulting R from the WBS approach with GPS water storage converted by GRACE mascon solution attains the lowest normalized root-mean-square error of 0.066, and the highest Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.974 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.950. Regardless of using either GPS-inferred or GRACE-inferred water storage, the WBS approach shows an increase of 1-4% in accuracy when compared to those reconstructed from remotely-sensed water balance variables. An external assessment also exhibits similar accuracies when examining the R estimated at another station location. By comparing the reconstructed and estimated Rs between the entrance and the estuary mouth, a relative error of 1-4% is found, which accounts for the remaining effect of tidal backwater on the estimated R. Additional errors might be caused by the accumulated errors from the proposed approach, the unknown signals in the remotely-sensed water balance variables, and the variable time shift across different years between the Mekong Basin at the upstream and the estuary at the downstream.

TI  - Determining improvements in Landsat spectral sampling for inland water quality monitoring
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland waters are optically complex and provide an ongoing challenge to effective water quality monitoring through remote sensing. Imaging satellites with spectral sampling designed for this task often have coarse spatial resolutions, preventing any capture of information from small lakes. Medium resolution satellite systems such as Landsat 8 have the appropriate spatial resolution and sensitivity required to resolve these waterbodies, but the spectral sampling is not optimal. This work uses system simulation to explore potential changes to Landsat spectral sampling to determine if its ability to monitor inland waters could be improved. The HydroLight and MODTRAN radiative transfer models are used for simulation in a Look Up Table and spectrum matching approach to provide maximum flexibility intesting spectral sampling scenarios. To isolate the testing to the impacts of spectral sampling, all simulations were performed based on the known system noise characteristics of Landsat 8. Spectral sampling changes tested include the addition of yellow and red edge spectral bands as well as conversion to an imaging spectrometer. Simulated spectra of inland waters undergoing a cyanobacteria bloom, including atmospheric effects and sensor noise, were implemented with the Look-Up-Table retrieval process to extract estimated concentrations of waterbody components. The retrieval accuracy of each potential system is compared to that of a modeled Landsat 8 baseline. All potential systems show an increase of retrieval accuracy over the baseline. The best performing system design is an imaging spectrometer, followed by the addition of both a yellow and red edge band simultaneously, and the addition of either band individually. Testing also demonstrates that resampling an imaging spectrometer with 20 nm spectral resolution to the Landsat 8 band responses produces outputs matching those available from Landsat 8. Our results indicate that future Landsat missions should aim to add as much spectral sampling as is feasible, while maintaining at least the same sensitivity. The minimum change to improve water quality monitoring capability is the addition of a red edge spectral band.

TI  - Poleward non-breeding migration of a breeding population: challenging the traditional perspective of avian migration.
T2  - Journal of Avian Biology
M3  - Article
AB  - Migration is a fundamental ecological phenomenon, which in the Northern Hemisphere involves directed movements between northern breeding grounds and southern non-breeding grounds. Migratory movements in the opposite direction to the prevailing seasonal routes had been seldom studied and are considered to be an exceptional behavior of animals. Here we present novel insights on avian movement and challenge the traditional perspective of avian migration, by revealing an exceptional movement pattern. We combine analyses of a large dataset based on high-frequency GPS animal tracking data, deployed on the breeding population of the Judean long-legged buzzardButeo rufinus(LLB), along with analyses of remotely sensed data (of a satellite-based greenness index NDVI - normalized difference vegetation index) to reveal the migratory patterns of this population. This species had never been tagged before and its annual movements were previously unknown. We show that the Judean LLB population is migratory rather than sedentary, and that this population performs a poleward non-breeding migration from their southern breeding grounds in Israel to their northern non-breeding grounds in Syria, Turkey and Russia. We suggest that this unusual phenomenon is likely related to food availability in their breeding and non-breeding grounds. We provide support to the hypothesis that LLBs occupy rich environments, track specific ecological productivity levels along latitude gradients, and maintain consistently lower NDVI levels across their annual cycle compared to NDVI values available in their respective home range. These low NDVI levels are linked to the foraging ecology of LLBs, which forage in relatively open areas characterized by low vegetation. To the best of our knowledge, we present here a most extreme departure from the seasonally appropriate migratory direction of most avian species, by showing a significant poleward non-breeding pattern and by providing a possible suggestion for this behavior.

AB  - Migration is a fundamental ecological phenomenon, which in the Northern Hemisphere involves directed movements between northern breeding grounds and southern non-breeding grounds. Migratory movements in the opposite direction to the prevailing seasonal routes had been seldom studied and are considered to be an exceptional behavior of animals. Here we present novel insights on avian movement and challenge the traditional perspective of avian migration, by revealing an exceptional movement pattern. We combine analyses of a large dataset based on high-frequency GPS animal tracking data, deployed on the breeding population of the Judean long-legged buzzardButeo rufinus(LLB), along with analyses of remotely sensed data (of a satellite-based greenness index NDVI - normalized difference vegetation index) to reveal the migratory patterns of this population.

TI  - Endmember Extraction of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images Based on an Improved Discrete Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm
T2  - MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at improving the performance of the endmember extraction problem in hyperspectral images, a new extraction method based on discrete hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm and genetic algorithm (DABC_GA) is proposed. By analyzing the characteristic of the problem, each dimension of candidate solution is a discrete and exclusive integer. Then we employ an optimization method with integral coding. By inheriting the strong exploration ability of the traditional artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), we propose a discrete ABC which could quickly obtain more valuable endmembers combinations in the early stage. Then we select some outstanding results of DABC as the potential solutions of GA, which is adopted as another optimization tool in the later stage of iteration. The concept of complementary sets is proposed in the cross and mutation operators to guarantee the diversity and completeness of solutions. Meanwhile, the greedy strategy is adopted to ensure that the favorable potential solutions are not discarded. Compared with conventional extraction algorithms in simulated and real hyperspectral remote sensing data, the experimental results show the validity of our proposed algorithm.

TI  - Effect of Land Use/Cover Changes on Urban Cool Island Phenomenon in Seville, Spain
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses Seville's surface urban heat island (SUHI) phenomenon, comparing spatial and temporal patterns of land surface temperature (LST) during July 1987, 2000 and 2017. Landsat data captured throughout three July months were analyzed for the different years, techniques of geographic information systems, ecological variables and geospatial approaches and used to carry out the analysis. The results indicate that from 1987 to 2017, the averaged LST has increased by 9.1 degrees C in the studied area. The urban areas are colder than their surroundings, suggesting the role of baresoil and cultivated land in the reversal of the SUHI phenomenon. The results show that a fraction of green space has a high unstandardized coefficient (beta) through the three time periods. A decreasing trend is also observed in the standardized beta "fraction of impervious surface" in the three time periods. The linear regression analysis shows a negative relationship of mean LST with impervious surface fraction due to the presence of shadows projected by buildings, and a positive relationship with green space fraction caused by the influence of baresoil and cultivated land that inverts the LST behavior pattern. The study concludes that there is a need to implement SUHI mitigation strategies during the initial phases of engineering projects where the origin of this problem can be acted upon, since the process of creating streets and public space offers a valuable opportunity to restore the environmental quality and diminish the effects generated by climate change.

TI  - A within-season approach for detecting early growth stages in corn and soybean using high temporal and spatial resolution imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop emergence date is a critical input to models of crop development and biomass accumulation. The ability to robustly detect and map emergence date using remote sensing would greatly benefit operational yield estimation and crop monitoring efforts; however, this has proven to be challenging. Previous remote-sensing phenology algorithms showed that crop stages can typically be detected starting only around the V3-V4 (3 to 4 established leaves) vegetative stage. Furthermore, traditional approaches have a strong assumption regarding the temporal evolution of plant growth and normally require a complete growth period of observations to define seasonal changes. Most approaches were not designed for within-season operational mapping, particularly in the early growing season. In the current paper, we describe a new within-season emergence (WISE) approach to mapping crop green-up date using satellite observations available during early growth stages. The approach was first optimized using high spatiotemporal resolution (10 m, 2-day revisit) imagery from the Vegetation and Environment monitoring New MicroSatellite (VEN mu S) research mission, and assessed using ground observations of early crop growth stages (emergence VE and one leaf V1 stages for corn, and emergence VE and unifoliolate VC stages for soybeans) collected over the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) experimental fields in Beltsville, MD during the 2019 growing season. Results show that early crop growth stages can be reliably detected at sub-field scale about two weeks after crop emergence. The remote-sensing green-up dates were about 4-5 days after crop emergence on average. Coefficients of determination (R-2) between green-up dates and the mid-point dates of the early growth stages were above 0.90. The mean absolute differences, standard deviations, and root mean square errors comparing to the early growth stage mid-point dates were within six days. The maximum differences were within +/- 10 days across all fields. The WISE approach was assessed using operational Sentinel-2 data (10 m, 5-day revisit) over BARC. The detected green-up dates from Sentinel-2 were consistent with those from VEN mu S. Some fields were not detected due to the lack of observations around the emergence dates. For independent evaluation, the WISE approach was applied over an agricultural watershed on the Maryland Eastern Shore using both VEN mu S and the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data (30 m, 3-4-day revisit). The detected green-up dates were compared with emergence dates in crop progress reports from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) at the state-level. The WISE-detected green-up dates at the regional scale are within VE stage ranges but slightly earlier than NASS crop progress reports at the state-level. The WISE approach uses remote-sensing observations during the early crop growth stages and has potential for operational application within the season using Sentinel-2 and HLS data.

TI  - Uncertainty analysis in cross-calibration and optimization calculation of calibration coefficients
T2  - CHINESE OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The general cross-calibration method uses the ordinary least square method to regress the calibration coefficient by data points selected after time, spatial, observation geometrics and spectral collocation. However, the ordinary least square algorithm would reduce the validity of the regressed result because of ignoring the differences in quality between each data point. An optimized method based on the calculation of uncertainty was proposed. This uncertainty analysis method was used to quantify the uncertainty of the radiation standard value for each data point, and their weight factors were calculated. The weighted least square method was used to regress the calibration coefficient. Using HYPERION as a radiance standard, the calibration coefficients of MODIS channels 1 to 7 were each regressed using the ordinary least squares method and the weighted least squares method. The regressed coefficients were compared with the official calibration coefficient. The results show that the calibration coefficients calculated using the weighted least squares method were closer to the official coefficients of MODIS channels 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The maximum relative error reduced to 3%similar to 5% and the average relative error decreased to 0.5%similar to 1.5% compared with the ordinary least squares method, which indicates that the weighted least squares method proposed in this paper can further improve the calculation accuracy of cross-calibration.

TI  - The sentinel lymph node biopsy technique in papillary thyroid carcinoma: The issue of false-negative findings
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The management of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is changed after introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) technique for nodal staging. Some debate still surrounds the accuracy of this procedure in terms of wide heterogeneity of sentinel lymph node detection and false-negative findings.Aim: to identify the key issues which make it difficult the usefulness of SNB in PTC. Methods: A comprehensive computer literature search of meta-analyses published in PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane library database until June 30, 2019 was conducted. We used a search algorithm based on this combination of terms: (i) "thyroid neoplasm" or "thyroid cancer" or "thyroid carcinoma" or "thyroid malignancy" or "meta-analysis" or "systematic review") AND (ii) "sentinel lymph node biopsy".Results: Comparing 4 written meta-analyses published in the literature, the diagnostic performance of SNB technique in PTC has been summarized. Relatively high false-negative rates (FNR) were reported for each SNB methods: vital-dye (VD: 12.7%; 7%; 0-38%), 99mTc-nanocolloid planar lymphoscintigraphy with the use of intraoperative hand-held gamma probes (LS: 11.3%; 16%; 0-40%), combined LS with VD (LS+VD: 0%; 0-17%), LS with the additional contribution of preoperative SPECT/CT (7-8%).Conclusion: Evidence-based data about the diagnostic performance of SNB in PTC are increasing. The nuclear medicine community should reach a consensus on the operational definition of the SLN to better guide the surgeon in identifying the lymph nodes most likely contain metastatic cells. Standardization of SLN identification, removal and analysis are required. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Live Fuel Moisture Content Product from Landsat TM Satellite Time Series for Implementation in Fire Behavior Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) contributes to fire danger and behavior, as it affects fire ignition and propagation. This paper presents a two layered Landsat LFMC product based on topographically corrected relative Spectral Indices (SI) over a 2000-2011 time series, which can be integrated into fire behavior simulation models. Nine chaparral sampling sites across three Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes were used to validate the product over the Western USA. The relations between field-measured LFMC and Landsat-derived SIs were strong for each individual site but worsened when pooled together. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) presented the strongest correlations (r) and the least Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), followed by the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI). The relations between LFMC and the SIs for all sites improved after using their relative values and relative LFMC, increasing r from 0.44 up to 0.69 for relative EVI (relEVI), the best predictive variable. This relEVI served to estimate the herbaceous and woody LFMC based on minimum and maximum seasonal LFMC values. The understory herbaceous LFMC on the woody pixels was extrapolated from the surrounding pixels where the herbaceous vegetation is the top layer. Running simulations on the Wildfire Analyst (WFA) fire behavior model demonstrated that this LFMC product alone impacts significantly the fire spatial distribution in terms of burned probability, with average burned area differences over 21% after 8 h burning since ignition, compared to commonly carried out simulations based on constant values for each fuel model. The method could be applied to Landsat-7 and -8 and Sentinel-2A and -2B after proper sensor inter-calibration and topographic correction.

TI  - Low-Volume Nodal Metastasis in Endometrial Cancer: Risk Factors and Prognostic Significance
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective:To evaluate the oncological outcomes of patients with low-volume metastasis compared to those with macrometastasis and negative nodes in endometrial cancer.Methods:A single institutional retrospective study was carried out, which included all patients with endometrial cancer who underwent surgical treatment between January 2007 and December 2016. We analyzed the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of all patients after sentinel node biopsy and full nodal surgical staging according to their final pathological nodal status, focusing on the impact of the size of nodal metastasis.Results:A total of 270 patients were operated on during the study period; among them, 230 (85.2%) patients underwent nodal staging. On final pathology, 196 (85.2%) patients had negative lymph nodes; low-volume metastasis (LVM) was present in 14 (6.1%) patients: 6 (2.6%) patients had isolated tumor cells (ITCs) and 8 (3.5%) patients presented just micrometastasis; additionally, 20 (8.7%) patients presented macrometastasis. After a median (range) follow-up of 60 (0-146) months, patients with macrometastasis showed a significantly worse PFS compared to LVM and node-negative patients (61.1% vs. 71.4% vs. 83.2%, respectively;p= 0.018), and similar results were obtained for 5-year OS (50% vs. 78.6% vs. 81.5%, respectively;p< 0.001). Half of the patients presenting LVM did not receive adjuvant treatment. Moreover, LVM had a moderate nonsignificant decrease in 5-year PFS compared to node-negative patients.Conclusions:Patients with endometrial cancer and low-volume nodal metastasis demonstrated a better prognosis than those presenting macrometastasis. Low-volume metastasis did not show worse oncological outcomes than node-negative patients, although there was a slight decrease in progression-free survival.

AB  - Deep-seated educational discourses have blamed low-income communities for their youth's lack of high school completion. These deficit discourses reflect top down knowledge hierarchies and a lack of knowledge democracy in education (de Sousa Santos 2007; Hall &Tandon 2017; Visvanathan 2009), and they are in need of 'critical and diverse knowledge reckoning' (Malone 2019, p.2) by low-income communities themselves. This article relays how a community-university participatory action research (PAR) partnership became a dynamic site of knowledge democracy from which to counter and transform deficit-based knowledge systems imposed on economically disadvantaged communities. Steeped in the generative enactments of PAR, storytelling, ecological metaphor, strength-based approaches and the arts, this article explores a low-income/social housing community's knowledge practices that are energising and growing its community power to support the success of their youth in school. These seven knowledge practices are narrated through the ecological metaphor of trees, specifically via a co-constructed PAR team narrative called the Tree of Community Knowledge and Engagement. In the telling and retelling of this counternarrative-in-the-making, this article embodies knowledge democracy Here, community members' energising knowledge practices are recognised as invaluable forms of everyday educational knowing and leadership for their youth. This article further explores three broad ways of knowing that reside within and across community members' seven knowledge practices: lived knowing, interconnected knowing and participatory/power-in-relation knowing. The three community ways of knowing illustrate how the community is growing its power to support youth's success via a transformative educational worldview, from which other schools and universities could learn and, indeed, thrive.

TI  - Comparative Assessment of Machine Learning Methods for Urban Vegetation Mapping Using Multitemporal Sentinel-1 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of green vegetation in urban areas using remote sensing techniques can be used as a tool for integrated spatial planning to deal with urban challenges. In this context, multitemporal (MT) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have not been equally investigated, as compared to optical satellite data. This research compared various machine learning methods using single-date and MT Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery. The research was focused on vegetation mapping in urban areas across Europe. Urban vegetation was classified using six classifiers-random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), AdaBoost.M1 (AB), and extreme learning machine (ELM). Whereas, SVM showed the best performance in the single-date image analysis, the MLP classifier yielded the highest overall accuracy in the MT classification scenario. Mean overall accuracy (OA) values for all machine learning methods increased from 57% to 77% with speckle filtering. Using MT SAR data, i.e., three and five S1 imagery, an additional increase in the OA of 8.59% and 13.66% occurred, respectively. Additionally, using three and five S1 imagery for classification, the F1 measure for forest and low vegetation land-cover class exceeded 90%. This research allowed us to confirm the possibility of MT C-band SAR imagery for urban vegetation mapping.

TI  - Land use/cover classification in an arid desert-oasis mosaic landscape of China using remote sensed imagery: Performance assessment of four machine learning algorithms
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of land use and cover change (LUCC) has gradually attracted more attention due to its influence on the climate and ecosystem. Consequently, the necessity of accurate LUCC mapping has become increasingly apparent. Over the past decades, although a large number of machine learning algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and reliability of remote sensing image classification, especially for LUCC classification, there is a lack of studies that assess the performance of machine learning algorithms in arid desert-oasis mosaic landscapes. In this study, the main objective is to provide a reference for the extraction of LUCC information in dryland regions with oasis-desert mosaic landscapes by comparing the performances of the k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) for the LUCC classification of the Dengkou Oasis, China. Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image data were used with spectral indices and auxiliary variables that were derived from a digital terrain model to classify 7 different land cover categories. The highest overall accuracy was produced by the ANN (97.16%), which was closely followed by the RF (96.92%), SVM (96.20%), and finally KNN (93.98%); statistically similar accuracies were obtained for the ANN, SVM and RF. The RF algorithm performed well across several aspects, such as stability, ease of use and processing time during the parameter tuning. Overall, the random forest algorithm is a good first choice method for land-cover classification in this study area, and the elevation and some spectral indices, such as the NDVI, MSAVI2 and MNDWI, should be used as variables to improve the overall accuracy.

TI  - Analysis of Land Cover Change Detection in Gozamin District, Ethiopia: From Remote Sensing and DPSIR Perspectives
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover patterns in sub-Saharan Africa are rapidly changing. This study aims to quantify the land cover change and to identify its major determinants by using the Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, Responses (DPSIR) framework in the Ethiopian Gozamin District over a period of 32 years (1986 to 2018). Satellite images of Landsat 5 (1986), Landsat 7 (2003), and Sentinel-2 (2018) and a supervised image classification methodology were used to assess the dynamics of land cover change. Land cover maps of the three dates, focus group discussions (FGDs), interviews, and farmers' lived experiences through a household survey were applied to identify the factors for changes based on the DPSIR framework. Results of the investigations revealed that during the last three decades the study area has undergone an extensive land cover change, primarily a shift from cropland and grassland into forests and built-up areas. Thus, quantitative land cover change detection between 1986 and 2018 revealed that cropland, grassland, and bare areas declined by 10.53%, 5.7%, and 2.49%. Forest, built-up, shrub/scattered vegetation, and water bodies expanded by 13.47%, 4.02%, 0.98%, and 0.25%. Household surveys and focus group discussions (FGDs) identified the population growth, the rural land tenure system, the overuse of land, the climate change, and the scarcity of grazing land as drivers of these land cover changes. Major impacts were rural to urban migration, population size change, scarcity of land, and decline in land productivity. The outputs from this study could be used to assure sustainability in resource utilization, proper land use planning, and proper decision-making by the concerned government authorities.

In this paper, modified classification algorithm of remote sensing data is presented for processing medium and high spatial resolution satellite images like Landsat and Sentinel in Tashkent province of Uzbekistan. The results of NDVI (Normalized difference vegetation index) profile analysis via Spectral Correlation Mapper classification are shown for the period 1994-2017. It is implied, that combination of optical and radar data with application of Spectral Correlation Mapper classification improve the results of classification for a specific dataset by considering such factors as overall classification accuracy and time and labor involved.

TI  - Estimation of Actual Evapotranspiration Using the Remote Sensing Method and SEBAL Algorithm: A Case Study in Ein Khosh Plain, Iran
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) using remote sensing and the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) in the Ilam province, Iran. Landsat 8 satellite images were used to calculate ET during the cultivation and harvesting of wheat crops. The evaluation using SEBAL, along with the FAO-Penman-Monteith method, showed that SEBAL has a sufficient accuracy for estimating ET. The values of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), and correlation coefficient were 0.466, 2.9%, 0.222 mm/day, and 0.97, respectively. Satellite images showed that rainfall, except for the last month of cultivation, provided the necessary water requirements and there was no requirement for the use of other water resources for irrigation, with the exception of late May and early June. The maximum ET on the Ein Khosh Plain occurred in March. The irrigation requirements showed that the Ein Khosh Plain in March, which witnessed the highest ET, did not experience any deficiency of rainfall that month. However, during April and May, with maxima of 50 and 70 mm, respectively, water was needed for irrigation. During the plant growth periods, the greatest and least amount of water required were 231.23 and 19.47 mm/hr, respectively.

TI  - An enhanced spatiotemporal fusion method - Implications for coal fire monitoring using satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Many real-world applications require remotely sensed images at both high spatial and temporal resolutions. This requirement, however, is generally not met by single satellite system. A number of spatiotemporal fusion models have been developed to overcome this constraint. Landsat and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data have been extensively used for detection and monitoring of active fires at different scales. Fusing the data obtained from these sensors will, therefore, significantly contribute to the satellite-based monitoring of fires. Among the available spatiotemporal fusion methods, the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM) algorithms have been widely used for studying the land surface dynamics in the homogeneous and heterogeneous regions. The present study explores the applicability of STARFM and ESTARFM algorithms for fusing the high spatial resolution Landsat-8 OLI data with high temporal resolution VIIRS data in the context of active surface coal fire monitoring. Further, a modified version of ESTARFM algorithm, referred as modified-ESTARFM, is developed to improve the performance of the fusion model. Jharia coalfield (India), known for widespread occurrences of coal fires, is taken as the study area. The qualitative and quantitative assessments of the predicted (synthetic) Landsat-like images from different algorithms (STARFM, modified-STARFM, ESTARFM, modified-ESTARFM) indicate that the modified-ESTARFM outperforms the other fusion approaches used in this study. Considering the advantages, limitations and performance of the algorithms used, modified-ESTARFM along with STARFM can be used for surface coal fire monitoring. The study will not only contribute to remote sensing based coal fire studies but also to other applications, such as forest fires, crop residue burning, land cover and land use change, vegetation phenology, etc.

TI  - Satellite Monitoring of Mass Changes and Ground Subsidence in Sudan's Oil Fields Using GRACE and Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring environmental hazards, owing to natural and anthropogenic causes, is an important issue, which requires proper data, models, and cross-validation of the results. The geodetic satellite missions, for example, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Sentinel-1, are very useful in this respect. GRACE missions are dedicated to modeling the temporal variations of the Earth's gravity field and mass transportation in the Earth's surface, whereas Sentinel-1 collects synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which enables us to measure the ground movements accurately. Extraction of large volumes of water and oil decreases the reservoir pressure and form compaction and, consequently, land subsidence occurs, which can be analyzed by both GRACE and Sentinel-1 data. In this paper, large-scale groundwater storage (GWS) changes are studied using the GRACE monthly gravity field models together with different hydrological models over the major oil reservoirs in Sudan, that is, Heglig, Bamboo, Neem, Diffra, and Unity-area oil fields. Then, we correlate the results with the available oil wells production data for the period of 2003-2012. In addition, using the only freely available Sentinel-1 data, collected between November 2015 and April 2019, the ground surface deformation associated with this oil and water depletion is studied. Owing to the lack of terrestrial geodetic monitoring data in Sudan, the use of GRACE and Sentinel-1 satellite data is very valuable to monitor water and oil storage changes and their associated land subsidence over our region of interest. Our results show that there is a significant correlation between the GRACE-based GWS anomalies (Delta GWS) and extracted oil and water volumes. The trend of Delta GWS changes due to water and oil depletion ranged from -18.5 +/- 6.3 to -6.2 +/- 1.3 mm/year using the CSR GRACE monthly solutions and the best tested hydrological model in this study. Moreover, our Sentinel-1 SAR data analysis using the persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) method shows a high rate of subsidence, that is, -24.5 +/- 0.85, -23.8 +/- 0.96, -14.2 +/- 0.85, and -6 +/- 0.88 mm/year over Heglig, Neem, Diffra, and Unity-area oil fields, respectively. The results of this study can help us to control the integrity and safety of operations and infrastructure in that region, as well as to study the groundwater/oil storage behavior.

TI  - Mapping, Monitoring, and Prediction of Floods Due to Ice Jam and Snowmelt with Operational Weather Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Among all the natural hazards throughout the world, floods occur most frequently. They occur in high latitude regions, such as: 82% of the area of North America; most of Russia; Norway, Finland, and Sweden in North Europe; China and Japan in Asia. River flooding due to ice jams may happen during the spring breakup season. The Northeast and North Central region, and some areas of the western United States, are especially harmed by floods due to ice jams and snowmelt. In this study, observations from operational satellites are used to map and monitor floods due to ice jams and snowmelt. For a coarse-to-moderate resolution sensor on board the operational satellites, like the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) and the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) series, and the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on board the GOES-R series, a pixel is usually composed of a mix of water and land. Water fraction can provide more information and can be estimated through mixed-pixel decomposition. The flood map can be derived from the water fraction difference after and before flooding. In high latitude areas, while conventional observations are usually sparse, multiple observations can be available from polar-orbiting satellites during a single day, and river forecasters can observe ice movement, snowmelt status and flood water evolution from satellite-based flood maps, which is very helpful in ice jam determination and flood prediction. The high temporal resolution of geostationary satellite imagery, like that of the ABI, can provide the greatest extent of flood signals, and multi-day composite flood products from higher spatial resolution imagery, such as VIIRS, can pinpoint areas of interest to uncover more details. One unique feature of our JPSS and GOES-R flood products is that they include not only normal flood type, but also a special flood type as the supra-snow/ice flood, and moreover, snow and ice masks. Following the demonstrations in this study, it is expected that the JPSS and GOES-R flood products, with ice and snow information, can allow dynamic monitoring and prediction of floods due to ice jams and snowmelt for wide-end users.

TI  - Phenological characterization of <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L. in Mediterranean populations of the Spanish Central Range with Landsat OLI/ETM+ and Sentinel-2A/B
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Spanish Central Range hosts some of the southernmost populations of Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech). Recent cartography indicates that these populations are expanding, going up-streams and gaining ground to oak forests of Quercus pyrenaica Willd., heather-lands, and pine plantations. Understanding the spectral phenology of European beech populations-which leaf flush occurs earlier than other vegetation formations-in this Mediterranean mountain range will provide insights of the species recent dynamics, and will enable modelling its performance under future climate oscillations. Intra-annual series of 211 Landsat OLI/ETM+ images, acquired between April 2013-December 2019, and 217 Sentinel-2A/B images, acquired between April 2017-December 2019, were employed to characterize the spectral phenology of European beech populations and five other vegetation types for comparison in an area of 108000 ha. Vegetation indices (VI) including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Tasseled Cap Angle (TCA) from Landsat, and the NDVI and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Sentinel-2 were retrieved from sample pixels. The temporal series of these VI were modelled with Savitzky-Golay and double logistic functions, and assessed with TIMESAT software, enabling the parametric characterization of European beech spectral phenology in the area with the start, length, and end of season, as well as peak time and value. The length of beech phenological season was similar when portrayed by Landsat and Sentinel-2 NDVI time series (214 and 211 days on average for the common period 2017-2019) although start and end differed. Compared with NDVI counterparts the TCA season started and peaked later, and the EVI season was shorter. Sentinel-2 NDVI peaked higher than Landsat NDVI. The European beech had an earlier (21 days on average) start of season than competing oak forests. Joint analysis of data from the virtual constellation Landsat/Sentinel-2 and calibration with field observations may enable more detailed knowledge of phenological traits at the landscape scale.

TI  - Prospective Study on the Potential Use of Satellite Data for Disaster Prevention, Preparedness, and Mitigation in Poland
T2  - PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering climate change, the risk of natural disasters requires a comprehensive approach on the part of all entities dealing with crisis management. Despite the advanced technologies available to predict weather phenomena, it is often unmanageable to take remedial measures, and the best solution is to suitably prepare for, and efficiently operate after, the occurrence of any given crisis. Nevertheless, it is imperative to implement the latest techniques and solutions which will allow for better preparation and responsiveness in the event of natural disasters. This manuscript presents results of initial analysis concerning the currently tested project, which is aimed at, among other things, improving safety in the event of natural disasters in Poland. There were two reasons for creating the manuscript. First, to present the potential of the system currently being built in Poland, which aims to reduce the risks associated with natural disasters and minimize the problems related to crisis management in Poland. And second, to open discussions and create grounds for information exchange between countries implementing similar solutions, especially neighboring countries, with which joint actions could be taken in the event of disasters in border areas.

TI  - The 2017 Land Use/Land Cover Map of Catalonia based on Sentinel-2 images and auxiliary data
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper details the process of generating the 2017 Land Use/Land Cover Map of Catalonia (MUCSC) using automatic classification of satellite imagery and auxiliary cartographic and remote sensing data. A total of 60 images (6 dates for each of the 10 tiles covering Catalonia) captured by the Sentininel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites were used. These images as well as texture variables, terrain models derived from lidar processing, and vegetation and wetness indices were classified using the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (kNN) to obtain a map with 25 categories. The categories related to urbanized areas (urban areas, urbanizations and industrial zones/commercial areas), road infrastructures and burned areas were edited using official cartographic datasets of the Catalan Government [Generalitat]. The results have an overall accuracy greater than 98 %, which was evaluated with a set of more than 8.6 million independent test pixels. This work represents an important milestone in terms of the computational effort it involves due to the territorial extension (32 000 km(2)), the spatial detail of between 2 and 20 m, the use of up to 58 variables, the relative completeness of the legend and the level of success achieved. The MUCSC 2017, which is part of a 30-year quinquennial series beginning in 1987, can be downloaded in different formats (also in MMZX: new ISO 19165-2) and at resolutions of 10 m and 30 m pixel side from the Ministry of Territory and Sustainability website of the Catalan Government.

TI  - Coastal settlement patterns and exposure to sea-level rise in the Jaffna Peninsula, Sri Lanka
T2  - POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Jaffna Peninsula in Sri Lanka has a generally flat topography with a median elevation of 2.72 m, and thus faces a high risk from sea-level rise that has the potential to have adverse impacts on the livelihoods of coastal communities. Understanding these risks and identifying the regions that could be adversely impacted is critical for planning future settlements and developing preventative protocols where possible. The aim of this study was to analyze the exposure of coastal settlements of the Jaffna Peninsula to climate risks, particularly to sea-level rise, and to identify the areas that are likely to be impacted under different sea-level rise scenarios. Raster-based sea-level rise modeling was performed with a digital elevation model produced with topographic contours and spot heights. The spatial distribution of individual residential houses for the entire Jaffna Peninsula was obtained through manual digitization using virtual globe platforms and high-resolution satellite images, and the houses exposed to inundation under various Representative Concentration Pathways from 2025 to 2100 were identified. The results showed that a majority (55.5%) of the residential buildings in the Jaffna Peninsula are located within 3 m above sea level. Approximately 5554 (5.6%) of the houses were projected to be inundated by 2100, and this projection increased to approximately 25,074 (25.4%) under high tide scenarios. This study highlights the coastal communities with a high level of exposure to coastal inundation where adaptation planning is essential. These results provide insights for coastal managers and policy makers for future planning of new settlements and urban expansion.

TI  - "My Daddy ... He Was a Good Man": Gendered Genealogies and Memories of Enslaved Fatherhood in America's Antebellum South
T2  - GENEALOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - While the last few years have witnessed an upsurge of studies into enslaved motherhood in the antebellum American South, the role of the enslaved father remains largely trapped within a paradigm of enforced absenteeism from an unstable and insecure familial unit. The origins of this lie in the racist assumptions of the infamous "Moynihan Report" of 1965, read backwards into slavery itself. Consequently, the historiographical trajectory of work on enslaved men has drawn out the performative aspects of their masculinity in almost every area of their lives except that of fatherhood. This has produced an image of individualistic masculinity, separate from the familial role that many enslaved men managed to sustain and, as a result, productive of a disjointed and gendered genealogy of slavery and its legacy. This paper assesses the extent to which this fractured genealogy actually represents the former slaves' worldview. By examining a selection of interviews conducted by the Federal Writers' Project under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s (the WPA Narratives), this paper explores formers slaves' memories of their enslaved fathers and the significance of the voluntary paternal presence in their life stories. It concludes that the role of the black father was of greater significance than so far recognised by the genealogical narratives that emerged from the slave communities of the Antebellum South.

TI  - Using Remote Sensing Data to Identify Large Bottom Objects: The Case of World War II Shipwreck of General von Steuben
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The seabed of the Baltic Sea is not yet fully searched for and investigated. In 2004 the crew of the Polish Navy hydrographic ship Arctowski discovered a new shipwreck that was not listed in the official underwater objects database nor was it marked on a chart. The identity of a new wreck is most frequently established based on artefacts found in the object by divers as a part of archaeological research, or through underwater inspection with remotely operated vehicle. The aim of this paper is to show how acoustic remote sensing data is used to identify large bottom object without having to go underwater. Bathymetric survey and sonar investigation were conducted over the study area. An appropriate methodology allowed for obtaining high-resolution imagery of the wreck. A review of literature concerning the end of World War II in the Baltic Sea was carried out. Moreover, the author presents a comparative analysis and evaluation of remote sensing data with archival photos, silhouette, and ship characteristics. The proposed approach led to the identification of a new Baltic Sea wreck as the General von Steuben, which was torpedoed in 1945 by soviet submarine. The author's findings show that state of preservation of the shipwreck, quality data as well as historical records play a key role in establishing the wreck's identity.

TI  - A Comparison of Forest Tree Crown Delineation from Unmanned Aerial Imagery Using Canopy Height Models vs. Spectral Lightness
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Improvements in computer vision combined with current structure-from-motion photogrammetric methods (SfM) have provided users with the ability to generate very high resolution structural (3D) and spectral data of the forest from imagery collected by unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The products derived by this process are capable of assessing and measuring forest structure at the individual tree level for a significantly lower cost compared to traditional sources such as LiDAR, satellite, or aerial imagery. Locating and delineating individual tree crowns is a common use of remotely sensed data and can be accomplished using either UAS-based structural or spectral data. However, no study has extensively compared these products for this purpose, nor have they been compared under varying spatial resolution, tree crown sizes, or general forest stand type. This research compared the accuracy of individual tree crown segmentation using two UAS-based products, canopy height models (CHM) and spectral lightness information obtained from natural color orthomosaics, using maker-controlled watershed segmentation. The results show that single tree crowns segmented using the spectral lightness were more accurate compared to a CHM approach. The optimal spatial resolution for using lightness information and CHM were found to be 30 and 75 cm, respectively. In addition, the size of tree crowns being segmented also had an impact on the optimal resolution. The density of the forest type, whether predominately deciduous or coniferous, was not found to have an impact on the accuracy of the segmentation.

TI  - Retroperitoneal lymph node assessment in pediatric paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Paratesticular Rhabdomyosarcoma accounts for 7 to 11% of pediatric rhabdomyosarcomas. Children older than 10 years have a worse event-free survival (69 to 80% vs. 87 to 92%) than children younger than 10 years. In this location, the relapses are essentially in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes and are often fatal. In European protocols, the assessment of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes at diagnosis is made by imaging whereas it is performed by retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in the American protocols. This method has been proved to improve event-free survival in the group of patient older than 10 years with a tumour bigger than 5 cm. In the next European protocol, when nodes will be enlarged a surgical biopsy will be performed, this will be irrespective of age or size, and when no nodes will be enlarged in patients older than 10 years, retroperitoneal lymph node assessment will be performed. Other techniques of lymph nodes assessment will be tested like sentinel node biopsies or PET-scan.

TI  - High-order approximations to call option prices in the Heston model
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL FINANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present paper, a decomposition formula for the call price due to Alos is transformed into a Taylor-type formula containing an infinite series with stochastic terms. The new decomposition may be considered as an alternative to the decomposition of the call price found in a recent paper by Al`os, Gatheral and Rodoicic. We use the new decomposition to obtain various approximations to the call price in the Heston model with sharper estimates of the error term than in previously known approximations. One of the formulas obtained in the present paper has five significant terms and an error estimate of the form O(nu(3)vertical bar rho vertical bar + nu)), where nu and rho are the volatility-of-volatility and the correlation in the Heston model, respectively. Another approximation formula contains seven more terms and the error estimate is of the form O(nu(4)(1 + vertical bar rho vertical bar)). For the uncorrelated Heston model (rho = 0), we obtain a

AB  - Cloud detection is an important and difficult task in the pre-processing of satellite remote sensing data. The results of traditional cloud detection methods are often unsatisfactory in complex environments or the presence of various noise disturbances. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, deep learning methods have achieved great success in many fields such as image processing, speech recognition, autonomous driving, etc. This study proposes a deep learning model suitable for cloud detection, Cloud-AttU, which is based on a U-Net network and incorporates an attention mechanism. The Cloud-AttU model adopts the symmetric Encoder-Decoder structure, which achieves the fusion of high-level features and low-level features through the skip-connection operation, making the output results contain richer multi-scale information. This symmetrical network structure is concise and stable, significantly enhancing the effect of image segmentation. Based on the characteristics of cloud detection, the model is improved by introducing an attention mechanism that allows model to learn more effective features and distinguish between cloud and non-cloud pixels more accurately. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has a significant accuracy advantage over the traditional cloud detection method. The proposed method is also able to achieve great results in the presence of snow/ice disturbance and other bright non-cloud objects, with strong resistance to disturbance. The Cloud-AttU model proposed in this study has achieved excellent results in the cloud detection tasks, indicating that this symmetric network architecture has great potential for application in satellite image processing and deserves further research.

TI  - A Novel Multitemporal Image-Fusion Algorithm: Method and Application to GOCI and Himawari Images for Inland Water Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A spectral-temporal-unmixing-based multitemporal image fusion (MTIF) algorithm is proposed to fuse Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) and Himawari images. The algorithm was applied to two data sets. The fusions are quantitatively and qualitatively compared with four widely used algorithms. The results show that the MTIF algorithm performs better using both evaluation indexes and visual comparisons. For optical complex water monitoring, the MTIF-derived chlorophyll-a concentration (Cchla) map has better spatial detail and temporal trends compared with the other algorithms. For cloudy images, the MTIF algorithm can estimate part of the undercloud water reflectance information: when there are more than 32.6 cloud-free pixels in the current study area, the MTIF algorithm can successfully recover the under cloud information. The MTIF algorithm has great potential to advance the monitoring of optical complex inland water.

TI  - Spatio-temporal study on changing trend of land use and land cover pattern in Munnar area, Idukki district, Western Ghats, India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Munnar is a world-famous tourist place surrounded by rolling hills & barren cliffs at the top with tea plantation at lower altitude, situated in the vicinity of Western Ghats in Kerala state of India. Presently, Munnar area is facing pressure of unplanned developmental activities to accommodate growing tourist flow. Landslide problems are also reported in the last couple of decades in this area; mostly mud/soil flow, rock fall and small rotational failures at places mainly due to change in rainfall pattern and change in the land use and land cover. An attempt has been made to study the change in the land use and land cover pattern of Munnar area covering roughly 542 km(2) using image processing and Geographical Information System. Studies have been carried out with the Survey of India Toposheet of the year 1980, and Cartosat imageries of the years 1995, 1997 2005, 2007 and 2014. Substantial change has been observed in the land use and land cover in this area from 1980 to 2014. Results are encouraging as the forest cover has increased in the study area, though construction activities are still nonsystematic and unplanned. This study provides the information regarding the changing trend of land use and land cover of the Munnar area over 34 years and will be helpful for sustainable planning and development of the beautiful Munnar area, Western Ghats of India.

TI  - A Randomized Trial Comparing the Efficacy of Methylene Blue Dye Alone Versus Combination of Methylene Blue Dye and Radioactive Sulfur Colloid in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Early Stage Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become a standard of care for management of axilla in breast cancer patients, the technique of SLNB is still not well defined. Unlike radioactive sulfur colloid which requires nuclear medicine facilities, methylene blue dye is readily available. The purpose of this study is to validate the use of methylene blue dye alone for SLNB in early breast cancer patients. 60 patients of early breast cancer were randomized to receive either methylene blue alone (Group A-30 patients) or a combination of both methylene blue and radioactive colloid (Group B-30 patients) for detection of sentinel lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was done followed by complete axillary dissection in all patients. In both Groups A and B, sentinel node was identified in all 30 patients, giving identification rate of 100%. In group A, sentinel node was the only positive node in 1 patient, with a false-positive rate of 14.2%. The negative predictive value was 91.3%. The sensitivity of the procedure in predicting further axillary disease was 75% with a specificity of 95.45%. The overall accuracy was 90%. In group B, sentinel node was the only positive node in 2 cases, giving a false-positive rate of 28.7%. The negative predictive value was 95.65%. The sensitivity of the procedure in predicting further axillary disease was 83.33% with a specificity of 91.67%. The overall accuracy was 90%. Although the false-negative rate was slightly higher with methylene blue alone than that using combination (8.6%-4.3%), it was statistically insignificant. Similarly the sensitivity (75%-83.33%), specificity (95.45-91.67%), and negative predictive value (91.3%-95.67%) were also comparable between groups A and B, respectively. Negative predictive value and false-negative rates are comparable, whether blue dye is used alone or a combination of blue dye and radioactive colloid is used. Sentinel lymph node biopsy with blue dye alone is reliable and can be put to clinical practice more widely, even if nuclear medicine facilities are not available in resource constrained centers, so as to reduce long-term morbidity of axillary dissection, with similar oncological outcomes.

TI  - Trends in the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil: repeated serological surveys
T2  - CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19, the disease produced by the virus SARS-CoV-2, has spread quickly throughout the world, leading the World Health Organization to first classify it as an international health emergency and, subsequently, declaring it pandemic. The number of confirmed cases, as April 11, surpassed 1,700,000, but this figure does not reflect the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population as, in many countries, tests are almost exclusively performed in people with symptoms, particularly severe cases. To properly assess the magnitude of the problem and to contribute to the design of evidence-based policies for fighting COVID-19, one must accurately estimate the population prevalence of infection. Our study is aimed at estimating the prevalence of infected individuals in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, to document how fast the infection spreads, and to estimate the proportion of infected persons who present or presented symptoms, as well as the proportion of asymptomatic infections. Four repeated serological surveys will be conducted in probability samples of nine sentinel cities every two weeks. Tests will be performed in 4,500 participants in each survey, totaling18,000 interviews. Interviews and tests will be conducted at the participants' household. A rapid test for the detection of antibodies will be used; the test was validated prior to the beginning of the fieldwork.

TI  - Surface temperature as an indicator of plant species diversity and restoration in oak woodland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As ecological restoration projects increase in size and complexity, scalable indicators of biodiversity change are needed for monitoring and evaluation. Through three experiments, we tested (1) if relative surface temperature decreased over time across 31 fields initially restored from agriculture to oak woodland between 2006 and 2013, (2) if diurnal temperature variation decreased with time since restoration for the same fields, and (3) if plant species diversity affects relative surface temperature change when controlling for biomass and shade.Thermal imagery was acquired from Landsat satellites 5, 7 and 8 for each growing season in 2002-2018 (excluding 2012) and from the ECOSTRESS thermal instrument on the International Space Station (ISS) for 2018. Three of the 31 fields were surveyed annually 2007-2018 for plant species diversity, ground and canopy cover, and number of woody stems. All surface temperatures were measured in percentage difference relative to adjacent mature forest areas that exhibited stable temperature responses over time.We found (1) a mean decrease in temperature of 1.5 percentage point per year since restoration; (2) a decrease of 4 percentage points of diurnal temperature difference per year since restoration for the same fields; and (3) when controlling for ground and canopy cover, stem count, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, an increase of one 'effective number' of plant species diversity decreased relative temperature by 5 percentage points. These results correspond to a decrease of daytime temperature of 4.5 degrees C over 12 years, a decrease of diurnal temperature variation of 5 degrees C in 8 years and a 0.3 degrees C decrease per extra plant species.Our results offer compelling evidence that relative temperature has potential to be used as an indicator to measure ecosystem change resulting from restoration.

TI  - A Hierarchical Clustering Method for Land Cover Change Detection and Identification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A method to detect abrupt land cover changes using hierarchical clustering of multi-temporal satellite imagery was developed. The Autochange method outputs the pre-change land cover class, the change magnitude, and the change type. Pre-change land cover information is transferred to post-change imagery based on classes derived by unsupervised clustering, enabling using data from different instruments for pre- and post-change. The change magnitude and change types are computed by unsupervised clustering of the post-change image within each cluster, and by comparing the mean intensity values of the lower level clusters with their parent cluster means. A computational approach to determine the change magnitude threshold for the abrupt change was developed. The method was demonstrated with three summer image pairs Sentinel-2/Sentinel-2, Landsat 8/Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-2/ALOS 2 PALSAR in a study area of 12,372 km(2) in southern Finland for the detection of forest clear cuts and tested with independent data. The Sentinel-2 classification produced an omission error of 5.6% for the cut class and 0.4% for the uncut class. Commission errors were 4.9% for the cut class and 0.4% for the uncut class. For the Landsat 8/Sentinel-2 classifications the equivalent figures were 20.8%, 0.2%, 3.4%, and 1.6% and for the Sentinel-2/ALOS PALSAR classification 16.7%, 1.4%, 17.8%, and 1.3%, respectively. The Autochange algorithm and its software implementation was considered applicable for the mapping of abrupt land cover changes using multi-temporal satellite data. It allowed mixing of images even from the optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors in the same change analysis.

TI  - Space-time detection of deforestation, forest degradation and regeneration in montane forests of Eastern Tanzania
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Naturally isolated montane forests in East Africa are hotspots of biodiversity, often characterised by high species endemism, and are fundamental contributors to water services. However, they are located in areas highly suitable for agriculture, making them a prime target for agricultural activities. The Eastern Arc Mountains (EAM) in Eastern Tanzania are within the target regions for agricultural development under the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT). However, forest monitoring initiatives that track long-term forest dynamics and the ecological impact of current agricultural development policies on forests, are lacking. Here, we use the STEF (Space-Time Extremes and Features) algorithm and Landsat time series to track forest disturbances (deforestation and degradation) and forest gains (regeneration) as spatio-temporal events over seventeen years (2001-2017) in the montane forests of the Mvomero District in Tanzania. We found that 27 % (similar to 20 487 ha) of montane forests were disturbed between 2001 and 2017, mainly led by deforestation (70 %). Small-scale crop farms with maize, banana, and cassava crops, were the most planted on deforested areas. Most disturbances occurred at lower elevation (lowland montane), but there was an increasing shift to higher elevations in recent years (2011-2017). Forest disturbances exclusively occurred at small spatial scales, a pattern similar to other forest montane landscapes in Africa, which lowers detection capabilities in global forest loss products. Our locally calibrated and validated deforestation map (Producer's accuracy = 80 %; User's accuracy = 78 %) shows a gross underestimation of forest cover loss (> 10 000 ha) by global forest loss products in these mountainous forest landscapes. Overall, we found few areas undergoing forest regeneration, with only 9 % of the disturbed forest regenerating over 17 years. Long-term conversion to cropland prevented regeneration in the lowlands, with regeneration mainly happening at higher elevations. However, the shift of deforestation and forest degradation to higher elevations may challenge high elevation regeneration trends, leaving the remaining blocks of montane forest in the Mvomero District at a risk of degradation and disappearance. Without effective forest conservation measures, market-driven agricultural development is likely to trigger an expansion of cropland at the expense of forests to meet the increased demand for the agricultural products promoted, with negative impact on biodiversity, carbon sequestration and water services.

TI  - LYMPH NODE PREDICTIVE MODEL WITH <i>IN VITRO</i> ULTRASOUND FEATURES FOR BREAST CANCER LYMPH NODE METASTASIS
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ultrasound diagnosis of axillary lymph nodes has the advantages of ease, convenience and low cost; however, most previous studies evaluated lymph node metastasis of the entire axilla rather than the association between the ultrasound features of a single lymph node and its pathology. This prospective study was performed to explore the ultrasound features of lymph nodes observed in bionic medium in vitro and to develop a lymph node-specific model for prediction of metastasis based on analysis of the association between the ultrasound features and pathology of each lymph node. From November 1, 2017 to December 19, 2017, 373 nodes (54 patients) were enrolled into the modeling group; from December 20, 2017 to January 12, 2018, 139 lymph nodes (22 patients) were enrolled into the validation group. Lymph nodes from sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection were enrolled. Individual lymph nodes were placed in bionic medium and observed separately using ultrasound. Traditional ultrasound features of metastatic nodes (long axis, short axis, cortical thickness and hilum loss) were recorded, and the longitudinal-to-transverse axis ratio (L/T) and cortical proportion were calculated. Pathologic results specific to each lymph node were recorded. On the basis of two-level binary logistic regression, independent predictors of lymph node metastasis in the modeling group were lymph node long axis (p = 0.004), short axis (p < 0.001), L/T (p = 0.006), cortical thickness (p = 0.001) and hilum loss (p < 0.001). When analysis was done at the node level, the areas under the curve of the modeling and validation groups were 0.97 and 0.75, respectively. When validation was done at the patient level, the areas under the curve of the modeling and validation groups were 0.96 and 0.93, respectively. The model for prediction of metastasis based on the ultrasound features and pathology of each lymph node is of good predictive value for lymph node metastasis.

TI  - Retrieval of Soil Moisture by Integrating Sentinel-1A and MODIS Data over Agricultural Fields
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an essential variable in the land surface ecosystem, which plays an important role in agricultural drought monitoring, crop status monitoring, and crop yield prediction. High-resolution radar data can be combined with optical remote-sensing data to provide a new approach to estimate high-resolution soil moisture over vegetated areas. In this paper, the Sentinel-1A data and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are combined to retrieve soil moisture over agricultural fields. The advanced integral equation model (AIEM) is utilized to calculate the scattering contribution of the bare soil surface. The water cloud model (WCM) is applied to model the backscattering coefficient of vegetated areas, which use two vegetation parameters to parameterize the scattering and attenuation properties of vegetation. Four different vegetation parameters extracted from MODIS products are combined to predict the scattering contribution of vegetation, including the leaf area index (LAI), the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI). The effective roughness parameters are chosen to parameterize the AIEM. The Sentinel-1A and MODIS data in 2017 are used to calibrate the coupled model, and the datasets in 2018 are used for soil moisture estimation. The calibration results indicate that the Sentinel-1A backscattering coefficient can be accurately predicted by the coupled model with the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) ranging from 0.58 to 0.81 and a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.996 to 1.401 dB. The modeled results show that the retrieved soil moisture can capture the seasonal dynamics of soil moisture withRranging from 0.74 to 0.81. With the different vegetation parameter combinations used for parameterizing the scattering contribution of the canopy, the importance of suitable vegetation parameters for describing the scattering and attenuation properties of vegetation is confirmed. The LAI is recommended to characterize the scattering properties. There is no obvious clue for selecting vegetation descriptors to characterize the attenuation properties of vegetation. These promising results confirm the feasibility and validity of the coupled model for soil moisture retrieval from the Sentinel-1A and MODIS data.

TI  - Assessing Forest/Non-Forest Separability Using Sentinel-1 C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar has a unique potential for continuous forest mapping as it is not affected by cloud cover. While longer wavelengths, such as L-band, are commonly used for forest applications, in this paper we assess the aptitude of C-band Sentinel-1 data for this purpose, for which there is much interest due to its high temporal resolution (five days) and "free, full, and open" data policy. We tested its ability to distinguish forest from non-forest in six study sites, located in Alaska, Colombia, Finland, Florida, Indonesia, and the UK. Using the time series for a full year significantly increases the classification accuracy compared to a single scene (a mean of 85% compared to 77% across the study sites for the best classifier). Our results show that we can further improve the mean accuracy to 87% when only considering the annual mean and standard deviation of co-polarized (VV) and cross-polarized (VH) backscatter. In this case, separation accuracies of up to 93% (in Finland) are possible, though in the worst case (Alaska), the highest possible accuracy using these variables was 80%. The best overall performance was observed when using a Support Vector Machine classifier, outperforming random forest, k-Nearest-Neighbors, and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. We further show that the small information content we found in the phase data is an artifact of terrain slope orientation and has a negligible impact on classifier performance. We conclude that for the purposes of forest mapping the smaller file size and easier to process GRD products are sufficient, unless the SLC products are used to compute the temporal coherence which was not tested in this study.

TI  - Monitoring and Assessment of Salinity and Chemicals in Agricultural Lands by a Remote Sensing Technique and Soil Moisture with Chemical Index Models
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land in the south of Iraq provides habitat for several types of living creatures. This land has a significant impact on the ecosystem. The agricultural land of Al-Hawizeh marsh covers an area of more than 3500 km(2)and is considered an enriched resource to produce several harvests. A total of 74% of this area suffers from a high degree of salinity and chemical pollution, which needs to be remedied. Several human-made activities and post-war-related events have caused radical deterioration in soil quality in the agricultural land. The goal of this research was to integrate mathematical models, remote sensing data, and GIS to provide a powerful tool to predict, assess, monitor, manage, and map the salinity and chemical parameters of iron (Fe), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), and zinc (Zn) in the soils of agricultural land in Al-Hawizeh marsh in southern Iraq during the four seasons of 2017. The mathematical model consists of four parts. The first depends on the B6 and B11 bands of Landsat-8, to calculate the soil moisture index (SMI). The second is the salinity equation (SE), which depends on the SMI result to retrieve the salinity values from Landsat-8 images. The third part depends on the B6 and B7 bands of Landsat-8, which calculates the clay chemical index (CCIs). The fourth part is the chemical equation (CE), which depends on the CCI to retrieve the chemical values (Fe, Pb, Cu, Cr, and Zn) from Landsat-8 images. The average salinity concentrations during autumn, summer, spring, and winter were 1175, 1010, 1105, and 1789 mg/dm(3), respectively. The average Fe concentrations during autumn, summer, spring and winter were 813, 784, 842, and 1106 mg/dm(3), respectively. The average Pb concentrations during autumn, summer, spring, and winter were 4.85, 3.79, 4.74, and 7.2 mg/dm(3), respectively. The average Cu concentrations during autumn, summer, spring, and winter were 3.9, 3.1, 4.45, and 7.5 mg/dm(3), respectively. The average Cr concentrations during autumn, summer, spring, and winter seasons were 1.28, 0.73, 1.03, and 2.91 mg/dm(3), respectively. Finally, the average Zn concentrations during autumn, summer, spring, and winter were 8.25, 6, 7.05, and 12 mg/dm(3), respectively. The results show that the concentrations of salinity and chemicals decreased in the summer and increased in the winter. The decision tree (DT) classification depended on the output results for salinity and chemicals for both SE and CE equations. This classification refers to all the parameters simultaneously in one stage. The output of DT classification results can display all the soil quality parameters (salinity, Fe, Pb, Cu, Cr, and Zn) in one image. This approach was repeated for each season in this study. In conclusion, the developed systematic and generic approach may constitute a basis for determining soil quality parameters in agricultural land worldwide.

TI  - Future Simulation of Land Use Changes in Rapidly Urbanizing South China Based on Land Change Modeler and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape transformations in rapidly urbanizing Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao (GHKM) regions of South China represent the most complex and dynamic processes altering the local ecology and environment. In this study, Land Change Modeler (LCM) is applied to land use land cover (LULC) maps for the years 2005, 2010, and 2017, derived from Landsat images, with the aim of understanding land use land cover change patterns during 2005-2017 and, further, to predict the future scenario of the years 2024 and 2031. Furthermore, the changes in spatial structural patterns are quantified and analyzed using selected landscape morphological metrics. The results show that the urban area has increased at an annual rate of 4.72% during 2005-2017 and will continue to rise from 10.31% (20,228.95 km(2)) in 2017 to 16.30% (31,994.55 km(2)) in 2031. This increase in urban area will encroach further into farmland and fishponds. However, forest cover will continue to increase from 45.02% (88,391.98 km(2)) in 2017 to 46.88% (92,049.62 km(2)) in 2031. This implies a decrease in the mean Euclidian nearest neighbor distance (ENN_MN) of forest patches (from 217.57 m to 206.46 m) and urban clusters (from 285.55 m to 245.06 m) during 2017-2031, indicating an accelerated landscape transformation if the current patterns of the change continues over the next decade. Thus, knowledge of the current and predicted LULC changes will help policy and decision makers to reconsider and develop new policies for the sustainable development and protection of natural resources.

TI  - AN INTEGRATIVE MODELLING APPROACH TO ANALYSE LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS THROUGH INTENSITY ANALYSIS AND CELLULAR AUTOMATA-MARKOV CHAIN MODEL
T2  - EUROPEAN SPATIAL RESEARCH AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study is offer a deep understanding of the landscape dynamics in the Gorgan Township, the Golestan Province, Iran. Landsat satellite imagery of two different time thresholds, i.e. the years 1992 and 2011, was acquired from the US Geological Survey database and the changes were quantified for the Gorgan area covering a 19-year time span. Furthermore, an integrated Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CA-MC) model was applied to predict future changes up to the year 2030. We used the intensity analysis method to compare the historical dynamics of different land categories at multiple levels. The results indicated that during the 19 years, the built-up and forest areas increased by 2.33% and 0.27%, respectively, while agriculture and remnant vegetation decreased by 2.43% and 0.24%, respectively. The CA-MC model illustrated that in the following 19 years, the built-up areas could increase by 2.45%. An intensity analysis revealed that forest gains and losses were dormant while remnant vegetation gains and losses were active. The built-up area's gains and water bodies' losses were active and stationary during both time intervals. The transitions from water bodies and remnant vegetation to agriculture were regularly targeting and stationary, while the transition from forest to agriculture was regularly avoiding and stationary. Our findings also indicated a heavy systematic transition from agriculture to built-up areas. Regarding the increasing population growth and urbanisation in the region, the outcomes of this study can help make informed decisions for the management and protection of natural resources in the study area.

TI  - Straw burning, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and death: Evidence from China
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses satellite data to detect agricultural straw burning and estimates its impact on air pollution and health in China. We find that straw burning increases particulate matter pollution and causes people to die from cardiorespiratory diseases. We estimate that a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 increases mortality by 3.25%. Middle-aged and old people in rural areas are particularly sensitive to straw burning pollution. Exploratory analysis of China's programs to subsidize straw recycling suggests that extending these programs to all the straw burning regions would bring about a health benefit that is an order of magnitude larger than the cost.

TI  - Population Spatialization in Beijing City Based on Machine Learning and Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data have been widely used in research on population spatialization. Previous studies have generally divided study areas into several sub-areas with similar features by artificial or clustering algorithms and then developed models for these sub-areas separately using statistical methods. These approaches have drawbacks due to their subjectivity and uncertainty. In this paper, we present a study of population spatialization in Beijing City, China based on multisource remote sensing data and town-level population census data. Six predictive algorithms were compared for estimating population using the spatial variables derived from The National Polar-Orbiting Partnership/ Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP/VIIRS) night-time light and other remote sensing data. Random forest achieved the highest accuracy and therefore was employed for population spatialization. Feature selection was performed to determine the optimal variable combinations for population modeling by random forest. Cross-validation results indicated that the developed model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2129.52 people/km(2)and a R(2)of 0.63. The gridded population density in Beijing at a spatial resolution of 500 m produced by the random forest model was also adjusted to be consistent with the census population at the town scale. By comparison with Google Earth high-resolution images, the remotely-sensed population was qualitatively validated at the intra-town scale. Validation results indicated that remotely sensed results can effectively depict the spatial distribution of population within town-level districts. This study provides a valuable reference for urban planning, public health and disaster prevention in Beijing, and a reference for population mapping in other cities.

TI  - Identification of waterlogging in Eastern China induced by mining subsidence: A case study of Google Earth Engine time-series analysis applied to the Huainan coal field
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground coal mining with high groundwater levels causes many environmental problems, one of the main ones being subsidence waterlogging. After the subsidence waterlogging, the land faces many problems, such as insufficient land development and difficult and costly land restoration. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the spatial range and temporal trajectory pattern of surface subsidence in a timely manner. When information about underground mining is lacking, it is difficult by using remote sensing alone to identify and distinguish (i) natural water, (ii) engineering water, and (iii) subsidence waterlogging. In this study, we used the Google Earth Engine platform to develop a method to detect subsidence waterlogging area and the disturbance year. The method includes pixel-based trajectory extraction and object-based water type recognition. First, LandTrendr is used to extract the change water (engineering water and subsidence waterlogging) pixels and its disturbance year. Then, the morphological method to further eliminate engineering water patches, so as to extract subsidence waterlogging. We selected the Panxie mining area in Huainan, China as the study area. Using 33 years of Landsat timeseries data to generate values of the annual water frequency index, maps of the year of water accumulation caused by underground coal mining and the year of restoration during 1989-2016 are drawn with accuracies of 86.5% and 80.7%, respectively. The results show that from 1989 to 2016, the accumulated area of subsidence waterlogging was 7715.25 ha, accounting for 14.5% of the total area of the study area, of which 75.8% occurred from 2008 to 2016. Furthermore, the accumulated area of restoration was 207.18 ha, which occurred after 2007 and accounts for 2.7% of the total area of subsidence waterlogging. Based on the analysis results of the changes of waterlogging types, the best time window for restoration of the waterlogging area is 3y after water accumulation. The main innovation of this paper is to make use of the temporal heterogeneity (Number of year in patches, Y_num) and morphological index (Landscape shape index in patches, LSI) of the change water to distinguish engineering water and subsidence waterlogging.

TI  - Mapping regional evapotranspiration in cloudy skies via variational assimilation of all-weather land surface temperature observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, a number of studies estimated evapotranspiration (ET) via variational assimilation of land surface temperature (LST) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Their unknown parameters are neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient (C-HN) (that scales the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes), and evaporative fraction (EF) (that represents the partitioning of available energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes). The variational data assimilation (VDA) approaches estimate C-HN and EF by minimizing the difference between the MODIS LST observations and model estimates. The applicability of these studies is limited only to clear-sky conditions where MODIS LST data are available. Even when the sky is clear, they cannot robustly update the initial guess of EF (i.e., the a priori EF value) because of the low temporal resolution of MODIS LST data. This study overcomes these shortcomings by 1) using the random forest (RF) method to obtain a reasonable the a priori EF value, and 2) assimilating the all-weather LST data (which are obtained by merging thermal infrared and passive microwave observations) into the VDA approach. The VDA approach is applied to the Source Regions of Rivers (SRR) in southwest China with heavy cloud covers. Results show that the RF method obtains a reasonably accurate the a priori EF value. Compared to assimilating the MODIS LST product, assimilation of all-weather LST data lead to an improvement in the ET estimates, especially in regions with dense clouds. Comparison of ET estimates with the measurements at four sites (i.e., Dangxiong, Linzhi, Naqu, and Qomolangma) in the SRR shows that the VDA approach can accurately estimate ET in cloudy conditions. Finally, the three-cornered hat (TCH) method is employed to assess the relative uncertainty of ET estimates over the SRR.

TI  - Different Drought Legacies of Rain-Fed and Irrigated Croplands in a Typical Russian Agricultural Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts are one of the primary natural disasters that affect agricultural economies, as well as the fire hazards of territories. Monitoring and researching droughts is of great importance for agricultural disaster prevention and reduction. The research significance of investigating the hysteresis of agricultural to meteorological droughts is to provide an important reference for agricultural drought monitoring and early warnings. Remote sensing drought monitoring indices can be employed for rapid and accurate drought monitoring at regional scales. In this paper, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices and the surface temperature product are used as the data sources. Calculating the temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) and constructing a comprehensive drought disaster index (CDDI) based on the crop growth period allowed drought conditions and spatiotemporal evolution patterns in the Volgograd region in 2010 and 2012 to be effectively monitored. The causes of the drought were then analyzed based on the sensitivity of a drought to meteorological factors in rain-fed and irrigated lands. Finally, the lag time of agricultural to meteorological droughts and the hysteresis in different growth periods were analyzed using statistical analyses. The research shows that (1) the main drought patterns in 2010 were spring droughts from April to May and summer droughts from June to August, and the primary drought patterns in 2012 were spring droughts from April to June, with an affected area that reached 3.33% during the growth period; (2) local drought conditions are dominated by the average surface temperature factor. Rain-fed lands are sensitive to the temperature and are therefore prone to summer droughts. Irrigated lands are more sensitive to water shortages in the spring and less sensitive to extremely high temperature conditions; (3) there is a certain lag between meteorological and agricultural droughts during the different growth stages. The strongest lag relationship was found in the planting stage and the weakest one was found in the dormancy stage. Therefore, the meteorological drought index in the growth period has a better predictive ability for agricultural droughts during the appropriately selected growth stages.

TI  - Remote Crop Mapping at Scale: Using Satellite Imagery and UAV-Acquired Data as Ground Truth
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate agricultural information is needed to inform resource allocation and sustainable practices to improve food security in the developing world. Obtaining this information through traditional surveys is time consuming and labor intensive, making it difficult to collect data at the frequency and resolution needed to accurately estimate the planted areas of key crops and their distribution during the growing season. Remote sensing technologies can be leveraged to provide consistent, cost-effective, and spatially disaggregated data at high temporal frequency. In this study, we used imagery acquired from unmanned aerial vehicles to create a high-fidelity ground-truth dataset that included examples of large mono-cropped fields, small intercropped fields, and natural vegetation. The imagery was acquired in three rounds of flights at six sites in different agro-ecological zones to capture growing conditions. This dataset was used to train and test a random forest model that was implemented in Google Earth Engine for classifying cropped land using freely available Sentinel-1 and -2 data. This model achieved an overall accuracy of 83%, and a 91% accuracy for maize specifically. The model results were compared with Rwanda's Seasonal Agricultural Survey, which highlighted biases in the dataset including a lack of examples of mixed land cover.

TI  - Hexosome engineering for targeting of regional lymph nodes
T2  - MATERIALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Hexosomes are nanoparticles enveloping inverted discontinuous hexagonal (H-II) liquid crystalline phases that offer exceptional physicochemical characteristics for drug encapsulation and targeted drug delivery. However, the fate of subcutaneously injected hexosomes has rarely been investigated. Here, we have followed the lymphatic fate of a technetium-99 m [Tc-99m]-labeled hexosome preparation on subcutaneous injection into the rat footpads with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in combination with CT. Hexosomes were composed of phytantriol and oleic acid and sterically stabilized with Pluronic F127. High tracer loading efficiency was achieved by chelating [Tc-99m] -pertechnetate to 1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadodecane-oleic acid conjugates incorporated within the ordered interior nanocompartments of hexosomes. The preparation was characterized by synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. On footpad injection, hexosomes rapidly drained into the lymphatic microvessels and distributed not only to the sentinel (popliteal) lymph node, but also to wider lymph nodes (inguinal and iliac nodes) situated along the pathway of the lymph drainage. The observed hexosome drainage kinetics from the injection site and lymphatic distribution pattern is in line with previously established poly(ethylene oxide) configuration attributes of Pluronic F127 in minimizing nanoparticle aggregation at the injection site, and interaction with the ground substance of interstitium, without interfering with macrophage uptake. Accordingly, we discuss the potential utility of Pluronic F127-stabilized hexosomes for lymphatic targeting and future development of simple, yet effective multifunctional lymphotropic agents and theranostics.

TI  - Into the woods: Changes in mosquito community composition and presence of key vectors at increasing distances from the urban edge in urban forest parks in Manaus, Brazil
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) was recently introduced into the Americas and now has the potential to spill back into a sylvatic cycle in the region, likely involving non-human primates and Aedes, Haemagogus, and Sabethes species mosquitoes. We investigated potential routes of mosquito-borne virus exchange between urban and sylvatic transmission cycles by characterizing mosquito communities in three urban forest parks that receive heavy traffic from both humans and monkeys in Manaus, Brazil.Parks were stratified by both distance from the urban-forest edge (0, 50, 100, and 500 m) and relative Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (low, medium, or high), and mosquitoes were sampled at randomly selected sites within each stratum using BG-Sentinel traps. Additionally, temperature, relative humidity, and other environmental data were collected at each site.A total of 1,172 mosquitoes were collected from 184 sites sampled in 2018, of which 98 sites were resampled in 2019. Using park as the unit of replication (i.e. 3 replicates per sampling stratum), a two-way ANOVA showed no effect of distance or NDVI on the mean number of identified species (P > 0.05 for both comparisons) or on species diversity as measured by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (P > 0.10 for both comparisons). However, the Morisita overlap index revealed that mosquito communities changed substantially with increasing distance from edge, with communities at 0 m and 500 m being quite distinct. Aedes albopictus and Ae. aegypti penetrated at least 100 m into the forest, while forest specialists including Haemagogus janthinomys, Sabethes glaucodaemon, and Sa. tridentatus were detected in low numbers within 100 m from the forest edge. Trichoprosopon digitatum and Psorophora amazonica were among the most abundant species collected, and both showed distributions extending from the forest edge to its interior.Our results show overlapping distributions of urban and forest mosquitoes at park edges, which highlights the risk of arbovirus exchange via multiple bridge vectors in Brazilian urban forest parks. These parks may also provide refugia for both Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti from mosquito control programs.

TI  - From nouns to verbs: How process ontologies enhance our understanding of social-ecological systems understood as complex adaptive systems
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on social-ecological systems (SES) has highlighted their complex and adaptive character and pointed to the importance of recognizing their intertwined nature. Yet, we often base our analysis and governance of SES on static and independent objects, such as actors and resources which are not well suited to address complexity and intertwinedness. This bias, which is largely implicit, has its roots in substance ontologies that have influenced most of contemporary science. This paper argues that it is useful to critically reflect on this ontological grounding and develop SES research from a process ontological perspective. Key insights are that process ontological concepts such as process, event and possibility space are able to overcome the dichotomy between the social and the ecological and allow for a conceptualization of continuous change (dynamism) that enhances our understanding of SES as truly intertwined and complex systems. This will enable SES researchers to conceptualize problems as well as corresponding solutions in novel ways which will ultimately support the development of novel governance approaches, from rethinking the aims of policies from managing people towards managing relations between and among people and the natural system. To fully tap the potential which comes with a change in worldview towards a process ontology, changing research approaches and ways of abstracting are required.ResumeLa recherche sur les systemes socio-ecologiques (SSE) a mis en evidence leur caractere complexe et adaptatif et a souligne l'importance de reconnaitre l'enchevetrement du social et de l'ecologique. Pourtant, nos analyses et nos modes de gouvernance se basent souvent sur l'existence d'objets statiques et independants, tels que des acteurs ou des ressources qui, soit ne permettent pas d'expliquer/communiquer le caractere complexe de ces systemes, soit ignorent leur nature enchevetree. Ce biais, largement implicite, trouve ses racines dans les ontologies de la substance qui ont influence la plupart des sciences contemporaines. Cet article propose de reflechir de maniere critique sur les fondements ontologiques des SSE et de s'inspirer d'ontologies qui considerent les relations et processus comme fondamentaux pour developper des recherches sur les SSE, tenant compte de leur caractere complexe, adaptatif et enchevetre. Des concepts tels que processus, evenements et espace de possibilite permettent de depasser la dichotomie nature/societe et de conceptualiser le changement continu (dynamisme) de telle sorte que notre comprehension des SSE se trouve amelioree. Cette nouvelle perspective permettra de repenser les problemes des SSE et, par consequent, de developper de nouvelles approches de gouvernance visant a gerer les relations entre les personnes tout aussi bien qu'entre les personnes et leur environnement. Pour exploiter pleinement le potentiel d'une ontologie des processus, il est necessaire de modifier nos approches de recherche et nos methodes d'abstraction.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.

TI  - Extending the Global Space-Based Inter-Calibration System (GSICS) to Tie Satellite Radiances to an Absolute Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System (GSICS) routinely monitors the calibration of various channels of Earth-observing satellite instruments and generates GSICS Corrections, which are functions that can be applied to tie them to reference instruments. For the infrared channels of geostationary imagers GSICS algorithms are based on comparisons of collocated observations with hyperspectral reference instruments; whereas Pseudo Invariant Calibration Targets are currently used to compare the counterpart channels in the reflected solar band to multispectral reference sensors. This paper discusses how GSICS products derived from both approaches can be tied to an absolute scale using specialized satellite reference instruments with SI-traceable calibration on orbit. This would provide resilience against gaps between reference instruments and drifts in their calibration outside their overlap period and allow construction of robust and harmonized data records from multiple satellite sources to build Fundamental Climate Data Records, as well as more uniform environmental retrievals in both space and time, thus improving inter-operability.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Pattern of Black Carbon (BC) Emission from Biomass Burning and Anthropogenic Sources in New South Wales and the Greater Metropolitan Region of Sydney, Australia
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burnings either due to Hazards Reduction Burnings (HRBs) in late autumn and early winter or bushfires during summer periods in various part of the world (e.g., CA, USA or New South Wales, Australia) emit large amount of gaseous pollutants and aerosols. The emissions, under favourable meteorological conditions, can cause elevated atmospheric particulate concentrations in metropolitan areas and beyond. One of the pollutants of concern is black carbon (BC), which is a component of aerosol particles. BC is harmful to health and acts as a radiative forcing agent in increasing the global warming due to its light absorption properties. Remote sensing data from satellites have becoming increasingly available for research, and these provide rich datasets available on global and local scale as well as in situ aethalometer measurements allow researchers to study the emission and dispersion pattern of BC from anthropogenic and natural sources. The Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) in New South Wales (NSW) has installed recently from 2014 to 2019 a total of nine aethalometers to measure BC in its state-wide air quality network to determine the source contribution of BC and PM2.5(particulate Matter less than 2.5 mu m in diameter) in ambient air from biomass burning and anthropogenic combustion sources. This study analysed the characteristics of spatial and temporal patterns of black carbon (BC) in New South Wales and in the Greater Metropolitan Region (GMR) of Sydney, Australia, by using these data sources as well as the trajectory HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) modelling tool to determine the source of high BC concentration detected at these sites. The emission characteristics of BC in relation to PM(2.5)is dependent on the emission source and is analysed using regression analysis of BC with PM(2.5)time series at the receptor site for winter and summer periods. The results show that, during the winter, correlation between BC and PM(2.5)is found at nearly all sites while little or no correlation is detected during the summer period. Traffic vehicle emission is the main BC emission source identified in the urban areas but was less so in the regional sites where biomass burnings/wood heating is the dominant source in winter. The BC diurnal patterns at all sites were strongly influenced by meteorology.

TI  - Identifying Ecosystem Function Shifts in Africa Using Breakpoint Analysis of Long-Term NDVI and RUE Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series of vegetation greenness data, derived from Earth-observation imagery, have become a key source of information for studying large-scale environmental change. The ever increasing length of such series allows for a range of indicators to be derived and for increasingly complex analyses to be applied. This study presents an analysis of trends in vegetation productivity-measured using the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modelling System third generation (GIMMS3g) Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data-for African savannahs, over the 1982-2015 period. Two annual metrics were derived from the 34 year dataset: the monthly, smoothed NDVI (the aggregated growth season NDVI) and the associated Rain Use Efficiency (growth season NDVI divided by annual rainfall). These indicators were then used in a BFAST-based change-point analysis, allowing the direction of change over time to change and the detection of one major break in the time-series. We also analysed the role of land cover type and climate zone as associations of the observed changes. Both methods agree that vegetation greening was pervasive across African savannahs, although RUE displayed less significant changes than NDVI. Monotonically increasing trends were the most common trend type for both indicators. The continental scale of the greening may suggest global processes as key drivers, such as carbon fertilization. That NDVI trends were more dynamic than RUE suggests that a large component of vegetation trends is driven by precipitation variability. Areas of negative trends were conspicuous by their minimalism. However, some patterns were apparent. In the southern Sahel and West Africa, declining NDVI and RUE overlapped with intensive population and agricultural regions. Dynamic trend reversals, in RUE and NDVI, located in Angola, Zambia and Tanzania, coincide with areas where a long-term trend of forest degradation and agricultural expansion has recently given way to increases in woody biomass. Meanwhile in southern Africa, monotonic increases in RUE with varying NDVI trend types may be indicative of shrub encroachment. However, all these processes are small-scale relative to the GIMMS NDVI data, and reconciling these conflicting drivers is not a trivial task. Our study highlights the importance of considering multiple options when undertaking trend analyses, as different inputs and methods can reveal divergent patterns.

TI  - Conflict ecology: Examining the strategies and rationales of lobbyists in the mining and energy industries in Australia
T2  - PUBLIC RELATIONS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This article develops a new framework, conflict ecology, for predicting and critiquing specific lobbying strategies. This framework is applied in an analysis of interviews conducted with senior lobbyists from the mining and energy sector in Australia, which has proven to be especially effective in opposing and defeating new taxes and legislation intended to reduce carbon pollution. This analysis shows that an industry suffering a legitimacy gap will likely possess an intransigent or resistant worldview. Practitioners directing these campaigns see their role as ethically justified and necessary to defeat oppositional publics. This worldview gives rise to power strategies that reward allies and punish adversaries, with emotive and targeted issues communication used to apply further pressure to the legislature as part of outsider lobbying campaigns. Ultimately, this study considers the extent to which these lobbying strategies serve communitas ends proposed in the theory of the fully functioning society.

TI  - A Research Framework to Integrate Cross-Ecosystem Responses to Tropical Cyclones
T2  - BIOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclones play an increasingly important role in shaping ecosystems. Understanding and generalizing their responses is challenging because of meteorological variability among storms and its interaction with ecosystems. We present a research framework designed to compare tropical cyclone effects within and across ecosystems that: a) uses a disaggregating approach that measures the responses of individual ecosystem components, b) links the response of ecosystem components at fine temporal scales to meteorology and antecedent conditions, and c) examines responses of ecosystem using a resistance-resilience perspective by quantifying the magnitude of change and recovery time. We demonstrate the utility of the framework using three examples of ecosystem response: gross primary productivity, stream biogeochemical export, and organismal abundances. Finally, we present the case for a network of sentinel sites with consistent monitoring to measure and compare ecosystem responses to cyclones across the United States, which could help improve coastal ecosystem resilience.

TI  - The Surface Expression of Deep Columnar Flows
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of the Earth's secular variation have blossomed in recent decades, due to the availability of brand-new satellite data. In particular, flow inversions at the core surface that incorporate the effects of rapid rotation a priori have been able to provide new insight into flows with time scales as short as a few years. These models have been mostly developed in a cylindrical representation, while core inversion methods are based on a spherical surface representation of the flow. This technical brief links band-limited expressions for the flow coefficients in a cylindrical representation and those in a spherical surface representation and demonstrates that these also remain band limited, with equal degrees of freedom. Correct regularity conditions on the stream function ensure a regular representation of these flows on the spherical surface. A triangular truncation rule for the cylindrical representation that is applicable for "isotropic resolution" is also presented. The equations we derive will be of use in future data-assimilation work employing this cylindrical flow representation and may prove helpful for conventional core-inversion strategies.

TI  - On the Value of Available MODIS and Landsat8 OLI Image Pairs for MODIS Fractional Snow Cover Mapping Based on an Artificial Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates how to select the optimal Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 8 OLI image pairs for MODIS fractional snow cover (FSC) mapping using an artificial neural network (ANN). Four issues are discussed, including date selection, location selection, priority of date and location, and global and regional monitoring of MODIS FSC with ANNs. We propose using the histogram quadratic distance to define the similarity between the ANN training and the target test scene, which was used to quantify the representativeness of the training samples. We use the case study of MODIS FSC mapping of North Xinjiang, China, in the 2014-2015 snow season as an example. Thirty-eight experiments were designed. The experimental results demonstrate that the ANN-based FSC estimation accuracy outperformed the MODIS FSC product, with an average RMSE of 0.17, R exceeds 0.8, and the total snow cover area was estimated more accurately in most cases. For a target test scene, we preliminarily inferred that the best method is to develop an ANN using image pairs of another location with the highest similarity in the same acquisition time, using historical image pairs of the target scene with the highest similarity is the second choice, and using historical image pairs from another location with a high similarity is the third choice. For global- and regional-scale MODIS FSC mapping with ANNs, we formulated the strategy of initially determining a reasonable location and subsequently selecting the acquisition date of the image pairs to guarantee that the training data set represents the entire study area well.

TI  - High Accuracy Geochemical Map Generation Method by a Spatial Autocorrelation-Based Mixture Interpolation Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Generating a high-resolution whole-pixel geochemical contents map from a map with sparse distribution is a regression problem. Currently, multivariate prediction models like machine learning (ML) are constructed to raise the geoscience mapping resolution. Methods coupling the spatial autocorrelation into the ML model have been proposed for raising ML prediction accuracy. Previously proposed methods are needed for complicated modification in ML models. In this research, we propose a new algorithm called spatial autocorrelation-based mixture interpolation (SABAMIN), with which it is easier to merge spatial autocorrelation into a ML model only using a data augmentation strategy. To test the feasibility of this concept, remote sensing data including those from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER), digital elevation model (DEM), and geophysics (geomagnetic) data were used for the feasibility study, along with copper geochemical and copper mine data from Arizona, USA. We explained why spatial information can be coupled into an ML model only by data augmentation, and introduced how to operate data augmentation in our case. Four tests-(i) cross-validation of measured data, (ii) the blind test, (iii) the temporal stability test, and (iv) the predictor importance test-were conducted to evaluate the model. As the results, the model's accuracy was improved compared with a traditional ML model, and the reliability of the algorithm was confirmed. In summary, combining the univariate interpolation method with multivariate prediction with data augmentation proved effective for geological studies.

TI  - Review of Remote Sensing Methods to Map Coffee Production Systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The coffee sector is working towards sector-wide commitments for sustainable production. Yet, knowledge of where coffee is cultivated and its environmental impact remains limited, in part due to the challenges of mapping coffee using satellite remote sensing. We recognize the urgency to capitalize on recent technological advances to improve remote sensing methods and generate more accurate, reliable, and scalable approaches to coffee mapping. In this study, we provide a systematic review of satellite-based approaches to mapping coffee extent, which produced 43 articles in the peer-reviewed and gray literature. We outline key considerations for employing effective approaches, focused on the need to balance data affordability and quality, classification complexity and accuracy, and generalizability and site-specificity. We discuss research opportunities for improved approaches by leveraging the recent expansion of diverse satellite sensors and constellations, optical/Synthetic Aperture Radar data fusion approaches, and advances in cloud computing and deep learning algorithms. We highlight the need for differentiating between production systems and the need for research in important coffee-growing geographies. By reviewing the range of techniques successfully used to map coffee extent, we provide technical recommendations and future directions to enable accurate and scalable coffee maps.

TI  - Analyzing Water Dynamics Based on Sentinel-1 Time Series-a Study for Dongting Lake Wetlands in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In China, freshwater is an increasingly scarce resource and wetlands are under great pressure. This study focuses on China's second largest freshwater lake in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River-the Dongting Lake-and its surrounding wetlands, which are declared a protected Ramsar site. The Dongting Lake area is also a research region of focus within the Sino-European Dragon Programme, aiming for the international collaboration of Earth Observation researchers. ESA's Copernicus Programme enables comprehensive monitoring with area-wide coverage, which is especially advantageous for large wetlands that are difficult to access during floods. The first year completely covered by Sentinel-1 SAR satellite data was 2016, which is used here to focus on Dongting Lake's wetland dynamics. The well-established, threshold-based approach and the high spatio-temporal resolution of Sentinel-1 imagery enabled the generation of monthly surface water maps and the analysis of the inundation frequency at a 10 m resolution. The maximum extent of the Dongting Lake derived from Sentinel-1 occurred in July 2016, at 2465 km(2), indicating an extreme flood year. The minimum size of the lake was detected in October, at 1331 km(2). Time series analysis reveals detailed inundation patterns and small-scale structures within the lake that were not known from previous studies. Sentinel-1 also proves to be capable of mapping the wetland management practices for Dongting Lake polders and dykes. For validation, the lake extent and inundation duration derived from the Sentinel-1 data were compared with excerpts from the Global WaterPack (frequently derived by the German Aerospace Center, DLR), high-resolution optical data, and in situ water level data, which showed very good agreement for the period studied. The mean monthly extent of the lake in 2016 from Sentinel-1 was 1798 km(2), which is consistent with the Global WaterPack, deviating by only 4%. In summary, the presented analysis of the complete annual time series of the Sentinel-1 data provides information on the monthly behavior of water expansion, which is of interest and relevance to local authorities involved in water resource management tasks in the region, as well as to wetland conservationists concerned with the Ramsar site wetlands of Dongting Lake and to local researchers.

TI  - Internal Pathology Review of Invasive Melanoma: An Academic Institution Experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Prior studies of internal pathology review (IPR) for melanoma have shown that changes in the pathology analysis are common. How these changes impact clinical management of melanoma or how the margin status reports may modify has not been evaluated. Our goal was to determine what changes to staging and surgical management occurred after IPR of newly diagnosed melanomas and to determine how the final surgical pathology report may correlate with the IPR.Methods: A retrospective study was conducted from 2014 to 2016 of newly diagnosed invasive melanomas referred to a single National Comprehensive Cancer Network tertiary care center.Results: A total of 370 cases met inclusion criteria. The most common feature changed after internal review was mitotic rate, in 155 (41.7%) patients, followed by Breslow depth in 99 (26.9%) patients. Tumor staging was changed in 45 (12.2%) patients. The most common change was a T1a lesion being upgraded to a T1b lesion. These tumor staging changes lead to 38 (10.3%) overall staging differences. A biopsy's deep margin status was changed in 27 (7.3%) patients. Outside hospital reports lacked information about deep margin status in 71 (19.2%) of specimens. Based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, 22 (5.9%) patients had changes in their sentinel lymph node biopsy recommendations and one of these patients had a positive node found on pathology. Of those patients who had changes in the T-stage, 16 (4.3%) of them also had changes in the recommended wide local excision radial margin.Conclusions: IPR of invasive melanoma leads to both changes in staging and the surgical management of melanoma and should remain an important component of care of melanoma patients at a tertiary referral center.

TI  - A Review of Terrestrial Carbon Assessment Methods Using Geo-Spatial Technologies with Emphasis on Arid Lands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Geo-spatial technologies (i.e., remote sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)) offer the means to enable a rapid assessment of terrestrial carbon stock (CS) over large areas. The utilization of an integrated RS-GIS approach for above ground biomass (AGB) estimation and precision carbon management is a timely and cost-effective solution for implementing appropriate management strategies at a localized and regional scale. The current study reviews various RS-related techniques used in the CS assessment, with emphasis on arid lands, and provides insight into the associated challenges, opportunities and future trends. The study examines the traditional methods and highlights their limitations. It explores recent and developing techniques, and identifies the most significant RS variables in depicting biophysical predictors. It further demonstrates the usefulness of geo-spatial technologies for assessing terrestrial CS, especially in arid lands. RS of vegetation in these ecosystems is constrained by unique challenges specific to their environmental conditions, leading to high inaccuracies when applying biomass estimation techniques developed for other ecosystems. This study reviews and highlights advantages and limitations of the various techniques and sensors, including optical, RADAR and LiDAR, that have been extensively used to estimate AGB and assess CS with RS data. Other new methods are introduced and discussed as well. Finally, the study highpoints the need for further work to fill the gaps and overcome limitations in using these emerging techniques for precision carbon management. Geo-spatial technologies are shown to be a valuable tool for estimating carbon sequestered especially in difficult and remote areas such as arid land.

TI  - Oil seeps detection and mapping by SAR imagery in the Adriatic Sea
T2  - ACTA ADRIATICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides a new perspective on the hydrocarbon seeps in the Adriatic Sea, supporting both the environmental issues and eventual oil and gas exploration. Remote sensing techniques, particularly synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are used to detect oil slicks on the sea surface. In such a way two groups of oil slicks have been detected in the Northern and Central Adriatic Sea on the SAR images acquired by the European Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites in 2017-2018. Analysis of SAR images together with bathymetry, geological and geophysical data in geographic information .system (GIS) have shown that these oil slicks, visible on the sea surface have natural origin, i.e. are seepage phenomena, associated to existing marine hydrocarbon systems. These oil slicks were concentrated over the shallow shelf and repeatedly or episodically occur in the areas of interest, and are related to local oil-and-gas bearing sediments. Findings of the seeps and seep candidates that passed unnoticed from public attention indicate the effectiveness of the approach used. Finally, it is concluded that the frequent SAR imagery is an excellent tool for monitoring of seepage phenomena, and the results indicate that the use of remote sensing methods can be considered as a good approach to support oil and gas exploration in the Adriatic Basin.

TI  - The Influence of Deforestation on Land Surface Temperature-A Case Study of Perak and Kedah, Malaysia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past few decades, there has been a rapid change in forest and land cover, especially in tropical forests due to massive deforestation. The major factor responsible for the changes is to fulfill the growing demand of increasing population through agricultural intensification, rural settlements, and urbanization. Monitoring forest cover and vegetation are essential for detecting regional and global environmental changes. The present study evaluates the influence of deforestation on land surface temperature (LST) in the states of Kedah and Perak, Malaysia, between 1988 and 2017. The trend in forest cover change over the time span of 29 years, was analyzed using Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite images to map the sequence of forest cover change. With the measurement of deforestation and its relationship with LST as an end goal, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to determine forest health, and the spectral radiance model was used to extract the LST. The findings of the study show that nearly 16% (189,423 ha) of forest cover in Perak and more than 9% (33,391 ha) of forest cover in Kedah have disappeared within these 29 years as a result of anthropogenic activities. The correlation between the LST and NDVI is related to the distribution of forests, where LST is inversely related to NDVI. A strong correlation between LST and NDVI was observed in this study, where the average mean of LST in Kedah (25 degrees C) is higher than in Perak (22.6 degrees C). This is also reflected by the decreased NDVI value from 0.6 to 0.5 in 2017 at both states. This demonstrated that a decrease in the vegetation area leads to an increase in the surface temperature. The resultant forest change map would be helpful for forest management in terms of identifying highly vulnerable areas. Moreover, it could help the local government to formulate a land management plan.

TI  - Evaluation of PM2.5 Emissions in Tehran by Means of Remote Sensing and Regression Models
T2  - POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Defined as any substance in the air that may harm humans, animals, vegetation, and materials, air pollution poses a great danger to human health. It has turned into a worldwide problem as well as a huge environmental risk. Recent years have witnessed the increase of air pollution in many cities around the world. Similarly, it has become a big problem in Iran. Although ground-level monitoring can provide accurate PM2.5 measurements, it has limited spatial coverage and resolution. As a result, Satellite Remote Sensing (RS) has emerged as an approach to estimate ground-level ambient air pollution, making it possible to monitor atmospheric particulate matters continuously and have a spatial coverage of them. Recent studies show a high correlation between ground level PM2.5, estimated by RS on the one hand, and measurements, collected at regulatory monitoring sites on the other. As such, the present study addresses the relation between air pollution and satellite images. For so doing, it derives RS estimates, using satellite measurements from Landsat satellite images. Monitoring data is the daily concentration of PM2.5 contaminants, obtained from air pollution stations. The relation between the concentration of pollutants and the values of various bands of Landsat satellite images is examined through 19 regression models. Among them, the Ensembles Bagged Trees has the lowest Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), equal to 21.88. Results show that this model can be used to estimate PM2.5 contaminants, based on Landsat satellite images.

TI  - Using Full and Partial Unmixing Algorithms to Estimate the Inundation Extent of Small, Isolated Stock Ponds in an Arid Landscape
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many natural wetlands around the world have disappeared or been replaced, resulting in the dependence of many wildlife species on small, artificial earthen stock ponds. These ponds provide critical wildlife habitat, such that the accurate detection of water and assessment of inundation extent is required. We applied a full (linear spectral mixture analysis; LSMA) and partial (matched filtering; MF) spectral unmixing algorithm to a 2007 Landsat 5 and a 2014 Landsat 8 satellite image to determine the ability of a time-intensive (i.e., more spectral input; LSMA) vs. a more efficient (less spectral input; MF) spectral unmixing approach to detect and estimate surface water area of stock ponds in southern Arizona, USA and northern Sonora, Mexico. Spearman rank correlations (r(s)) between modeled and actual inundation areas less than a single Landsat pixel (< 900 m(2)) were low for both techniques (r(s)range = 0.22 to 0.62), but improved for inundation areas >900 m(2)(r(s)range = 0.34 to 0.70). Our results demonstrate that the MF approach can model ranked inundation extent of known pond locations with results comparable to or better than LSMA, but further refinement is required for estimating absolute inundation areas and mapping wetlands <1 Landsat pixel.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil moisture retention properties using solely satellite-based data and data mining techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture retention is an important environmental factor that controls water availability in agro-ecosystems. Comprehensive information on spatial distribution and patterns of soil properties controlling moisture retention such as organic carbon (OC), clay content, and saturation percentage (SP) are crucial for effective land management and sustainable development. This study seeks to employ two data mining algorithms named Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP) as predictive models in digital soil mapping (DSM) and quantify the associated uncertainty at a grid resolution of 30 m using satellite-based covariates. For each model, the features selected based on their interior algorithm during the training of the models. The performance and accuracy of MARS and GEP were evaluated through nine statistical/quantitative and graphical criteria, including mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), Root mean squared error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2), relative RMSE (RMSE%), Taylor diagram, scatter, curve fitting, and point density plots. For each model, the prediction maps of soil properties and their associated uncertainty maps were generated. The results revealed that MARS outperformed GEP in providing predictions with superior performance and accuracy. Moreover, MARS performed better in showing the spatial distributions and patterns of all the studied soil properties. In addition, the MARS model produced less prediction uncertainty and can predict soil moisture retention properties more accurately. This study highlights the key role of data mining/numerical modeling algorithms as predictive models in DSM toward the most accurate predictions. Moreover, the study expressed the capabilities of remote sensing derived data in predicting complex soil properties. This study opened a new research line for accurate DSM.

TI  - Urbanization and land use pattern in Arba Minch town, Ethiopia: driving forces and challenges
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the driving forces of urbanization, land use pattern, and its challenges in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia. Mixed research design was employed to generate and analyze data. Four sample kebeles [Mehal Ketema, Dilfana, Bere and Woze] were selected using simple random sampling technique. Stratified proportional sampling technique was used to obtain data from selected kebeles (197 households) through questionnaires. Interviews were made with key informants. Aerial photo, Google Earth Image and Satellite images of LANDSAT (1975, 2000 and 2018) were visualized to quantify land use and land cover [LULC] change and its pattern. Field observation was made to cross-check results from other sources. Data was analyzed using SPSS (23), Erdas Imagine (2014) and ArcGIS (10.3). The study revealed rapid urbanization mainly induced by migration. Physically, Arba Minch has grown from fragmented neighborhoods (since 1950s to mid 1970s) to a conurbated urban fabric in recent years. Built-up area has increased by 780 ha at the expense of agriculture, plantation and mixed forests between 2000 and 2018. Continual land demand for development [road infrastructure, education and tourism] and rural economic transformation ignited rapid urbanization in Arba Minch. The study revealed housing shortage and the proliferation of informal settlements in different pockets of the town and poor vacant land management as challenges. Therefore; Arba Minch municipality and other stake holders should work hand-in-hand to promote sustainable urban development through: optimal vacant land management; monitoring informal settlements; promoting vertical development and preserving the scenic urban fabric.

TI  - Comparative studies on remote sensing techniques for red tide monitoring in Bohai Sea.
T2  - Marine Environmental Science
M3  - Article
AB  - In Bohai Sea, one of the red-tide worst-hit areas of China, the red-tide disasters occurred frequently and aggravated in recent years. Effectively monitoring the processes of the red tide from happening to extinction is of great significance for Bohai Sea. Based on MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) data, five methods including the chlorophyll concentration anomalies, the red tide index, the Rrs band ratio method, the red band difference, the Karenia brevis bloom index have been comparatively analyzed to examine their availability for red tide extraction in Bohai Sea. The results showed that these five methods could effectively extract the red tide information in the offshore area of Tianjin Binhai tourism area. Not only the range but also the spatial distribution of remote sensing detection agreed with the fact. In contrast, the red tide extraction by these five methods indicated a distinct difference in the offshore area of Qinhuangdao area, which was relatively reasonable for the chlorophyll concentration anomalies and the band ratio method. However, no matter what the method was used, the field survey data or ERGB (enhanced red-green-blue) composite was necessarily combined to validate the performance of red tide extraction at different times or in different regions.

TI  - A Modified KNN Method for Mapping the Leaf Area Index in Arid and Semi-Arid Areas of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important vegetation canopy parameter, the leaf area index (LAI) plays a critical role in forest growth modeling and vegetation health assessment. Estimating LAI is helpful for understanding vegetation growth and global ecological processes. Machine learning methods such as k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and random forest (RF) with remote sensing images have been widely used for mapping LAI. However, the accuracy of mapping LAI in arid and semi-arid areas using these methods is limited due to remote and large areas, the high cost of collecting field data, and the great spatial variability of the vegetation canopy. Here, a novel and modified kNN method was presented for mapping LAI in arid and semi-arid areas of China using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images with field data collected in Ganzhou and Kangbao of China. The modified kNN was developed by integrating the traditional kNN estimation and RF classification. The results were compared with those from kNN and RF regression alone using three sets of input predictors: (i) spectral reflectance bands (input 1); (ii) vegetation indices (input 2); and (iii) a combination of spectral reflectance bands and vegetation indices (input 3). Our analysis showed that in Ganzhou, the red-edge bands of the Sentinel-2 image had a high correlation with LAI. Using the red-edge band-derived vegetation indices increased the accuracy of mapping LAI compared with using other spectral variables. Among the three sets of input predictors, input 3 resulted in the highest prediction accuracy. Based on the combination, the values of RMSE obtained by the traditional kNN, RF, and modified kNN were 0.526, 0.523, and 0.372, respectively, and the modified kNN significantly improved the accuracy of LAI prediction by 29.3% and 28.9% compared with the kNN and RF alone, respectively. A similar improvement was achieved for input 1 and input 2. In Kangbao, the improvement of the prediction accuracy obtained by the modified kNN was 31.4% compared with both the kNN and RF. Therefore, this study implied that the modified kNN provided the potential to improve the accuracy of mapping LAI in arid and semi-arid regions using the images.

TI  - Refined UNet: UNet-Based Refinement Network for Cloud and Shadow Precise Segmentation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Formulated as a pixel-level labeling task, data-driven neural segmentation models for cloud and corresponding shadow detection have achieved a promising accomplishment in remote sensing imagery processing. The limited capability of these methods to delineate the boundaries of clouds and shadows, however, is still referred to as a central issue of precise cloud and shadow detection. In this paper, we focus on the issue of rough cloud and shadow location and fine-grained boundary refinement of clouds on the dataset of Landsat8 OLI and therefore propose the Refined UNet to achieve this goal. To this end, a data-driven UNet-based coarse prediction and a fully-connected conditional random field (Dense CRF) are concatenated to achieve precise detection. Specifically, the UNet network with adaptive weights of balancing categories is trained from scratch, which can locate the clouds and cloud shadows roughly, while correspondingly the Dense CRF is employed to refine the cloud boundaries. Eventually, Refined UNet can give cloud and shadow proposals sharper and more precisely. The experiments and results illustrate that our model can propose sharper and more precise cloud and shadow segmentation proposals than the ground truths do. Additionally, evaluations on the Landsat 8 OLI imagery dataset of Blue, Green, Red, and NIR bands illustrate that our model can be applied to feasibly segment clouds and shadows on the four-band imagery data.

TI  - Comparison of clinical outcomes between sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection in a single-center Z0011-eligible breast cancer cohort.
T2  - Korean journal of clinical oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Purpose: The ACOSOG Z0011 trial has proven the oncological safety of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLBx) for node negative breast cancer. Accordingly, treatment paradigm including axilla surgery was changed. We retrospectively reviewed breast cancer patients to evaluate the clinical effect of paradigm shift in breast cancer surgery after applying the Z0011 criteria.Methods: All women who underwent breast-conserving surgery at the National Cancer Center between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2015, were enrolled and classified according to the Z0011 criteria. The primary endpoint of the study was the disease-free survival rates, and the secondary was the adverse events, especially arm lymphedema.Results: Total 361 patients were enrolled the study (271 axillary lymph node dissection [ALND] group, 90 SLBx group). After the Z0011 guideline was adopted in our institute, the use of ALND decreased, and lymph node sampling (removing only a few axillary lymph nodes) replaced ALND. The total mean number of retrieved nodes were more in ALND group (13.02) than SLBx group (3.43). However, there was no difference in the mean number of positive nodes between two groups (2.34 in ALND group vs. 1.12 in SLBx group, P=0.001). During follow-up, 25 patients experienced disease recurrence: 22 from the ALND group and three from the SLBx group. All of died seven patients were from the ALND group. The ALND group had more complications than the SLBx group (P=0.02). Arm edema occurred more frequently in the ALND group (29.5%) than in the SLBx group (5.6%), although without statistical significance (P=0.07).Conclusion: In our study, we concluded that SLBx can be used safely in Z0011-eligible cohort without increased risk of locoregional recurrence. Moreover, we found that omission of ALND is favored to reduce some serious complications such as arm lymphedema.

TI  - Dosimetric comparison of incidental axillary irradiation between three-dimensional conformal and volumetric modulated arc techniques for breast cancer
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiotherapy techniques for breast cancer have evolved with efforts to reduce treatment-related side effects. In the present study, we conducted dosimetric analysis of incidental axillary irradiation between volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). A total of 20 patients with early stage left breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy were analyzed. For VMAT plans, dose-volume constraints were not imposed on the axilla, as with 3D-CRT. We compared the dosimetric parameters of the planning target volumes, organs at risk and axillary level I-III of the two plans. VMAT showed better target coverage and a normal organ-sparing effect compared with 3D-CRT. The incidental axillary irradiation of VMAT was lower; the mean dose and the V40(Gy) were significantly reduced at all axillary levels, with the exception of no difference in the maximum dose to axillary level I. In conclusion, VMAT decreased incidental axillary irradiation, even in the absence of a dose-volume constraint on the axilla, and can, therefore, decrease the risk of radiotherapy-related lymphedema. However, caution is also required because it is unclear whether this incidental axillary irradiation is beneficial for reducing recurrence on the axilla.

TI  - Field-Validated Detection of <i>Aureoumbra lagunensis</i> Brown Tide Blooms in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, Using Sentinel-3A OLCI and Ground-Based Hyperspectral Spectroradiometers
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent Aureoumbra lagunensis blooms in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida, have devastated populations of seagrass and marine life and threaten public health. To substantiate a more reliable remote sensing early-warning system for harmful algal blooms, we apply varimax-rotated principal component analysis (VPCA) to 12 images spanning similar to 1.5 years. The method partitions visible-NIR spectra into independent components related to algae, cyanobacteria, suspended minerals, and pigment degradation products. The components extracted by VPCA are diagnostic for identifiable optical constituents, providing greater specificity in the resulting data products. We show that VPCA components retrieved from Sentinel-3A Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and a field-based spectroradiometer are consistent despite vast differences in spatial resolution (similar to 50 cm vs. 300 m). Furthermore, the VPCA components associated with A . lagunensis in both spectral datasets indicate high correlations to Ochrophyta cell counts (R-2 >= 0.92, p < 0.001). Recombining components exhibiting a red-edge response produces a Chl a algorithm that outperforms empirical band ratio algorithms and preforms as well or better than a variety of semianalytical algorithms. The results from the VPCA spectral decomposition method are more efficient than traditional Empirical Orthogonal Function or PCA, requiring fewer components to explain as much or more variance. Overall, our observations provide excellent validation for Sentinel-3A OLCI-based VPCA spectral identification and indicate A . lagunensis was highly concentrated within the Banana River region of the IRL during the study. These results enable improved brown tide monitoring to identify blooms at an early stage, allowing more time for stakeholder response to this public health problem.Plain Language Summary Toxic or nuisance blooms of microscopic plankton are causing environmental, economic, and public health problems in Indian River Lagoon, Florida, and other coastal waters. Monitoring from boats can be expensive compared to remote sensing methods, but the remote sensing signal must be validated. Here we present results that document that the brown tide that develops in the Indian River Lagoon can be identified with very little error using different types of supporting data sets. These results enable improved brown tide monitoring to identify blooms at an early stage, allowing more time for stakeholder response to this public health problem.

T2  - NEURO-ONCOLOGY PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. In recent years an increasing number of patients with cerebral metastasis (CM) have been referred to the neuro-oncology multidisciplinary team (NMDT). Our aim was to obtain a national picture of CM referrals to assess referral volume and quality and factors affecting NMDT decision making.Methods. A prospective multicenter cohort study including all adult patients referred to NMDT with 1 or more CM was conducted. Data were collected in neurosurgical units from November 2017 to February 2018. Demographics, primary disease, KPS, imaging, and treatment recommendation were entered into an online database.Results. A total of 1048 patients were analyzed from 24 neurosurgical units. Median age was 65 years (range, 21-93 years) with a median number of 3 referrals (range, 1-17 referrals) per NMDT. The most common primary malignancies were lung (36.5%, n = 383), breast (18.4%, n = 193), and melanoma (12.0%, n = 126). A total of 51.6% (n = 541) of the referrals were for a solitary metastasis and resulted in specialist intervention being offered in 67.5% (n = 365) of cases. A total of 38.2% (n = 186) of patients being referred with multiple CMs were offered specialist treatment. NMDT decision making was associated with number of CMs, age, KPS, primary disease status, and extent of extracranial disease (univariate logistic regression, P < .001) as well as sentinel location and tumor histology (P < .05). A delay in reaching an NMDT decision was identified in 18.6% (n = 195) of cases.Conclusions. This study demonstrates a changing landscape of metastasis management in the United Kingdom and Ireland, including a trend away from adjuvant whole-brain radiotherapy and specialist intervention being offered to a significant proportion of patients with multiple CMs. Poor quality or incomplete referrals cause delay in NMDT decision making.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid prescribing guidelines for partial mastectomy (PM) and PM with sentinel lymph node biopsy (PM-SLNB) recommend prescribing anywhere from 0 to 15 oxycodone pills for postoperative pain. We sought to eliminate opioids after breast-conserving surgery.STUDY DESIGN: In January 2017, we implemented a perioperative pathway in which patients received (1) pre-operative acetaminophen, (2) pre-incisional bupivacaine skin infiltration, (3) post-excision bupivacaine wound deposition, (4) intraoperative ketorolac, (5) instructions to use both acetaminophen and ibuprofen for postoperative analgesia, and (6) counseling to set the expectation that opioids would not be required. We measured the percentage of patients who received, filled, and used opioid prescriptions. We compared this to historical institutional data from 2016.RESULTS: There were 226 patients (mean age: 62 +/- 13 years) who underwent surgery: 50% (114 of 226) underwent PM alone and 50% (112 of 226) PM-SLNB. Twenty-four patients (11%) required opioids in the recovery unit, and 14 (6%) were discharged home with a prescription. Five of the 14 patients (36%) did not fill their prescription. Among the patients who did fill their prescription, only 1 patient used opioids. In addition, 2 (1%) patients had difficulty managing their postoperative pain and were prescribed opioids within 7 days of surgery. Ultimately, 99% (223 of 226) of patients managed their postoperative pain after discharge without opioids. This represents a significant decrease in opioid use after breast conserving surgery, from 40% in 2016 to 1% after pathway implementation, p < 0.001.CONCLUSIONS: When a multimodal nonopioid pain pathway was implemented, 99% of patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery did not require opioids after discharge.

TI  - Role of Transformative Learning in Developing Global Mindedness in an EFL Literature Studies Context
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIA TEFL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purposes of this research were to examine the role of transformative learning on the development of the global mindedness of university students in an English as a foreign language literature studies context and to explore student attitudes towards their transformative learning experiences. Participants included 25 second-year English major students who were enrolled in the Introduction to Literature Course in the first semester of the academic year 2018 at a university in Thailand. The instruments used for this study were six lesson plans using transformative learning theory, a global mindedness scale, a reflective writing activity, semi-structured interview questions, and a classroom observation schedule. The t-test, the mean and standard deviation calculations including content analysis were used for data analysis. The findings revealed that the transformative learning experiences had a significant role in improving student global mindedness in the literature studies class via a process of worldview changing; an acknowledgement of differences of ideas, culture, and race; and a disorienting dilemma. The students also expressed positive attitudes towards their transformative learning experiences in the literature studies class.

TI  - Estimating Yields of Household Fields in Rural Subsistence Farming Systems to Study Food Security in Burkina Faso
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has an increasing impact on food security and child nutrition, particularly among rural smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Their limited resources and rainfall dependent farming practices make them sensitive to climate change-related effects. Data and research linking yield, human health, and nutrition are scarce but can provide a basis for adaptation and risk management strategies. In support of studies on child undernutrition in Burkina Faso, this study analyzed the potential of remote sensing-based yield estimates at household level. Multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data from the growing season 2018 were used to model yield of household fields (median 1.4 hectares (ha), min 0.01 ha, max 12.6 ha) for the five most prominent crops in the Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance (HDSS) area in Burkina Faso. Based on monthly metrics of vegetation indices (VIs) and in-situ harvest measurements from an extensive field survey, yield prediction models for different crops of high dietary importance (millet, sorghum, maize, and beans) were successfully generated producing R-2 between 0.4 and 0.54 (adj. R-2 between 0.32 and 0.5). The models were spatially applied and resulted in a yield estimation map at household level, enabling predictions of up to 2 months prior to harvest. The map links yield on a 10-m spatial resolution to households and consequently can display potential food insecurity. The results highlight the potential for satellite imagery to provide yield predictions of smallholder fields and are discussed in the context of health-related studies such as child undernutrition and food security in rural Africa under climate change.

TI  - A remote sensing approach to monitor potential fishing zone associated with sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - India is the biggest seafood producing country in the world, and its economy relies, to a large extent, on fish production. Recent technologies in the remote sensing field enabled the gathering of information about the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll Concentration (CC) are used for analyzing the Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ). We used Landsat 8 images to create the base map of the Thoothukudi coastline. MODIS-AQUA satellite data were used to derive the SST and Chlorophyll -a for the Thoothukudi coast (Bay of Bengal) for the years 2013 to 2017, for the month of June. PFZ was classified into three classes: High PFZ, Medium PFZ, and Low PFZ. Results shows 2015 has highest PFZ found in the region of Sippikulam and Vembar. During 2016, PFZ identified at Kayalpattinam, Tiruchendur, and Manapad regions. The PFZ level was low during 2017 compared to the previous years. The PFZ has increased in the international maritime boundary line, which forced the fishermen to cross the territorial boundary. This study provides valuable information about fish catching areas to the fishermen and local populations, by reducing fish search time by 30 to 70 %, and consequently the fuel cost and human efforts. Additionally, also reduces the need of crossing the international maritime boundary line.

TI  - I Don't Believe in Miracles: Using the Ecological Validity Model to Adapt the Miracle Question to Match the Client's Cultural Preferences and Characteristics
T2  - PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY-RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Miracle Question (MQ) is a characteristic feature of solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT). However, there are times when the terminology of the Miracle Question may not fit the worldview of the client. The main objective of this article is to systematically review the various ways the MQ was adapted and the process of adaptation followed by therapists. The systematic review yielded 24 articles that showed the various ways of adapting the MQ substituting "miracle" with following words/phrases: a fresh start, dreams, at your best, harmony with people and life, click your fingers, something big is possible, and on track. The review highlighted a gap that many therapists did not follow a framework when adapting the MQ. Moreover, the review suggests the use of an expanded cultural adaptation framework based on the Ecological Validity Model, Hofstede's cultural dimensions of national culture and a client's time orientation provides clinical guidelines to help therapists' adapt MQ and more broadly any intervention to match the client's cultural preferences, values and beliefs. The framework includes the following cultural dimensions for consideration when adapting an intervention: (a) cultural sayings/symbols; (b) cultural customs/traditions/values; (c) cultural definitions of success in developing goals; (d) where a client lies on the collectivist-individualist continuum; (e) the importance of the role of hierarchy/authority and spirituality; and (f) a client's time orientation. Finally, an example of an adaptation of the MQ, the Bounce Back Question was provided for therapists to demonstrate the process of how the adaptation could occur using these clinical guidelines.

TI  - Which heterogeneous glacier melting patterns can be robustly observed from space? A multi-scale assessment in southeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Region-wide investigation of glacier change in High Mountain Asia marked the strongest recession in southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP) in recent decades. However, evident differences of quantitative glacier mass balance (MB) estimations on fine scales exist in the prior reports. The large uncertainties in current geodetic observations over this region highlight the need for more independent validations and investigations on the spatial variability of glacier change. This study enriched glacier MB estimates over the SETP by using the newly released global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) - the TanDEM-X and analyzed the spatial pattern of glacier change on multi-spatial scales by comparing available satellite-based geodetic observations. Results reveal that the TanDEM-X - SRTM elevation differences, which show no obvious horizontal shifts and no significant elevation-dependent bias, provide reliable elevation change information over this challenging area. On the regional scale, the geodetic datasets (the ASTER elevation change rates data, TanDEM-X- SRTM differences, ICESat) achieved a highly consistent estimate of glacier MB at -4.11 +/- 1.52 Gt a(-1) (-0.60 +/- 0.16 m w.e. a(-1)) during 2000 and 2010s. On the subregional scale, the two gridded geodetic datasets revealed a clear contrast between moderate thinning of spring-accumulation type glaciers in the south and significantly more negative glacier MB of summer-accumulation type glaciers in the north. Glacier-wide MB showed high heterogeneity, which was closely related to the combined effect of topographic variation and climate forcings. We observed similar glacier thinning rates between debris-covered land-terminating glaciers and clean-ice glaciers (-0.50 +/- 0.32 m w.e. a(-1)) but remarkable more negative MB (-0.89 +/- 0.36 m w.e. a(-1)) of debris-covered glaciers connected with glacial lakes, which may indicate different evolution process of debris-covered glaciers in the monsoon-influenced region. This study demonstrates that current satellite-based geodetic observations achieve overall consistent patterns of glacier mass changes even over the most challenging mountainous areas (complicated terrain and climate). With the global TanDEM-X DEM and increasing observations from the mission, we expect improved consistency in glacier MB estimation on large spatial scales as well as detailed investigation of glacier mass change variability in the future.

TI  - Assessment of the Characteristics of Recent Major Wildfires in the USA, Australia and Brazil in 2018-2019 Using Multi-Source Satellite Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analysed the characteristics of the recent (2018-2019) wildfires that occurred in the USA, Brazil, and Australia using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fires (AF), fire radiative power (FRP, MW) and burned area (BA) products. Meteorological and environmental parameters were also analysed. The study found various patterns in the spatial distribution of fires, FRP and BA at the three sites, associated with various vegetation compositions, prevailing meteorological and environmental conditions and anthropogenic activities. We found significant fire clusters along the western and eastern coasts of the USA and Australia, respectively, while vastly distributed clusters were found in Brazil. Across all sites, significant fire intensity was recorded over forest cover (FC) and shrublands (SL), attributed to highly combustible tree crown fuel load characterised by leafy canopies and thin branches. In agreement, BA over FC was the highest in the USA and Australia, while Brazil was dominated by the burning of SL, characteristic of fire-tolerant Cerrado. The relatively lower BA over FC in Brazil can be attributed to fuel availability and proximity to highly flammable cover types such as cropland, SL and grasslands rather than fuel flammability. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of wildfires in various regions and the underlying environmental and meteorological causal factors, towards better wildfire disaster management strategies and habitat-specific firefighting.

T2  - RESEARCH IN MARINE SCIENCES

AB  - Remote sensing is typically the most efficient and cost-effective method to measure chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). This study was designed to perform remote sensing of Chl-a in Chabahar Bay, located in the northern part of the Gulf of Oman, Iran, based on the light absorption coefficient of phytoplankton. Surface water has been sampled at six stations in Chabahar Bay during 2013-2015. Chl-a was extracted by acetone (90%) and the absorption (750, 664, and 630 nm) was read using the spectrophotometry method. These values were compared with data acquired by the Landsat 8 satellite to estimate the concentration of Chl-a. The results showed that Chl-a concentration was at the range of 5 to 30 mg/m(3) and a positive correlation was found between the field data and satellite prediction algorithms. Generally, this study showed that Landsat satellite data can provide useful information on the spatio-temporal variations in Chabahar Bay and establish general trends that are difficult to be determined through routine ground measurements.

TI  - The Language Personality of an Elderly Person through the Prism of Interference (On the Example of a Siberian Czech Dialect Speaker)
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The research was conducted within the framework of the actively developing area of linguistics-linguopersonology. It is devoted to the phenomenon of the bilingual language personality of an elderly person (born in 1938) based in the polyethnic Middle Irtysh region. The basic concepts of the study include language contacts, bilingualism, and interference. Its aim is to investigate relevant features of a bilingual language personality, in particular, factors influencing the processes of interference in speech, as well as the axiological component of the "linguopersoneme". The research is based on the "live" speech recordings of ethnic Czechs made during the dialectological expeditions with the author's participation in 2000, 2004, and 2012. The analyzed material includes over 9,000 words (incl. 5000 words from the ninety-minute audio recordings of 2004 and 2012). The analysis shows that the informant inherited certain linguistic features from Siberian Czechs-speakers of the Middle Irtysh Czech dialect, which is his "family" language as well as the language of communication with his fellow villagers-ethnic Czechs. At the phonetic level, the features include the distant metathesis of liquid consonants. At the semantic-syntactic level, the features are the Czech speech system (sentences with generalized and personal semantics, etc.); the worldview characteristic of this dialect is also present. Recordings from different years show dynamic changes in the respondent's speech as a result of interlingual (closely related Czech and Russian languages) and interdialectal (surrounding Ukrainian, Russian old- and new-settlers', German, Estonian dialects) contacts. Interference shows in the acquisition of such phonetic features as akanye and ikanye, in the use of contracted forms of adjectives (typical of Russian old-settlers' dialects); lexical and semantic adaptation. The informant's bilingual thinking reflects common features of the old generation of bilingual Czechs in the Omsk Irtysh region. They include the preservation of cultural traditions (wedding ritual), nostalgic memories of the past (through the prism of "now and before"), actualization of basic values: work, life, family, education. Individual features of the bilingual informant include interest in the history of his family in connection with the history of the village as a whole, interest in the history of Czechs in Siberia; a high degree of linguistic reflection (through the opposition "us"- them"), expression of personal evaluation of linguistic phenomena. The language personality is a native speaker of the Russian-Czech dialect and a bilingual personality ("switching registers" depending on the addressee) formed under the influence of both linguistic (native dialect, trends in the development of the Russian language, the surrounding Ukrainian dialects, Russian Siberian old- and new-settlers' dialects) and extralinguistic (sociocultural, historical and cultural) factors.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard axillary procedure in early breast cancer patients. In a randomized trial, the survival rates were not different when axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was omitted in patients with 1 or 2 lymph node metastases who underwent breast conserving surgery. This study aimed to compare the outcomes in patients who underwent total mastectomy (TM) with 1 or 2 metastatic nodes according to the types of axillary surgery.Methods: In total, 79,058 patients registered in the Korean Breast Cancer Society database who underwent TM were included in the analysis. The inclusion criteria were history of TM and SLNB, pathologic T stage 1 or 2, clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, 1 or 2 metastatic axillary lymph nodes, no radiation therapy, and no neoadjuvant therapy. We divided the patients into the SLNB only and SLNB + ALND groups. The groups were matched by propensity scores. We retrospectively analyzed the differences in the overall survival (OS) between the 2 groups.Results: A total of 883 patients were matched in a 1:4 ratio for the SLNB only and SLNB + ALND groups in the cohort from 1999 to 2014. There were no significant differences in OS between the 2 groups (P = 0.413). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant survival benefit in the SLNB + ALND group in the T2 subgroup (P = 0.013).Conclusion: OS did not differ between the 2 groups in early breast cancer patients with 1 or 2 metastatic axillary lymph nodes who underwent TM. Omission of ALND may be considered in selected patients.

TI  - Object-based landfast sea ice detection over West Antarctica using time series ALOS PALSAR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landfast sea ice (fast ice) is an important feature prevalent around the Antarctic coast, which is affected by climate change and energy exchanges with the atmosphere and ocean. This study proposed a method for detection of the West Antarctic fast ice using the Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array L-band SAR (ALOS PALSAR) images. The algorithm has combined image segmentation, image correlation analysis, and machine learning techniques (i.e., random forest (RF), extremely randomized trees (ERT), and logistic regression (LR)). We used SAR images with a baseline of 5 days that are not in the same orbit but overlap each other as overlaps between swaths in adjacent orbits are often available in the polar regions. The underlying assumption for the proposed fast ice detection algorithm is that fast ice regions in SAR images with a time interval of 5 days are highly correlated. The object-based approach proposed in this study was well suited to high-resolution SAR images in deriving spatially homogeneous fast ice regions. The image segmentation results using the optimized parameters showed a distinct difference in the backscatter temporal evolution between fast ice and pack ice regions. Correlation and STD of backscattering coefficients were found to be the most significant variables for the object-based fast ice detection from two temporally separated images. In overall, the quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrated that the algorithm was an effective approach to detect fast ice with high accuracies. The models well detected various fast ice regions in the West Antarctica but misclassified some objects. The misclassifications occurred toward the edge of fast ice regions with relatively rapid changes in backscattering between both data acquisitions. On the other hand, few fast ice objects were misclassified as uniform backscattering over time occurred by chance on very small objects far from the coast. Very old multi-year fast ice regions with high backscattered signals were also a source for some misclassifications. This may be due to the sensitivity of L-band to snow structure to some extent and a thinner ice over the region with either ice growth (no deformation) or closing (slight deformation) between both images. Heavy snow load on the ice could be another error source for some misclassification as well. The approach allowed for the reliable detection of fast ice regions by using L-band SAR images with a small local incidence angle difference.

TI  - Retrieval of Land Surface Temperature Using Landsat 8 Images with Deep Neural Networks
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a viable option for retrieval of LST (Land Surface Temperature), this paper presents a DNN (Deep Neural Network) based approach using 148 Landsat 8 images for South Korea. Because the brightness temperature and emissivity for the band 10 (approx. 11-mu m wavelength) of Landsat 8 are derived by combining physics-based equations and empirical coefficients, they include uncertainties according to regional conditions such as meteorology, climate, topography, and vegetation. To overcome this, we used several land surface variables such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), land cover types, topographic factors (elevation, slope, aspect, and ruggedness) as well as the T-0 calculated from the brightness temperature and emissivity. We optimized four seasonal DNN models using the input variables and in-situ observations from ASOS (Automated Synoptic Observing System) to retrieve the LST, which is an advanced approach when compared with the existing method of the bias correction using a linear equation. The validation statistics from the 1,728 matchups during 2013-2019 showed a good performance of the CC=0.910 similar to 0.917 and RMSE=3.245 similar to 3.365 degrees C, especially for spring and fall. Also, our DNN models produced a stable LST for all types of land cover. A future work using big data from Landsat 5/7/8 with additional land surface variables will be necessary for a more reliable retrieval of LST for high-resolution satellite images.

TI  - Novel Air Temperature Measurement Using Midwave Hyperspectral Fourier Transform Infrared Imaging in the Carbon Dioxide Absorption Band
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate visualization of air temperature distribution can be useful for various thermal analyses in fields such as human health and heat transfer of local area. This paper presents a novel approach to measuring air temperature from midwave hyperspectral Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging in the carbon dioxide absorption band (between 4.25-4.35 mu m). In this study, the proposed visual air temperature (VisualAT) measurement is based on the observation that the carbon dioxide band shows zero transmissivity at short distances. Based on analysis of the radiative transfer equation in this band, only the path radiance by air temperature survives. Brightness temperature of the received radiance can provide the raw air temperature and spectral average, followed by a spatial median-mean filter that can produce final air temperature images. Experiment results tested on a database obtained by a midwave extended FTIR system (Telops, Quebec City, QC, Canada) from February to July 2018 show a mean absolute error of 1.25 degrees K for temperature range of 2.6-26.4 degrees C.

TI  - Rapid Change Detection of Flood Affected Area after Collapse of the Laos Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Dam Using Sentinel-1 GRD Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water-related disasters occur frequently worldwide and are strongly affected by a climate. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images can be effectively used to monitor and detect damage because these images are minimally affected by weather. This study analyzed changes in water quantity and flooded area caused by the collapse of the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Dam in Laos on 23 July 2018, using Sentinel-1 ground range detected (GRD) images. The collapse of this dam gained worldwide attention and led to a large number of casualties at least 98 people, as well as enormous economic losses. Thus, it is worth noting that this study quantitatively analyzed changes in both the Hinlat area, which was flooded, and the Xe-Namnoy reservoir. This study aims to suggest a practical method of change detection which is to simply compute flood extent and water volume in rapidly analysis. At first, a alpha-stable distribution was fitted to intensity histogram for removing the non-water-affected pixels. This fitting differs from other typical histogram fitting methods, which is applicable to histograms with two peaks, as it can be applied to histograms with not only two peaks but also one peak. Next, another type of threshold based on digital elevation model (DEM) data was used to correct for residual noise, such as speckle noise. The results revealed that about 2.2 x 10(8) m(3) water overflowed from the Xe-Namnoy reservoir, and a flooded area of about 28.1 km(3) was detected in the Hinlat area shortly after the dam collapse. Furthermore, the water quantity and flooded area decreased in both study areas over time. Because only SAR GRD images were used in this study for rapid change detection, it is possible that more accurate results could be obtained using other available data, such as optical images with high spatial resolution like KOMPSAT-3, and in-situ data collected at the same time.

TI  - Merkel Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck Compared to Other Anatomical Sites in a Real-World Setting: Importance of Surgical Therapy for Facial Tumors
T2  - FACIAL PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine skin tumor with a high propensity for nodal involvement, local recurrence, and distant metastases. Up to 50% of MCC arises on head and neck (HN), which may impede oncological treatment due to insufficiently wide excisions and a lower rate of sentinel lymph node detection due to more complicated lymph drainage. Several studies have compared the clinical outcome of HN-MCC with those of non-head and neck (NHN) MCC yielding inconsistent results. This single-center, retrospective analysis compared the clinical outcome of 26 HN-MCC patients with 30 NHN-MCC patients. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method assuming proportional hazards. The mean resection margins were 1.6 and 2.0 cm for the HN and NHN cohort, respectively. Local relapses were more frequently observed in patients with HN-MCC (19 vs. 10%). Patients with HN-MCC had a median OS of 4.3 years compared with 7.5 years in patients with NHN-MCC (p = 0.277). The median OS by tumor stage was 11, 3, 2, and 3 years in stage I, II, III, and IV disease, respectively (p = 0.009). The median DFS in HN-MCC was 10 years and not reached in the cohort with NHN-MCC patients (p = 0.939). Our data suggest a trend toward poorer outcomes of HN-MCC compared with NHN-MCC. Patients with MCC on the head and neck carry a higher risk for local relapse, requiring resolute surgical treatment also in facial localizations at early stages.

TI  - Micrometastases in Sentinel Lymph Nodes Represent a Significant Negative Prognostic Factor in Early-Stage Cervical Cancer: A Single-Institutional Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The data on the prognostic significance of low volume metastases in lymph nodes (LN) are inconsistent. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the outcome of a large group of patients treated with sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy at a single referral center. Patients with cervical cancer, stage T1a-T2b, common tumor types, negative LN on preoperative staging, treated by primary surgery between 01/2007 and 12/2016, with at least unilateral SLN detection were included. Patients with abandoned radical surgery due to intraoperative SLN positivity detected by frozen section were excluded. All SLNs were postoperatively processed by an intensive protocol for pathological ultrastaging. Altogether, 226 patients were analyzed. Positive LN were detected in 38 (17%) cases; macrometastases (MAC), micrometastases (MIC), isolated tumor cells (ITC) in 14, 16, and 8 patients. With the median follow-up of 65 months, 22 recurrences occurred. Disease-free survival (DFS) reached 90% in the whole group, 93% in LN-negative cases, 89% in cases with MAC, 69% with MIC, and 87% with ITC. The presence of MIC in SLN was associated with significantly decreased DFS and OS. Patients with MIC and MAC should be managed similarly, and SLN ultrastaging should become an integral part of the management of patients with early-stage cervical cancer.

TI  - Chyle leakage after axillary node sampling in a patient with breast cancer: a case report
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Chyle leakage is a well-known complication after thoracic surgery, such as esophagectomy, cardiac surgery, mediastinal lymph node dissection, and neck surgery. However, chyle leakage is a rare complication after dissections of the lateral or subclavian axillary nodes for breast surgery. It is particularly unusual for chyle leakage to occur after minimally invasive dissection of the axillary nodes. Most cases of chyle leakage subside with conservative management, but some cases require surgery. Case report An 80-year-old woman had invasive lobular cancer of the left breast (cT1 [1.7 cm], cN0, M0) for which she underwent breast-conservative surgery and biopsy of an axillary sentinel lymph node. Because two of the three sentinel lymph nodes tested positive for cancer, seven lateral axillary lymph nodes (level I) were subsequently removed for the additional sampling. On postoperative day 11, the patient visited our outpatient clinic because of swelling in her left axillary region and breast. Centesis of the axilla yielded 670 mL of milky fluid, which suggested chyle leakage. We commenced the conservative management at first; however, the persistent leakage made us perform the surgical management. The operation was not only ligating the opening of the chyle duct but needed total mastectomy because the postoperative pathology report showed invasive lobular carcinoma; the nipple and the caudal surgical margin of the lumpectomy were positive for cancer. The patient agreed to our recommendation of total mastectomy and surgical management of the chyle leakage. Ligation of the opening completely resolved the chylous discharge. Conclusion We here report a case of large-volume leakage of chyle after sampling dissection of the lateral axillary lymph nodes for left breast cancer; the leakage persisted despite the standard conservative therapy but was resolved after surgical treatment. Chyle leakage can occur even after minimally invasive dissection of the axillary nodes.

TI  - Assimilation of SAR Ice and Open Water Retrievals in Environment and Climate Change Canada Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we evaluate the impact of assimilating spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in an Arctic regional ice analysis system over a year cycle. Ice and water information was automatically extracted from more than 7000 RADARSAT-2 HH-HV ScanSAR Wide images acquired over the Canadian Arctic and adjacent waters throughout the entire year 2013. A quality-control procedure was specifically developed and applied to reduce the number of erroneous SAR retrievals. To assess the impact of SAR ice and water retrievals on the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS) ice concentration analyses, we designed a set of data assimilation experiments with and without the inclusion of SAR retrievals. Our verification results suggest that the assimilation of SAR-derived retrievals considerably improves ice concentration analyses in the situations where high spatial resolution is important (e.g., near land and over small inland lakes). Furthermore, SAR retrievals are particularly useful over the areas where the Canadian Ice Service & x2019;s (CIS) manually derived ice products (such as Image Analyses, daily and weekly ice charts) are not available or have limited coverage. The three-satellite RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) launched in June 2019 will significantly increase the temporal frequency of SAR data. According to the most recent CIS estimate, more than 54 000 RCM images a year will be acquired over the CIS areas of interest. Therefore, the assimilation of SAR retrievals from RCM should further enhance automated ice concentration analyses products.

TI  - A quantitative framework for analysing long term spatial clustering and vegetation fragmentation in an urban landscape using multi-temporal landsat data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization threatens urban green spaces and vegetation, demonstrated by a decrease in connectivity and higher levels of fragmentation. Understanding historic spatial and temporal patterns of such fragmentation is important for habitat and biological conservation, ecosystem management and urban planning. Despite their potential value, Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) measures have not been sufficiently exploited in monitoring the spatial and temporal variability in clustering and fragmentation of vegetation patterns in urban areas. LISA statistics are an important structural measure that indicates the presence of outliers, zones of similarity (hot spots) and of dissimilarity (cold spots) at proximate locations, hence they could be used to explicitly capture spatial patterns that are clustered, dispersed or random. In this study, we applied landscape metrics, LISA indices to analyse the temporal variability in clustering and fragmentation patterns of vegetation patches in Harare metropolitan city, Zimbabwe using Landsat series data for 1994, 2001 and 2017. Analysis of landscape metrics showed an increase in the fragmentation of vegetation patches between 1994-2017 as shown by the decrease in mean patch size, an increase in number of patches, edge density and shape complexity of vegetation patches. The study further demonstrates the utility of LISA indices in identifying key hot spot and cold spots. Comparatively, the highly vegetated northern parts of the city were characterised by significantly high positive spatial autocorrelation (p < 0.05) of vegetation patches. Conversely, more dispersed vegetation patches were found in the highly and densely urbanized western, eastern and southern parts of the city. This suggest that with increasing vegetation fragmentation, small and isolated vegetation patches do not spatially cluster but are dispersed geographically. The findings of the study underline the potential of LISA measures as a valuable spatially explicit method for the assessment of spatial clustering and fragmentation of urban vegetation patterns.

TI  - Fine-Tuning Self-Organizing Maps for Sentinel-2 Imagery: Separating Clouds from Bright Surfaces
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Removal of cloud interference is a crucial step for the exploitation of the spectral information stored in optical satellite images. Several cloud masking approaches have been developed through time, based on direct interpretation of the spectral and temporal properties of clouds through thresholds. The problem has also been tackled by machine learning methods with artificial neural networks being among the most recent ones. Detection of bright non-cloud objects is one of the most difficult tasks in cloud masking applications since spectral information alone often proves inadequate for their separation from clouds. Scientific attention has recently been redrawn on self-organizing maps (SOMs) because of their unique ability to preserve topologic relations, added to the advantage of faster training time and more interpretative behavior compared to other types of artificial neural networks. This study evaluated a SOM for cloud masking Sentinel-2 images and proposed a fine-tuning methodology to separate clouds from bright land areas. The fine-tuning process which is based on the output of the non-fine-tuned network, at first directly locates the neurons that correspond to the misclassified pixels. Then, the incorrect labels of the neurons are altered without applying further training. The fine-tuning method follows a general procedure, thus its applicability is broad and not confined only in the field of cloud-masking. The network was trained on the largest publicly available spectral database for Sentinel-2 cloud masking applications and was tested on a truly independent database of Sentinel-2 cloud masks. It was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively with the interpretation of its behavior through multiple visualization techniques being a main part of the evaluation. It was shown that the fine-tuned SOM successfully recognized the bright non-cloud areas and outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms: Sen2Cor and Fmask, as well as the version that was not fine-tuned.

TI  - Investigating the Patterns and Dynamics of Urban Green Space in China's 70 Major Cities Using Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green space (UGS) plays a pivotal role in improving urban ecosystem services and building a livable environment for urban dwellers. However, remotely sensed investigation of UGS at city scale is facing a challenge due to the pixels' mosaics of buildings, squares, roads and green spaces in cities. Here we developed a new algorithm to unmix the fraction of UGS derived from Landsat TM/ETM/8 OLI using a big-data platform. The spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of UGSs were examined for 70 major cities in China between 2000 and 2018. The results showed that the total area of UGS in these cities grew from 2780.66 km(2)in 2000 to 6764.75 km(2)in 2018, which more than doubled its area. As a result, the UGS area per inhabitant rose from 15.01 m(2)in 2000 to 18.09 m(2)in 2018. However, an uneven layout of UGS occurred among the coastal, western, northeastern and central zones. For example, the UGS percentage in newly expanded urban areas in the coastal zone rose significantly in 2000-2018, with an increase of 2.51%, compared to the decline in UGS in cities in the western zone. Therefore, the effective strategies we have developed should be adopted to show disparities and promote green infrastructure capacity building in those cities with less green space, especially in western China.

TI  - Uncertainties in GPS-based operational orbit determination: A case study of the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites
T2  - AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Operations Centre currently operates five Copernicus Sentinel satellites in the framework of Europe's Copernicus Earth observation programme. The routine operations rely on a daily orbit determination, carried out on-ground, consisting in a least-squares fit of a dynamical model to GPS navigation solutions generated on-board. The purpose of this paper is the estimation of realistic uncertainties on this daily determined state vector. By comparison with the orbit derived by Precise Orbit Determination, we estimate the 1-sigma errors at approximately 0.5m and 0.5mm/s. Non-stationary errors in the navigation solution preclude their characterisation with a constant covariance matrix. Error whitening is achieved by decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio in the errors through the use of underestimated weights on the data. The approach keeps the errors on the derived state vector unchanged and allows the covariance on the state vector to become realistic.

TI  - Multi-temporal LULC Classification using Hybrid Approach and Monitoring Built-up Growth with Shannon's Entropy for a Semi-arid Region of Rajasthan, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) classification of Churu district of Rajasthan state in India was done through hybrid classification technique. Landsat imageries of 1998, 2008 and 2018 were used to ascertain the rate and nature of spatio-temporal LULC changes. Major focus was given on vegetative cover change detection of the study area. On the basis of field survey and standard classification classes, the land use classes of the study area were divided into eleven classes. A detailed vegetative classification has been done while categorizing the classes. This classification method employed maximum likelihood and ISODATA clustering. The decision tree approach was used to create the multi-temporal hybrid LULC classification. The accuracy assessment results have shown excellent results at 91% overall accuracy with a kappa of 0.92. The results indicated that agriculture, crop land dominated the land use of Churu district while natural vegetation (forest areas) had the least share in land cover during the entire study period from 1998 to 2018. Shannon's entropy index was used to determine the changes in spatial distributional pattern of built up during the period 1998 to 2018 for the study area in general and also for each of the eight sub-administrative regions (tehsils). The increase in the built up area in the study area during the period of 1998 to 2018 was quite paltry with a general dispersed type of built up. The increase varied from moderate to nominal with the entropy value decreasing from 0.84 to 0.71 for the study area in general.

TI  - Crop characterization using an improved scattering power decomposition technique for compact polarimetric SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop characterization using Compact-Pol Synthetic Aperture Radar (CP-SAR) data is of prime interest with the rapid advancements of SAR systems towards operational applications. It is noteworthy that as a good compromise between the dual and quad-polarized SAR systems, the CP-SAR offer advantages in terms of the larger swath and lower data rate. The m - chi(CP) decomposition considers two out of the three Stokes child parameters: degree of polarization (m), ellipticity (chi), and orientation angle (psi) to describe the polarized part of the quasimonochromatic partially polarized wave. An improvement in the scattering powers was proposed in the S - Omega decomposition, which takes into accounts both the transmitted and received wave ellipticities (.t,.r) and the orientation angles (psi(t), psi(r)). In this decomposition, S denotes the Stokes vector and Omega is the polarized power fraction. However, it may be noted that the S - Omega decomposition intrinsically ignores dominance in the target scattering mechanism while calculating the powers. In this work, improvement is proposed for the S - Omega decomposition by utilizing the degree of dominance in the scattering mechanism. The improved S - Omega (named as iS - Omega) decomposition powers are first compared with the existing m - chi and S - Omega powers for elementary (viz., trihedral and dihedral corner reflectors) and distributed targets using simulated CP-SAR data from quadpol RADARSAT-2 data. An increase of similar to 2% for odd and even-bounce powers obtained from the iS- O decomposition is observed for the trihedral and dihedral corner reflectors respectively. The analysis of the scattering powers for distributed targets shows that an increase of 15% and 12% in the even and odd-bounce powers is observed from iS- O for urban and bare soil areas respectively as compared to the m - chi and S - Omega decompositions. Besides, temporal variations in the scattering powers obtained from the iS - Omega decomposition are also analyzed for rice, cotton, and sugarcane crops at different growth stages.

TI  - Effect of Surface Temperature on Energy Consumption in a Calibrated Building: A Case Study of Delhi
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and associated land-use changes in cities cause an increase in the demand for electricity by altering the local climate. The present study aims to examine the variations in total energy and cooling energy demand in a calibrated building energy model, caused by urban heat island formation over Delhi. The study used Sentinel-2A multispectral imagery for land use and land cover (LULC) of mapping of Delhi, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery for land surface temperature (LST) mapping during March 2018. It was observed that regions with dense built-up areas (i.e., with built-up area greater than 90%) had a higher annual land surface temperature (LST), i.e., 293.5 K and urban heat island intensity (UHII) ranging from 0.9 K-5.9 K. In contrast, lower annual values of LST (290K) and UHII (0.0-0.4 K) were observed in regions with high vegetation cover (53%). Statistical analysis reveals that a negative correlation exists between vegetation and nighttime LST, which is further confirmed by linear regression analysis. Energy simulations were performed on a calibrated building model placed at three different sites, identified on the basis of land use and land cover percentage and annual LST. Simulation results showed that the site located in the central part of Delhi displayed higher annual energy consumption (255.21 MWh/y) compared to the site located in the rural periphery (235.69 MWh/y). For all the three sites, the maximum electricity consumption was observed in the summer season, while the minimum was seen in the winter season. The study indicates that UHI formation leads to increased energy consumption in buildings, and thus UHI mitigation measures hold great potential for energy saving in a large city like Delhi.

AB  - Humanity as a species has spent most of its existence moving with instead of against nature as found among Indigenous or First Nation communities traditionally. Yet most members of modern societies feel disconnected from nature, which is attributed to a lack of connection and respect toward the more than human. We developed assessment tools for ecological attachment from an Indigenous perspective, validating measures (n=695) of ecological empathy (feeling concern for more-than-human entities), ecological mindfulness (mindful attitudes and behaviors toward living things), and green action (conservation behaviors). Then we conducted a 3-week behavioral intervention with university students (n=47) with two conditions expected to increase ecological mindfulness: (1) Indigenous ecological attachment (e.g., acknowledge the trees you pass today) by which ecological empathy was expected to increase; (2) conservation behaviors (e.g., turning off lights) by which green action was expected to increase. In session one, participants completed key measures, read texts related to their condition (facts, a poem, and an essay), and selected condition-relevant actions to draw from and perform in the following 3 weeks (one selected per day). In session two, measures were retaken. In comparison with a control group, MANOVA revealed that hypotheses were supported: Only the ecological attachment group increased on ecological empathy, only the conservation group significantly increased on green actions, and both intervention groups increased on ecological mindfulness.

TI  - THE SHEPHERD OF HEAVENLY HERDS AND THE GOD OF CATTLE: VELES IN THE RUSSIAN FOLKLORE WORLDVIEW
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper reveals centuries-old connection between the Slavic picture of the world and pagan beliefs. The Moon (night light) is the deity associated with the god Veles (Volos). The author pays special attention to the principles of grouping of Veles' serpent, bear and auroch's faces which aimed to highlight his unity with the Moon. The link between Veles and Dazhdbog in the Old Russian Pantheon is examined in complex relations of the impersonated Moon and Sun. Both deities are the bearers of benefits (Veles - of wealth and offspring, Dazhdbog - of harvest). Veles is the God of the otherworld, a shepherd of souls of the dead. Old Slavic beliefs about the Moon as a haven for the souls once again prove identity of the deity (Veles) and the night Sun (Moon). The name of Veles was identified with a chthonic or usual serpent and a bear. The otherworldly serpent connects the Moon with Veles. The otherworldly bear serves as the link between Veles and the Moon. Contrary to the Slavic mythology, the Baltic mythology see the God of the otherworld and the chthonic underground character as different beings called Vels and Velnias. Therefore the image of Veles-Volos appears both dual and monolithic.

TI  - A Hybrid Approach Combining Conceptual Hydrological Models, Support Vector Machines and Remote Sensing Data for Rainfall-Runoff Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding catchment response to rainfall events is important for accurate runoff estimation in many water-related applications, including water resources management. This study introduced a hybrid model, the Tank-least squared support vector machine (LSSVM), that incorporated intermediate state variables from a conceptual tank model within the least squared support vector machine (LSSVM) framework in order to describe aspects of the rainfall-runoff (RR) process. The efficacy of the Tank-LSSVM model was demonstrated with hydro-meteorological data measured in the Yongdam Catchment between 2007 and 2016, South Korea. We first explored the role of satellite soil moisture (SM) data (i.e., European Space Agency (ESA) CCI) in the rainfall-runoff modeling. The results indicated that the SM states inferred from the ESA CCISWI provided an effective means of describing the temporal dynamics of SM. Further, the Tank-LSSVM model's ability to simulate daily runoff was assessed by using goodness of fit measures (i.e., root mean square error, Nash Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), and coefficient of determination). The Tank-LSSVM models' NSE were all classified as "very good" based on their performance during the training and testing periods. Compared to individual LSSVM and Tank models, improved daily runoff simulations were seen in the proposed Tank-LSSVM model. In particular, low flow simulations demonstrated the improvement of the Tank-LSSVM model compared to the conventional tank model.

TI  - Utilization of Geodetic Methods Results in Small Open-Pit Mine Conditions: A Case Study from Slovakia
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining, especially surface mining, has a significant impact on the upper part of the soil cover, including fauna and flora. The article deals with the use of geodetic methods to observe the mining process and its possible impact on the environment. The created model can be used to design the recovery and reclamation of open-pit mines after their closure and mining termination. For the modeling of an open-pit mine, 2151 points from two stages of geodetic measurements were used. Graphical presentations of the geodetic measurements were compared with data from aerial photogrammetry. The measurement and processing results were used to visualize the spatial changes in the open-pit mine, which are necessary to take measures related to the recovery of the landscape affected by mining. Based on the calculation, 145.266 m(3)were extracted during the period under exploration. When calculating the average excavated volume per working day, it was found that 188 m(3)= 500 tons = 0.5 kilotons per day were extracted between the monitored periods. When comparing the original surface and the generated model of the open-pit mine, it was found that the entire top of the rock massif was permanently removed in the total volume of 3,421,000 m(3). To capture the impact of mining on the surrounding environment, multispectral images of Landsat 7 and 8 during the observed period. Focused attention was divided into two factors, land surface temperature, and vegetation condition. The results from the temperature maps show that the open-pit mine is becoming a heat island. Analysis of the vegetative state confirms the rapid change in the health of vegetation, resp. reduction of its condition in the area around the open-pit mine. The presented results show that the selected methods and procedures are applicable in the conditions of the small mining company in Slovakia.

TI  - OLCI A/B Tandem Phase Analysis, Part 1: Level 1 Homogenisation and Harmonisation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Copernicus is a European system for monitoring the Earth in support of European policy. It includes the Sentinel-3 satellite mission which provides reliable and up-to-date measurements of the ocean, atmosphere, cryosphere, and land. To fulfil mission requirements, two Sentinel-3 satellites are required on-orbit at the same time to meet revisit and coverage requirements in support of Copernicus Services. The inter-unit consistency is critical for the mission as more S3 platforms are planned in the future. A few weeks after its launch in April 2018, the Sentinel-3B satellite was manoeuvred into a tandem configuration with its operational twin Sentinel-3A already in orbit. Both satellites were flown only thirty seconds apart on the same orbit ground track to optimise cross-comparisons. This tandem phase lasted from early June to mid October 2018 and was followed by a short drift phase during which the Sentinel-3B satellite was progressively moved to a specific orbit phasing of 140 degrees separation from the sentinel-3A satellite. In this paper, an output of the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-3 Tandem for Climate study (S3TC), we provide a full methodology for the homogenisation and harmonisation of the two Ocean and Land Colour Instruments (OLCI) based on the tandem phase. Homogenisation adjusts for unavoidable slight spatial and spectral differences between the two sensors and provide a basis for the comparison of the radiometry. Persistent radiometric biases of 1-2% across the OLCI spectrum are found with very high confidence. Harmonisation then consists of adjusting one instrument on the other based on these findings. Validation of the approach shows that such harmonisation then procures an excellent radiometric alignment. Performed on L1 calibrated radiances, the benefits of harmonisation are fully appreciated on Level 2 products as reported in a companion paper. Whereas our methodology aligns one sensor to behave radiometrically as the other, discussions consider the choice of the reference to be used within the operational framework. Further exploitation of the measurements indeed provides evidence of the need to perform flat-fielding on both payloads, prior to any harmonisation. Such flat-fielding notably removes inter-camera differences in the harmonisation coefficients. We conclude on the extreme usefulness of performing a tandem phase for the OLCI mission continuity as well as for any optical mission to which the methodology presented in this paper applies (e.g., Sentinel-2). To maintain the climate record, it is highly recommended that the future Sentinel-3C and Sentinel-3D satellites perform tandem flights when injected into the Sentinel-3 time series.

TI  - The delayed effect of wildfire season particulate matter on subsequent influenza season in a mountain west region of the USA
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Particularly in rural settings, there has been little research regarding the health impacts of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during the wildfire season smoke exposure period on respiratory diseases, such as influenza, and their associated outbreaks months later. We examined the delayed effects of PM2.5 concentrations for the short-lag (1-4 weeks prior) and the long-lag (during the prior wildfire season months) on the following winter influenza season in Montana, a mountainous state in the western United States. We created gridded maps of surface PM2.5 for the state of Montana from 2009 to 2018 using spatial regression models fit with station observations and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical thickness data. We used a seasonal quasi-Poisson model with generalized estimating equations to estimate weekly, county-specific, influenza counts for Montana, associated with delayed PM2.5 concentration periods (short-lag and long-lag effects), adjusted for temperature and seasonal trend. We did not detect an acute, short-lag PM2.5 effect nor short-lag temperature effect on influenza in Montana. Higher daily average PM2.5 concentrations during the wildfire season was po- sitively associated with increased influenza in the following winter influenza season (expected 16% or 22% increase in influenza rate per 1 mu g/m(3) increase in average daily summer PM2.5 based on two analyses, p = 0.04 or 0.008). This is one of the first observations of a relationship between PM2.5 during wildfire season and influenza months later.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Data in an Evaluation of the Impact of the Disturbances on Forest Vegetation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we investigated the detection of forest vegetation changes during the period of 2017 to 2019 in the Low Tatras National Park (Slovakia) and the Sumava National Park (Czechia) using Sentinel-2 data. The evaluation was based on a time-series analysis using selected vegetation indices. The case studies represented five different areas according to the type of the forest vegetation degradation (one with bark beetle calamity, two areas with forest recovery mode after a bark beetle calamity, and two areas without significant disturbances). The values of the trajectories of the vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI)) and the orthogonal indices (tasseled cap greenness (TCG) and tasseled cap wetness (TCW)) were analyzed and validated by in situ data and aerial photographs. The results confirm the abilities of the NDVI, the NDMI and the TCW to distinguish disturbed and undisturbed areas. The NDMI vegetation index was particularly useful for the detection of the disturbed forest and forest recovery after bark beetle outbreaks and provided relevant information regarding the health of the forest (the individual stages of the disturbances and recovery mode). On the contrary, the TCG index demonstrated only limited abilities. The TCG could distinguish healthy forest and the gray-attack disturbance phase; however, it was difficult to use this index for detecting different recovery phases and to distinguish recovery phases from healthy forest. The areas affected by the disturbances had lower values of NDVI and NDMI indices (NDVI quartile range Q(2)-Q(3): 0.63-0.71; NDMI Q(2)-Q(3): 0.10-0.19) and the TCW index had negative values (Q(2)-Q(3): -0.06--0.05)). The analysis was performed with a cloud-based tool-Sentinel Hub. Cloud-based technologies have brought a new dimension in the processing and analysis of satellite data and allowed satellite data to be brought to end-users in the forestry sector. The Copernicus program and its data from Sentinel missions have evoked new opportunities in the application of satellite data. The usage of Sentinel-2 data in the research of long-term forest vegetation changes has a high relevance and perspective due to the free availability, distribution, and well-designed spectral, temporal, and spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 data for monitoring forest ecosystems.

TI  - Characterizing Spatiotemporal Patterns of Mangrove Forests in Can Gio Biosphere Reserve Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application This study proposes the features of mangrove forest variations in relation to anthropogenic activities under the forms of land use land cover changes around three ecological zones of a Biosphere Reserve area, using Sentinel-2 Imagery and spatial regression approaches that have wide application in natural resources, land use planning, and environmental management. This study aimed at evaluating the spatiotemporal patterns of mangrove forest variations for three ecological zones of the Can Gio biosphere reserve (i.e., core, buffer, and transition zones) and its relation to land use/land cover changes. Time series Sentinel-2 Imagery-which presents the Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI), obtained through the Google Earth Engine and Overlap Similarity Algorithm-was used to characterize vegetation cover in the study area. Furthermore, the Cohen's Kappa agreement was applied to examine the accuracy of mangrove classification, and the Mann-Kendal (MK) significance was used to analyze the spatiotemporal trends of mangrove forests. The results showed that an NDVI value greater than 0.3 recorded the reflected signal of mangrove population in the study area with anO-index greater than 0.85. A Cohen's Kappa statistic of agreement of 0.7 and an overall classification accuracy of 83% was obtained. Regarding the trend in mangrove forest patterns, an increase in area of 669 ha and 579 ha explored at the buffer and core zones, respectively, while the largest declined mangrove area of 350 ha was investigated at the buffer zone, followed by a transition at 314 ha during the study period due to the interconversion of shrimp farming and the expansion of built-up areas. Moreover, the study also described the negative impacts of the sea-encroached urban-tourism zone on mangrove patterns in the foreseeable future. The results from this study will act as a basic fundamental authentic report for local governments in proposing strategies for the shielding of mangrove forests and economic development from negative consequences in foreseeable future.

TI  - The Influence of Screening, Misclassification, and Reporting Biases on Reported Chlamydia Case Rates Among Young Women in the United States, 2000 Through 2017
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNational chlamydia case rate trends are difficult to interpret because of biases from partial screening coverage, imperfect diagnostic tests, and underreporting. We examined the extent to which these time-varying biases could influence reported annual chlamydia case rates. MethodsAnnual reported case rates among women aged 15 through 24 years from 2000 through 2017 were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention AtlasPlus tool. Estimates of reporting completeness, diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity, and screening coverage were derived from literature review and expert opinion. We adjusted annual reported case rates for incomplete reporting, imperfect diagnostic tests, and partial screening coverage through a series of corrections, and calculated annual adjusted case rates of correctly diagnosed chlamydia. ResultsAdjusted chlamydia case rates among young women were higher than reported case rates throughout the study period. Reported case rates increased over the study period, but adjusted rates declined from 12,900 to 7900 cases per 100,000 person-years between 2000 and 2007. After 2007, adjusted case rates declined to 7500 cases per 100,000 person-years in 2017. Bias from partial screening coverage had a larger impact on case rate magnitude and trend shape than bias from imperfect diagnostic tests or underreporting. ConclusionsReported chlamydia case rates may be substantially lower than true chlamydia case rates because of incomplete reporting, imperfect diagnostic tests, and partial screening coverage. Because the magnitude of these biases has declined over time, the differences between reported and adjusted case rates have narrowed, revealing a sharp decline in adjusted case rates even as reported case rates have risen. The decline in adjusted case rates suggests that the rise in reported case rates should not be interpreted strictly as increasing chlamydia incidence, as the observed rise can be explained by improvements in screening coverage, diagnostic tests, and reporting.

T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The dust storm is an important weather event in the Middle East and the frontal dust storms being the most prominent ones in the non-summer seasons. In this research, the 13 April 2011 frontal dust storm in the Middle East is studied in detail. The analysis is based on satellite images, aerosol index, synoptic data, and numerical simulation using the WRF-Chem model. It is estimated that in this event, more than 7.2 Tg dust was emitted from the study area. The dust plume covered northern Saudi Arabia, southern Iraq, Kuwait, and extended northeast across Iran and the Caspian Sea. About 0.3 Tg of the emitted dust was deposited in the study area during 12-13 April. The model simulation shows that the amount of dry deposition in Iran and Saudi Arabia was much higher than in other regions. The model simulations and satellite images are consistent. The combination of the various datasets enables a comprehensive characterization of the frontal dust storm in the Middle East.

TI  - A Cloud Top-Height Retrieval Algorithm Using Simultaneous Observations from the Himawari-8 and FY-2E Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we introduce a cloud top-height (CTH) retrieval algorithm using simultaneous observations from the Himawari-8 and FengYun (FY)-2E geostationary (GEO) satellites (hereafter, dual-GEO CTH algorithm). The dual-GEO CTH algorithm estimates CTH based on the parallax, which is the difference in the apparent position of clouds observed from two GEO satellites simultaneously. The dual-GEO CTH algorithm consists of four major procedures: (1) image remapping, (2) image matching, (3) CTH calculation, and (4) quality control. The retrieved CTHs were compared with other satellite CTHs from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and the Cloud-Profiling Radar (CPR), on three occasions. Considering the geometric configuration and footprint sizes of the two GEO satellites, the theoretical accuracy of the dual-GEO CTH algorithm is estimated as +/- 0.93 km. The comparisons show that the retrieval accuracy generally tends to fall within the theoretical accuracy range. As the dual-GEO CTH algorithm is based on parallax, it could be easily applied for the estimation of the height of any elevated feature in various fields.

TI  - An Effect of Urban Forest on Urban Thermal Environment in Seoul, South Korea, Based on Landsat Imagery Analysis
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island effect has posed negative impacts on urban areas with increased cooling energy demand followed by an altered thermal environment. While unusually high temperature in urban areas has been often attributed to complex urban settings, the function of urban forests has been considered as an effective heat mitigation strategy. To investigate the cooling effect of urban forests and their influence range, this study examined the spatiotemporal changes in land surface temperature (LST) of urban forests and surrounding areas by using Landsat imageries. LST, the size of the urban forest, its vegetation cover, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were investigated for 34 urban forests and their surrounding areas at a series of buffer areas in Seoul, South Korea. The mean LST of urban forests was lower than that of the overall city, and the threshold distance from urban forests for cooling effect was estimated to be roughly up to 300 m. The group of large-sized urban forests showed significantly lower mean LST than that of small-sized urban forests. The group of urban forests with higher NDVI showed lower mean LST than that of urban forests with lower mean NDVI in a consistent manner. A negative linear relationship was found between the LST and size of urban forest (r = -0.36 to -0.58), size of vegetation cover (r = -0.39 to -0.61), and NDVI (r = -0.42 to -0.93). Temporal changes in NDVI were examined separately on a specific site, Seoul Forest, that has experienced urban forest dynamics. LST of the site decreased as NDVI improved by a land-use change from a barren racetrack to a city park. It was considered that NDVI could be a reliable factor for estimating the cooling effect of urban forest compared to the size of the urban forest and/or vegetation cover.

TI  - Multi-Objective Support Vector Regression Reduces Systematic Error in Moderate Resolution Maps of Tree Species Abundance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When forest conditions are mapped from empirical models, uncertainty in remotely sensed predictor variables can cause the systematic overestimation of low values, underestimation of high values, and suppression of variability. This regression dilution or attenuation bias is a well-recognized problem in remote sensing applications, with few practical solutions. Attenuation is of particular concern for applications that are responsive to prediction patterns at the high end of observed data ranges, where systematic error is typically greatest. We addressed attenuation bias in models of tree species relative abundance (percent of total aboveground live biomass) based on multitemporal Landsat and topoclimatic predictor data. We developed a multi-objective support vector regression (MOSVR) algorithm that simultaneously minimizes total prediction error and systematic error caused by attenuation bias. Applied to 13 tree species in the Acadian Forest Region of the northeastern U.S., MOSVR performed well compared to other prediction methods including single-objective SVR (SOSVR) minimizing total error, Random Forest (RF), gradient nearest neighbor (GNN), and Random Forest nearest neighbor (RFNN) algorithms. SOSVR and RF yielded the lowest total prediction error but produced the greatest systematic error, consistent with strong attenuation bias. Underestimation at high relative abundance caused strong deviations between predicted patterns of species dominance/codominance and those observed at field plots. In contrast, GNN and RFNN produced dominance/codominance patterns that deviated little from observed patterns, but predicted species relative abundance with lower accuracy and substantial systematic error. MOSVR produced the least systematic error for all species with total error often comparable to SOSVR or RF. Predicted patterns of dominance/codominance matched observations well, though not quite as well as GNN or RFNN. Overall, MOSVR provides an effective machine learning approach to the reduction of systematic prediction error and should be fully generalizable to other remote sensing applications and prediction problems.

TI  - Evaluation of Two Global Land Surface Albedo Datasets Distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service and the EUMETSAT LSA-SAF
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper is devoted to the quality assessment of two global land surface albedo products developed by Meteo France in the frame of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and the LSA-SAF (Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis), herein called, respectively, VGT (VeGeTation) (the C3Sv1 dataset, derived from VGT sensors onboard Satellites for the Observation of the Earth, also called SPOT) and ETAL (European polar system Ten-day surface ALbedo, derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR) onboard METeorological OPerational (METOP) satellites). The evaluation study inter-compared these products with measurements at 33 ground stations and two independent operational products, MTAL-R/NRT (Meteosat second generation Ten-day ALbedo Reprocessed/Near Real-Time) and MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), over two distinct four-year periods. In accordance with the prescription from the Land Product Validation group of the joint Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (LPV/CEOS), the evaluation was addressed per land cover; furthermore, two albedo regimes were considered throughout the evaluation to distinguish between high (over 0.15) and low (below 0.15) surface albedo behaviors. First, we show that both VGT and ETAL products agree well with the measurements and the other satellite products at the ground stations. Second, when inter-compared with MODIS, the results are noteworthy for ETAL as opposed to VGT, with 11 out of 13 land cover types passing the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) requirements for more than 80% of the sites for albedo values less than 0.15 (compared with none for VGT) and 10 out of 14 land cover types passing the GCOS requirements for more than 50% of the sites for albedo values greater than 0.15 (compared with 5 for VGT). Finally, a pixel-by-pixel analysis reveals that VGT overestimates the surface albedo as compared with MODIS by about 0.02 in absolute value for albedo values less than 0.15 and by about 22% in relative value for albedo values greater than 0.15. The root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) in absolute value is about 0.015 for albedo values less than 0.15 and 51.5% in relative value for albedo values greater than 0.15. In contrast, the bias for ETAL when compared with MODIS remains very small. Over the four-year period, ETAL overestimates the surface albedo as compared with MODIS by 0.001 in absolute value for the regime of surface albedo less than 0.15 and by about 5.8% in relative value for albedo values greater than 0.15. The RMSD in absolute value is about 0.014 for albedo values less than 0.15 and 19.4% in relative value for albedo values greater than 0.15. Assuming that the MODIS product is a good reference, a relative bias of around 6% can be judged satisfactory for ETAL surface albedo. The lower performance of the VGT (C3Sv1) product is currently the subject of investigation. Work is ongoing to upgrade it further towards the final C3S product.

TI  - Evidence of Pathogen-Induced Immunogenetic Selection across the Large Geographic Range of a Wild Seabird
T2  - MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Over evolutionary time, pathogen challenge shapes the immunepheno type of the host to better respond to an incipient threat. The extent and direction of this selection pressure depend on the local pathogen composition, which is in turn determined by biotic and abiotic features of the environment. However, little is known about adaptation to local pathogen threats in wild animals. The Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) is a species complex that lends itself to the study of immune adaptation because of its circumpolar distribution over a large latitudinal range, with little or no admixture between ''different clades. Inthis study, we examine the diversity in a key family of innate immune genes-theToll-like receptors (TLRs)-across the range of the Gentoo penguin. The three TLRs that we investigated present varying levels of diversity, with TLR4 and TLR5 greatly exceeding the diversity of TLR7. We present evidence of positive selection in TLR4 and TLR5, which points to pathogen-driven adaptation to the local pathogen milieu. Finally, we demonstrate that two positively selected cosegregating sites in TLR5 are sufficient to alter the responsiveness of the receptor to its bacterial ligand, flagellin. Taken together, these results suggest that Gentoo penguins have experienced distinct pathogen-driven selection pressures in different environments, which may be important given the role of the Gentoo penguin as a sentinel species in some of the world's most rapidly changing environments.

TI  - A Multi-Sensor Fusion Framework Based on Coupled Residual Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-sensor remote sensing image classification has been considerably improved by deep learning feature extraction and classification networks. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-sensor fusion framework for the fusion of diverse remote sensing data sources. The novelty of this paper is grounded in three important design innovations: 1- a unique adaptation of the coupled residual networks to address multi-sensor data classification; 2- a smart auxiliary training via adjusting the loss function to address classifications with limited samples; and 3- a unique design of the residual blocks to reduce the computational complexity while preserving the discriminative characteristics of multi-sensor features. The proposed classification framework is evaluated using three different remote sensing datasets: the urban Houston university datasets (including Houston 2013 and the training portion of Houston 2018) and the rural Trento dataset. The proposed framework achieves high overall accuracies of 93.57%, 81.20%, and 98.81% on Houston 2013, the training portion of Houston 2018, and Trento datasets, respectively. Additionally, the experimental results demonstrate considerable improvements in classification accuracies compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Registration method of dislocation rows for the advanced geosynchronous radiation imager
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the solution to dislocation between adjacent rows is proposed for the advanced geosynchronous radiation imager (AGRI) of Fengyun-4A (FY-4A). Firstly, according to the scanning mode of AGRI combined with the shift theorem of the Fourier Transform, the phase difference curve of adjacent pixels in the misaligned row is calculated. Secondly, the displacement value is obtained by fitting the low frequency portion of the phase difference spectrum by the least squares method. Finally, the dislocation rows are reconstructed by means of "weight assignment" according to the displacement value, and the problem of dislocation between the rows is solved. The scheme proposed is verified by simulation experiment, and the in-orbit images of AGRI are processed. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve registration between adjacent rows with high precision on sub-pixel level.

TI  - A polycultural theory of wisdom based on Habermas's worldview
T2  - CULTURE & PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Building on Habermas's worldview, this paper attempts to construct a theory of wisdom that integrates the advantages of Eastern and Western cultures. To this end, we review previous definitions of wisdom and their problems and analyze the importance of worldview for wisdom. A worldview provided by the German philosopher Jurgen Habermas is eminently persuasive. We argue that Habermas's worldview provides a more suitable basis for a polycultural theory of wisdom. The specific components of the wisdom theory are: (1) a relationalist belief in the universal world; (2) transcendental agency in the subjective world; (3) intersubjective communication orientation in the social world; and (4) integrated principles of certainty and uncertainty in the objective world. Inspired by this theory, people could adopt different principles for their subjective, social, and objective worldviews and coordinate them to deal with the problems of human survival, which would also promote the long-term flourishing of human civilization.

TI  - Detecting and Analyzing the Increase of High-Rising Buildings to Monitor the Dynamic of the Xiong'an New Area
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As an effort to monitor the urban dynamic of the Xiong'an new area, this paper proposed a novel procedure to detect the increase of High-Rising Buildings (HRBs) from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data based on Fully Convolutional Networks. The procedure was applied to detect the increase of HRBs between 2017 and 2019 in 39 counties in the center of the Xiong'an new area. The detected increases were validated and then analyzed in terms of their quantities, spatial distribution and driving forces at the county level. The results indicate that our method can effectively detect the increase of HRBs in large urban areas. The quantity and spatial distribution of the increased HRBs varies a lot in the 39 counties. Most of the increase is located in the north-east and the mid-west of the study region. As to the driving forces, it seems that no single factor can fully explain the increase. Among the five selected factors, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and transportation accessibility have clear high impacts than others. Number of Permanent Residents (NPR) and policy follow as the secondary group. The terrain has the lowest influence on the increase. Our method provides a useful tool to dynamically monitor HRBs in large areas and also the increase of HRBs can be employed as a new indicator to characterize urban development.

TI  - Refining Urban Built-Up Area via Multi-Source Data Fusion for the Analysis of Dongting Lake Eco-Economic Zone Spatiotemporal Expansion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has given rise to serious urban problems. It is crucial to understand the urbanization process to accurately and quickly identify boundary changes in urban built-up areas and implement planning schemes and adjustments in scientific and effective ways. This study proposes a new method to automate and refine the extraction of urban built-up areas by using Landsat and nighttime light (NTL) imagery. The urban agglomeration of Dongting Lake Ecological Economic Zone (UADLEEZ) Landsat data are mapped to NTL data using resampling, superpixel segmentation, and assigning the blank part with the Euclidean distance method. We then compared our findings with those produced via traditional threshold extraction methods. In total, 33 built-up areas of UADLEEZ boundary maps were produced between 1992 and 2018. Thus, we reached the following conclusions: (1) the urban built-up areas obtained via our proposed method are finer than those obtained via other threshold extraction methods; (2) we applied the extraction method to UADLEEZ, and analyzed the expansion of the urban agglomeration based on expansion scale, gravity center offset, and landscape pattern index, the analysis of expansion process is consistent with the actual situation; (3) the proposed method can be used to draw long-term dynamic maps of urban extents in units of years, and the results can be used to update the existing products. This study can serve as a reference for future urban planning, and provide both adjustment programs for relevant departments, and an objective basis for governmental decision-making.

TI  - Spatial Heterogeneous of Ecological Vulnerability in Arid and Semi-Arid Area: A Case of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological vulnerability, as an important evaluation method reflecting regional ecological status and the degree of stability, is the key content in global change and sustainable development. Most studies mainly focus on changes of ecological vulnerability concerning the temporal trend, but rarely take arid and semi-arid areas into consideration to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the ecological vulnerability index (EVI) there. In this study, we selected the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on the Loess Plateau of China, a typical arid and semi-arid area, as a case to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of the EVI every five years, from 1990 to 2015. Based on remote sensing data, meteorological data, and economic statistical data, this study first evaluated the temporalspatial change of ecological vulnerability in the study area by Geo-information Tupu. Further, we explored the spatial heterogeneity of the ecological vulnerability using Getis-Ord Gi*. Results show that: (1) the regions with high ecological vulnerability are mainly concentrated in the north of the study area, which has high levels of economic growth, while the regions with low ecological vulnerability are mainly distributed in the relatively poor regions in the south of the study area. (2) From 1990 to 2015, ecological vulnerability showed an increasing trend in the study area. Additionally, there is significant transformation between different grades of the EVI, where the area of transformation between a slight vulnerability level and a light vulnerability level accounts for 41.56% of the transformation area. (3) Hot-spot areas of the EVI are mainly concentrated in the north of the study area, and cold-spot areas are mainly concentrated in the center and south of the study area. Spatial heterogeneity of ecological vulnerability is significant in the central and southern areas but insignificant in the north of the study area. (4) The grassland area is the main driving factor of the change in ecological vulnerability, which is also affected by both arid and semi-arid climates and ecological projects. This study can provide theoretical references for sustainable development to present feasible suggestions on protection measures and management modes in arid and semi-arid areas.

TI  - The 2019 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.4 and <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.1 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence in Eastern California: rupture on a conjugate fault structure revealed by GPS and InSAR measurements
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - On 4 and 6 July 2019, an M-w 6.4 foreshock and an M-w 7.1 main shock successively struck the city of Ridgecrest in eastern California. These two events arc the most significant earthquake sequences to strike in this part of California for the past 20 yr. We used both continuous global positioning system (GPS) measurements and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images taken by the Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 satellites in four different viewing geometries to fully map the coseismic surface displacements associated with these two earthquakes. Using these GPS and InSAR measurements both separately and jointly, we inverted data to find the coseismic slip distributions and fault dips caused by the two earthquakes. The GPS-constrained slip models indicate that the M-w 7.1 main shock was predominately controlled by right-lateral motions on a series of northwest-trending faults, while the M-w 6.4 foreshock involved both right-lateral slipping on a northwest-trending fault and left-lateral slipping on a northeasttrending fault. The two earthquakes both generate significant surface slip, with the maximum inferred slip of 5.54 m at the surface. We estimate the cumulative geodetic moment of the two earthquakes to have been 4.93 x 10(19) Nm, equivalent to M-w 7.1. Furthermore, our calculations of the changes in static Coulomb stress suggest that the M-w 7.1 main shock was promoted significantly by the M-w 6.4 foreshock. This latest Ridgecrest earthquake sequence ruptured only the northern part of the seismic gap between the 1992 M-w 7.3 Landers earthquake and the 1872 M7.4 7.9 Owens Valley earthquake. The earthquake risk in this area, therefore, remains very high, considering the significant accumulation of strain in the Eastern California Shear Zone, especially in the southern part of the seismic gap.

TI  - Three-stage Tree Height Inversion Algorithm with Compensation for Temporal Decorrelation
T2  - Forest Research
M3  - Article
AB  - [Objective] When polarimetric SAR data are used to invert tree height, time decorrelation factor is the main factor affecting inversion accuracy. Random-Motion-over-Ground (RMoG) model is one of the most effective models, but it has the disadvantages of difficult inversion and long time-consuming. Here, a simplified RMoG model is proposed. [Method] In this study, the ground motion was neglected, the vegetation canopy motion was retained, and the vegetation volume scattering formula was rewritten. Then, the ground phaSe was judged by linear fitting of multiple coherence coefficients, and the decoherence value of pure volume scattering was estimated by PD polarization coherence optimization method. Finally, the rewritten vegetation volume scattering formula was used to establish a survey. Based on the fixed extinction coefficient, the height of vegetation can be retrieved by looking-up table. To verify the validity of this method, the remote sensing data of BioSAR 2007 project were tested in Remingstorp, southern Sweden. The inversion results of the four models were compared and evaluated with the determination coefficient (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). [Result] This method can improve the overestimation problem of three-stage algorithm. In terms of accuracy comparison, the R-2 of three-stage algorithm is 0.78 and RMSE is 8.52; the R-2 of RMoG model is 0.47 and RMSE is 4.17; the R-2 of RMoGL model is 0.48 and RMSE is 2.50; the R2 of this method is 0.53 and RMSE is 6.24. It is showed that this method is better in accuracy compared with three-stage algorithm, and can effectively reduce the inversion time compared with RMoG model and RMoGL model. [Conclusion] It is effective to eliminate time-related effects by adding vegetation canopy movement. Compared with threestage algorithm, RMoG model and RMoGL model, the simplified RMoG model has the advantages of high accuracy and less time-consuming.

TI  - The spatio-temporal patterns of landfast ice in Antarctica during 2006-2011 and 2016-2017 using high-resolution SAR imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landfast ice is an important component of the Antarctic sea ice regime. It affects the Antarctic climate and ecological system. In this study, the first high-resolution, long time series of the landfast ice edge from 2006 to 2011 and 2016 to 2017 is presented. The dataset was produced based on the improved net gradient difference algorithm using 2470 SAR scenes from ENVISAT and Sentinel-1A/B as well as manual analysis of MODIS imagery to fill in SAR data gaps. The study results show that the landfast ice area in November for all studied years was approximately 49.49 +/- 3.25 x 10(4) km(2), accounting for about 3%-4% of the total Antarctic sea ice area. The maximum area was 55.70 x 10(4) km(2) in November 2007, compared to the minimum area 44.01x10(4) km(2) in 2011. The area in West Antarctica was about 40% of that in East Antarctica. The distribution of landfast ice in Antarctica has significant regional differences. The extent in the Indian Ocean sector is the maximum with a mean value of 16.49 +/- 1.1x 10(4) km(2); however, the ratio of the landfast ice area to the sea ice area in the Pacific Ocean sector is the highest. Twenty-four landfast ice zones with groups of small, grounded icebergs were identified, most of which were located in East Antarctica, particularly along the Wilkes Land and Oates Land. Two cases are presented to illustrate how giant, grounded icebergs affected landfast ice. Results from this study are well suited to underpin the Antarctic climate or ecological system studies.

T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the interaction between slow-slip events (SSEs) and large earthquakes provides insights into earthquake-triggering mechanisms and is crucial for earthquake hazard assessment. In this study, we used Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar and Global Positioning System (GPS) data to estimate the source parameters of the 2018 M-w 7.2 Pinotepa, Mexico, earthquake. The results show that the earthquake ruptured both the seismogenic zone and a long-term SSE area, with two asperities ruptured during the event. GPS time-series data indicate that an SSE was initiated approximately during March 2017 below Oaxaca; the SSE ruptured an area below the source region of the Pinotepa earthquake and intruded into the seismogenic zone. The spatiotemporal proximity may suggest that the SSE triggered the Pinotepa earthquake. We propose that the triggering mechanism may either have been Coulomb stress loading or weakening of the source area by fluid migration. Furthermore, we calculated the seismic moment deficit and Coulomb failure stress changes and conclude that the Oaxaca area still has the potential for large earthquakes.

TI  - Assessment of Fire Fuel Load Dynamics in Shrubland Ecosystems in the Western United States Using MODIS Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing fire behavior in shrubland/grassland ecosystems of the western United States has proven especially problematic, in part due to the complex nature of the vegetation and its relationships with prior fire history events. Our goals in this study were (1) to determine if we can effectively leverage the high temporal resolution capabilities of current remote sensing systems such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to improve upon shrub and grassland mapping and (2) to determine if these improvements alter and improve fire behavior model results in these grass- and shrub-dominated systems. The study focused on the shrublands and grasslands of the Owyhee Basin, which is located primarily in southern Idaho. Shrubland and grassland fuel load dynamics were characterized using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Net Primary Production (NPP) datasets (both derived from MODIS). NDVI shrub and grassland values were converted to biomass, and custom fire behavior fuel models were then developed to evaluate the impacts of surface fuel changes on fire behaviors. Results from the study include the following: (1) high intra- and interannual spectral variability characterized these shrubland/grassland ecosystems, and this spectral variability was highly correlated with climate variables, most notably precipitation; (2) fire activity had a higher likelihood of occurring in areas where the NDVI (and biomass) differential between spring and summer values was especially high; (3) the annual fuel loads estimated from MODIS NPP showed that live herbaceous fuel loads were closely correlated with annual precipitation; (4) estimated fuel load accumulation was higher on shrublands than grasslands with the same vegetation productivity; (5) the total fuel load on shrublands was impacted by shrubland age, and live woody fuel load was over 66% of the total fuel load; and (6) comparisons of simulated fire behavior and spread between dynamic and static fuel loads, the latter estimates being obtained from the operational and nationwide LANDFIRE program, showed clear differences in fire indices and fire burn areas between the dynamic fuel loads and the static fuel loads. Current standard fuel models appear to have bias in underestimating the fire spread and total burnable area.

TI  - A rare case of Bowen's disease of the nipple: Literature review and management pathway
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Bowen's disease or squamous cell carcinoma in situ is a precursor malignant neoplasm restricted to the epidermis. Clinically and histologically, Bowen's disease of the nipple can resemble Paget's disease. It is crucial to differentiate between the two with immunohistological staining in order to provide the appropriate treatment. This review of Bowen's disease of the nipple will examine the diagnostic and treatment modalities previously used. We also present our own case of Bowen's disease of the nipple and propose a clinical pathway for this rare disease process. Methods A review of published literature using MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google Scholar revealed seven articles were identified with a total of eight cases of Bowen's disease of the nipple. Results Treatment modalities varied within the literature. This ranged from photodynamic therapy to simple mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Standard surgical margins are inadequate for Bowen's disease of the nipple, as it has been shown to spread along the lactiferous ducts. Our case is of a 57-year-old female with Bowen's disease of her right nipple, confirmed through immunohistological staining. Wide local excision with immediate full-thickness skin graft reconstruction was performed and is now disease-free with a healed graft. Conclusion There is no accepted management pathway for Bowen's disease of the nipple. We propose a treatment algorithm that involves immunohistological staining to diagnose Bowen's disease of the nipple. This would then be followed by a wide local excision, complete nipple excision including underlying lactiferous ducts and glandular tissue and subsequent reconstruction.

TI  - The Context-Dependent Effect of Urban Form on Air Pollution: A Panel Data Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There have been debates and a lack of understanding about the complex effects of urban-scale urban form on air pollution. Based on the remotely sensed data of 150 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei agglomeration in China from 2000 to 2015, we studied the effects of urban form on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations from multiple perspectives. The panel models show that the elastic coefficients of aggregation index and fractal dimension are the highest among all factors for the whole region. Population density, aggregation index, and fractal dimension have stronger influences on air pollution in small cities, while area size demonstrates the opposite effect. Population density has a stronger impact on medium/high-elevation cities, while night light intensity (NLI), fractal dimension, and area size show the opposite effect. Low road network density can enlarge the influence magnitude of NLI and population density. The results of the linear regression model with multiplicative interactions provide evidence of interactions between population density and NLI or aggregation index. The slope of the line that captures the relationship between NLI on PM2.5 is positive at low levels of population density, flat at medium levels of population density, and negative at high levels of population density. The study results also show that when increasing the population density, the air pollution in a city with low economic and low morphological aggregation degrees will be impacted more greatly.

TI  - Mapping the dynamic degree of aeolian desertification in the Shiyang River Basin from 1975 to 2010
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Shiyang River Basin is an area of China that is severly affected by aeolian desertification. Thus, we established an aeolian desertified land classification system for visual interpretation, which classified the Aeolian Desertified. Land (ADL) into Slight (SL), Moderate (M), Severe (S) and Extremely Severe (ES) according to the severity. Imagery of Landsat series (acquired in 1975, 1990, 2000 and 2010) were employed to monitor the status, trend and spatial pattern of aeolian desertification, especially to map the overall spatial pattern of ADL dynamics by proposing a new Dynamic Index (DI) in the Shiyang River Basin from 1975 to 2010. The results show a generally decreasing trend from 1975 to 2010. However, the ES ADL kept increasing throughout the whole study period. Moreover, the area of ADLs with different severity increased with increasing severity, this S and ES ADLs dominated characteristics of aeolian desertification was contrary to those sandy lands in eastern China where was dominated by SL and M ADLs. Among the three sub-periods of 1975-1990, 19902000 and 2000-2010, the first two were the restoration stage, while the last one was the expansion stage of aeolian desertification. Moreover, all these new ADLs occurred in Minqin County during 2000-2010, indicating a detrimental increase of aeolian desertification in Minqin, and the concentration of ADLs toward the lower reaches of the Shiyang River Basin. The DI works well to identify areas with desertification changes no matter the sub-periods. Moreover, DI results disclosed a stable status of aeolian desertification, and the DI decreased with increasing ADL severity. These results indicate that it will be difficult to control the expansion of aeolian desertification in Minqin County over an extended period of time. Thus, we suggest effective and long-lasting aeolian desertification control programs in the Shiyang River Basin, especially in Minqin, and SL and M ADLs should have priority in facilitating a quick reversal of aeolian desertification.

TI  - Machine Learning for Tree Species Classification Using Sentinel-2 Spectral Information, Crown Texture, and Environmental Variables
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The most recent forest-type map of the Korean Peninsula was produced in 1910. That of South Korea alone was produced since 1972; however, the forest type information of North Korea, which is an inaccessible region, is not known due to the separation after the Korean War. In this study, we developed a model to classify the five dominant tree species in North Korea (Korean red pine, Korean pine, Japanese larch, needle fir, and Oak) using satellite data and machine-learning techniques. The model was applied to the Gwangneung Forest area in South Korea; the Mt. Baekdu area of China, which borders North Korea; and to Goseong-gun, at the border of South Korea and North Korea, to evaluate the model's applicability to North Korea. Eighty-three percent accuracy was achieved in the classification of the Gwangneung Forest area. In classifying forest types in the Mt. Baekdu area and Goseong-gun, even higher accuracies of 91% and 90% were achieved, respectively. These results confirm the model's regional applicability. To expand the model for application to North Korea, a new model was developed by integrating training data from the three study areas. The integrated model's classification of forest types in Goseong-gun (South Korea) was relatively accurate (80%); thus, the model was utilized to produce a map of the predicted dominant tree species in Goseong-gun (North Korea).

TI  - Integrating In-Situ Data and RS-GIS Techniques to Identify Groundwater Potential Sites in Mountainous Regions of Taiwan
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to rapid urbanization, the development of megacities and metropolises worldwide is creating water scarcity, social-environmental risk, and challenges to the regions where water supply from rivers and alluvial aquifers is insufficient and unstable. Groundwater exploration in fractured bedrock of mountainous regions is thus a crucial issue in the search for substitute water resources. To achieve cost effectiveness on groundwater exploration, the use of comprehensive remote sensing (RS)- and geographic information system (GIS)-based models appears feasible. The required parameters selected and analyzed from the literature depend on the hydrogeological characteristics. This study intends to investigate and improve the proposed parameters and data sources upon those presented in the literature. A total of 17 hydrogeological units of concern was delineated from 105 complex geological formations of the geological sections and main rock types. The other parameters related to groundwater potential were derived from the digital elevation model and Landsat imagery. In addition, 118 drilling cores were inspected and in-situ well yield data from 72 wells were employed to assess the normalized groundwater potential index in the raster-based empirical GIS model with a higher spatial resolution. The results show that the accuracy of the interpretation of groundwater potential sites improved from 48.6% to 84.7%. The three-dimensional (3D) visualization of a thematic map integrated with satellite imagery is useful as a cost-effective approach for assessing groundwater potential.

TI  - Assimilating multi-satellite snow data in ungauged Eurasia improves the simulation accuracy of Asian monsoon seasonal anomalies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Properly initializing land snow conditions with multi-satellite data assimilation (DA) may help tackle the long-standing challenge of Asian monsoon seasonal forecasts. However, to what extent can snow DA help resolve the problem remains largely unexplored. Here we establish, for the first time, that improved springtime snow initializations assimilating the Moderate Spectral Imaging Satellite (MODIS) snow cover fraction and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage data can improve the simulation accuracy of Asian monsoon seasonal anomalies. Focusing on the western Tibetan Plateau (TP) and mid- to high-latitude Eurasia (EA), two regions where multi-satellite snow DA is critical, we found that DA influences the monsoon circulation at different months depending on the regional snow-atmosphere coupling strengths. For the pre-monsoon season, accurate initialization of the TP snow is key, and assimilating MODIS data slightly outperforms jointly assimilating MODIS and GRACE data. For the peak-monsoon season, accurate initialization of the EA snow is more important due to its long memory, and assimilating GRACE data brings the most pronounced gains. Among all the Asian monsoon subregions, the most robust improvement is seen over central north India, a likely result of the region's strong sensitivity to thermal forcing. While this study highlights complementary snow observations as promising new sources of the monsoon predictability, it also clarifies complexities in translating DA to useful monsoon forecast skill, which may help bridge the gap between land DA and dynamical climate forecasting studies.

TI  - Incorporating synthetic aperture radar and optical images to investigate the annual dynamics of anthropogenic impervious surface at large scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The area, distribution, and temporal dynamics of anthropogenic impervious surface (AIS) at large scale are significant for environmental, ecological and socio-economic studies. Remote sensing has become an important tool for monitoring large scale AIS, while it remains challenging for accurate extraction of AIS using optical datasets alone due to the high diversity of land covers over large scale. Previous studies indicated the complementary use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to improve the AIS estimation, while most of them were limited to local and small scales. The potential of SAR for large scale AIS mapping is still uncertain and under-explored. In this study, first, a machine learning framework incorporating both optical and SAR data based on Google Earth Engine platform was developed for mapping and analyzing the annual dynamics of AIS in China. Feature-level fusion for SAR and optical data across large scale was tested applicable considering the backscattering coefficients, texture measures and spectral characteristics. Improved accuracy (averaged 2% increased overall accuracy and averaged 4% increased Kappa coefficient) and better delineation between the bright impervious surface and bare land was observed comparing with using optical data alone. Second, comprehensive assessment was conducted using high-resolution samples from Google Earth, census data from China Statistic Yearbook and benchmark datasets from the GlobeLand30 and GHSL, demonstrating the feasibility and reliability of the proposed method and results. Last but not the least, we analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of AIS in China from national, regional and provincial levels.

TI  - Study on the Spatial Differentiation of the Populations on Both Sides of the "Qinling-Huaihe Line" in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The "Qinling-Huaihe Line" is the recognized geographical boundary between north and south China. In the context of a widening north-south gap, the large-scale population flow and the implementation of the regional coordinated development strategy, the north-south differentiation of the Chinese population requires further investigation. This study is based on national census data and uses quantitative methods, such as the centralization index, coefficient of variation, hot spot analysis and geodetector, as research methods. This study takes the Qinling-Huaihe Line as the dividing line and aims to extensively explore the spatial differentiation, evolutionary characteristics, and influential factors of the populations on both sides. The main conclusions are as follows: ? From 1982 to 2010, the population share ratio on the south and north sides of the Qinling-Huaihe Line remained at 58:42, showing a distribution pattern of "South more and North less". ? The area within 200 km from the Qinling-Huaihe Line is a transition area with a stable distribution of the populations on both sides. ? From 1982 to 2010, the concentration of the population distribution gradually increased on both sides, and the concentration of population on the south side was higher; the characteristics of population growth had significant spatial differences between the two sides. ? The results calculated by the geodetector method show that socioeconomic factors are the main factors causing the spatial differentiation of the populations, while physical geographical environmental factors have a smaller influence and their influence continues to decrease.

M3  - Article
AB  - Based on Landsat TM/OLI images in 2005, 2010, and 2017, we analyzed the distribution and dynamics of tidal creek and vegetation coverage (VC) in the Yellow River Delta costal wetland by remote sensing and geographic information technologies. We conducted correlation analysis between tidal gully and VC in the study area using grid search method. The results showed that vegetation coverage of coastal wetlands in the Yellow River Delta continuously increased from 2005 to 2017. The area of low vegetation coverage decreased by 233.73 km(2), while that of high vegetation coverage increased by 165.85 km(2). From 2005 to 2017, the length and area of tidal creek in the Yellow River Delta coastal wetland continuously increased, and the frequency also increased. In 2017, the length and area of tidal gully in the southeast of the coastal wetland reached 216.13 km, and the area was 22.23 km(2). From 2005 to 2017, the length of tidal creek was negatively correlated with VC, and the tidal creek in 2010 and 2017 was significantly correlated with VC (P<0.05).

TI  - Quality Assessment by Region and Land Cover of Sharpening Approaches Applied to GF-2 Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The existing pansharpening methods applied to recently obtained satellite data can produce spectral distortion. Therefore, quality assessments should be performed to address this. However, quality assessment of the whole image may not be sufficient, because major differences in a given region or land cover can be minimized by small differences in another region or land cover in the image. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the pansharpening process for different regions and land covers. In this study, the widely used modified intensity-hue-saturation (mIHS), Gram-Schmidt spectral sharpening (GS), color spectral sharpening (CN), and principal component analysis (PCA) pansharpening methods were applied to Gaofen 2 (GF-2) imagery and evaluated according to region and land-cover type, which was determined via an object-oriented image analysis technique with a support vector machine-supervised method based on several reliable quality indices at the native spatial scale without reference. Both visual and quantitative analyses based on region and land cover indicated that all four approaches satisfied the demands for improving the spatial resolution of the original GF-2 multispectral (MS) image, and mIHS produced results superior to those of the GS, CN, and PC methods by preserving image colors. The results indicated differences in the pansharpening quality among different land covers. Generally, for most land-cover types, the mIHS method better preserved the spectral information and spatial autocorrelation compared with the other methods.

TI  - Local climate zone mapping as remote sensing scene classification using deep learning: A case study of metropolitan China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China, with the world's largest population, has gone through rapid development in the last forty years and now has over 800 million urban citizens. Although urbanization leads to great social and economic progress, they may be confronted with other issues, including extra heat and air pollution. Local climate zone (LCZ), a new concept developed for urban heat island research, provides a standard classification system for the urban environment. LCZs are defined by the context of the urban environment; the minimum diameter of an LCZ is expected to be 400-1,000 m so that it can have a valid effect on the urban climate. However, most existing methods (e.g., the WUDAPT method) regard this task as pixel-based classification, neglecting the spatial information. In this study, we argue that LCZ mapping should be considered as a scene classification task to fully exploit the environmental context. Fifteen cities covering 138 million population in three economic regions of China are selected as the study area. Sentinel-2 multispectral data with a 10 m spatial resolution are used to classify LCZs. A deep convolutional neural network composed of residual learning and the Squeeze-andExcitation block, namely the LCZNet, is proposed. We obtained an overall accuracy of 88.61% by using a large image (48x48 corresponding to 480x480 m(2)) as the representation of an LCZ, 7.5% higher than that using a small image representation (10x10) and nearly 20% higher than that obtained by the standard WUDAPT method. Image sizes from 32x32 to 64x64 were found suitable for LCZ mapping, while a deeper network achieved better classification with larger inputs. Compared with natural classes, urban classes benefited more from a large input size, as it can exploit the environment context of urban areas. The combined use of the training data from all three regions led to the best classification, but the transfer of LCZ models cannot achieve satisfactory results due to the domain shift. More advanced domain adaptation methods should be applied in this application.

TI  - Understanding Land use/Land cover dynamics and impacts of human activities in the Mekong Delta over the last 40 years
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mekong Delta is the third largest delta in the world, and a globally recognized agricultural production zone and biodiversity hotspot. In recent decades, land use and land cover (LULC) in the Mekong Delta has undergone tremendous changes due to increasing anthropogenic activities. However, accurate and long-term LULC mapping products for the entire delta are scarce. This study aims to use the Landsat and Chinese HJ-1B satellite images for nearly 40 years to detect the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC in the Mekong Delta applying the classification and regression trees (CART) technique and analyze its driving factors. Seven main LULC categories were identified with an overall accuracy of 89-94%. We generated seven LULC maps of the whole Mekong Delta from 1979 to 2015 at a 30 m spatial resolution. The results showed that the area of aquaculture and residential land increased, while the area of mangroves, planting land, other forests, wasteland, and unused land decreased from 1979 to 2015. The planting land has been the dominant land use type in the delta since 1979, and still occupied over 72% of the delta area in 2015. The change to aquaculture is most pronounced in all LULC categories, with its percentage of area in the delta increasing to 19% in 2015. With the transformation of large-scale inland planting land into aquaculture ponds, aquaculture has become the second largest land use type following the planting land in the Mekong Delta from the late 20th century. Although the mangrove area showed only slight reduction during 1979-2015, the degree of patch fragmentation increased significantly. We found that the rapid changes of the LULC were mainly driven by economic development and land policies. This study gives insights into LULC dynamics and provides a valuable dataset for regional sustainable development planning and ecological assessment in the Mekong Delta. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Using the axillary reverse mapping technique to screen breast cancer patients with a high risk of lymphedema
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Preventing breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) by preserving upper lymphatic drainage is still controversial. Our study aimed to use the axillary reverse mapping (ARM) technique in patients who underwent axillary surgery to analyse the correlation between postoperative residual ARM nodes and the occurrence of lymphedema, select candidates at high risk of developing lymphedema, and analyse the oncologic safety of ARM nodes.Methods: Patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) from October 2015 to February 2016 at the Peking University People's Hospital Breast Center were prospectively recruited for the study. ARM was performed in all patients before surgery. ARM nodes were separated from SLNB and ALND specimens. Data were collected on the identification of ARM nodes before surgery, number of residual ARM nodes after surgery, nodal status, crossover rate, and correlation between residual ARM nodes and the occurrence of lymphedema.Results: The analysis included 78 patients. Of the 53 patients who underwent SLNB, crossover between ARM nodes and breast sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) was seen in 22 specimens. The incidence of ARM node metastasis was 1.89% (1/53) and 25% (9/36) in the SLNB and ALND groups, respectively. The number of positive axillary lymph nodes was associated with the involvement of ARM nodes (P = 0.036). The incidence of residual ARM nodes was significantly higher in the SLNB group than in the ALND group (67.6% vs. 37.9%, P = 0.016). The incidence of lymphedema was significantly higher in the ALND group than in the SLNB group (33.3% vs. 5.4%, P = 0.003).Conclusions: For SLNB, the ARM technique can help to resect SLNs more accurately. However, we do not recommend using the ARM technique to preserve ARM nodes in patients undergoing ALND due to oncologic safety issues. Nevertheless, we can predict patients undergoing axillary surgery who are more likely to have a high risk of lymphedema by assessing residual ARM nodes.

TI  - A MultiKernel Domain Adaptation Method for Unsupervised Transfer Learning on Cross-Source and Cross-Region Remote Sensing Data Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Labeling remote sensing data for classification is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Transfer learning (TL), under such context, is attracting increasing attention as it aims to harness information from data set of other regions where labels are readily available. The central topic of concern is to homogenize the large disparities of feature distribution of different data set through domain adaptation (DA). This article proposes a novel DA method for unsupervised TL, namely, multikernel jointly domain matching (MKJDM), which by definition considers multiple kernels as opposed to the currently popular single-kernel methods for measuring the distances between distributions. The single-kernel methods minimize the distances of feature distribution between the source domain (data set with training labels) and the target domain (data set to be classified) through, for example, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) metric, formed under a kernel function mapping, while the multikernel version (MK-MMD) uses different kernel functions to encapsulate multiple aspects of distribution discrepancies, and is, therefore, more capable of distance minimization. Our MKJDM implementation also considers simultaneously aligning marginal and class conditional distributions and reweight for each instance, which further improves the performance. Two experiments performed on remote sensing images and multi-modal data sets (i.e., Orthophoto and Digital Surface Models), with regions of different countries with distinctly different land patterns serving as source and target domain data, show that the overall accuracies are improved by 37.28 & x0025; and 46.62 & x0025; after applications of our MKJDM method. An additional comparative experiment with five state-of-the-art DA methods also demonstrates that our method achieves the best performance.

TI  - Spectral unmixing based spatiotemporal downscaling fusion approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series remote sensing data are important in monitoring land surface dynamics. Due to technical limitations, satellite sensors have a trade-off between temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions when acquiring remote sensing images. In order to obtain remote sensing images with high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency, spatiotemporal fusion methods have been developed. In this paper, we propose a Linear Spectral Unmixing-based Spatiotemporal Data Fusion Model (LSUSDFM) for spatial and temporal data fusion. In this model, the endmember abundance of the low-resolution image pixel is calculated based on that of the highresolution image by the spectral mixture analysis. The endmember spectrum signals of low-resolution images are then calculated continuously within an optimized moving window. Subsequently, the fused image is reconstructed according to the endmember spectrum and its corresponding abundance map. A simulated dataset and real satellite images are used to test the fusion model, and the fusion results are compared with a current spectral unmixing based downscaling fusion model (SUDFM). Our experimental work shows that, compared to the SUDFM, the proposed LSUSDFM can achieve better quality and accuracy of fused images, especially in effectively eliminating the "plaque" phenomenon in the results by the SUDFM. The LSUSDFM has great potential in generating images with both high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency, as well as increasing the number of spectral bands of the high spatial resolution data.

TI  - Satellite image-based investigation of the seasonal variations in the hydrological connectivity of a large floodplain (Poyang Lake, China)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological processes of floodplains in large river-lake systems are subjected to strong flood pulses from catchment flows and lake inundations. Hydrological connectivity (HC) is one of the important characteristics of floodplains that can be used to provide evidence of mass and energy transport that influences the health of ecosystems and the biological productivity of floodplain water bodies. This study used geostatistical methods in combination with remote sensing data (2000-2015) to investigate the hydrological connectivity in a complex river-lake floodplain (Nanji Wetland National Natural Reserve) of the Poyang Lake floodplain, which is naturally connected to the middle Yangtze River. The geomorphic characteristics of the study area were characterized by the connection of surface water bodies including rivers, wetlands, sub-lakes and main lake. Results of this research indicated the apparent seasonal shifts of the dominant hydrological factors that affect the spatial-temporal changes of HC. In particular, we find that the main lake stage plays a dominant role in determining the hydrological connectivity during the lake's flooding and receding periods. We also find the existence of a threshold that causes an abrupt change of HC, i.e., if the main lake stage is below this threshold, the whole system becomes weakly hydrologically-connected. This threshold is related to the local topography, but has ecological implications for the entire floodplain system. The outcomes of this research provide an improved understanding of the hydrological behaviour of the catchment-floodplain-lake system. Considering the encountering of consistent drought of the lakes in the middle Yangtze River, this work may help clarify the intensity of the drought impacts on the ecologically important floodplains, and also assist in optimizing the interactions between the lake and the Yangtze River.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of summer urban heat island in Beijing, China using an improved land surface temperature
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) is a major urban ecological environment issue, and it requires to be comprehensively understood from the perspective of temporal changes. This study investigated UHI in Beijing by building a monthly land surface temperature (LST) dataset at a fine spatial resolution in the summer from 2003 to 2018 using a data fusion method. First, we generated the monthly Landsat-like LST images. We then analyzed the temporal patterns of UHI in the past 16 years. Finally, we explored the spatial patterns of UHI. We find that UHI in Beijing experienced two phases, including the enhanced UHI concentrated in the urban area from 2003 to 2009, and the mitigated UHI dispersed in the suburban area from 2010 to 2018. The results of temporal trend analysis show that sub-districts with significant decreasing trends of UHI mainly locate in the urban center, while sub-districts with significant increasing trends of UHI mainly locate in the suburban areas. Moreover, the results of spatial clusters analysis demonstrate that the sub-districts with high UHIs concentrate in the urban center, while those with low UHIs disperse in the suburban area. The 16-year fine spatial resolution LSTs from this study offer a reliable dataset for studying the UHI in Beijing. The information on spatiotemporal patterns of UHI is of great help for urban planners to design UHI mitigation strategies for sustainable urban development. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Secchi Disk Depth Estimation from China's New Generation of GF-5 Hyperspectral Observations Using a Semi-Analytical Scheme
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity, commonly measured as the Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)), is an important parameter that depicts water quality in aquatic ecosystems. China's new generation Advanced HyperSpectral Imager (AHSI) on board the GF-5 satellite has significant potential for applications of more accurate water clarity estimation compared with existing multispectral satellite imagery, considering its high spectral resolution with a 30-m spatial resolution. In this study, we validate the semi-analytical model with various Quasi-Analytical Algorithms (QAA), including QAAV5, QAAV6, QAAL09 and QAAM14, for the AHSI images with concurrent in situ measurements in four inland water bodies with a Z(sd) range of 0.3-4.5 m. The semi-analytical method with QAAV5 can yield the most accurate Z(sd) predictions with approximated atmospheric-corrected remote sensing reflectance. For 84 concurrent sampling sites, the estimated Z(sd) had a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.35 m, while the mean relative error (MRE) was 25.3%. Specifically, the MAEs of estimated Z(sd) were 0.22, 0.46, and 0.24 m for Z(sd) of 0.3-1, 1-3, and 3-4.5 m, respectively. The corresponding MREs were 33.1%, 29.1% and 6.3%, respectively. Although further validation is still required, especially in terms of highly turbid waters, this study indicates that AHSI is effective for water clarity monitoring.

TI  - Joint Effect of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> Invasion and Reclamation on the Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Tidal Flats in Yangtze River Estuary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats, which are non-vegetated land-sea transition areas, have an important ecological function in the global ecosystem. However, they have been shrinking in recent years due to natural and anthropogenic activities. Although many studies focus on tidal flats in the Yangtze River estuary (YRE) in China, how reclamation and plant invasion affect the expansion and erosion of tidal flats are still unclear. In this study, we analyzed all of the available Landsat TM/ETM+ /OLI imagery from the period 1996 to 2018 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to obtain annual maps of coastal tidal flats of YRE at 30 m spatial resolution. We chose three sample tidal flats where severe Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) invasion, reclamation, and control areas existed to explore the joint impact of plant invasion and reclamation on tidal flats. We also point out the main driving factor of tidal flat expansion of each island in YRE by multiple linear regression. Our results suggest that the tidal flats of YRE had obvious expansion from 1996 to 2018, and the speed of expansion is getting slower because of the decreasing deposits in the Yangtze River. Invasive S. alterniflora is effective at promoting silting, and tidal flats with S. alterniflora invasion expanded 2.54 times faster than the control group. Chongming and Hengsha Islands were mainly affected by sediment concentration, while Changxing and Jiuduansha Islands were affected by reclamation and S. alterniflora invasion, respectively. The results could be used to support coastal zone management and biodiversity conservation of the YRE.

AB  - Background Staged expander to implant breast reconstruction is associated with a high complication rate when the patient has had postmastectomy radiation. With an increasing number of American women undergoing implant-based breast reconstruction after postmastectomy radiation, surgeons may find themselves operating in a radiated field with synthetic devices. We report the performance characteristics of a novel surgical modification to the second stage expander to implant exchange after adjuvant radiation using a transaxillary approach through a prior sentinel lymph node incision, a site remote from the breast implant pocket. Methods We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database to evaluate the surgical outcomes of serial patients undergoing second staged expander to implant exchange through the sentinel lymph node incision 6 months or more after completing whole breast radiation. A case matched cohort to age, body mass index, and comorbid status was used to compare outcomes between patients in the group of interest versus a traditional skin sparing incision on the anterior breast mound through the radiated skin envelope. All patients included demonstrated grade 1 or 2 skin changes on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema for the skin organ system. Results Nineteen breasts were reconstructed for 18 women after immediate tissue expander placement and adjuvant whole breast radiation were included in our group of interest. Forty-one case-matched second controls were identified for the comparison group. There were no intraoperative complications. Two postoperative complications were reported for the sentinel lymph node approach group (10.5%) with an average of 9 months of follow-up: 1 operative exploration for hematoma and 1 minor wound requiring recloser in the office. The case matched cohort demonstrated significantly more minor postoperative complications (P= 0.037) with a total complications rate of 41.4%. There were 31.7% of the patients that experienced a minor complication alone, whereas 9.7% of the case-matched cohort experienced a major complication. Conclusions These data support the use of the existing axillary sentinel lymph node access incision for second stage placement of a gel implant after immediate expander and adjuvant radiation therapy. The sentinel lymph node incision approach facilitates layered closure over the breast pocket at a site remote from irradiated tissue, reducing the incidence of postoperative minor complications. Forthcoming long-term data will determine if differences in reported capsular contracture rates can be achieved with a remote transaxillary approach to second stage implant reconstruction after radiation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation is important for hydrological modelling and water management for irrigation. The present study estimates the reference evapotranspiration using FAO Penman-Monteith (FAO P-M) method and SWAT hydrological model, and its spatial variation during ENSO events during 1996 to 2013. The spatial variation of crop coefficient and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) is also analyzed. The results from these methods are compared for various El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and normal years. MODIS NDVI data was used to generate crop coefficients which were further used for generation of ETa.The results show that the ET0 estimated using FAO P-M is less during the pre-monsoon period than ET0 estimated using SWAT model. ET(0 )values from FAO P-M show decreasing trends while those by SWAT show increasing trends. Also, ET0 shows higher values during post monsoon period of El Nino years as compared to La Niha and normal years.

TI  - Detecting Long Time Changes in Benthic Macroalgal Cover Using Landsat Image Archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal macroalgae worldwide provide multiple ecological functions and support vital ecosystem services. Thereby, it is important to monitor changes in the extent of benthic macroalgal cover. However, as in situ sampling is costly and time-consuming, areal estimates of macroalgal species cover are often based only on a limited number of samples. This low sampling effort likely yields very biased estimates, as macroalgal communities are often characterized by large spatial variability at multiple spatial scales. Moreover, ecological time series are often short-term, making it impossible to assess changes in algal communities over decades and relate this to different human pressures and/or climate change. The Landsat series satellites have operated for 40 years. In the current study, we tested if the Landsat sensors could be used for mapping the cover of shallow water benthic macroalgae. This study was carried out at two sites in the West Estonian Archipelago, in the northeastern Baltic Sea. Our results show that the Landsat imagery accurately reflected both spatial and temporal variability in benthic algal cover. To conclude, the current methodology can be used to improve the existing assessments of areal macroalgal cover, or to estimate the cover values, in areas and times lacking ecological observations.

TI  - A Case Study of Novel Landslide Activity Recognition Using ALOS-1 InSAR within the Ragged Mountain Western Hillslope in Gunnison County, Colorado, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The "East Muddy Creek Landslide Complex" in Gunnison County, Colorado, USA destroyed Colorado State Highway 133 from 1986 to 1987 and has been investigated over decades during different periods of reactivation. This paper presents a case study of novel landslide activity recognition related to the landslide complex using Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 (ALOS-1) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) analysis. We compare the result from ALOS-1 InSAR analysis to landslide recognition investigations from traditional field methods for ground motions at a watershed scale. Line of Sight (LOS) velocity mapping is used to characterize displacement zonation, failure modes, and hazard assessment activities. Mass wasting estimates using existing geological modeling are discussed in terms of potential of landslide element dynamics. ALOS-1 InSAR analysis reveals newly detected ground displacement at very slow to extremely slow velocities with a significantly increased spatial extent. The implications of expanded displacement activity in the context of landslide geomorphology, mountain denudation, exhumation, and future monitoring efforts for hazard and risk assessment are also examined and discussed.

TI  - Optical interpretation of oil emulsions in the ocean - Part II: Applications to multi-band coarse-resolution imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water in oil (WO) and oil in water (OW) emulsions from marine oil spills have different physical properties, volume concentrations, and spectral characteristics. Identification and quantification of these different types of oil emulsions are important for oil spill response and post-spill assessment. While the spectral characteristics of WO and OW emulsions have been presented in previous studies including Part I of this series, their application to airborne and satellite imagery is further demonstrated here. Using AVIRIS and Landsat observations, we firstly show that false color Red-Green-Blue composite images from Landsat-like sensors (R: 1677 nm, G: 839 nm, B: 660 nm) are effective in differentiating WO and OW emulsions as they show reddish and greenish colors, respectively, in such composite images. This is a consequence of the relative difference in the reflectance of WO and OW emulsions at 1677 and 839 nm, which is not impacted by the presence of medium-strength sunglint or the surface heterogeneity within medium-resolution pixels (e.g., 30 m). Based on image statistics, a decision tree method is proposed to classify oil type, and oil quantification is further attempted, with results partially validated through spectral analysis and spatial coherence test. The numerical mixing experiments using AVIRIS pixels further indicate that the SWIR bands might be used to develop linear unmixing models in the future once the coarse-resolution oiled pixels are first classified to WO and OW types, and 1295 nm is the optimal wavelength to perform spectral unmixing of mixed coarse-resolution pixels.

TI  - Preoperative Axillary Ultrasound Helps in the Identification of a Limited Nodal Burden in Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - ULTRASOUND QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the Z0011 trial, the clinical evaluation of axillary status has been redirected to predicting nodal tumor burden rather than nodal metastases. Our study aimed to evaluate the value of clinicopathological factors and axillary ultrasound (US) for the prediction of a high nodal burden (>= 3 metastatic lymph nodes) in breast cancer patients. A total of 532 consecutive patients who underwent preoperative axillary US and subsequent surgery for clinical T1-2 breast cancer with a final pathologic analysis were included. Clinical and pathologic variables were retrospectively evaluated. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to identify the variables that were associated with a high nodal burden. Among the 532 patients, 110 (20.7%) had a high axillary nodal burden and 422 (79.3%) had a limited nodal burden. The multivariate analysis showed that suspicious axillary US findings (P< 0.001), clinical T2 stage (P= 0.011), the presence of lymphovascular invasion (P< 0.001), and estrogen receptor positivity (P< 0.001) were significantly associated with a high nodal burden. Patients with negative axillary US findings seldom had a high nodal burden, with a negative predictive value of 93.0% (294/316). Patients with suspicious axillary US findings, clinical T2 stage, lymphovascular invasion, and estrogen receptor positivity are more likely to have a high nodal burden, which may provide additional information for the treatment plan of breast cancer patients. Preoperative axillary US helps identify a limited nodal burden in breast cancer patients and has implications for axillary lymph node dissection and adjuvant treatment.

TI  - Intracystic papillary carcinoma of the breast in males Three case reports
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: Intracystic papillary breast carcinoma is extremely rare in males with a favorable prognosis. Clinical and mammographic manifestations of IPC are not specific, and no consensus has been reached on its management. Patient concerns: Three cases of IPC of the breast in male patients who underwent surgery are presented. In each patient, clinical manifestations, radiological appearance, surgical procedures, pathological diagnosis, and prognosis were investigated. Diagnosis: Ultrasonography showed a complex mass with cystic and nodular solid components in 2 patients and a solid hypoechoic mass in the other 1. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography(CEUS) was performed for 1 patient demonstrated a solid component of the characteristic enhancement patterns. The final diagnosis of IPC was made after an excisional biopsy. Interventions: A mastectomy with sentinel lymph node mapping was carried out in 2 patients, and it was negative for metastatic disease. The third patient received a mastectomy without an investigation of the axillary lymph node status. Outcomes: All the patients are disease-free during a median follow-up of 67 months (range, 13-120) months. Lessons: It is difficult to diagnose IPC of the male breast before surgery, excisional biopsy is necessary. CEUS can be useful to diagnose IPC in male patients in the preoperative evaluation. Sentinel node biopsy may be considered in patients with IPC associated with DCIS or invasive carcinoma.

TI  - Effect of northern boreal forest fires on PAH fluctuations across the arctic
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are formed by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and forest or biomass burning. PAHs undergo long-range atmospheric transport, as evidenced by in situ observations across the Arctic. However, monitored atmospheric concentrations of PAHs indicate that ambient PAH levels in the Arctic do not follow the declining trend of worldwide anthropogenic PAH emissions since the 2000s, suggesting missing sources of PAHs in the Arctic or other places across the Northern Hemisphere. To trace origins and causes for the increasing trend of PAHs in the Arctic, the present study reconstructed PAH emissions from forest fires in the northern boreal forest derived by combining forest carbon stocks and MODIS burned area. We examined the statistical relationships of forest biomass, MODIS burned area, emission factors, and combustion efficiency with different PAH congeners. These relationships were then employed to construct PAH emission inventories from forest biomass burning. We show that for some PAH congeners, for example, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)-the forest-fire-induced air emissions are almost one order of magnitude higher than previous emission inventories in the Arctic. A global-scale atmospheric chemistry model, GEOS-Chem, was used to simulate air concentrations of BaP, a representative PAH congener primarily emitted from biomass burning, and to quantify the response of BaP to wildfires in the northern boreal forest. The results showed that BaP emissions from wildfires across the northern boreal forest region played a significant role in the contamination and interannual fluctuations of BaP in Arctic air. A source-tagging technique was applied in tracking the origins of BaP pollution from different northern boreal forest regions. We also show that the response of BaP pollution at different Arctic monitoring sites depends on the intensity of human activities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping Long-Term Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Pen Aquaculture in a Shallow Lake: Less Aquaculture Coming along Better Water Quality
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pen aquaculture is the main form of aquaculture in some shallow lakes in eastern China. It is valuable to map the spatiotemporal changes of pen aquaculture in eutrophic lakes to assess its effect on water quality, thereby helping the relevant decision-making agencies to manage the water quality (WQ) of lakes. In this study, an automatic approach for extracting the pen aquaculture area was developed based on Landsat data. The approach integrates five algorithms, including grey transformation, discrete wavelet transform, fast Fourier transform, singular value decomposition and k-nearest neighbor classification. It was successfully applied in the automatic mapping of the pen aquaculture areas in Lake Yangcheng from 1990 to 2016. The overall accuracies were greater than 92%. The result indicted that the practice of pen aquaculture experienced five stages, with the general area increasing in the beginning and decreasing by the end of the last stage. Meanwhile, the changes of nine WQ parameters observed from 2000 to 2016, such as ammonia (NH3-N), pH, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemiluminescence detection of permanganate index (CODMn), Secchi disk depth (SDD) and dissolved oxygen (DO), were analyzed in the lake sectors of Lake Yangcheng, and then their relationships were explored with the percentage of pen aquaculture area. The result suggested that the percentage of pen aquaculture area exhibits significantly positive correlations with NH3-N, TN, TP, chlorophyll a, BOD and CODMn, but significantly negative correlations with SDD and DO. The experimental results may offer an important implication for managing similar shallow lakes with pen aquaculture expansion and water pollution problems.

TI  - Rheology of the Zagros Lithosphere from Post-Seismic Deformation of the 2017 Mw7.3 Kermanshah, Iraq, Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We use 2018-2020 Sentinel-1 InSAR time series data to study post-seismic deformation processes following the 2017 Mw 7.3 Kermanshah, Iraq earthquake. We remove displacements caused by two large aftershock sequences from the displacement field. We find that for a six month period the response is dominated by afterslip along the up-dip extension of the coseismic rupture zone, producing up to 6 cm of radar line-of-sight displacements. The moment magnitude of afterslip is Mw 5.9 or 12% of the mainshock moment. After that period, the displacement field is best explained by viscoelastic relaxation and a lower crustal viscosity of eta(lc) = 1(-0.4)(+0.8) x 10(19) Pas. The viscosity of the uppermost mantle is not constrained by the data, except that it is larger than 0.6 x 10(19) Pas. The relatively high lower crustal and uppermost mantle viscosities are consistent with a cold and dry lithosphere of the Zagros region.

TI  - Accelerating a Geometrical Approximated PCA Algorithm Using AVX2 and CUDA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data has known an explosive growth in the past decade. This has led to the need for efficient dimensionality reduction techniques, mathematical procedures that transform the high-dimensional data into a meaningful, reduced representation. Projection Pursuit (PP) based algorithms were shown to be efficient solutions for performing dimensionality reduction on large datasets by searching low-dimensional projections of the data where meaningful structures are exposed. However, PP faces computational difficulties in dealing with very large datasets-which are common in hyperspectral imaging, thus raising the challenge for implementing such algorithms using the latest High Performance Computing approaches. In this paper, a PP-based geometrical approximated Principal Component Analysis algorithm (gaPCA) for hyperspectral image analysis is implemented and assessed on multi-core Central Processing Units (CPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and multi-core CPUs using Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) AVX2 (Advanced Vector eXtensions) intrinsics, which provide significant improvements in performance and energy usage over the single-core implementation. Thus, this paper presents a cross-platform and cross-language perspective, having several implementations of the gaPCA algorithm in Matlab, Python, C++ and GPU implementations based on NVIDIA Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). The evaluation of the proposed solutions is performed with respect to the execution time and energy consumption. The experimental evaluation has shown not only the advantage of using CUDA programming in implementing the gaPCA algorithm on a GPU in terms of performance and energy consumption, but also significant benefits in implementing it on the multi-core CPU using AVX2 intrinsics.

TI  - Distribution of small seasonal reservoirs in semi-arid regions and associated evaporative losses
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - To support the increasing demand of a growing population for freshwater, small-sized (<0.1 km(2)) water reservoirs are necessary in areas with limited infrastructure, especially in water-stressed regions having seasonal and variable precipitation. Seasonal storage in small reservoirs is often overlooked in present inventories. Accordingly, we assessed the current state in semi-arid regions using highly resolved Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Globally, about 3 million small reservoirs are in operation in semi-arid regions having a total water surface area of 17 800 km(2) and seasonal storage of 37 km(3), supporting 15% of the world's population in semi-arid regions. Estimated upper-bound of evaporative losses represent 38% (14 km(3)) of storage during dry season. The study estimates the evaporation suppression using floating covers and lays foundation to assess the feasibility of this technical solution to increase water savings.Significance and originality statementThis study provides new insights into the distribution of seasonal freshwater storage in water stressed regions that support large rural population. We provide the first baseline dataset of this distributed freshwater resource to better assess the sustainability of communities in semi-arid regions with chronic water shortages. Water storage in semi-arid regions is subject to potential evaporative losses of nearly 40% of the stored water. We analyzed conditions where evaporative losses could be significantly reduced using floating covers, a simple and scalable solution suitable for regions with underdeveloped economies. The study as well ranks regions with highest potential benefits from evaporation suppression measures.

TI  - Evaluating glacier surges in Karakoram region using earth observation data
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - A glacier is said to be in a state of surge if it has abnormally high velocity and advances very rapidly (10-100 times faster than normal) in a short period of time (lasting few months to a few years). The glacier velocities can be easily assessed using feature-tracking techniques and image correlation algorithms. The applications of multi-source remotely sensed imagery from open source platforms for understanding glacier surges has been discussed in this paper. This paper draws insights for understanding glacier surges in Karakoram region using remote sensing data from two recently published papers (Rashid et al., 2020, 2018). The use of remote sensing data from United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Planet Labs for assessing glacier surface velocity, movement/advance of snout, supraglacial debris cover dynamics and evolution of ice-dammed lake has been discussed.

TI  - A prospective study of receptor profiles in breast cancer and the ipsilateral axillary lymph node metastases measured simultaneously in treatment naive cases
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The heterogeneity of receptor profiles in breast cancer is well known. The differing receptor profiles of primary breast cancer and nodal metastases have been investigated and found to range between 10-50% depending on the hormone receptor tested. A study comparing the hormone status of primary breast cancers and the synchronous ipsilateral involved sentinel lymph node has not been performed in a South African population.Method: This is a prospective study where two specialist radiologists performed the simultaneous core needle biopsies of the primary breast cancer and the clinically positive axillary nodes. All receptor status analysis was conducted by one specialist histopathologist.Results: Of 141 patients who gave written informed consent for this study, 29 were excluded; 112 patients met the inclusion criteria. Anonymised demographics of age, clinical stage, HIV status and metastatic screening were recorded. The simultaneous biopsies and receptor measurements identified 10 patients with discordant receptor status in the positive axillary lymph nodes. In each case, the receptor profile of the axillary lymphatic metastases was more aggressive than that of the primary tumour. The luminal A subtype had a significantly greater risk of discordance than other subtypes (p = 0.02).Conclusion: Core needle biopsy and receptor analysis should be considered on the positive axillary nodes in breast cancer patients. Adjuvant treatment should be targeted to the receptor profile of the lymph node metastases.

TI  - Comparison of pixel unmixing models in the evaluation of post-fire forest resilience based on temporal series of satellite imagery at moderate and very high spatial resolution
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Mediterranean fire-prone ecosystems, shifts in fire regime as a consequence of global change could modify the resilience of vegetation communities. In this paper, we aim to compare the efficiency of high and moderate spatial resolution satellite imagery in the evaluation of resilience in a fire-prone landscape under different fire regime categories using two pixel unmixing techniques. A time series of Landsat (ETM + and OLI; spatial resolution of 30 m) and WorldView-2 (spatial resolution of 2 m) imagery collected between 2011 (pre-fire conditions) and 2016 were used to estimate the temporal variation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) as a quantitative measure of forest resilience. For this time series, FVC was computed under four fire-regime categories of recurrence and severity using two approaches: dimidiate pixel model and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). The dimidiate pixel model was computed using NDVI as spectral response for the case of Landsat imagery and NDVI and red-edge NDVI (RENDVI) for WorldView-2. MESMA was applied to unmix WorldView-2 and Landsat imagery into four fraction images: photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photo-synthetic vegetation (NPV), soil and shade. The PV shade normalized fraction corresponds to the FVC. In summer of 2016 we established 85 30 x 30 m field plots and 360 2 x 2 m field plots to measure the percentage of total vegetation cover in order to validate the FVC estimates made from remote sensing data. The FVC time series showed the same general pattern with both spatial scales and modeling approaches, high fire recurrence categories registering the highest resilience. The accuracy of the dimidiate pixel model was significantly higher for WorldView-2 based estimates (RMSE: 5-10%) than for Landsat (RMSE: 10-15%). The dimidiate pixel model computed from NDVI for both Landsat and WorldView-2 underestimated FVC at high field-sampled vegetation cover, while MESMA estimations were accurate for the entire range of vegetation cover for both satellites. The fraction of photosynthetic vegetation calculated using WorldView-2 had a higher performance (RMSE: 4-6%) than that quantified from Landsat (RMSE: 6-8%). The linear relationships assumed for validation purposes were statistically significant for both sensors and modeling approaches. Our study demonstrates the highest performance of very high spatial resolution satellite imagery and MESMA models in the quantitative estimation of FVC as a measure of post-fire resilience.

TI  - Monitoring vegetation using remote sensing time series data: a review of the period 1996-2017
T2  - REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Review
AB  - Analyzing time series data with remote sensing provides a better understanding of vegetation dynamics, since previous conditions and changes that have occurred over a given period are known. The objective of this paper was to analyze the current status and recent advances in the use of time series data obtained from remote sensors for vegetation monitoring. A systematic search of scientific papers was performed and 167 papers were found, published during the period 1996 to 2017. No significant difference in the amount of years analyzed was found between time series analyzed with a single sensor and those analyzed with a combination of several sensors (i.e. Landsat and SPOT, Landsat and Sentinel, among others). However, the combination of data from different sensors (fusion of images) can improve the quality of the results. Special attention must also be given to the fusion of optical and radar data, since this offers more unique spectral and structural information for land cover and land use assessments.

TI  - National wetland mapping in China: A new product resulting from object-based and hierarchical classification of Landsat 8 OLI images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially and thematically explicit information of wetlands is important to understanding ecosystem functions and services, as well as for establishment of management policy and implementation. However, accurate wetland mapping is limited due to lacking an operational classification system and an effective classification approach at a large scale. This study was aimed to map wetlands in China by developing a hybrid object-based and hierarchical classification approach (HOHC) and a new wetland classification system for remote sensing. Application of the hybrid approach and the wetland classification system to Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data resulted in a wetland map of China with an overall classification accuracy of 95.1%. This national scale wetland map, so named CAS_Wetlands, reveals that China's wetland area is estimated to be 451,084 +/- 2014 km(2), of which 70.5% is accounted by inland wetlands. Of the 14 sub-categories, inland marsh has the largest area (152,429 +/- 373 km(2)), while coastal swamp has the smallest coverage (259 +/- 15 km(2)). Geospatial variations in wetland areas at multiple scales indicate that China's wetlands mostly present in Tibet, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, and Xinjiang Provinces. This new map provides a new baseline data to establish multi-temporal and continuous datasets for China's wetlands and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Remote Sensing Applications for Monitoring Terrestrial Protected Areas: Progress in the Last Decade
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Terrestrial protected areas (PAs) play an essential role in maintaining biodiversity and ecological processes worldwide, and the monitoring of PAs is a useful tool in assessing the effectiveness of PA management. Advanced remote sensing technologies have been increasingly used for mapping and monitoring the dynamics of PAs. We review the advances in remote sensing-based approaches for monitoring terrestrial PAs in the last decade and identify four types of studies in this field: land use & land cover and vegetation community classification, vegetation structure quantification, natural disturbance monitoring, and land use & land cover and vegetation dynamic analysis. We systematically discuss the satellite data and methods used for monitoring PAs for the four research objectives. Moreover, we summarize the approaches used in the different types of studies. The following suggestions are provided for future studies: (1) development of remote sensing frameworks for local PA monitoring worldwide; (2) comprehensive utilization of multisource remote sensing data; (3) improving methods to investigate the details of PA dynamics; (4) discovering the driving forces and providing measures for PA management. Overall, the integration of remote sensing data and advanced processing methods can support PA management and decision-making procedures.

TI  - Improving Spatial Resolution of Multispectral Rock Outcrop Images Using RGB Data and Artificial Neural Networks
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral information provided by multispectral and hyperspectral sensors has a great impact on remote sensing studies, easing the identification of carbonate outcrops that contribute to a better understanding of petroleum reservoirs. Sensors aboard satellites like Landsat series, which have data freely available usually lack the spatial resolution that suborbital sensors have. Many techniques have been developed to improve spatial resolution through data fusion. However, most of them have serious limitations regarding application and scale. Recently Super-Resolution (SR) convolution neural networks have been tested with encouraging results. However, they require large datasets, more time and computational power for training. To overcome these limitations, this work aims to increase the spatial resolution of multispectral bands from the Landsat satellite database using a modified artificial neural network that uses pixel kernels of a single spatial high-resolution RGB image from Google Earth as input. The methodology was validated with a common dataset of indoor images as well as a specific area of Landsat 8. Different downsized scale inputs were used for training where the validation used the ground truth of the original size images, obtaining comparable results to the recent works. With the method validated, we generated high spatial resolution spectral bands based on RGB images from Google Earth on a carbonated outcrop area, which were then properly classified according to the soil spectral responses making use of the advantage of a higher spatial resolution dataset.

TI  - Regional Tropical Aboveground Biomass Mapping with L-Band Repeat-Pass Interferometric Radar, Sparse Lidar, and Multiscale Superpixels
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce a multiscale superpixel approach that leverages repeat-pass interferometric coherence and sparse AGB estimates from a simulated spaceborne lidar in order to extend the NISAR mission's applicable range of aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests. Airborne and spaceborne L-band radar and full-waveform airborne lidar data are used to simulate the NISAR and GEDI mission, respectively. In addition to UAVSAR data, we use spaceborne ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 imagery with 14-day temporal baseline, which is comparable to NISAR's 12-day baseline. Our reference AGB maps are derived from the airborne LVIS data during the AfriSAR campaign for three sites (Mondah, Ogooue, and Lope). Each tropical site has mean AGB of at least 125 Mg/ha in addition to areas with AGB exceeding 700 Mg/ha. Spatially sampling from these LVIS-derived AGB reference maps, we approximate GEDI AGB estimates. To evaluate our methodology, we perform several different analyses. First, we partition each study site into low (<= 100 Mg/ha) and high (>100 Mg/ha) AGB areas, in conformity with the NISAR mission requirement to provide AGB estimates for forests between 0 and 100 Mg/ha with a RMSE below 20 Mg/ha. In the low AGB areas, this RMSE requirement is satisfied in Lope and Mondah and it fell short of the requirement in Ogooue by less 3 Mg/ha with UAVSAR and 6 Mg/ha with PALSAR-2. We note that our maps have finer spatial resolution (50 m) than NISAR requires (1 hectare). In the high AGB areas, the normalized RMSE increases to 51% (i.e., <90 Mg/ha), but with negligible bias for all three sites. Second, we train a single model to estimate AGB across both high and low AGB regimes simultaneously and obtain a normalized RMSE that is <60% (or <100 Mg/ha). Lastly, we show the use of both (a) multiscale superpixels and (b) interferometric coherence significantly improves the accuracy of the AGB estimates. The InSAR coherence improved the RMSE by approximately 8% at Mondah with both sensors, lowering the RMSE from 59 Mg/ha to 47.4 Mg/h with UAVSAR and from 57.1 Mg/ha to 46 Mg/ha. This work illustrates one of the numerous synergistic relationships between the spaceborne lidars, such as GEDI, with L-band SAR, such as PALSAR-2 and NISAR, in order to produce robust regional AGB in high biomass tropical regions.

TI  - Estimation of the surface temperature in historical Landsat 5 images by means of single-channel atmospheric correction in the thermal for the Tempisque-Bebedero river basin (Costa Rica)
T2  - REVISTA GEOGRAFICA DE AMERICA CENTRAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decades, the use of satellite images has increased to the point of constituting a fundamental tool in monitoring environmental processes and global change. In this sense, the historical importance of the Landsat satellite family marks a milestone in 1985 with the introduction of the Tematic Mapper sensor, which offered users the possibility of acquiring information from a historical base of more than 25 years of thermal images at 120 meters of spatial resolution. This work is presented as a methodology for obtaining surface temperature from a temporal series of Landsat-5 TM images acquired in 2001 over the northern Pacific of Costa Rica. The different algorithms that can be used to estimate surface temperature from Landsat data with the single-channel method by the inverse Planck function are presented. Aspects such as the average transmissivity of the atmosphere, the ascending and descending radiance, or the emissivity of the Earth's surface were taken into account, prior to calculating the brightness temperature of the images.

TI  - Bifocal Dual-Reflectarray Antenna to Generate a Complete Multiple Spot Beam Coverage for Satellite Communications in Ka-Band
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel multibeam transmitting dual-reflectarray antenna able to generate a complete multiple spot coverage from a geostationary satellite in Ka-band (20 GHz). The bifocal design technique has been exploited for the first time to reduce by 50% the beam deviation factor with respect to the equivalent monofocal antenna, allowing to produce adjacent beams separated by only 0.56 degrees in the antenna offset plane. In order to guarantee an acceptable spillover, the main reflectarray has been oversized in the same plane where the beams are compressed, resulting in an elliptical reflectarray of 3.5 m x 1.8 m. The interleaved beams required to provide the complete multi-spot coverage are produced in the orthogonal polarization, using the same aperture and feeds. The proposed antenna requires a smaller main aperture (about half of the area) and a lower number of feeds than other configurations that use a single oversized reflector to generate a complete multi-spot coverage, showing promising results for communication satellite applications in the Ka-band.

TI  - Ground Surface Deformation Detection in Complex Landslide Area-Bobonaro, Timor-Leste-Using SBAS DInSAR, UAV Photogrammetry, and Field Observations
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - During the past 10 years, Timor-Leste has concentrated all its efforts on infrastructure development. However, it has not achieved enough due to unexpected ground deformation in mountainous areas that is seriously affecting road constructions, etc. In order to design roads and other infrastructure under such difficult conditions, it is important to know the present and future ground conditions. Continuous monitoring is a significant methods of detecting ground deformation and providing essential information to realize an effective design. The problem arises of "How can ground deformation be monitored in extensive areas, which are generally located in mountain areas that are difficult to access?" Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) has recently been applied to monitor displacement in extensive areas. In addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry is useful for detecting the deformation in detail. Both methods are advantageous in that they do not require any sensors. Therefore, the combination of DInSAR and UAV photogrammetry is one of the solutions for monitoring the ground deformation in Timor-Leste. In this paper, DInSAR and UAV photogrammetry are applied to unstable ground in the Bobonaro region of Timor-Leste to find the recent ground deformation, since 2007, due to earthquakes and hard rainfall events. It is found that DInSAR is useful for screening usual and unusual ground behavior and that UAV photogrammetry is flexible to use and can detect displacements with cm accuracy after the DInSAR screening.

TI  - The Song Narrative as an Expression of the Verbal Culture of Siberia in George Grebenstchikoff's Fairy Tale "Khan Altai" and Its English Self-Translation
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the functioning of song passages in George Grebenstchikoff's fairytale "Khan Altai". It was first published in the Riga journal Perezvony in 1928 and belongs to the initial stage of the writer's work after his emigration to the United States. The English-language self-translation of the fairy tale was created in the 1940s and has not been published. The Archive of the Museum of Fine Arts (Barnaul) has five versions of the translation. In the fairy tale, the image of Altai plays the central role. The aim of the study is to identify ways of creating the song passages, their functioning in the text, and their influence on the tale's poetics. The material consists of 12 passages. Grebenstchikoff created them on the basis of traditional folk songs, which influenced the form, the composition, and the system of images. The song fragments are written in unrhymed blank verse, stylized as translations of Altai folklore. The author accentuates the song passages graphically and intonationally: they differ from the context by the characteristics of the verse. The literary analysis made during the study showed the following results. Grebenstchikoff's appeal to the folk tradition is manifested in the choice of the form of the song passages. He uses an amoebean design based on the parallelism of compositionally significant parts and images. The clarity of the song rhythm of the Russian unrhymed poetic text is achieved through inversion ("Were I into a bird to turn - by the entrance of her wigwam I would sit"), lexical repetitions ("Oh, come, come, come, Katun-Su!"), syntactic parallelism ("Tell, then, to my father that as a hero in battle I fell, // And to my mother that fifteen wounds I had received!"). When creating the English self-translation, Grebenstchikoff used the same strategies as in the original work. The analysis shows the high accuracy of the translation: all the passages were translated and arranged graphically in the same way, the climax aspects of the songs were also transmitted with high accuracy. The line and stanza division of the text was also preserved, and the compositional characteristics of the amoebean design were transferred to the English text. In the final part of the article, the author draws a number of conclusions. The form of the song passages in "Khan-Altai" serves as a means of constructing characterology and adds a sacred motif to the images of the fairy tale. In the tale and its translation, psychological parallelism is used, based on the animistic worldview. The preservation of the native culture in exile, thoughts about the self-determination of Russia, Siberia and Altai led Grebenstchikoff to work on translating poetic monuments in the space of another linguaculture, to appeal to traditional Altai folklore, on the one hand, and to choose a fairy tale plot, on the other.

TI  - Automated High-Resolution Time Series Mapping of Mangrove Forests Damaged by Hurricane Irma in Southwest Florida
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In September of 2017, Hurricane Irma made landfall within the Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve of southwest Florida (USA) as a category 3 storm with winds in excess of 200 km h(-1). We mapped the extent of the hurricane's impact on coastal land cover with a seasonal time series of satellite imagery. Very high-resolution (i.e., <5 m pixel) satellite imagery has proven effective to map wetland ecosystems, but challenges in data acquisition and storage, algorithm training, and image processing have prevented large-scale and time-series mapping of these data. We describe our approach to address these issues to evaluate Rookery Bay ecosystem damage and recovery using 91 WorldView-2 satellite images collected between 2010 and 2018 mapped using automated techniques and validated with a field campaign. Land cover was classified seasonally at 2 m resolution (i.e., healthy mangrove, degraded mangrove, upland, soil, and water) with an overall accuracy of 82%. Digital change detection methods show that hurricane-related degradation was 17% of mangrove forest (similar to 5 km(2)). Approximately 35% (1.7 km(2)) of this loss recovered one year after Hurricane Irma. The approach completed the mapping approximately 200 times faster than existing methods, illustrating the ease with which regional high-resolution mapping may be accomplished efficiently.

TI  - A Monk for All Seasons: Visions of Jien (1155-1225) in Medieval Japan
T2  - HARVARD JOURNAL OF ASIATIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Jien's familial connection to the highest echelons of state bureaucracy ensured his rapid rise and fall within the Tendai Buddhist establishment, illustrating his duality as cleric and worldly politician. Yet the divided portrait of Jien refracted by different academic disciplines obscures Jien's life and motivations. Using materials written by and about him, I examine Jien's rise to prominence, his connection to the power centers of his day, his role as a spiritual authority, his investiture of land and positions to his disciples, and his often-ignored role as a prophetic visionary to paint a more holistic picture of his life. I argue that Jien held a consistent spiritually infused worldview most visible during a confrontation with his former sovereign, Retired Emperor Gotoba, on the eve of the Jakyu War (12.21). I argue we can only understand that confrontation by reconciling his political interests and his religious faith.

TI  - Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma of the Ovary and Fallopian Tube Rare Neoplasms Associated With Germline and Somatic <i>DICER1</i> Mutations
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - DICER1 mutations (somatic or germline) are associated with a variety of uncommon neoplasms including cervical and genitourinary embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS). We report a primary ovarian and 2 primary fallopian tube ERMS occurring in 60-, 13-, and 14-year-olds, respectively. The 3 neoplasms exhibited a similar morphologic appearance being polypoid and containing edematous hypocellular areas and hypercellular foci composed of small cells with scant cytoplasm exhibiting rhabdomyoblastic differentiation (desmin, myogenin, myoD1 positive). There was cellular cartilage in all cases and extensive foci of anaplasia, eosinophilic globules, and bone/osteoid in 1 case each. All 3 neoplasms exhibited DICER1 mutations; in 1 of the tubal cases, the patient had a germline mutation and in the other 2 cases, the DICER1 mutations were somatic. Accompanying DICER1 "second hits" were identified in all cases. In 2 of the neoplasms, SALL4-positive glandular structures were present which we speculate may represent an unusual primitive "metaplastic" phenomenon. Our study adds to the literature on ERMS at unusual sites associated with DICER1 mutations. ERMS arising at such sites, especially when they contain cartilage or bone/osteoid, are especially likely to be associated with DICER1 mutations. Pathologists should be aware of this as these may be the sentinel neoplasms in patients with DICER1 syndrome and confirming a germline mutation can facilitate the screening of the individual and affected family members for other neoplasms which occur in this syndrome.

TI  - Remote Sensing Support for the Gain-Loss Approach for Greenhouse Gas Inventories
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - For tropical countries that do not have extensive ground sampling programs such as national forest inventories, the gain-loss approach for greenhouse gas inventories is often used. With the gain-loss approach, emissions and removals are estimated as the product of activity data defined as the areas of human-caused emissions and removals and emissions factors defined as the per unit area responses of carbon stocks for those activities. Remotely sensed imagery and remote sensing-based land use and land use change maps have emerged as crucial information sources for facilitating the statistically rigorous estimation of activity data. Similarly, remote sensing-based biomass maps have been used as sources of auxiliary data for enhancing estimates of emissions and removals factors and as sources of biomass data for remote and inaccessible regions. The current status of statistically rigorous methods for combining ground and remotely sensed data that comply with the good practice guidelines for greenhouse gas inventories of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is reviewed.

TI  - Six rounds of annual praziquantel treatment during a national helminth control program significantly reduced schistosome infection and morbidity levels in a cohort of schoolchildren in Zimbabwe
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summary Following a national helminth prevalence survey conducted in 2010/2011, Zimbabwe launched a national schistosomiasis and intestinal worm control program in 2012 targeting school children aged 6-15 years who carry the highest infection burden. The control strategy as advocated by the World Health Assembly in 2012 was adopted to suit the country context. We conducted a study in a cohort of children to assess the effect of praziquantel treatment on schistosome infection intensity and prevalence as well as on urogenital schistosomiasis morbidity prevalence after every annual MDA for 6 years. Maximum treatment coverage in a cohort of children reached 90% over the 6 rounds of annual treatment. Annual surveys in sentinel sites throughout the country showed that schistosome infection prevalence and intensity as well as the marker of urogenital schistosomiasis, haematuria decreased significantly after each round of treatment from the pre-treatment levels in the same year. Most notably, both urogenital schistosomiasis infection and morbidity prevalence reduced from 32% at baseline in 2012 to 1.56% before the 6(th)MDA in 2017, and infection intensity reduced and 28.75 eggs/10ml urine to a mean of 0.07eggs/10ml urine prior to the 6(th)MDA. Both infection prevalence and intensity fell to 0 after the 6(th)MDA. Intestinal schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity reduced from 4.6% and 0.28 eggs/25mg of stool to 0% and 0 eggs respectively. Thus, the control program significantly reduced schistosome infection and morbidity in this cohort of schoolchildren.Background The World Health Organization recommends that schistosomiasis be treated through Mass Drug Administration (MDA). In line with this recommendation, Zimbabwe commenced a national helminth control program in 2012 targeting schoolchildren throughout the country for 6 years. This study, part of a larger investigation of the impact of helminth treatment on overall health of the children, determined the effect of annual praziquantel treatment on schistosome infection and morbidity in a cohort of children during Zimbabwe's 6-year national helminth control program. Methodology/Principal findings A school-based longitudinal study was carried out in 35 sentinel sites across Zimbabwe from September 2012 to November 2017. The sentinel sites were selected following a countrywide survey conducted in 280 primary schools.Schistosoma haematobiumwas diagnosed using the urine filtration technique.Schistosoma mansoniwas diagnosed using both the Kato Katz and formol ether concentration techniques.S.haematobiummorbidity was determined through detection of macro and microhaematuria. A cohort of children aged 6-15 years old were surveyed annually before MDA and 6 weeks post treatment. Maximum treatment coverage reached 90% over the 6 rounds of MDA. At baselineS.haematobiuminfection prevalence and intensity were 31.7% (95% CI = 31.1-32.2) and 28.75 eggs/10ml urine (SEM = 0.81) respectively, whileS.mansoniprevalence and intensity were 4.6% (95% CI = 4.4-4.8) and 0.28 eggs/25mg (SEM = 0.02). Prior to the 6(th)round of MDA,S.haematobiuminfection prevalence had reduced to 1.56% (p<0.001) and infection intensity was to 0.07 (SEM 0.02). Six weeks later after the 6(th)MDA, both were 0. Similarly the prevalence ofS.haematobiummorbidity as indicted by haematuria also fell significantly from 32.3% (95% CI = 29.9-34.6) to 0% (p< 0.0001) prior to the final MDA. ForS.mansoni, both prevalence and intensity had decreased to 0 prior to the 6(th)MDA. After 6 rounds of annual MDA, prevalence and intensity of both schistosome species decreased significantly to 0% (p< 0.0001). Conclusion Zimbabwe's helminth control program significantly reduced schistosome infection intensity and prevalence and urogenital schistosomiasis morbidity prevalence in a cohort of school-aged children, moving the schistosome prevalence in the children from moderate to low by WHO classification. These findings will inform the design of the country next stage interventions for helminth control and eventual elimination.

TI  - Can Intraoperative Fluorescence Imaging Identify All Lesions While the Road Map Created by Preoperative Nuclear Imaging Is Masked?
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tracers can help visualize the lymphatic drainage patterns and sentinel nodes (SNs) of individual prostate cancer patients. To determine the role of nuclear medicine in surgical guidance, in particular the positional guidance of a SPECT/CT-based 3-dimensional imaging road map, in this process we studied to what extent fluorescence guidance underestimated the number of target lesions relative to radioguidance. Methods: SPECT/CT imaging was performed after intraprostatic tracer administration of either indocyanine green (ICG)-Tc-99m-nanocolloid (hybrid-tracer group) or Tc-99m-nanocolloid to create a road map that depicted all SNs. Patients who received Tc-99m-nanocolloid were injected with "free" ICG immediately before surgery. Before unmasking, fluorescence guidance was used for intraoperative SN identification. This was followed by extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND). After unmasking of the SPECT/CT images, the number of missed SNs was recorded and their resection was pursued when there was no risk of intraoperative complications. Results: Preoperative SPECT/CT revealed no differences in the SN identification rate between ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid and Tc-99m-nanocolloid. However, fluorescence guidance allowed intraoperative removal of all SNs in only 40% of patients in the hybrid-tracer group and 20% of patients in the free-ICG group. Overall, 75.9% of the intraoperatively resected SNs in the hybrid-tracer group and 51.8% of the SNs in the free-ICG group were removed solely under fluorescence guidance. During ePLND, 22 additional SNs were resected (7 in the hybrid-tracer group and 15 in the free-ICG group). After unmasking, 18 remaining SNs were identified (6 in the hybrid group and 12 in the free-ICG group). In the free-ICG group, ex vivo evaluation of the excised specimens revealed that 14 SNs removed under ePLND or after unmasking contained radioactivity but no fluorescence. Conclusion: The preoperative imaging road map provided by SPECT/CT enhanced the detection of prostate SNs in more ectopic locations in 17 of the 25 patients, and the hybrid tracer ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid was shown to outperform free ICG. Overall, fluorescence-guided pelvic nodal surgery underestimated the number of SNs in 60%-80% of patients.

TI  - Stress Detection in New Zealand Kauri Canopies with WorldView-2 Satellite and LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - New Zealand kauri trees are threatened by the kauri dieback disease (Phytophthora agathidicida(PA)). In this study, we investigate the use of pan-sharpened WorldView-2 (WV2) satellite and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for detecting stress symptoms in the canopy of kauri trees. A total of 1089 reference crowns were located in the Waitakere Ranges west of Auckland and assessed by fieldwork and the interpretation of aerial images. Canopy stress symptoms were graded based on five basic stress levels and further refined for the first symptom stages. The crown polygons were manually edited on a LiDAR crown height model. Crowns with a mean diameter smaller than 4 m caused most outliers with the 1.8 m pixel size of the WV2 multispectral bands, especially at the more advanced stress levels of dying and dead trees. The exclusion of crowns with a diameter smaller than 4 m increased the correlation in an object-based random forest regression from 0.85 to 0.89 with only WV2 attributes (root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.48, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.34). Additional LiDAR attributes increased the correlation to 0.92 (RMSE of 0.43, MAE of 0.31). A red/near-infrared (NIR) normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a ratio of the red and green bands were the most important indices for an assessment of the full range of stress symptoms. For detection of the first stress symptoms, an NDVI on the red-edge and green bands increased the performance. This study is the first to analyse the use of spaceborne images for monitoring canopy stress symptoms in native New Zealand kauri forest. The method presented shows promising results for a cost-efficient stress monitoring of kauri crowns over large areas. It will be tested in a full processing chain with automatic kauri identification and crown segmentation.

TI  - FPGA implementation of low power and high speed image edge detection algorithm
T2  - MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Image processing is a vital task in data processing system for applications in medical fields, remote sensing, microscopic imaging etc., Algorithms for processing image exist except for real time system style, hardware implementation is most popular principally. This paper presents a design for Sobel filter based edge detection on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board. Hardware implementation of the Sobel edge detection algorithm is chosen because it presents an honest scope for similarity over software package. On the opposite hand, Sobel edge detection will work with less deterioration in high level of noise. Edges are primarily the noticeable variation of intensities in a picture. Edges facilitate to spot the placement of an object and also the boundary of a selected entity within the image. It conjointly helps in feature extraction and pattern recognition. Hence, edge detection is of nice importance in pc vision. The planned design for edge detection exploitation Sobel algorithm is designed using structural Verilog lipoprotein synthesized exploitation Cadence Genus and enforced using Cadence Innovus. The practicality of the planning is verified exploitation normal pictures by FPGA implementation. The proposed architecture reduce the power, delay and space complexity compare to three existing architectures. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Rogue wave statistics in (2+1) Gaussian seas I: Narrow-banded distribution
T2  - APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Originally discussed in the context of ocean statistics for oil rig platform decks and satellite data, spatiotemporal exceeding probability distributions have recently been thought to explain the failure of second and third-order nonlinear models of distributions at a fixed point in space. To investigate this possibility, we derive a simplified model for the (2 + 1) exceeding probability distribution of ocean waves based on the Gaussian random field approach, with a particular interest in rogue waves. Using standard statistical tools, we show that (2 + 1)) Longuet-Higgins' distribution does not depend on the spatiotemporal scale of the ocean surface, rather on the directional spectrum and the dimensionless wave height. Moreover, we use extreme value theory Gumbel (1958) [24] to find the expected maximum wave height in (2 + 1) dimensions, showing that Piterbarg's framework provides a smaller expected maximum than Adler's approach. Unfortunately, both are known for assigning maximum heights that do not saturate when the surface area is very large. Taking into account the mean rogue wave profile, we derive a new expression for the maximum wave height that provides realistic estimates. Finally, comparing the theory for the exceeding probability and expected maximum dimensionless height with the North Alwyn data set of Stansell (2004)[47] we conclude that both (2 + 1) versions of Longuet-Higgins (1952, 1980) [31,34] distributions fail to provide an accurate description of both return period and maximum observed wave heights, thus undermining the argument that the error in ocean wave statistics can be cured by extending point statistics to higher-dimensions.

TI  - Demographic and Health Indicators in Correlation to Interstate Variability of Incidence, Confirmation, Hospitalization, and Lethality in Mexico: Preliminary Analysis from Imported and Community Acquired Cases during COVID-19 Outbreak
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study's objective is to analyze the incidence, lethality, hospitalization, and confirmation of COVID-19 cases in Mexico. Sentinel surveillance for COVID-19 cases in Mexico began after the confirmation of the first patient with community transmission. Methods: This epidemiologic, cross-sectional study includes all clinically suspected, and laboratory-confirmed cases nationwide from the beginning of the outbreak to 21 April 2020. State-cluster demographic data and health indicators were analyzed in reference to epidemiologic measures, with logistic regressions for the dependent variables of incidence, confirmation, and lethality. Results: The national incidence was 13.89/100,000 inhabitants with a 6.52% overall lethality and a confirmed-case mortality of 11.1%. The incidence variation significantly correlated with migration, but not urbanization. Pediatric patients were less prone to be tested (OR = -3.92), while geriatric individuals were a priority. State lethality positively correlated with the proportion of the population assisted at public hospitals and correlated inversely to the number of hospitals and clinics in the state. Conclusions: Migration strongly correlated with incidence; elderly patients had lower odds of being hospitalized but were likely to die. Patients aged <15 were less prone to be laboratory-confirmed. Case confirmation was not performed in all hospitalized patients, but 72.15% of hospitalized patients had favorable outcomes to date.

TI  - General Practitioner House Call Network (SOS Medecins): An Essential Tool for Syndromic Surveillance - Bordeaux, France
T2  - PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In the French mainland administrative region Nouvelle-Aquitaine, syndromic surveillance is based on hospital emergency data, mortality data, and data from associations belonging to the SOS Medecins network. The aim of the present article is to describe the functioning of this network and to illustrate its use for syndromic surveillance in Nouvelle-Aquitaine. Method: The SOS Medecins network participates in the syndromic surveillance system SurSaUD, developed by Sante publique France (SpF; the French National Public Health Agency; Saint-Maurice, Paris, France). Near real-time data are automatically transmitted daily to a data server and analyzed by SpF's Nouvelle Aquitaine's regional unit to identify, monitor, and evaluate the impact of expected and unexpected health events in the region. Results: The SOS Medecins network has five local associations spread across the region with 146 participating physicians. Data have been recorded for more than 10 years and represented nearly 481,000 visits in 2017. The resulting database has helped to identify and monitor seasonal epidemics and unexpected events, as well as measure the health impact of these events. Conclusion: The data from the SOS Medecins network are an essential source in syndromic surveillance. They complement surveillance data from other sources. More specifically, mortality and emergency unit traffic reflect the most severe cases, while SOS Medecins data help early detection of epidemics and health events in the general population. The network has shown its responsiveness and its reliability, not only for the surveillance of seasonal epidemics, but also for the detection of unusual signals. It therefore constitutes an essential link in syndromic surveillance in France, and specifically in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region.

TI  - Using RGISTools to Estimate Water Levels in Reservoirs and Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of freely accessible satellite imagery from multiple programs improves the spatio-temporal coverage of remote sensing data, but it exhibits barriers regarding the variety of web services, file formats, and data standards.Ris an open-source software environment with state-of-the-art statistical packages for the analysis of optical imagery. However, it lacks the tools for providing unified access to multi-program archives to customize and process the time series of images. This manuscript introducesRGISTools, a new software that solves these issues, and provides a working example on water mapping, which is a socially and environmentally relevant research field. The case study uses a digital elevation model and a rarely assessed combination of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery to determine the water level of a reservoir in Northern Spain. The case study demonstrates how to acquire and process time series of surface reflectance data in an efficient manner. Our method achieves reasonably accurate results, with a root mean squared error of0.90m. Future improvements of the package involve the expansion of the workflow to cover the processing of radar images. This should counteract the limitation of the cloud coverage with multi-spectral images.

TI  - CyanoTRACKER: A cloud-based integrated multi-platform architecture for global observation of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, the global proliferation of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) have presented a major risk to the public and wildlife, and ecosystem and economic services provided by inland water resources. As a consequence, water resources, environmental, and healthcare agencies are in need of early information about the development of these blooms to mitigate or minimize their impact. Results from various components of a novel multi-cloud cyber-infrastructure referred to as "CyanoTRACKER" for initial detection and continuous monitoring of spatio-temporal growth of CyanoHABs is highlighted in this study. The novelty of the CyanoTRACKER framework is the collection and integration of combined community reports (social cloud), remote sensing data (sensor cloud) and digital image analytics (computation cloud) to detect and differentiate between regular algal blooms and CyanoHABs. Individual components of CyanoTRACKER include a reporting website, mobile application (App), remotely deployable solar powered automated hyperspectral sensor (CyanoSense), and a cloud-based satellite data processing and integration tool. All components of CyanoTRACKER provided important data related to CyanoHABs assessments for regional and global water bodies. Reports and data received via social cloud including the mobile App, Twitter, Facebook, and CyanoTRACKER website, helped in identifying the geographic locations of CyanoHABs affected water bodies. A significant increase (124.92%) in tweet numbers related to CyanoHABs was observed between 2011 (total relevant tweets = 2925) and 2015 (total relevant tweets = 6579) that reflected an increasing trend of the harmful phenomena across the globe as well as an increased awareness about CyanoHABs among Twitter users. The CyanoHABs affected water bodies extracted via the social cloud were categorized, and smaller water bodies were selected for the deployment of CyanoSense, and satellite data analysis was performed for larger water bodies. CyanoSense was able to differentiate between ordinary algae and CyanoHABs through the use of their characteristic absorption feature at 620 nm. The results and products from this infrastructure can be rapidly disseminated via the CyanoTRACKER website, social media, and direct communication with appropriate management agencies for issuing warnings and alerting lake managers, stakeholders and ordinary citizens to the dangers posed by these environmentally harmful phenomena.

TI  - Topographic and climatic influence on seasonal snow cover: Implications for the hydrology of ungauged Himalayan basins, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Himalayan glaciers exert considerable influence on basin hydrology and its response to climate change. Melt-runoff generated from ungauged Himalayan basins (UHB) requires an understanding of snow and ice cover extent along with prevailing meteorological conditions. Therefore, an estimation of seasonal snow cover distribution, topographic (elevation, aspect, and slope) and climatic variability was carried out using satellite data and meteorological observations from three automatic weather stations (AWSs) located at different elevations in an UHB (Chorabari Glacier). Results suggest that the topography and the meteorological conditions of the basin influence the dynamics of snow cover and the corresponding processes responsible for the melt-runoff generation. The snow cover area (SCA) has high variability in the elevation range of 3799-5000 m, indicating that as glacier ablation begins, SCA below this elevation primarily contributes to the melt-runoff. Likewise, the eastern aspect and the slopes (0-10 degrees and 70-80 degrees) show higher variability. Further, the annual distribution of air temperature gradients (dT/dZ) or temperature lapse rates (TLRs) exhibits a bimodal pattern. The mean annual TLR for the basin is 6.0 degrees C km(-1), which is lower than the traditionally used adiabatic or environmental lapse rate (6.5 degrees C km(-1)) We also established the role of TLRs in the dynamics of SCA, which is an important parameter used for the computation of melt-runoff. The 0 degrees C isotherm established indicates that the elevation zone above 5000-5500 m has persistent snow cover throughout the year and snow cover below this zone contributes to the melt-runoff during the ablation season. Therefore, validating the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of Chorabari Glacier lies within this zone. Since the TLR and SCA vary with space and time, our study in an ungauged glacierized basin of river Ganga could be useful for policymakers as well as other researchers working on the regional hydrology.

TI  - MOTETS BY J.S. BACH IN THE CONTEXT OF LUTHERAN TRADITIONS
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is devoted to the consideration of the motets by J.S. Bach from the perspective of the traditions of the Lutheran divine service of the 18th century in Germany. One of the central problems revealed by the author is the refraction of the ideas of the Lutheran worldview in literary texts of motets and individual work with them by J.S.By the end of the 18th century, traditions of free prayer-making and the formation of spiritual verse were formed in Germany, which were reflected in the composers' motes. In this regard, the author analyzes the influence of religious and philosophical conceptualism on the musical and poetic design of motets. The combination of J. S. Bach of various sources of literary texts in motets contributed to the emergence of a synthesis of philosophical, poetic and theological principles, and also influenced the formation of their melodic design.It is noted that the motets by J.S. Bach belong to ceremonial works performed in the framework of the memorial liturgy of Lutheran traditions. Attention is paid to the characteristic features of the commemoration rite, including the spiritual chants accompanying the mourning Liturgy. In addition to describing the course of Lutheran worship directly, the author touches upon the issue of forming a certain mentality of the Lutheran mindset, in which the moral and moral analysis is grafted, inspired by the upbringing caused by the religious atmosphere. Lutheran worldview characterized by freedom of reasoning, holding a prayer ceremony, the free addition of spiritual verse, has a significant influence on the choice of compositional forms, genres, literary content of prayers. In general, the dogma itself does not impose any restrictions on the competence and form of the presentation of prayers, in connection with this, the author of the article assumes that the choice of the motet genre of J.S. Bach is due to such freedom for creativity in the composition of spiritual poetry and musical content.The theoretical basis in the process of writing the article was the work of authoritative musicologists - D. Melamed, K. Hofmann, A. Bomba, A. Schweitzer, M. Saponov.In the course of the study, the author comes to the conclusion that the motets by J.S. Bach go beyond the ritual compositions, over time they became widespread outside the practice of worship, representing highly artistic musical works in a complex form. In the works of the composer, the genre in question was embodied on an individualized basis of the existing compositional structures of the German motet in combination with free philosophical textual content.

TI  - Landslide Detection with Himawari-8 Geostationary Satellite Data: A Case Study of a Torrential Rain Event in Kyushu, Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigated the utility of Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), one of third-generation geostationary satellite sensors, for mapping landslides caused by torrential rain that hit the northern Kyushu area in Japan in the summer of 2017. AHI normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data had distinctive temporal signatures over landslide areas where the NDVI abruptly decreased after the rain event. The observed changes in the NDVI were linearly correlated with the percent landslide area, the percentage of landslide areas within the AHI pixel footprint, obtained with aerial survey (r = 0.78). AHI 10 min resolution data obtained near cloud-free coverage of the landslide region by the 8th day after the disaster event. This was comparable to the amount of time it took to obtain near cloud-free image coverage with aerial survey, and better than those with the polar-orbiting satellite sensors of Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager, and Sentinel-2A/B MultiSpectral Instrument. These results suggest that third-generation geostationary satellite data can serve as another useful resource for post-event, region-wide initial assessment of landslide areas after a heavy rain event.

TI  - Combination of Cross- and Inter-Band Radiometric Calibrations for a Hyperspectral Sensor Using Model-Based Spectral Band Adjustment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the growing number of hyperspectral satellite sensors have increased the demand for a flexible and robust approach to their calibration. This paper proposes an operational method for the simultaneous correction of inter-sensor and inter-band biases in hyperspectral sensors via the soil line concept for spectral band adjustment. Earth Observing-1 Hyperion was selected as an example, with the Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as a reference. The results over the Railroad Valley Playa calibration site indicated that the discrepancy in the analogous bands between Hyperion and MODIS during 2001-2008 was approximately 4-6% and 7-9% of the root-mean-square error in the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance at the visible and near-infrared region and shortwave infrared region, respectively. For all Hyperion bands, the relative cross-calibration coefficients during this period were calculated (typically ranging from 0.9 to 1.1) to correct the Hyperion TOA radiance to be consistent with the MODIS and the other Hyperion bands. The application of the proposed approach could allow for more flexible cross-calibration of irregular-orbit sensors aboard the International Space Station.

TI  - Vulnerability assessment for flash floods using GIS spatial modeling and remotely sensed data in El-Arish City, North Sinai, Egypt
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Egypt suffers from freshwater crisis, and the shortage is predicted to become severe by 2025. Egypt is exposed to flash floods, especially in Sinai governorate, causing rapid rises of water in a short amount of time and can trigger other catastrophic hazards associated with damage, danger to human life, properties and environment. Flash floods may be considered a source of water that can be explored to meet the water shortage problem. In this study, a composite flash floods vulnerability index based on an integrated hydro-climatic and physical vulnerability component was created. The composite index was based on eight parameters including rainfall distribution, elevation and slope, flow direction, streams, geomorphological features, soil type and land cover. The composite index was ranked into three categories: high, moderate and low. The index can help identify the weak and strong points to support the decision-making process concerned with water management as an essential prerequisite for Egypt sustainable development. The results revealed that the urban, vegetation cover, loamy sand, sand dunes, the low elevation and the flat areas are the most affected by the flash floods in EL-Arish City in Sinai governorate. 42% of Wadi El-Arish had low vulnerability, 45% moderate vulnerability and 13% high vulnerability.

TI  - Correction of amplitude scintillation effect in fully polarimetric SAR coherency matrix data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the correction of ionospheric amplitude scintillations appearing as image artifacts in low frequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. A method has been proposed to separate amplitude and phase components of fully polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) coherency matrix [T], and then implement a combination of multi-level, two-dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform and Fast Fourier Transform (DWT-FFT) to correct the amplitude scintillation-induced stripes in [T] matrix. In the methodology, [T] is decomposed into component matrices of amplitude and relative phases. To the amplitude [T] matrix, a combination of 2-D DWT is performed, using the Haar wavelet, followed by a non-linear 2-D FFT correction strategy to remove amplitude scintillation stripes. Using DWT, each amplitude [T] matrix element is decomposed into low- and high-frequency components known as approximate and detailed coefficients respectively. On applying a 2-D FFT on the detailed coefficients, amplitude scintillation-induced stripes are easily identified in the frequency spectrum and then removed using 2-D FFT correction strategy of averaging-post-thresholding. The proposed method is tested on the [T] matrix of several POLSAR datasets acquired from Advanced Land Observation Satellite/Phased Array type L-band synthetic aperture radar (ALOS/PALSAR) and Advanced Land Observation Satellite-2/Phased Array type L-band synthetic aperture radar-2 (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2) satellites. The performance of the correction technique is analysed both, qualitatively and quantitatively. While improvements in the post-correction datasets are visually observed, a supervised Wishart classification also performed on the [T] matrices of undisturbed (reference), disturbed and corrected data indicates significant increase in overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient ((kappa) over cap) parameters. The classification accuracies of the disturbed data (OA = 69.31%, (kappa) over cap = 0.54) improved to OA = 76.49%, (kappa) over cap = 0.68 after applying the proposed correction approach, which is comparable to the reference data values (OA = 81.57%, (kappa) over cap =0.71). The proposed method performs significantly better than the existing technique of a simple 2-D FFT approach (OA = 73.49%, (kappa) over cap = 0.62). The contribution of dominant scattering powers, obtained from the seven-component scattering power decomposition of POLSAR coherency matrix (7SD) model, also demonstrates post-correction improvements. The dominant scattering power for targets increased by similar to 3-9% using the proposed approach, shows an improvement of similar to 3% over the existing 2-D FFT technique.

M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are one of the most detrimental geological disasters that intimidate human lives along with severe damages to infrastructures and they mostly occur in the mountainous regions across the globe. Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) serves as a key step in assessing potential areas that are prone to landslides and could have an impact on decreasing the possible damages. The application of the fuzzy best-worst multi-criteria decision-making (FBWM) method was applied for LSM in Austria. Further, the role of employing a few numbers of pairwise comparisons on LSM was investigated by comparing the FBWM and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP). For this study, a wide range of data was sourced from the Geological Survey of Austria, the Austrian Land Information System, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, and remotely sensed data were collected. We used nine conditioning factors that were based on the previous studies and geomorphological characteristics of Austria, such as elevation, slope, slope aspect, lithology, rainfall, land cover, distance to drainage, distance to roads, and distance to faults. Based on the evaluation of experts, the slope conditioning factor was chosen as the best criterion (highest impact on LSM) and the distance to roads was considered as the worst criterion (lowest impact on LSM). LSM was generated for the region based on the best and worst criterion. The findings show the robustness of FBWM in landslide susceptibility mapping. Additionally, using fewer pairwise comparisons revealed that the FBWM can obtain higher accuracy as compared to FAHP. The finding of this research can help authorities and decision-makers to provide effective strategies and plans for landslide prevention and mitigation at the national level.

TI  - The Dystopian Transformation of Urban Space in Margaret Atwood's <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>
T2  - AMERICAN, BRITISH AND CANADIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present contribution examines the representation of the city in Margaret Atwood's 1985 dystopian novel, The Handmaid's Tale, with the aim of uncovering how the urban space is transformed and repurposed in order to uphold the ideological pillars of the theocratic regime described in the book. The urban space depicted in the book, which the reader sees through the eyes of the protagonist and narrator Offred, is built upon the contrasting image of "everything looks the same" versus "everything is fundamentally different." Inspired by the Puritan colonies of 17th-century New England, the Republic of Gilead, in a manner similar to many reallife totalitarian regimes throughout history, remodels the urban space in such a way as to correspond to its worldview and help maintain its hold on power. The first part of the article examines how this is done in the novel itself (also making brief references to the representation of the city in the 2019 sequel to The Handmaid's Tale, entitled The Testaments) while the second part discusses how the city is portrayed in the 2017 TV series adaptation of the novel in order to highlight similarities and differences between the literary and televised versions.

TI  - Neoliberal environmentality in the land of Gross National Happiness
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores how a growing trend towards neoliberalization throughout Bhutan manifests within environmental governance in particular. Bhutan's well-known Gross National Happiness (GNH) development strategy can be seen to represent a shift towards a variegated governmentality more generally that increasingly exhibits neoliberal tendencies as the country seeks to negotiate its further integration into the global economy. Part of this integration entails efforts to promote ecotourism as a key element of the country's future conservation strategy. Ecotourism has been described as a growing manifestation of a "neoliberal environmentality" (Fletcher, 2010) within environmental conservation policy and practice, and hence Bhutan's promotion of ecotourism can be seen as contributing to the promotion of neoliberal conservation. Yet in practice, my analysis demonstrates that environmental governance in Bhutan is a complex of external neoliberal influences filtered through local formal and informal institutions, specifically a Buddhist worldview, a history of state paternalism and the Gross National Happiness governance model, all of which express contrasting governance rationalities. This study thus contributes to governmentality studies by promoting a variegated environmentality perspective that calls for more nuanced analyses beyond "variegated" neoliberalization. This perspective also affords a holistic understanding of discrepancies between the vision and execution of neoliberal conservation that can be attributed to the articulation of alternative rationalities in policy formulation and implementation.

TI  - Spatial-temporal dynamics of rainfall erosivity in the state of Espirito Santo (Brazil) from remote sensing data
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The most common methodology to estimate erosivity is using rainfall data obtained from rain monitoring stations. However, the quality of this estimation may be compromised due to low density, operational problems and maintenance cost of rainfall monitoring stations, common problem encountered in developing countries such as Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of pluviometric data obtained by TRMM satellite images for the spatiotemporal characterization of erosivity in the state of Espirito Santo (Brazil). Design/methodology/approach For this, rainfall data and annual and monthly erosivities of 71 rainfall stations were statistically compared with those from TRMM images. Findings For this, rainfall data and annual and monthly erosivities of 71 rainfall stations were statistically compared with those from TRMM images. The estimate proved that TRMM is efficient since the NSE values were higher than 0.70 and the coefficient of determination was higher than 0.77 for monthly and annual erosivities, but in most months and yearly, erosivity was overestimated. Practical implications The use of satellite images to estimate rainfall allowed the spatial representation over time (months) of the oscillating degree of erosivity in the state of Espirito Santo (Brazil). The spatialization may provide an identification of areas and periods in which are essential for the implementation of land use management in order to minimize environmental problems related to soil loss. Originality/value The technique applied may be an alternative to overcome common problems on rainfall monitoring station, such as low density, low data reliability, high manutention and maintenance cost and operational problems.

TI  - Comparison of Sentinel-2 and High-Resolution Imagery for Mapping Land Abandonment in Fragmented Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land abandonment is an important environmental issue in Europe. The proper management of agricultural areas has important implications for ecosystem services (food production, biodiversity, climate regulation and the landscape). In the coming years, an increase of abandoned areas is expected due to socio-economic changes. The identification and quantification of abandoned agricultural plots is key for monitoring this process and for applying management measures. The Valencian Region (Spain) is an important fruit and vegetable producing area in Europe, and it has the most important citrus industry. However, this agricultural sector is highly threatened by diverse factors, which have accelerated land abandonment. Landsat and MODIS satellite images have been used to map land abandonment. However, these images do not give good results in areas with high spatial fragmentation and small-sized agricultural plots. Sentinel-2 and airborne imagery shows unexplored potential to overcome this thanks to higher spatial resolutions. In this work, three models were compared for mapping abandoned plots using Sentinel-2 with 10 m bands, Sentinel-2 with 10 m and 20 m bands, and airborne imagery with 1 m visible and near-infrared bands. A pixel-based classification approach was used, applying the Random Forests algorithm. The algorithm was trained with 144 plots and 100 decision trees. The results were validated using the hold-out method with 96 independent plots. The most accurate map was obtained using airborne images, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Thiam's Transformed Vegetation Index (TTVI), with an overall accuracy of 88.5%. The map generated from Sentinel-2 images (10 m bands and the EVI and TTVI spectral indices) had an overall accuracy of 77.1%. Adding 20 m Sentinel-2 bands and the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) did not improve the classification accuracy. According to the most accurate map, 4310 abandoned plots were detected in our study area, representing 32.5% of its agricultural surface. The proposed methodology proved to be useful for mapping citrus in highly fragmented areas, and it can be adapted to other crops.

TI  - Spatial distribution of iron forms and features in the dried lake bed of Urmia Lake of Iran
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urmia Lake, located in Iran, has a unique pedological feature as fresh soil materials are being exposed as the lake is shrinking. Overuse of its water resources has caused its water level to drop, particularly in the east shore of that lake. This consequence has caused a serious environmental risk, but created a rare opportunity to investigate the spatial distribution of six iron forms and features, i.e., total iron (Fe-t); dithionite-extractable iron (Fe-d); oxalate-extractable iron (Fe-o); crystalline iron (Fe-d-Fe-o); activity ratio (Fe-o/Fe-d) and crystallinity ratio (Fe-d-Fe-o/Fe-t). In total, 130 soil samples were taken from three strata based on their proximity to the lake. Spectral indices derived from Landsat-8 OLI imagery acquired in July 2017 were used as environmental covariates in spatial models using Random Forests (RF) technique. The calibrated RF model for 2017 allowed us to backcast data for 2013 and 2015. The results showed that the iron forms and features varied primarily as a function of distance from the shore. Soil ripening process was also demonstrated in the east shore of Urmia Lake. Overall, this study showed the possibility of a combination of spectral imageries and spatial models to predict the dynamic environment of iron forms.

TI  - Detecting urban changes using phase correlation and l<sub>1</sub>-based sparse model for early disaster response: A case study of the 2018 Sulawesi Indonesia earthquake-tsunami
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection between images is a procedure used in many applications of remote sensing data. Among these applications, the identification of damaged infrastructures in urban areas due to a large-scale disaster is a task that is crucial for distributing relief, quantifying losses, and rescue purposes. A crucial consideration for change detection is that the images must be co-registered precisely to avoid errors resulting from misalignments. An essential consideration is that some large-magnitude earthquakes produce very complex distortions of the ground surface; therefore, a pair of images recorded before and after a particular earthquake cannot be co-registered accurately. In this study, we intend to identify changes between images that are not co-registered. The proposed procedure is based on the use of phase correlation, which shows different patterns in changed and non-changed areas. A careful study of the properties of phase correlation suggests that it is robust against misalignments between images. However, previous studies showed that, in areas with no-changes, the signal power in the phase correlation is not concentrated in a single component, but rather in several components. Thus, we study the performance of the l(1)-regularized logistic regression classifier to identify the relevant components of phase correlation and learn to detect non-changed and changes areas. An empirical evaluation consisting of identifying the changes between pre-event and post-event images corresponding to the 2018 Sulawesi Indonesia earthquake-tsunami was performed for this purpose. Pairs of visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral bands of medium-resolution were used to compute the phase correlation to set feature space. The phase correlation-based feature space consisted of 484 features. We evaluate the proposed procedure using a damage inventory performed from visual inspection of optical images of 0.5-m resolution. A third-party provided the referred inventory. Because of the limitation of medium-resolution imagery, the different damage levels in the damage inventory were merged into a binary class: "changed" and "non-changed". The results demonstrate that the proposed procedure efficiently reproduced 85 +/- 6% of the damage inventory. Furthermore, our results identified tsunami-affected areas that were not previously identified by visual inspection.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in head and neck oncology
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been initially developed for melanoma and breast cancers. Its application in head and neck cancers is recent, probably due to the complexity of the lymphatic drainage, the proximity between the primary tumor and the lymph nodes and the critical anatomical structures (such as the facial nerve). In onco- dermatology, SLNB is validated in head and neck surgery for melanoma with Breslow thickness up to 1 mm or ulceration, Merkel carcinoma and high-risk squamous cell carcinoma. Considering the malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract, the feasibility and oncologic safety of SLNB are now established for T1-T2N0 oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, it could allow patients with negative sentinel nodes to avoid an unnecessary neck dissection, leading to a decrease of morbidity with an quality of life improvement. For some primary locations (e.g., anterior floor of the mouth) with high proximity between tumor and lymph nodes, it is recommended to remove the tumor before the SLNB so as to improve the detection. New techniques of detection are currently being developed with intra-operative procedures and new tracers (such as tilmanocept), leading to a better accuracy of detection and, probably, new indications.

TI  - Evaluation of employing local climate zone classification for mesoscale modelling over Beijing metropolitan area
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land use and landscape morphology exert notable influences on local climate and its surrounding environment. Better understanding of the complex interplay between urban landscape and overlying atmosphere could contributes to decision-making related to urban planning and risk assessment. This paper classifies local climate zones (LCZs) over Beijing metropolitan area following the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) level 0 method, and evaluates the effect of LCZ classification on mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) modelling over the city. Specifically, according to the method proposed by Stewart and Oke (Bull Am Meteor Soc 93(12):1879-1900, , 2012), the LCZ classification across Beijing is created based on the Landsat imagery of the Earth's surface. The derived LCZ system is then imported to the WRF model, and coupled to different urban canopy schemes, i.e. single-layer urban canopy model (SLUCM), multi-layer urban canopy model (BEP-building effect parameterization), and the BEP model with a simple building energy model (BEP + BEM). The performance of employing this refined land use classification scheme versus those using United States Geological Survey land use data is evaluated by comparisons with weather station observations. The results, e.g. the spatial distribution of 2-m temperature and the diurnal variation of the surface heat fluxes, indicate that the LCZ classification scheme yields better comparisons than the default land use method, especially when coupled to the SLUCM as compared to BEP and BEP + BEM. This finding qualifies the coupling scheme of LCZ and SLUCM as a promising albeit simple option for weather modelling in a finer resolution.

TI  - Stably numerical solving inverse boundary value problem for data assimilation
T2  - APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing data assimilation, inverse methods are often used to retrieve the boundary conditions from some of the observations in the interior scanning region. Needless to say, the inverse boundary value problem (IBVP) is ill-conditioned in general. Ultimately, the data assimilation must include mechanisms that enable them to overcome the numerical instability for solving IBVP. In this paper, we begin by studying the behavior of ill-conditioned IBVP, and find that the condition number varies with the number of the observations and distribution locations of the observations. Next, we define the number of equivalent independent equations as a novel measurement of ill-conditioning of a problem, which can measure the degree of bad conditions. Furthermore, the novel measure can answer how many additional observations are needed to stabilize the retrieving problem, and where additional observations are fixed up. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methodology by applying it to the study of precipitation data assimilation, with a particular emphasis on the analysis of the effect of the number of observations and their distribution locations. The new methodology appears to be particularly efficient in tackling the instability of the retrieving problem in data assimilation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Incidence of pelvic lymph node metastasis using modern FIGO staging and sentinel lymph node mapping with ultrastaging in surgically staged patients with endometrioid and serous endometrial carcinoma
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. We report the incidence of occult nodal metastasis in patients who underwent primary surgical staging for apparent early endometrioid or serous endometrial cancer with bilateral SLN mapping and enhanced pathology. Occult ovarian metastasis rates were also reported.Methods. Patients with clinical stage I serous or endometrioid endometrial cancer who underwent primary staging surgery with successful bilateral SLN mapping from 1/2005-12/2018 were retrospectively evaluated. Rates of isolated tumor cells (ITCs), micro- and macrometastatic nodal disease, and occult ovarian involvement were reported.Results. Of 1044 patients, 959 had endometrioid and 85 serous carcinoma. There were no positive SLNs among 510 patients with noninvasive FIGO grade 1/2 endometrioid carcinoma and < 1%ITCs. Grade 1: 4.5%(9/202) with inner-half and 10%(6/62) with outer-half myoinvasion had positive SLNs. Grade 2: rates were 4%(3/76) and 20%(8/41), respectively. Grade 3: 5%(1/20) with noninvasive, 3%(1/31) with inner-half, and 24%(4/17) with outer-half myoinvasion had positive SLNs. ITC incidence increased with depth of myoinvasion-25% of deeply invasive grade 1/2 and 18% of deeply invasive grade 3 tumors. Four (10%) of 41 patientswith noninvasive serous endometrial carcinoma had ITCs or positive SLNs. There were no occult ovarian metastases with grades 1/2 disease, 2/68 (3%) with grade 3 disease, and 2/85 (2%) with serous endometrial carcinoma.Conclusion. Ultrastaging SLNs may be unwarranted in low-grade noninvasive endometrioid cancer but valuable in noninvasive serous carcinoma. Occult ovarian metastasis is uncommon in early endometrial carcinoma and occurs in 2-3% of high-risk histologies. Further research is needed to determine ITC significance, particularly with regard to adjuvant treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article discusses the functioning of prepositions, representing space, in proverbs and sayings of the English and Russian languages. The category of space is one of the essential categories of the modern worldview and has been studied by scientists of various fields of knowledge for centuries. Space, along with time, is an integral attribute of the existence of all objects and processes of the surrounding reality, as well as one of the main categories of culture, which enables a person to perceive the world. In linguistics, spatial relationships are expressed by various means, lexical and grammatical (morphological and syntactic). This article deals with the expression of the category of space by lexical means, namely one of the service parts of speech, prepositions. The prepositions expressing the space are grouped in the article according to the meanings. Oriented and non-oriented prepositions are considered. The authors conducted a comparative analysis of the prepositions representing the space in the paroemiological fund of heterogeneous English and Russian languages, determined the universal and unique characteristics of each of the compared languages.

TI  - Detecting flood prone areas in Harris County: a GIS based analysis
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters in the world that causes massive damages to natural and man-made features every year. As urbanization continues at an unprecedented rate, the damage caused by such natural disasters keeps increasing. Moreover, as human population continues to explode, settlements keep expanding and human activities continue to grow in low-lying areas vulnerable to flooding activities. Different strategies have been adopted to prevent flood hazards. One such strategy is flood susceptibility mapping to identify vulnerable areas prone to flooding. Such mapping processes are important for early warning system, emergency services, prevention and mitigation of future floods and implementation of flood management strategies. Harris County is a rapidly growing metropolitan area, situated on a low-lying coastal plain with little topographic relief and high susceptibility to flooding. This study incorporates a GIS based weighted multi-criteria analysis to determine flood prone areas in Harris County, Texas by integrating nine flood conditioning factors such as slope, elevation, soil type, rainfall intensity, flow accumulation, LULC, NDVI and distance from river and distance from road. The objectives of this study is threefold. Firstly, to determine the impact weight of the selected nine flood conditioning factors. Secondly, to combine the conditioning factors using weighted overlay method in ArcGIS to map the areas in Harris County that are prone to flooding. And finally, to overlay the 2017 FEMA flood hazard map on the weighted overlay flood hazard map.

TI  - Atmospheric aerosol optical depth and its variability over an urban location in Eastern India
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Eastern India is characterized by high aerosol loading of primarily anthropogenic origin due to both local emissions and long-range transport and hence outflow of air mass from the Indo-Gangetic Plains. Using a year-long measurement of atmospheric aerosol optical properties over Bhubaneswar, one of the fastest growing tier-two cities in the Eastern India, we show that the aerosol optical depth (AOD) varied between 0.39 and 0.96 with high loading during February and low during July. The Angstrom exponent (AE) was found to be mostly higher than unity indicating large dominance of fine mode particles with a larger AE. Further analysis using spectral curvature of AOD and satellite-based estimates indicates that more than 80% of the time, fine mode aerosols dominate the region. It is observed that there is a large diurnal variability in AOD (AE) of the order of 15% (5%) indicating a large change in loading (spectral characteristics) over a short period of within a day. The aerosols types inferred from spectral curvature method match reasonably well with those from MERRA-2 chemical reanalysis. Further, it is found that satellite-derived AOD's are low biased with respect to ground measurements and are unable to capture seasonality consistently. These findings show that additional research is required to assess the causes for such inconsistency especially during the monsoon period.

TI  - Shoreline change assessment using geospatial tools: a study on the Ganges deltaic coast of Bangladesh
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ganges deltaic coast of Bangladesh experiences an incessant movement over the time. Understanding the shoreline movement of this alluvial delta and a suitable method to calculate the rate of change poses a challenge for this highly dynamic coast having erosion and accretion. Using GIS and multi temporal LANDSAT images, the study investigated the positional change of the Ganges deltaic shoreline for the period of 1977-2017. LANDSAT images were radiometrically corrected and a spectral index i.e., normalized difference water index (NDWI) was applied to differentiate water and land features. A histogram based Otsu's Binary thresholding method along with image based visual interpretation was used to extract the shorelines. Net changes of shoreline position were statistically calculated using three different techniques, namely; End Point Rate (EPR), Linear Regression Rate (LRR) and Weighted Linear Regression (WLR). A comparison between the techniques was also made to choose and evaluate the suitable statistical technique to estimate the rate of shoreline change for this alluvial delta. Analyses showed that LRR technique had less positional uncertainty in compare to EPR and WLR, although at a particular transect the techniques were closely correlated. The EPR, WLR and LRR technique showed that the shoreline is experiencing landward movement (erosion) with an average rate of 0.62 m/yr, 0.96 m/yr and 0.27 m/yr respectively. Moreover, a high erosion rate of 5 m/yr at the mangrove forest area of the GDC is a great concern for the existence of the mangrove forest. During 1977-2017, an overall 6.29 sq. km land area has been lost although significant land depositions were observed at the river estuaries. This study revealed the spatiotemporal trend of shoreline position of the Ganges deltaic coast and that would be beneficial for the coastal management and planning of the region.

TI  - The novel use of proximal photogrammetry and terrestrial LiDAR to quantify the structural complexity of orchard trees
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the agrifood sector, the production of high yields is a driver for UK orchard husbandry. Currently, orchard tree management is typically a non-discriminatory method with all trees subjected to the same interventions. Previous studies indicate that structural complexity of individual orchard trees is an indicator for future yield, which can guide the management of individual trees. However, data on the structure of individual trees is often limited. This study investigated the suitability of using remote sensing methods to capture data that can be used to quantify tree structure. Descriptive metrics based on the mathematical assessment of self-affinity and dimensionality were applied to the remotely-sensed data to quantify tree structure, and were also analysed for suitability as a predictor of fruit yield. The findings suggest that while proximal photogrammetry is informative, terrestrial LiDAR data can be used to quantify structural complexity most effectively and this approach holds greater potential for informing orchard management.

TI  - Local Community Perceptions on Landscape Change, Ecosystem Services, Climate Change, and Livelihoods in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding humanity's relationship with nature is crucial for the well-being and sustainable development of mankind in the face of global environmental change. Communities depend on landscapes for survival and landscapes determine if sustainable development is to be achieved. The links between landscapes, ecosystem services, livelihoods, and climate change are often complex, misunderstood, and barely studied in rural areas of Africa, where communities live side-by-side with conservation areas. Our study surveyed the perception of the nexus of landscape change, climate change, ecosystem services, and livelihoods in Gonarezhou, a national park in southeastern Zimbabwe. We also used Landsat satellite imagery to map the landscape change over 20 years to validate and to correlate with the survey data. The survey results indicated that people relied on rainfed agriculture as a means of livelihood, but droughts as a result of climate change force communities to engage in other means of livelihoods such as small-scale poaching of small game such as impala and harvesting of natural resources such as edible shrubs. Crops and livestock as provisional ecosystem services have been negatively affected by climate change and landscape change. Landsat data confirmed that there was a negative transformation of the landscape as a result of agriculture, growth in settlements, and large herbivores. However, there was also a positive landscape transformation resulting from the conservation efforts by the Gonarezhou Conservation Trust (GCT). Cultural services about education and awareness of the environment and provisional services such as wild fruits are booming. Challenges such as soil erosion, human-wildlife conflict, and minimal community benefits from conservation efforts hindered sustainable development in the study area. While changes in landscape, climate, livelihoods, and ecosystem services happened at a local scale, the underlying drivers such as politics and the economy were also identified as drivers of landscape change.

TI  - Spatio-temporal invasion dynamics of <i>Maesopsis eminii</i> in Amani Nature Forest Reserve, Tanzania
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, invasive plant species cause negative impacts to human livelihoods and natural ecosystems, particularly in biodiversity hotspots. Maesopsis eminii invasion in Amani Nature Forest Reserve, Tanzania, was considered an ecological disaster in the 1980s. After > 50 years have elapsed since the species was first introduced in the reserve, there is yet little information available on its invasion progress. We assessed spatio-temporal invasion dynamics using forest inventory data collected in 1998 and resurveyed 60 (20 m x 50 m) sample plots in 2018. Among resurveyed plots, 30 had been invaded by M. eminii in 1998 and other 30 sample plots as control, which had no M. eminii in the year 1998. We also assessed vegetation cover change over a 20 year period between 1998 and 2018 using Landsat satellite images. Over the last 20 years, 23% of control plots were newly invaded by M. eminii. Tree species richness was 25% lower in invaded versus control plots (U = 1490, z = 2.9, p = 0.04). Large trees (DBH >= 31-50 cm) of Maesopsis eminii were most abundant (62%) in invaded plots whereas small trees (DBH <= 10 cm) were most abundant ( > 50%) in control plots, indicating that the tree species might be prone to self-thinning. Woody species diversity was significantly lower in invaded (1.63 +/- 0.49) vs control plots (1.87 +/- 0.35; t((58)) = - 2.19, p = 0.03). The number of M. eminii individuals ha(-1) was positively associated with higher altitudes ranging above 800 masl (rho = 0.33, P = 0.011) but there was no correlation with distance away from the forest reserve boundary (rho = 0.11, P = 0.394;) nor with distance away from village centers (rho = -0.08, P = 0.502). Change detection analysis indicated about 1,108 ha of non-forest vegetation had regrown into forest over the last 20 years, particularly in the south - western region of the reserve. The region included 4 sample plots newly invaded by M. eminii. We conclude that there is an increase in spatial distribution of M. eminii individuals between the year 1998 and 2018. Furthermore, M. eminii has low regeneration potential in already invaded sites of high invasive density and only slowly invading gaps in uninvaded sites.

TI  - Intra-annual variations of regional total column ozone, aerosol optical depth, and water vapor from ground-based, satellite-based and model-based observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Microtops II ozonometer has been deployed to continuously measure the total column ozone (TCO), precipitable water content (PWC) and aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at Atigre village (16.74 degrees N, 74.37 degrees E, 604 m above sea level, masl) located on the southeastern slope of Indian western Ghats. The Microtops II ozonometer measurements during the period from September 2017 to June 2018 were analyzed along with the retrieved products of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard NASA's Terra satellites and also the ERA-interim reanalysis model. We found that the TCO (or PWC) data from the OMI (or MODIS) and the ERA reanalysis model data products are in good agreement. The measurements showed strong seasonal variability such that TCO was lowest in the winter season but increased in the summer season, and both PWC and AOT were lowest in the post-monsoon season and increased in the summer season. In continuous ERA-interim reanalysis TCO observations, we found the three types of periodicities in the daily mean TCO as well as PWC (i) The weekly (7 days), (ii) quasi-biweekly (14 to 16 days), (iii) Madden Julian Oscillations (MJO) (30-60 days) oscillations. These oscillations depend on the periodic weather changes in the troposphere. We also observe that the average day to day variability in daily mean TCO observations in the observational period is about 1.4%, 1.1%, 2.62% in the Microtops II ozonometer, ERA-interim reanalysis, and OMI data respectively. We found the positive correlation between daily mean AOT and PWC in all seasons (except monsoon), which is maximum in the winter season, showing the hygroscopic nature of aerosols. The sources of water vapor and aerosol at our location are also studied using back-trajectory analysis.

TI  - Fresh, frozen or fake: A comparison of predation rates measured by various types of sentinel prey
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Arthropod predators and parasitoids support the health and functioning of the world's ecosystems, most notably by supplying biological control services to agricultural landscapes. Quantifying the impact that these organisms have on their prey can be challenging, as direct observation and measurement of arthropod predation is difficult. The use of sentinel prey is one method to measure predator impact; however, despite widespread use, few studies have compared predation on different prey types within a single experiment. This study evaluated the predation rates on four sentinel prey items in grass and wheat fields in south-east Queensland, Australia. Attack rates on live and dead Helicoverpa armigera eggs, and dead H. armigera larvae and artificial plasticine larvae, were compared and the predators that were attracted to each prey type were documented with the use of field cameras. There was no significant difference in predation rates between sentinel eggs, while dead larvae were significantly more attacked than artificial larvae. Prey were attacked by a diverse range of predators, including ants, beetles, various nymph and juvenile insects and small mammals. Different predators were active in grass and crop fields, with predator activity peaking around dawn and dusk. The same trends were observed within and between the two habitats studied, providing a measure of confidence in the sentinel prey method. A range of different sentinel prey types could be suitable for use in most comparative studies; however, each prey type has its own benefits and limitations, and these should be carefully evaluated to determine which is most suitable to address the research questions.

TI  - Assessment of contribution of agricultural residue burning on air quality of Delhi using remote sensing and modelling tools
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Application of remote sensing in analysing the pollutant dispersion and concentration in the atmosphere has gained importance over the years amongst the researchers. Particulates, being a threat to human health is being closely monitored for its sources and transport, to implement respective mitigative measures. A study has been carried out to assess the contribution of agriculture residue/stubble burning (SB) in Haryana, Punjab region over the air quality of Delhi region. Monitoring is carried out using multidisciplinary approaches over the region during October and November 2017. A higher baseline value in Delhi is observed throughout the study duration. Both remote sensing and ground data from stations show similar characteristics. Local meteorological condition of study region, observed during the study duration, indicates that particulates from Punjab-Haryana region are not likely to be transmitted over Delhi region. The study performed using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) shows some carbonaceous aerosol subtype over Delhi region. Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) study shows that northwesterly winds intersect the agricultural residue burning regions, which might have transported the burnt stubble particulates towards Delhi area during the days of November 2017. Further, the larger mass of stubble burning aerosols are found to be dispersed at a height 3000 m above the ground, which is out of the human vicinity. The month of October 2017 showed aerosol subtypes majorly from local emissions and dust. Delhi faces severe air pollution issues around human vicinity due to poor meteorological conditions and majorly because of local emission. The severe conditions, however, are generally short-lived and gradually ameliorates with improved meteorological conditions of the region.

TI  - Automatic Flood Detection in Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery Using ANN Algorithms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural Calamities like floods cause wide-range of damage to human existence as well as substructures. For automatic extraction of flooded area in multi-temporal satellite imagery acquired by Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), this paper presents two neural network algorithms: Feed-Forward Neural Network, Cascade-forward back-propagation neural network. This work currently focuses on Uttar Pradesh in India, which was affected due to floods during August 2017. The two models are trained, validated and tested using MATLAB R2018b. The models are first trained using a variety of input data until the percentage of error with respect to water body detection is within an acceptable error limit. These models are then used to extract the water features effectively and to detect the flooded regions. Finally, flood area is calculated in sq. km in during flood and post-flood imagery using these algorithms. The results thus obtained are compared with that from the binary thresholding method from previous studies. The results show that the Feed-Forward Neural Network gives better accuracy than the Cascade-forward back propagation neural network. Based on the promising results, the proposed method may assist in our understanding of the role of machine learning in disaster detection.

TI  - Using ICESat-2 to Estimate and Map Forest Aboveground Biomass: A First Example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provides rich insights over the Earth's surface through elevation data collected by its Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) since its launch in September 2018. While this mission is primarily aimed at capturing ice measurements, ICESat-2 also provides data over vegetated areas, offering the capability to gain insights into ecosystem structure and the potential to contribute to the sustainable management of forests. This study involved an examination of the utility of ICESat-2 for estimating forest aboveground biomass (AGB). The objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate the use of canopy metrics for estimating AGB, using data extracted from an ICESat-2 transect over forests in south-east Texas; (2) compare the accuracy for estimating AGB using data from the strong beam and weak beam; and (3) upscale predicted AGB estimates using variables from Landsat multispectral imagery and land cover and canopy cover maps, to generate a 30 m spatial resolution AGB map. Methods previously developed with simulated ICESat-2 data over Sam Houston National Forest (SHNF) in southeast Texas were adapted using actual data from an adjacent ICESat-2 transect over similar vegetation conditions. Custom noise filtering and photon classification algorithms were applied to ICESat-2's geolocated photon data (ATL03) for one beam pair, consisting of a strong and weak beam, and canopy height estimates were retrieved. Canopy height parameters were extracted from 100 m segments in the along-track direction for estimating AGB, using regression analysis. ICESat-2-derived AGB estimates were then extrapolated to develop a 30 m AGB map for the study area, using vegetation indices from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), National Land Cover Database (NLCD) landcover and canopy cover, with random forests (RF). The AGB estimation models used few canopy parameters and suggest the possibility for applying well-developed methods for modeling AGB with airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data, using processed ICESat-2 data. The final regression model achieved a R-2 and root mean square error (RMSE) value of 0.62 and 24.63 Mg/ha for estimating AGB and RF model evaluation with a separate test set yielded a R-2 of 0.58 and RMSE of 23.89 Mg/ha. Findings provide an initial look at the ability of ICESat-2 to estimate AGB and serve as a basis for further upscaling efforts.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Reflectarrays (RAs) offer low-cost and low-profile solutions for reflector antennas that are polarization and frequency selective. These features augment their capabilities for point-to-point communications compared to conventional reflectors. Here, a dual-band dual-circularly polarized (CP) RA that can radiate independently shaped beams in the desired directions for each polarization in each band is proposed. The RA is composed of a dual-band dual-linearly polarized (LP) RA and a dual-band LP-to-CP polarizer. The proposed RA can be employed to reduce the number of the required apertures for a four-color multiple spot beam coverage implemented using a single-feed-per-beam configuration from four to two. The underlying unit cell of the proposed RA is designed for 18.3-18.8 GHz and 27.0-27.5 GHz. It provides a 323 degrees phase shift in the lower band and 381 degrees phase shift in the higher band while maintaining a cross-polarization level better than 15 dB in both bands and excellent decoupling between the two bands. An offset-fed RA is designed, fabricated, and measured.

Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms with six different band combinations was used to classify the data in 6 classes. The highest accuracy was achieved with SVM for December-January combination with Overall Accuracy of 74.36% and a kappa coefficient of 0.6905. SVM algorithm performed the best followed by DT, ANN and RF. It was observed that the accuracy of classification increased with multi-temporal datasets. In SVM and RF the accuracy increased by almost 8% from single to dual date, but no increase in accuracy was observed irrespective of taking three dates. For DT and ANN, the accuracy from single to dual date increased by > 10% and by approximately 3% (Marginal) for three dates. The single date ANN achieved very poor results but with an increase in the datasets, good accuracy was attained. This study, therefore, reveals that with single and dual datasets, SVM and RF performs well and with multi-temporal datasets, DT and ANN can also achieve good accuracy.

TI  - Regional mapping of species-level continuous foliar cover: beyond categorical vegetation mapping
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to quantify spatial patterns and detect change in terrestrial vegetation across large landscapes depends on linking ground-based measurements of vegetation to remotely sensed data. Unlike non-overlapping categorical vegetation types (i.e., typical vegetation and land cover maps), species-level gradients of foliar cover are consistent with the ecological theories of individualistic response of species and niche space. We collected foliar cover data for vascular plant, bryophyte, and lichen species and 17 environmental variables in the Arctic Coastal Plain and Brooks Foothills of Alaska from 2012 to 2017. We integrated these data into a standardized database with 13 additional vegetation survey and monitoring data sets in northern Alaska collected from 1998 to 2017. To map the patterns of foliar cover for six dominant and widespread vascular plant species in arctic Alaska, we statistically associated ground-based measurements of species distribution and abundance to environmental and multi-season spectral covariates using a Bayesian statistical learning approach. For five of the six modeled species, our models predicted 36% to 65% of the observed species-level variation in foliar cover. Overall, our continuous foliar cover maps predicted more of the observed spatial heterogeneity in species distribution and abundance than an existing categorical vegetation map. Mapping continuous foliar cover at the species level also revealed ecological patterns obscured by aggregation in existing plant functional type approaches. Species-level analysis of vegetation patterns enables quantifying and monitoring landscape-level changes in species, vegetation communities, and wildlife habitat independently of subjective categorical vegetation types and facilitates integrating spatial patterns across multiple ecological scales. The novel species-level foliar cover mapping approach described here provides spatial information about the functional role of plant species in vegetation communities and wildlife habitat that are not available in categorical vegetation maps or quantitative maps of broadly defined vegetation aggregates.

TI  - Monitoring Vegetation Change in the Presence of High Cloud Cover with Sentinel-2 in a Lowland Tropical Forest Region in Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play major roles in climate regulation, ecosystem services, carbon storage, biodiversity, terrain stabilization, and water retention, as well as in the economy of numerous countries. Nevertheless, deforestation and forest degradation are rampant in many parts of the world. In particular, the Amazonian rainforest faces the constant threats posed by logging, mining, and burning for agricultural expansion. In Brazil, the "Sete de Setembro Indigenous Land", a protected area located in a lowland tropical forest region at the border between the Mato Grosso and Rondonia states, is subject to illegal deforestation and therefore necessitates effective vegetation monitoring tools. Optical satellite imagery, while extensively used for landcover assessment and monitoring, is vulnerable to high cloud cover percentages, as these can preclude analysis and strongly limit the temporal resolution. We propose a cloud computing-based coupled detection strategy using (i) cloud and cloud shadow/vegetation detection systems with Sentinel-2 data analyzed on the Google Earth Engine with deep neural network classification models, with (ii) a classification error correction and vegetation loss and gain analysis tool that dynamically compares and updates the classification in a time series. The initial results demonstrate that such a detection system can constitute a powerful monitoring tool to assist in the prevention, early warning, and assessment of deforestation and forest degradation in cloudy tropical regions. Owing to the integrated cloud detection system, the temporal resolution is significantly improved. The limitations of the model in its present state include classification issues during the forest fire period, and a lack of distinction between natural vegetation loss and anthropogenic deforestation. Two possible solutions to the latter problem are proposed, namely, the mapping of known agricultural and bare areas and its subsequent removal from the analyzed data, or the inclusion of radar data, which would allow a large amount of finetuning of the detection processes.

TI  - First Experiences with the Landsat-8 Aquatic Reflectance Product: Evaluation of the Regional and Ocean Color Algorithms in a Coastal Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the launch of the Landsat-8 (L8) Operational Land Imager (OLI) on 11 February 2013, there has been a continuous effort to produce reliable ocean color products by taking the advantages of its medium spatial resolution (30 m) and higher Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). A Provisional Aquatic Reflectance product for the L8 OLI (L8PAR) has been recently released to the public to explore its potential for ocean color applications. This study used a six-year data record of L8 for development of a regionally tuned algorithm (RTA20) for estimating Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations around the complex coastal environment of Hong Kong, and is the first to report the usability of the L8PAR product for coastal areas. Furthermore, this study validated three previously developed algorithms, namely RTA16, RTA17 and RTA19, and two ocean color algorithms (OC2 and OC3) modified for L8 OLI by NASA's Ocean Color group. Results indicate that the newly released L8PAR product has a high potential for estimating the coastal water Chl-a concentrations with higher detail and higher accuracy than previously. The RTA20 algorithm developed in this study outperformed the previous algorithms (RTA16, RTA17, RTA19, OC2 and OC3), e.g., with lower values for Root Mean Square Error (RMSE; 0.92 mg/m(3)), bias (-0.26 mg/m(3)) and mean ratio (1.29). Although inferior to the RTA20, the OC2 algorithm also performed well in terms of Pearson's correlation coefficient (r; 0.84), slope (6.87) and intercept (-8.44) while for RTA20 the values for r, slope and intercept were 0.96, 0.77 and 0.27, respectively. This preliminary evaluation reveals that the OC2 algorithm can be used as an operational algorithm for L8 Chl-a product generation for global coastal areas while RTA20 can be used as a regional algorithm for the routine monitoring of Chl-a concentrations around the coastal areas of Hong Kong or for coastal areas with similar water quality elsewhere in the world.

TI  - Clinical Outcomes of Sentinel Cerebral Protection System Use During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR REVASCULARIZATION MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: To compare the clinical outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with and without the use of the Sentinel Cerebral Protection System (Sentinel CPS).Background: Stroke occurs in 2-5% of patients at 30 days after TAVR and increases mortality >3 fold. The Sentinel CPS is the only FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved cerebral embolic protection device.Methods: The Cochrane Library, PubMed and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Two authors independently screened and included studies comparing the clinical outcomes after TAVR with and without the Sentinel CPS. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tools (RoB2.0 and ROBINS-I).Results: Four studies comparing 606 patients undergoing TAVR with Sentinel CPS to 724 without any embolic protection device were included. Sentinel CPS use was associated with lower rates of 30-day mortality [0.8% vs 2.7%; RR 0.34 (95% CI 0.12, 0.92) I-2 = 0%], 30-day symptomatic stroke [3.5% vs 6.1%; RR 0.51 (95% CI 0.29, 0.90) I-2 = 0] and major or life-threatening bleeding [3.3% vs 6.6%; RR 0.50 (0.26, 0.98) I-2 = 16%]. There was no significant difference between the two arms in the incidence of acute kidney injury [0.8% vs 1%; RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.22, 3.24) I-2 = 0%] and major vascular complications [5.1% vs 6%; RR 0.74 (0.33, 1.67) I-2 = 45%].Conclusion: The results suggest that Sentinel CPS use in TAVR is associated with a lower risk of stroke, mortality and major or life-threatening bleeding at 30 days.

TI  - Using Data Assimilation to Reconstruct High-Latitude Polar Cap Patches
T2  - RADIO SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Discrete high-density plasma structures in the Earth's ionosphere that convect across the polar cap from the dayside to nightside are known as polar cap patches. This high-latitude phenomenon can interfere and disrupt satellite and high-frequency (HF) communications when the associated sharp electron density gradients are encountered, and therefore, accurate modeling and forecasting of such events would be greatly beneficial. In this study, we have utilized the assimilative Global Positioning System Ionospheric Inversion (GPSII) method to reconstruct the high-latitude ionosphere utilizing data from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, vertical ionosondes, the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radar (RISR-N), in situ satellite data, and Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars. The novel method of assimilating RISR-N and SuperDARN ground scatter measurements helps to increase the limited number of observations at high latitudes. The reconstructed polar cap patches are shown to correspond with ground- and spaced-based observations, illustrating the ability of utilizing GPSII to study the complex high-latitude region.

TI  - Hyperspectral remote sensing to detect leafminer-induced stress in bok choy and spinach according to fertilizer regime and timing
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Detection and diagnosis of emerging arthropod outbreaks in horticultural glasshouse crops, such as bok choy and spinach, is both important and challenging. A major challenge is to accurately detect and diagnose arthropod outbreaks in growing crops (changes in canopy size, structure, and composition), and when crops are grown under three fertilization regimes. Day-time remote sensing inside glasshouses is highly sensitive to inconsistent lighting, spectral scattering, and shadows casted by glasshouse structures. To avoid these issues, a unique feature of this study was that hyperspectral remote sensing data were acquired after sunset with an active light source. As part of this study, we describe a comprehensive approach to performance assessment of classification algorithms based on hyperspectral remote sensing data.RESULTS Based on average hyperspectral remote sensing profiles from individual crop plants, none of the 31 individual spectral bands showed consistent significant response to leafminer infestation and non-significant response to fertilizer regime. Multi-band classification algorithms were subjected to a comprehensive performance assessment to quantify risks of model over-fitting and low repeatability of classification algorithms. The performance assessment of classification algorithms addresses the important 'bias-variance trade-off'. Truly independent validation (training and validation data sets being separated over time) revealed that leafminer infestation could be detected with >99% accuracy in both bok choy and spinach.CONCLUSION We conclude that detailed hyperspectral profiles (not single spectral bands) can accurately detect and diagnose leafminer infestation over time and across fertilizer regimes. Hyperspectral remote sensing data acquisition at night with an active light source has the potential to enable arthropod infestations in glasshouse-grown crops, such as, bok choy and spinach. In addition, we conclude that effective use and deployment of hyperspectral remote sensing requires thorough performance assessments of classification algorithms, and we propose an analytical performance method to address this important matter.

TI  - Development of a PM<sub>2.5</sub> Forecasting System Integrating Low-cost Sensors for Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is a serious concern in urban areas, especially cities such as Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). Because the air quality directly affects peoples health, air quality monitoring is urgently needed. In this study, the models of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emission (SMOKE), and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) were integrated to develop an air quality forecasting system. Drawing input data from transportation and industrial emission inventories, the forecasting system was calibrated and configured using local parameters to deliver hourly forecasts for HCMC. To increase the accuracy of WRF and the meteorological forecasting, the global DEM and land use data were replaced by Lidar data, and land use data were also retrieved from MODIS. Output from the MOZART model served as the boundary conditions for CMAQ, and AOD values reported by the MODIS Aerosol Product were assimilated to enhance the accuracy of the results. A low-cost PM2.5 sensor connected to a LinkIt ONE, a development board for Internet of things (IoT) devices, was employed for calibration and verification. The strong correlation (R2 = 0.8) between the measured and predicted concentrations indicates that the estimates delivered by the proposed forecasting system are consistent with the values obtained via monitoring.

T2  - AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of groundwater potential is important for the preparation of management plan of groundwater resource in watershed scale. Groundwater potential zone in watershed scale is identified using GIS, remote sensing satellite data, and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis technique. Different thematic layers, i.e. geological formation, lineament, soil, etc. were used for the identification of groundwater potential zones, while groundwater quality parameters, i.e. hardness, pH, etc. were used for the preparation of groundwater quality index map. The present study focused on identification of possible groundwater potential zones and groundwater quality index both in terms of quantity and quality. The Analytic Hierarchy Approach is utilized to identify the groundwater potential zones. Conclusively, 27.1% area falls under low-medium groundwater potential zone and 9.3% area falls under above the permissible limit of water quality. In total, 240 suitable water harvesting structures, namely storage tank (120 nos), percolation tank (70 nos), stop dam (34 nos) and check dam (16 nos) with their sites, were identified and suggested for water harvesting to enhance the groundwater conditions to meet the scarcity of water resources in agriculture and domestic use.

TI  - Numerical Modeling of the Hydro-Morphodynamics of a Distributary Channel of the Po River Delta (Italy) during the Spring 2009 Flood Event
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - One-dimensional (1D) numerical models generally provide reliable results when applied to simulate river hydraulics and morphodynamics upstream of the tidal influence, given the predominantly unidirectional flow conditions. Such models, however, can also be used to reproduce river hydraulics across the fluvial to marine transition zone when specific conditions occur, as during high discharge events, and the results obtained via these simple modeling tools can provide indicative trends that may guide more structured and detailed modeling of a particularly critical area. In this study, the application of a 1D model setup with hydrologic engineering centers river analysis system (HEC-RAS) for simulating the hydro-morphodynamic conditions of a distributary channel of the Po River Delta (Italy) during a flooding event that occurred in Spring 2009 is presented. The channel bathymetry and the grainsize composition was taken from field measurements, while the dimension of the plume offshore the delta was derived from a MODIS image acquired at the peak of the flood. The comparison between the numerical outcomes and the field evidence shows the reliability of the proposed 1D modeling approach in representing the delta dynamics at a large scale, as well as in showing locations where more spatially detailed studies are needed. The code was also able to adequately reproduce the channel hydro-morphodynamics and the sediment data as derived from a core sample taken a few km offshore during the flooding event of April-May 2009. Through a sensitivity analysis, it is also proven that the dimension of the river plume can influence the evolution of the prodelta, while having a rather negligible effect inland, because of the major stresses induced by the high river discharge during the flood event.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring of ecological environment quality in Kunming based on RSEI model
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remote sensing technology to monitor ecological environment is a good way to quickly acquire the changes of ecological environment. Based on the data of Landsat TM and OLI images, we constructed a model of Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) with four indicators (greenness, humidity, dryness and heat) by using principal component analysis. This model was used to evaluate the ecological environment quality of Kunming during 2000-2018. The results showed that RSEI can well indicate the quality of regional ecological environment. RSEI was mainly affected by dryness, followed by humidity and greenness, with heat having the least influence. From 2000 to 2018, the five-year average of RSEI in Kunming was 0.51, and the ecological environment quality was in a general state (0.4-0.6). The quality of ecological environment showed a fluctuating trend of "rise -down -rise -down" over time. The quality of ecological environment was better in the western Kunming than in the eastern part, with the best in the southwest corner of Kunming.

TI  - Sterilization Rate of the Axilla After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: The Scope for Conservative Surgery
T2  - JCO GLOBAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE The role of axillary conservation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is debatable. We routinely carry out complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). This study was conducted to understand the pathologic axillary complete response (pAxCR) after NACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated a prospective database of patients with breast cancer who underwent surgery after NACT in the year 2017 at our institution. NACT was administered to downstage locally advanced breast cancer or facilitate breast-conservation surgery.RESULTS Of 793 patients who underwent surgery after NACT, 97(12.2%) had cN0 disease, 407 (51.3%) had cN1, 262 (32%) had cN2, and 27 (3.4%) had cN3 at presentation. Eighty-eight patients (11.1%) had cT1-2 primary tumor stage, and 623 patients (78.6%) had cT3-4 primary tumor stage; primary tumor stage details were unavailable for 82 patients (10.3%). The median age was 46 years (range, 21-74 years). On histopathology, the overall pAxCR rate was 52.8%. In the cN1 and cN2 settings, 58.7% and 36.6% of patients achieved ypN0 status, respectively. The overall pathologic complete response rate was 22.64% (161 of 711 patients). On univariable analysis, cN stage, histologic grade, hormone receptor status, NACT duration, and lymphovascular invasion were significantly associated with pAxCR (P <.001). On logistic regression, prechemotherapy cN status (odds ratio [OR], 3.08; 95% CI, 2.18 to 4.37; P <.001), estrogen and progesterone receptor status (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.4; P <.001), and administration of both chemotherapy regimens preoperatively (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.97; P <.05) predicted pAxCR.CONCLUSION At least half of patients with cN1 and a third of patients with cN2 breast cancer who develop pAxCR may be suitable candidates for axillary conservation. A careful postchemotherapy assessment followed by a conservative axillary procedure may be an alternative to ALND, but this needs to be studied prospectively.

TI  - Effect of spatial resolution of satellite images on estimating the greenness and evapotranspiration of urban green spaces
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS), like most managed land covers, are getting progressively affected by water scarcity and drought. Preserving, restoring and expanding UGS require sustainable management of green and blue water resources to fulfil evapotranspiration (ET) demand for green plant cover. The heterogeneity of UGS with high variation in their microclimates and irrigation practices builds up the complexity of ET estimation. In oversized UGS, areas too large to be measured with in situ ET methods, remote sensing (RS) approaches of ET measurement have the potential to estimate the actual ET. Often in situ approaches are not feasible or too expensive. We studied the effects of spatial resolution using different satellite images, with high-, medium- and coarse-spatial resolutions, on the greenness and ET of UGS using Vegetation Indices (VIs) and VI-based ET, over a 780-ha urban park in Adelaide, Australia. We validated ET with the ground-based ET method of Soil Water Balance. Three sets of imagery from WorldView2, Landsat and MODIS, and three VIs including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2), were used to assess long-term changes of VIs and ET calculated from the different imagery acquired for this study (2011-2018). We found high correspondence between ET-MODIS and ET-Landsat (R-2 > 0.99 for all VIs). Landsat-VIs captured the seasonal changes of greenness better than MODIS-VIs. We used artificial neural network (ANN) to relate the RS-ET and ground data, and ET-MODIS (EVI2) showed the highest correlation (R-2 = 0.95 and MSE =0.01 for validation). We found a strong relationship between RS-ET and in situ measurements, even though it was not explicable by simple regressions; black box models helped us to explore their correlation. The methodology used in this research makes a strong case for the value of remote sensing in estimating and managing ET of green spaces in water-limited cities.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH AND POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. In early 2010, outbreaks of lead poisoning due to artisanal gold mining in villages in the northwest Nigerian state of Zamfara have resulted in the death of hundreds of children < 5 years old. There have also been unconfirmed reports of high mortality of geese within these villages. Objectives. To report a case of lead poisoning in three domestic free-range chickens found in one of the affected communities where illegal small-scale gold mining activities take place. Methods. Three free-range domestic chickens were presented during a field investigation in one of the villages. The birds were observed to be emaciated, weak, showing nervous manifestations and moribund. Results. Tissue extracts of liver, spleen and intestines were negative for Newcastle viral antigens, while cultures of liver and spleen biopsy were positive for Escherichia coli. Histopathological lesions were observed in the kidney, proventriculus and brain. Concentrations of lead in the tissues ranged between 7.5 mg/kg and 120.5 mg/kg wet weight, and the potential daily intake of lead in the tissues were estimated at 34.06200.15 mu g/day/kg body weight with an average of 118.37 mu g/day/kg body weight. Conclusions. The results of the present study suggest probable risk to human health due to the consumption of chicken contaminated by lead in the affected villages. Poisoning in animal populations may serve as a sentinel to assess the extent of environmental contamination and human health problems related to lead. Ethics Approval. Protocols were approved and performed in accordance with relevant local guidelines and regulations as set by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Veterinary Research Institute, Vom, Nigeria.

TI  - Investigation of C-Band SAR Polarimetry for Mapping a High-Tidal Coastal Environment in Northern Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been used in characterizing intertidal zones along northern Canadian coastlines. RADARSAT-2, with its full polarimetric information, has been considered for monitoring these vulnerable ecosystems and helping enhance the navigational safety of these waters. The RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) will ensure data continuity with three identical SAR satellites orbiting together, providing superior revisit capabilities. The three satellites are equipped with multiple configurations, including single-polarization (HH, HV, VV), conventional (HH-HV, VV-VH, and HH-VV), hybrid (i.e., compact) dual polarization, and fully polarimetric (FP) modes. This study investigates the potential of the compact polarimetric (CP) mode for mapping an intertidal zone located at Tasiujaq village on the southwest shore of Ungava Bay, Quebec. Simulated RCM data were generated using FP RADARSAT-2 images collected over the study site in 2016. Commonly used tools for CP analysis include Raney m-delta classification and the hybrid dual polarizations RH-RV (where the transmitter is right-circular and the receivers are horizontal and vertical linear polarizations) and RR-RL (where the transmitter is right circular and the receivers are right-circular and left-circular polarizations). The potential of CP is compared with single, conventional dual-pol, and FP. The Freeman-Durden and Touzi discriminators are used for FP analysis. The random forest classifier is used as a classification approach due to its well-documented performance compared to other classifiers. The results suggest that the hybrid compact (RR-RL and RH-RV) dual polarizations provide encouraging separability capacities with overall accuracies of 61% and 60.7%, respectively, although they do not perform as well as conventional dual-pol HH-HV (64.4%). On the other hand, the CP polarimetric m-delta decomposition generated slightly less accurate classification results with an overall accuracy of approximately 62% compared to the FP Freeman-Durden (67.08%) and Touzi discriminators (71.1%).

TI  - Sensitivity of Volcanic Ash Dispersion Modelling to Input Grain Size Distribution Based on Hydromagmatic and Magmatic Deposits
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The size distribution of volcanic ash is rarely measured in real time and Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres (VAACs) often rely on a default particle size distribution (PSD) to initialise their dispersion models when forecasting the movement of ash clouds. We conducted a sensitivity study to investigate the impact of PSD on model output and consider how best to apply default PSDs in operational dispersion modelling. Compiled grain size data confirm that, when considering particles likely to be in the distal ash cloud (< 125 mu m diameter), magma composition and eruption size are the dominant controls on grain size distribution. Constraining the PSD is challenging but we find that the grain size of deposits from large hydromagmatic eruptions remains relatively constant with distance, suggesting that total (whole-deposit) grain size distributions (TGSDs) for these eruptions could be estimated from a few samples. We investigated the sensitivity of modelled ash mass loadings (in the air and on the ground) to input PSDs based on coarse to fine TGSDs from our dataset. We found clear differences between modelled mass loadings and the extent of the plume. Comparing TGSDs based on ground-only and ground-plus-satellite data for the Eyjafjallajokull 2010 eruption, we found that basing input PSDs on TGSDs from deposits alone (likely missing the finest particles) led to lower modelled peak ash concentrations and a smaller plume.

TI  - Lymph node management in endometrial cancer
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2018, around 382,100 new cases of endometrial cancer (EC) were reported worldwide, accounting for about 4.4% of all new cases of cancer in women. In France, in 2018, the EC is the first gynecological cancer in incidence and the fourth cancer in women. The rationale for the therapeutic management of EC is based on the estimation of a theoretical risk of recurrence and lymph node metastasis using MRI and preoperative biopsy criteria. However, lymph node status remains the determining factor of adjuvant treatment. In order to reduce the morbidity of lymphadenectomy, the concept of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLN) has been developed. The SLN technique has evolved in recent years, thanks to the advent of robotics and the creation of fluorescence detection cameras. It has been shown that detection of SLN with Indocyanine Green (ICG) allows for more frequent bilateral migration of 88 to 100% and better detection of pelvic GS in 97% of cases with a decrease in morbidity. Recently, in view of the absence of a therapeutic role of lymph node staging, the operational risks and the delay of adjuvant treatments, in case of pelvic lymph node metastasis on definitive histological examination, the question of secondarily performing paraaortic lymphadenectomy arises. The SLN procedure, extended to all early-stage endometrial cancers, should lead to a major reduction in the use of secondary staging and better adaptation of adjuvant therapy.

TI  - Probabilistic object detection and shape extraction in remote sensing data
T2  - COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing mainly focuses on information extraction from data acquired by sensors on satellite and aerial platforms. Here, one such area of interest is ground object detection and shape extraction. Recently launched satellites and conventional aerial platforms (such as commercial UAV and professional drones) have sensors leading to more detailed and rich data source for this purpose. From these, data most of the times come in the form of optical images and LiDAR measurements. Resolution of this acquired data has increased significantly such that most ground objects (as buildings, trees, ships, cars, airplanes) can be detected and analyzed in detail. Therefore, computer vision methods have become extremely useful in remote sensing applications such as building detection and shape extraction for urban planning; tree crown measurement for crop yield forecasting; ship detection for monitoring unlawful fishery; car detection for traffic flow monitoring and intelligent transportation; and airplane detection for military and commercial operations. Researchers proposed several methods to automate the mentioned applications since manually handling them is extremely hard and prohibitively time consuming. Unfortunately, the proposed methods focus on one object type most of the times. Therefore, there is no general method to handle all the mentioned applications using computer vision tools. To overcome this problem, we propose a general framework for object detection and shape extraction in remote sensing data. Our method is based on probabilistic representation inspired by our previous work and perceptual organization principles. Due to space limitations, we only focus on buildings, trees, ships, airplanes, and cars as objects of interest in this study. We test the proposed method on several optical images acquired by different satellites and LiDAR data obtained from an aerial platform. For all objects of interest, we provide test results on both object detection and shape extraction steps. We analyze the proposed method based on these tests and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. We also comment on possible future extensions of the proposed method.

TI  - Examining LiDAR - WorldView-3 data synergy to generate a detailed stand map in a mixed forest in the north-west of Turkey
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although stand delineation approach based on aerial photographs and field survey produces high accuracy maps, it is labour-intensive and time consuming. Furthermore, conventional forest stand maps may have some uncertainties that can hardly be verified due to the experiments and skills of photo-interpreters. Therefore, researchers have been seeking more objective and cost-effective methods for forest mapping. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data have a high potential to automatically delineate forest stands. Unlike optical sensors, LiDAR height data provides information about both the horizontal and vertical structural characteristics of forest stands. However, it deprives of spectral data that may be successfully used in separating tree species. In this study, we investigate the potential of LiDAR - WorldView-3 data synergy for the automatic generation of a detailed forest stand map which can be used for a tactical forest management plan. Firstly, image segmentation was applied to LiDAR data alone and LiDAR/WorldView-3 data set in order to obtain the most suitable image objects representing forest stands. Visual inspection of the segmentation results showed that image objects based on the LiDAR/WorldView-3 data set were more compatible with the reference forest stand boundaries. After the segmentation process, the LiDAR and LiDAR/WorldView-3 data sets were independently classified using object-based classification method. We tested two levels of classification. The first was a detailed classification with 14 classes considering reference stand types. The second was the rough classification with 9 classes where some stand types were combined. The mean, standard deviation and texture features of LiDAR metrics and spectral information were used in the classification. The accuracy assessment results of LiDAR data showed that the Overall Accuracy (OA) was calculated as 0.31 and 0.43, and the Kappa Index (KIA) was calculated as 0.26 and 0.32 for the detailed and rough classifications, respectively. For the LiDAR/WorldView-3 data set, the OA values were calculated as 0.50 and 0.61, and the KIA were calculated as 0.46 and 0.55 for the detailed and rough classifications, respectively. These results showed that the forest stand map derived from the LiDAR/WorldView-3 data synergy is more compatible with the reference forest stand map. In conclusion, it can be said that the forest stand maps produced in this study may provide strategic forest planning needs, but it is not sufficient for tactical forest management plans.

TI  - Using Landsat and soil clay content to map soil organic carbon of oxisols and Ultisols near Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of soil organic carbon (SOC) is a low-cost and necessary practice to meet increasing agricultural demands. Studies show that remote sensing (RS) is important for SOC prediction and its use has become crucial in agricultural management. In this study, a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model was constructed to predict SOC in a site in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil. As predictor variables, we used the optical-satellite data of OLI/Landsat-8 sensor (bands 5 and 7, specifically), clay concentration, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We collected 218 samples at the sampling points in the field to quantify clay and SOC in the laboratory as a calibration procedure. An Exposed SoilMask (ESM) was created using the method GEOS3 technology, which showed pixels with greater variability of bare soil. The pixels were evaluated with their respective surface reflectance values obtained by the satellite sensor and their respective NDVI index values. We evaluated the model predictive performance based on the adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2), the Root Mean-Squared Error (RMSE), and the Ratio of Performance to Interquartile Range (RPIQ) obtained in data validation. The MLR model presented R-2 values 0.79 and 0.81 for calibration and validation, respectively. We obtained important RMSE and RPIQ values, 0.14 and 2.32, respectively. The high RPIQ indicated significative sampling distribution around the trendline. After construction, the model was applied to the C spatial distribution using the predictive variables as layers, predominant concentrations of 0.65 to 0.79 g. Kg(-1) in 51 (23.4%) soil samples. The analysis presented here offer possibilities for SOC prediction using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Generating Elevation Surface from a Single RGB Remotely Sensed Image Using Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Generating Digital Elevation Models (DEM) from satellite imagery or other data sources constitutes an essential tool for a plethora of applications and disciplines, ranging from 3D flight planning and simulation, autonomous driving and satellite navigation, such as GPS, to modeling water flow, precision farming and forestry. The task of extracting this 3D geometry from a given surface hitherto requires a combination of appropriately collected corresponding samples and/or specialized equipment, as inferring the elevation from single image data is out of reach for contemporary approaches. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have experienced unprecedented growth in recent years as they can extrapolate rules in a data-driven manner and retrieve convoluted, nonlinear one-to-one mappings, such as an approximate mapping from satellite imagery to DEMs. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end Deep Learning (DL) approach to construct this mapping and to generate an absolute or relative point cloud estimation of a DEM given a single RGB satellite (Sentinel-2 imagery in this work) or drone image. The model has been readily extended to incorporate available information from the non-visible electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike existing methods, we only exploit one image for the production of the elevation data, rendering our approach less restrictive and constrained, but suboptimal compared to them at the same time. Moreover, recent advances in software and hardware allow us to make the inference and the generation extremely fast, even on moderate hardware. We deploy Conditional Generative Adversarial networks (CGAN), which are the state-of-the-art approach to image-to-image translation. We expect our work to serve as a springboard for further development in this field and to foster the integration of such methods in the process of generating, updating and analyzing DEMs.

TI  - An integrated approach to delineate the groundwater potential zones in Devdari watershed area of Akola district, Maharashtra, Central India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present research work accentuates the hydrogeological evaluation for Devdari watershed of Maharashtra, Central India, using remote sensing, GIS, and multi influencing factor (MIF). The thematic layers of land use/land cover, groundwater depth, slope, drainage, flow direction, flow accumulation and geomorphology were prepared using IRS-LISS-III satellite data coupled with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data on 23.50 and 30 m spatial resolution, respectively. The raster layers of these themes were estimated by employing ArcGIS software 10.3 and multi-influencing factor method and subsequently assigned with the relative weights as per their groundwater potential characteristics. For acknowledgement of the groundwater potential map, all the thematic layers and their respective weightage values were subjected to weighted overlay analysis (WOA) method. The evolved map demonstrates six groundwater potential zones in the study area, i.e., poor to nil (0.27 km(2)), very poor (0.95 km(2)), poor (17.67 km(2)), moderate (0.33 km(2)), good (9.51 km(2)), very good (14.665 km(2)) and excellent (1.84 km(2)). A field check survey was carried out to ascertain the validity of groundwater potential maps. The results of study area disclose that the area of watershed with poor, moderate and good-to-excellent groundwater potential zones is evaluated to allow precipitated water to infiltrate into subsurface and finally contribute to groundwater recharge in the watershed area.

TI  - High-Resolution Mapping of Forest Carbon Stock Using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) Technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed and mapped the aboveground tree carbon stock using very high-resolution satellite imagery (VHRS)-WorldView-2 in Barkot forest of Uttarakhand, India. The image was pan-sharpened to get the spectrally and spatially good-quality image. High-pass filter technique of pan-sharpening was found to be the best in this study. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) was carried out for image segmentation and classification. Multi-resolution image segmentation yielded 74% accuracy. The segmented image was classified into sal (Shorea robusta), teak (Tectona grandis) and shadow. The classification accuracy was found to be 83%. The relationship between crown projection area (CPA) and carbon was established in the field for both sal and teak trees. Using the relationship between CPA and carbon, the classified CPA map was converted to carbon stock of individual trees. Mean value of carbon stock per tree for sal was found to be 621 kg, whereas for teak it was 703 kg per tree. The study highlighted the utility of OBIA and VHRS imagery for mapping high-resolution carbon stock of forest.

TI  - Assimilation of Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) Using Satellite Remote Sensing Data in Budhi Gandaki River Basin, Nepal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayan region, a major source of fresh water, is recognized as a water tower of the world. Many perennial rivers originate from Nepal Himalaya, located in the central part of the Himalayan region. Snowmelt water is essential freshwater for living, whereas it poses flood disaster potential, which is a major challenge for sustainable development. Climate change also largely affects snowmelt hydrology. Therefore, river discharge measurement requires crucial attention in the face of climate change, particularly in the Himalayan region. The snowmelt runoff model (SRM) is a frequently used method to measure river discharge in snow-fed mountain river basins. This study attempts to investigate snowmelt contribution in the overall discharge of the Budhi Gandaki River Basin (BGRB) using satellite remote sensing data products through the application of the SRM model. The model outputs were validated based on station measured river discharge data. The results show that SRM performed well in the study basin with a coefficient of determination (R-2) >0.880. Moreover, this study found that the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) meteorological datasets are highly applicable to the SRM in the Himalayan region. The study also shows that snow days have slightly decreased in the last three years, hence snowmelt contribution in overall discharge has decreased slightly in the study area. Finally, this study concludes that MOD10A2 and ECMWF precipitation and two-meter temperature products are highly applicable to measure snowmelt and associated discharge through SRM in the BGRB. Moreover, it also helps with proper freshwater planning, efficient use of winter water flow, and mitigating and preventive measures for the flood disaster.

TI  - A Methodological Approach for Irrigation Detection in the Frame of Common Agricultural Policy Checks by Monitoring
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - New needs have arisen from member states and paying agencies (PA) to achieve the compliance assessment from farmers in the frame of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Traditional field inspection (on-the-spot checks) and computer-aided photointerpretation (CAPI) carried out by each PA over a sample of 5% of the applicants are being replaced by a 100% sample Copernicus satellite-based system (checks by monitoring, CbM). This new approach will be an integral part of the Area Monitoring System that will be part of the Integrated Administrative Control System (IACS) in the post-2020 CAP. Among all the aid schemes having to be analyzed, there are some specific aids in which the detection of irrigation of certain crops can result in a no-compliance resolution. Apart from that, the knowledge of the truly irrigated area in each campaign has always been data of great interest in irrigation planning, crop yield statistics, and water management, and now more than ever. Although several sources of information exist, there is no consensual methodology for estimating the actual irrigated area. The objective of this study is to propose a methodological approach based mainly on Copernicus Sentinel and IACS data not only to detect the surface of herbaceous crops that have been actually irrigated but also to derive a product suitable to be incorporated into the CAP monitoring process system. This methodology is already being used operationally during the ongoing campaign 2020 by Castile and Leon PA.

AB  - The rapid advancement of remote sensing and availability of polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data have facilitated to monitor the land use land cover (LULC) dynamics. In the recent past, polarimetric decomposition theorems are applied widely to perform LULC classification with the help of machine learning techniques. In this study, we utilized ALOS PALSAR-1 L-band quad polarimetric data for performing polarimetric decomposition, textural information extraction, and to generate LULC maps over the western part of Mizoram state, northeast India. The study area comprises three districts, namely Mamit, Lunglei, and Lawngtlai. We adopted two representative full-polarimetric decomposition models: classical model-based Freeman-Durden and Yamaguchi decomposition. These methods decompose the coherency matrix of PolSAR images into surface, double-bounce, and volume scattering. Textural measures, such as variance, contrast, entropy, homogeneity, dissimilarity, and uniformity are also retrieved using grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) for LULC classification. For LULC classification, we employed a support vector machine classifier and calculated the area statistics of LULC. The outcomes were checked with the help of confusion matrix derived for six classes, such as built-up, deciduous forest, evergreen forest, scrubland, bareland, and waterbody. Each LULC class is separated using the scattering properties of PolSAR images. Results exhibited that Yamaguchi four-component decomposition (overall accuracy 90% and kappa coefficient 0.88) gives relatively better LULC classification results than the Freeman-Durden three-component decomposition (overall accuracy 87% and kappa coefficient 0.84). Use of textural images of GLCM has supported the classification accuracy at par with the Yamaguchi model. Integration of polarimetric information offers a new dimension in LULC classification and produces high accuracy maps. This approach overcomes the limitations of optical data in cloud covering areas, and furthermore, it provides better classification accuracy.

TI  - The effect of post mastectomy radiation therapy on survival in breast cancer patients with N1mic disease
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The role of post mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) in patients with N1mic breast cancer has not been well defined. A retrospective analysis was performed using the SEER database to evaluate the impact of PMRT on survival in patients with N1mic breast cancer.Materials and methods: Women with Tl-T2, N1mic, M0 breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Univariate analysis to assess for differences in survival with respect to covariates was performed using the log rank test while multi-variate analysis was performed with Cox proportional hazards regression. Sub-cohort analysis with propensity score matching was used to assess differences in survival among patients undergoing PMRT vs no PMRT. Comparisons were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.Results: Among 5878 patients, 1202 (20%) underwent PMRT. On univariate analysis, PMRT was a significant predictor of CSS, but not OS. There was no difference in either OS or CSS between the PMRT vs no PMRT groups on multivariate Cox regression analysis and after propensity score matching.Conclusions: Among patients with T1-T2, N1mic, M0 breast IDC from the SEER database, there was no difference in either OS or CSS among patients who underwent PMRT vs no PMRT. These results suggest that PMRT does not impact survival among breast cancer patients with N1mic disease. However, additional prospective studies with longer follow up are necessary for further evaluation. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - "You Don't Know Exactly Which Country You Have to Belong To" <i>Rethinking Alvarez v. Lemon Grove through the Deportation Regime, 1924-1931</i>
T2  - PACIFIC HISTORICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the 1931 desegregation case based in Southeast San Diego County, Roberto Alvarez v. Lemon Grove Independent School District, through the lens of the deportation regime. This analysis reveals the ways new pressures from deportation-based immigration policies initiated in the 1920s complicated widely shared notions of transnational Mexicano identity and emphasized differences in nativity and citizenship status. The practice of apprehending individuals identified as "illegal aliens" took on a new form during the repatriation efforts of the Great Depression-removal. Within this new context, this article highlights the significance of the fact that working-class Mexican-origin migrant parents mobilized to demand educational equality for their children and to reject segregation. It illuminates how the Lemon Grove Mexican-origin community gave expression to a more expansive notion of their anti-segregation worldview than that found in the court ruling. They envisioned a community that was transnational and inclusive regardless of citizenship status, and they challenged segregation beyond mere claims to whiteness, critiquing inequality of resources with little reference to assimilationist goals.

TI  - Spatio temporal and climatic analysis of the high Andean wetland of Chalhuanca ( Peru) during the period 1986-2016
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - The high Andean wetlands are considered fragile ecosystems that provide ecosystem services for the maintenance of Andean biodiversity and economy. However, currently the global threat of climate change puts them at serious risk, which is why the objective of this study is to determine the spatial-temporal and climatic variation of the high Andean wetlands of Chalhuanca (Peru), during the period 1986-2016. Landsat scenes obtained during dry season in the years 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, and using remote sensing techniques the area and vegetation index (NDVI) of the wetlands were calculated. For precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, an analysis of moving averages, linear trends and the Mann-Kendall non-parametric statistical test was carried out, and finally the interaction between the variables was evaluated by using correlation and regression. The results show that the wetland area has increased by 12 ha/year. As for the NDVI, an increase of the average values for the evaluated period has been detected, being 0.26 the average of minimum values. Analysis of climate data shows that precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature have increased by 32 mm/dec, 0.3 degrees C/dec and 0.6 degrees C/dec respectively, with the maximum and minimum temperature being significant (alpha<0.05). Finally, correlation and regression analyses show that the wetland area-precipitation, NDVI-precipitation and wetland-NDVI relationships are significant for alpha<0.01, while the wetland-temperature and NDVI-temperature relationships were significant for alpha<0.05.

TI  - Integrating multiple land cover maps through a multi-criteria analysis to improve agricultural monitoring in Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring agricultural land cover is highly relevant for global early warning systems such as ASAP (Anomaly hot Spots of Agricultural Production), because it represents the basis for detecting production deficits in food security assessment. Given the significant inconsistencies among existing land cover datasets, there is a need to obtain a more accurate representation of the spatial distribution and extent of agricultural area in Africa. In this research, we explore a fusion approach that combines the strength of individual datasets and minimises their limitations. Specifically, a semi-automatic method is developed, relying on multi-criteria analysis (MCA) complemented with manual fine-tuning using the best-rated datasets, to generate two hybrid and static agricultural masks - one for cropland and another for grassland. Following a comprehensive selection of land cover maps, each dataset is evaluated at country level according to five criteria: timeliness, spatial resolution, comparison with FAO statistics, accuracy assessment and expert evaluation. A sensitivity analysis is performed, based on an evaluation of the impact of weight settings on the resulting land cover. The proposed methodology is capable of improving agricultural characterisation in Africa. As a result, two static masks at 250 m spatial resolution for the nominal year 2016 are provided.

TI  - Estimation of sanity of a stand of <i>Pinus taeda</i> L. after the attack of <i>Sapajus nigritus</i> Kerr (1972) using vegetation index
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to identify regression and classification models using the most robust VI derived from Sentinel-2/MSI digital images for the detection of areas attacked by Sapajus nigritus in a Pinus taeda L. stand located in Bocaina do Sul, Santa Catarina State. In order to do this, three orbital images of the Sentinel-2/MSI constellation were used in pre-attack, attack and post-attack dates. A total of 46 field plots were allocated, in which tree individuals were classified according to the intensity of the year in: I: no damage, II: moderate, III: severe and VI: dead. Using Principal Component Analysis, vegetation index were selected as regressor variables for the development of regression models by Stepwise, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) to estimate the percentage of attack classes per plot. The best model selection was based on regression model fit statistics. The most robust indexes were MCARI, ND145 and NDVIRR, which estimated for the classes a percentage of attack of S. nigritus per plot with adjusted R-2 of 0.80, 0.46, 0.88 and 0.97; Syx of 13.49, 61.42, 15.11 and 8.69 (% 0.045 ha(-1)) and RMSE of 1.95, 4.49, 2.11 and 0.32 (% 0.045 ha(-1)). It was possible to estimate/identify areas attacked by this primate in the evaluated stand, highlighting the Stepwise model, followed by SVM and RF. However, it is recommended to test digital images of high/ultrahigh spatial resolution to corroborate with such methodology.

TI  - Using Multi-Temporal MODIS NDVI Data to Monitor Tea Status and Forecast Yield: A Case Study at Tanuyen, Laichau, Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea is a cash crop that improves the quality of life for people in the Tanuyen District of Laichau Province, Vietnam. Tea yield, however, has stagnated in recent years, due to changes in temperature, precipitation, the age of the tea bushes, and diseases. Developing an approach for monitoring tea bushes by remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) might be a way to alleviate this problem. Using multi-temporal remote sensing data, the paper details an investigation of the changes in tea health and yield forecasting through the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In this study, we used NDVI as a support tool to demonstrate the temporal and spatial changes in NDVI through the extract tea NDVI value and calculate the mean NDVI value. The results of the study showed that the minimum NDVI value was 0.42 during January 2013 and February 2015 and 2016. The maximum NDVI value was in August 2015 and June 2017. We indicate that the linear relationship between NDVI value and mean temperature was strong with R-2=0.79 Our results confirm that the combination of meteorological data and NDVI data can achieve a high performance of yield prediction. Three models to predict tea yield were conducted: support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and the traditional linear regression model (TLRM). For period 2009 to 2018, the prediction tea yield by the RF model was the best with a R-2=0.73, by SVM it was 0.66, and 0.57 with the TLRM. Three evaluation indicators were used to consider accuracy: the coefficient of determination (R-2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and percentage error of tea yield (PETY). The highest accuracy for the three models was in 2015 with a R-2 >= 0.87, RMSE < 50 kg/ha, and PETY less 3% error. In the other years, the prediction accuracy was higher in the SVM and RF models. Meanwhile, the RF algorithm was better than PETY (<= 10%) and the root mean square error for this algorithm was significantly less (<= 80 kg/ha). RMSE and PETY showed relatively good values in the TLRM model with a RMSE from 80 to 100 kg/ha and a PETY from 8 to 15%.

AB  - Introduction. This paper introduces the metaphorical-critical incident technique where elicitation of metaphors is combined with the critical incident technique to study public librarians' professional identity. A new methodological analytical framework is presented to elicit conceptualisations of professional identity and to derive meaning from them.Method. A questionnaire was administered online to public librarians in New Zealand. The combined elicitation of metaphors and critical incidents were the only substantive open-ended questions and responses were optional. Only complete responses to all open-ended questions were analysed.Analysis. Qualitative analyses were conducted on the metaphors and critical incidents data. The study employed an inductive approach in analysing the responses to the questions eliciting metaphors and critical incidents. Excel was used to arrange notations from the content analysis.Results. Findings support an integrative analytical framework for the joint analysis of metaphors and critical incidents, accommodating a variety of analytical foci. Critical incidents tended to be key data points, providing reasoning for the worldview presented in metaphors.Conclusions. Results indicate a viable methodological and analytical approach. Mutual support can be established between metaphors and critical incidents in the analytical framework. This approach establishes a link between worldview as expressed by metaphors and critical incidents and their meanings.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The data presented in this article relates to the research article "A history of the rehabilitation of mangroves and an assessment of their diversity and structure using Landsat annual composites (1987-2019) and transect plot inventories" [1]. This article describes how the rehabilitated mangroves evolved over 28 years and whether the ecological parameters of rehabilitated forest resembled those of the adjacent natural mangroves. This article presents species and structural composition data of rehabilitated and adjacent natural mangrove forests in the Trat Province of eastern Thailand. The species type, their girth at 1.3 m breast height, tree height, and the number of seedlings for each of the thirteen species, (Avicennia alba, Bruguiera cylindrica, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Bruguiera sexangula, Ceriops tagal, Excoecaria agallocha, Intsia bijuga, Lumnitzera littorea, Lumnitzera racemosa, Rhizophora apiculata, Rhizophora mucronata, Xylocarpus granatum, and Xylocarpus moluccensis), of the mangrove forests were collected. The data were collected in 10 x 10 m size plots from the seaward to landward end along with the stand age of the rehabilitated mangroves. The data was analysed using the Importance Value, Complexity Index, Simpson's Dominance Index of diversity and Simpson's Reciprocal, and Shannon-Weaver Index to distinguish various diversity and structural parameters using the mangrove forest structure and vegan: Community Ecology Package in R programming [2,3].

TI  - Spiritual transcendence as a buffer against death anxiety
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terror Management Theory assumes the existence of two basic buffers against mortality salience: self-esteem and worldview. The aim of the current paper is to propose another buffer against mortality salience, namely spiritual transcendence. In the first study, we studied the impact of activation of spiritual transcendence as a moderator of mortality salience. Activating spiritual transcendence reduced the effect of the increase of the level of altruistic tendencies after exposure to mortality salience. In the second study, we replicated this finding based on the research procedures of former TMT research, using essay attacking participants' worldview. Results showed that spiritual transcendence acts as a buffer against mortality salience both among religious and non-religious individuals. Therefore, spiritual transcendence seems to be an additional buffer against mortality salience, independent from worldview and self-esteem, and it could be further examined from TMT perspective.

TI  - Detailed Lacustrine Calving Iceberg Inventory from Very High Resolution Optical Imagery and Object-Based Image Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the field of iceberg and glacier calving studies, it is important to collect comprehensive datasets of populations of icebergs. Particularly, calving of lake-terminating glaciers has been understudied. The aim of this work is to present an object-based method of iceberg detection and to create an inventory of icebergs located in a proglacial lagoon of San Quintin glacier, Northern Patagonia Icefield, Chile. This dataset is created using high-resolution WorldView-2 imagery and a derived DEM. We use it to briefly discuss the iceberg size distribution and area-volume scaling. Segmentation of the multispectral imagery produced a map of objects, which were classified with use of Random Forest supervised classification algorithm. An intermediate classification product was corrected with a ruleset exploiting contextual information and a watershed algorithm that was used to divide multiple touching icebergs into separate objects. Common theoretical heavy-tail statistical distributions were tested as descriptors of iceberg area and volume distributions. Power law models were proposed for the area-volume relationship. The proposed method performed well over the open lake detecting correctly icebergs in all size bands except 5-15 m(2) where many icebergs were missed. A section of the lagoon with ice melange was not reliably mapped due to uniformity of the area in the imagery and DEM. The precision of the DEM limited the scaling effort to icebergs taller than 1.7 m and larger than 99 m(2), despite the inventory containing icebergs as small as 4 m(2). The work demonstrates viability of object-based analysis for lacustrine iceberg detection and shows that the statistical properties of iceberg population at San Quintin glacier match those of populations produced by tidewater glaciers.

AB  - Based on satellite data on sea surface temperature (1985-2018) and surface wind (1992-2017), the parameters of low-frequency variability are calculated and analyzed for the intensity of the Canary, Benguela, Californian, Peruvian, and Chilean upwellings. It is shown that all the analyzed large-scale wind-driven upwellings have intensified in the recent 30 years. The main contribution to this intensification is made by the strengthening of offshore wind. An exception is the Peruvian upwelling, where a trend caused by the wind stress curl intensification prevails.

AB  - A laboratory study on rare earth element bearing mine tailings, collected from Bangka Island, Indonesia, reported a new spectral absorption feature at 674 nm associated with Erbium. The present study aims to evaluate the capability of the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 MSI sensors to detect this absorption feature from space. An arithmetic band operation is performed on selected visible and near-infrared spectral bands of a Sentinel-2 image. The results show that Sentinel-2 MSI is capable of detecting the 674 nm Erbium-related absorption feature within the particular environmental setting of the study area.

TI  - Ingested plastic and trace element concentrations in Short-tailed Shearwaters (<i>Ardenna tenuirostris</i>)
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollution of marine environments is concerning for complex trophic systems. Two anthropogenic stresses associated with marine pollution are the introduction of marine plastic and their associated chemicals (e.g., trace elements) which, when ingested, may cause harm to wildlife. Here we explore the relationship between plastic ingestion and trace element burden in the breast muscle of Short-tailed Shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris). We found no relationship between the amount of plastic ingested and trace element concentration in the birds' tissues. Though the mass and number of plastic items ingested by birds during 1969-2017 did not change significantly, trace element concentrations of some elements (Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr and Cd), appeared to have increased in birds sampled in 2017 compared to limited data from prior studies. We encourage policy which considers the data gleaned from this sentinel species to monitor the anthropogenic alteration of the marine environment.

TI  - Accuracy assessment on the number of flux terms needed to estimate in situ fAPAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) is a crucial variable for assessing global carbon balances and currently, there is an urgent need for reference data to validate satellite-derived fAPAR products. However, it is well-known that fAPAR ground measurements are associated with considerable uncertainties. Generally, fAPAR measurements can be carried out with two-, three- and four-flux approaches, depending on the number of flux terms measured. Currently, not much is known about the number of flux terms needed to satisfactorily reduce systematic errors. This study investigates the accuracy of different fAPAR estimates based on permanent, 10-min PAR measurements using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) at three forest sites, located in Central Europe (mixed-coniferous forest), North America (boreal-deciduous forest) and Central America (tropical dry forest). All fAPAR estimates reflect the seasonal course of fAPAR. The highest average biases of different fAPAR estimates account to 0.02 at the temperate, 0.08 at the boreal and -0.05 at the tropical site, respectively, thereby generally fulfilling the uncertainty threshold of a maximum of 10 % or 0.05 fAPAR units set by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS, 2016). During high wind speed conditions at the boreal site, the bias of the two-flux fAPAR estimate exceeded the 0.05-uncertainty threshold. Three-flux fAPAR estimates were not found to be advantageous, especially at the tropical site. Our findings are beneficial for the development of sampling protocols that are needed to validate global satellite-derived fAPAR products.

TI  - High Spectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS): System Overview and On-Orbit Performance Assessment
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The High Spectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS) is the first Chinese Fourier Transform Michelson interferometer onboard the FengYun 3D (FY-3D) polar-orbiting meteorological satellite launched on November 15, 2017. The FY-3D HIRAS provides infrared (IR) radiance spectra measurements in three spectral bands: the long-wave IR (LWIR) band from 650 to 1135 cm(-1), middle-wave IR (MWIR) band from 1210 to 1750 cm(-1), and short-wave IR (SWIR) band from 2155 to 2550 cm(-1). The ground system processes the interferogram measurements into calibrated radiance spectra. In each cross-track scan, there are 29 observations, each with a field-of-regard (FOR) comprising an array of 2 x 2 field of views. In a six-month intensive campaign period, the HIRAS system was tuned, characterized, and validated. For the operational Level 1 product, the radiance noise levels meet the specifications. The spectral frequency accuracy was improved by maximizing the spectral correlation between the measured and simulated spectra by tuning the instrument-line-shape parameters. The absolute spectral frequency biases are less than 3 part per million (ppm) for all the three bands, and spectral bias standard deviations are less than 3 ppm in the LWIR and MWIR bands, and are about 3-5 ppm in the SWIR band. The radiometric calibration uncertainties were assessed by the comparisons of the radiance spectra between HIRAS and other IR hyperspectral sensors on different satellites. The radiance differences of the cross-sensor comparisons are in general less than 0.3, 0.7, and 1.0 K in the LWIR, MWIR, and SWIR bands, respectively. The HIRAS spectra were also compared with the spectra simulated with a fast radiative transfer model. Some remaining issues for the FY-3D HIRAS are also discussed.

TI  - A remote sensing monitoring method for alpine grasslands desertification in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine grassland is the typical vegetation in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, which has important ecological service functions, and also supports the development of alpine stock farming. In recent years, under both the natural and human disturbance, alpine grasslands in this area have appeared to different degrees of desertification. A diagnosis of the desertification degree serves as the basis for grassland ecological restoration. This study constructs a comprehensive index based on remote sensing called alpine grassland desertification index (AGDI) to monitor the areas and degree of desertification. The most relevant indicators of desertification, namely, vegetation fraction, aboveground biomass, soil moisture, and land surface temperature, were selected to establish AGDI. The geographical detector is used to reselect and assess these indicators. The results show that the overall verification accuracy of AGDI is 82.05%. In particular, the accuracy of identifying severe desertification is the highest. Our study confirms that the desertification of alpine grasslands in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is characterized by fragmentation. Thus, Landsat-8 OLI data with a spatial resolution of 30 m is more suitable than MODIS data for alpine grasslands desertification monitoring. The research results can provide a methodological reference for monitoring desertification of alpine grasslands and other grassland regions in the world.

TI  - Evaluation of Six High-Spatial Resolution Clear-Sky Surface Upward Longwave Radiation Estimation Methods with MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface upward longwave radiation (SULR) is a critical component in the calculation of the Earth's surface radiation budget. Multiple clear-sky SULR estimation methods have been developed for high-spatial resolution satellite observations. Here, we comprehensively evaluated six SULR estimation methods, including the temperature-emissivity physical methods with the input of the MYD11/MYD21 (TE-MYD11/TE-MYD21), the hybrid methods with top-of-atmosphere (TOA) linear/nonlinear/artificial neural network regressions (TOA-LIN/TOA-NLIN/TOA-ANN), and the hybrid method with bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) linear regression (BOA-LIN). The recently released MYD21 product and the BOA-LIN-a newly developed method that considers the spatial heterogeneity of the atmosphere-is used initially to estimate SULR. In addition, the four hybrid methods were compared with simulated datasets. All the six methods were evaluated using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) in situ measurements. Simulation analysis shows that the BOA-LIN is the best one among four hybrid methods with accurate atmospheric profiles as input. Comparison of all the six methods shows that the TE-MYD21 performed the best, with a root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE) of 14.0 and -0.2 W/m(2), respectively. The RMSE of BOA-LIN, TOA-NLIN, TOA-LIN, TOA-ANN, and TE-MYD11 are equal to 15.2, 16.1, 17.2, 21.2, and 18.5 W/m(2), respectively. TE-MYD21 has a much better accuracy than the TE-MYD11 over barren surfaces (NDVI < 0.3) and a similar accuracy over non-barren surfaces (NDVI >= 0.3). BOA-LIN is more stable over varying water vapor conditions, compared to other hybrid methods. We conclude that this study provides a valuable reference for choosing the suitable estimation method in the SULR product generation.

TI  - Achieving Higher Resolution Lake Area from Remote Sensing Images Through an Unsupervised Deep Learning Super-Resolution Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes have been identified as an important indicator of climate change and a finer lake area can better reflect the changes. In this paper, we propose an effective unsupervised deep gradient network (UDGN) to generate a higher resolution lake area from remote sensing images. By exploiting the power of deep learning, UDGN models the internal recurrence of information inside the single image and its corresponding gradient map to generate images with higher spatial resolution. The gradient map is derived from the input image to provide important geographical information. Since the training samples are only extracted from the input image, UDGN can adapt to different settings per image. Based on the superior adaptability of the UDGN model, two strategies are proposed for super-resolution (SR) mapping of lakes from multispectral remote sensing images. Finally, Landsat 8 and MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) images from two study areas on the Tibetan Plateau in China were used to evaluate the performance of UDGN. Compared with four unsupervised SR methods, UDGN obtained the best SR results as well as lake extraction results in terms of both quantitative and visual aspects. The experiments prove that our approach provides a promising way to break through the limitations of median-low resolution remote sensing images in lake change monitoring, and ultimately support finer lake applications.

TI  - The Roles of the S3MPC: Monitoring, Validation and Evolution of Sentinel-3 Altimetry Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-3 Mission Performance Centre (S3MPC) is tasked by the European Space Agency (ESA) to monitor the health of the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites and ensure a high data quality to the users. This paper deals exclusively with the effort devoted to the altimeter and microwave radiometer, both components of the Surface Topography Mission (STM). The altimeters on Sentinel-3A and -3B are the first to operate in delay-Doppler or SAR mode over all Earth surfaces, which enables better spatial resolution of the signal in the along-track direction and improved noise reduction through multi-looking, whilst the radiometer is a two-channel nadir-viewing system. There are regular routine assessments of the instruments through investigation of telemetered housekeeping data, calibrations over selected sites and comparisons of geophysical retrievals with models, in situ data and other satellite systems. These are performed both to monitor the daily production, assessing the uncertainties and errors on the estimates, and also to characterize the long-term performance for climate science applications. This is critical because an undetected drift in performance could be misconstrued as a climate variation. As the data are used by the Copernicus Services (e.g., CMEMS, Global Land Monitoring Services) and by the research community over open ocean, coastal waters, sea ice, land ice, rivers and lakes, the validation activities encompass all these domains, with regular reports openly available. The S3MPC is also in charge of preparing improvements to the processing, and of the development and tuning of algorithms to improve their accuracy. This paper is thus the first refereed publication to bring together the analysis of SAR altimetry across all these different domains to highlight the benefits and existing challenges.

TI  - Comparison of<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Labeled Colloid SPECT/CT and Planar Lymphoscintigraphy in Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Patients with Melanoma: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - We compared the detection rate (DR) for sentinel lymph nodes (SLNS), the number of SLNs and the subjects with additional SLNs of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and planar lymphoscintigraphy (PL) in patients with melanoma. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of SPECT/CT on surgical plans. Articles containing head-to-head comparisons between SPECT/CT and PL were searched in Pubmed/MEDLINE and Scopus. The literature search was updated until December 31st, 2019. DR was calculated on a per-patient-based analysis; the studies were pooled by their odds ratios (ORs) with a random effects model to assess the significance of difference (p< 0.05). The number of additional SLNs (calculated as the relative risk) and pooled proportion of patients with additional SLNs were investigated. The pooled ratio of surgical procedures influenced by the SPECT/CT findings was calculated. Seventeen studies with 1438 patients were eligible for the calculation of DR of SPECT/CT and PL. The average DR was 98.28% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 97.94-99.19%) for the SPECT/CT and 95.53% (95% CI: 92.55-97.77%) for the PL; OR of 2.31 (95% CI: 1.66-4.18,p< 0.001) in favor of the SPECT/CT. There was a relative risk of a higher number of SLNs (1.13) for the SPECT/CT and 17.87% of patients with additional SLNs were detected by SPECT/CT. The average impact of SPECT/CT on surgery resulted in 37.43% of cases. This meta-analysis favored SPECT/CT over PL for the identification of SLNs in patients with melanoma due to a higher DR, reproducibility, number of SLNs depicted, proportion of patients with additional SLNs and the impact on the surgical plan. However, PL remains a good option due to the high values of the DR for SLNs.

TI  - Management of the nodal disease in vulvar cancers. The ESGO guidelines
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Society of Gynaecologic Oncology (ESGO) guidelines cover the whole field of common clinical situations in gynecologic oncology. Their elaboration follows a strict process including a systematic review of the literature, the setting up of a group of expert on the basis of scientific production, geographical balance, and multidisciplinarity, and an external review by users and patients. The recommendations for the management of vulvar cancer were elaborated in 2015 and published in 2017. They are available in open access on the ESGO website, and can be incorporated in clinical practice using the free ESGO guidelines smartphone application. This review is a selection of the sections addressing the diagnostic and strategical aspects of the management of lymph nodal disease in vulvar cancer. An additional review of the recent literature published since 2015 has been carried out. The management of nodal disease in vulvar cancer encompasses a diagnostic and a therapeutic component. Clinical and imaging assessment still play a major role, whilst the identification of the sentinel node is currently a mainstay of assessment of the nodal status in early vulvar cancer. The therapeutic component is based on the rational use of full lymph node dissection and (chemo)radiation.

TI  - Forest Potential Productivity Mapping by Linking Remote-Sensing-Derived Metrics to Site Variables
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A fine-resolution region-wide map of forest site productivity is an essential need for effective large-scale forestry planning and management. In this study, we incorporated Sentinel-2 satellite data into an increment-based measure of forest productivity (biomass growth index (BGI)) derived from climate, lithology, soils, and topographic metrics to map improved BGI (iBGI) in parts of North American Acadian regions. Initially, several Sentinel-2 variables including nine single spectral bands and 12 spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were used in combination with forest management variables to predict tree volume/ha and height using Random Forest. The results showed a 10-12 % increase in out of bag (OOB) r(2)when Sentinel-2 variables were included in the prediction of both volume and height together with BGI. Later, selected Sentinel-2 variables were used for biomass growth prediction in Maine, USA and New Brunswick, Canada using data from 7738 provincial permanent sample plots. The Sentinel-2 red-edge position (S2REP) index was identified as the most important variable over others to have known influence on site productivity. While a slight improvement in the iBGI accuracy occurred compared to the base BGI model (similar to 2%), substantial changes to coefficients of other variables were evident and some site variables became less important when S2REP was included.

TI  - "sen2r": An R toolbox for automatically downloading and preprocessing Sentinel-2 satellite data
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - sen2r is a scalable and flexible R package to enable downloading and preprocessing of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery via an accessible and easy to install interface. It allows the execution of several preprocessing steps which are commonly performed by Sentinel-2 users: searching the Sentinel-2 archive for datasets available over a spatial area of interest and in a defined time window, downloading them, applying the Sen2Cor atmospheric correction algorithm to compute surface reflectances, merging adjacent files, performing geometric transformations, applying a cloud mask, computing spectral indices and colour images. The package is designed to be accessible to a range of users, from beginners to skilled R users. It comes with a Graphical User Interface, which can be used to set the processing parameters and launch processing operations: this feature makes sen2r accessible also for novices with limited programming experience. High-level R functions, which enable customised image processing workflows and control over intermediate steps, can be useful to experienced remote sensing researchers. Thanks to those functions it is possible to easily schedule automatic processing chains, so to manage massive processing operations. This paper describes the main characteristics, functionalities and performance of the package and highlights its usefulness as the operational back-end of service-oriented architectures, as illustrated by the SATURNO project.

M3  - Article
AB  - The paper dwells on results of the analysis of a lexical component "toponyms" of a piece from D. Rubina' s trilogy "Russian Canary" - the novel "Zheltukhin". The lack of research of the works of modern Russian prose, created at the turn of the century, in terms of the lexical component and the importance of a comprehensive consideration of vocabulary as one of the manifestations of the general cultural and national consciousness of society determined the relevance of the study. The scientific novelty of the material explored in the paper is presented as one of constituent parts of a general study of the lexical layer in D. Rubina' s trilogy "Russian Canary" - equivalents of toponymy in the novel "Zheltukhin". The main purpose of the study is to examine toponyms presented in the novel from the point of view of their subject, grammatical structure and other. The material was collected and analyzed by the author using the method of continuous sampling. In the course of the study, following tasks were solved: examining of a lexical layer of the novel by D. Rubina, represented by the toponyms identified during the comprehensive textual analysis; toponyms' division into groups depending on the thematic, the size of the named object and construction of the overall structure.

TI  - Molecular Decolonization: An Indigenous Microcosm Perspective of Planetary Health
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous peoples are resilient peoples with deep traditional knowledge and scientific thought spanning millennia. Global discourse on climate change however has identified Indigenous populations as being a highly vulnerable group due to the habitation in regions undergoing rapid change, and the disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality already faced by this population. Therefore, the need for Indigenous self-determination and the formal recognition of Indigenous knowledges, including micro-level molecular and microbial knowledges, as a critical foundation for planetary health is in urgent need. Through the process of Indigenous decolonization, even at the smallest molecular scale, we define a method back to our original selves and therefore to our planetary origin story. Our health and well-being is directly reflected at the planetary scale, and we suggest, can be rooted through the concept of molecular decolonization, which through the English language emerged from the 'First 1000 Days Australia' and otherwise collectively synthesized globally. It is through our evolving understanding of decolonization at a molecular level, which many of our Indigenous cultural and healing practices subtly embody, that we are better able to translate the intricacies within the current Indigenous scientific worldview through Western forms of discourse.

As a consequence, many massive landslides have occurred in the area in historical times that have destroyed infrastructure, blocked the Hunza River, and damaged the Karakoram Highway repeatedly. However, despite the high frequency of large magnitude landslide events, and the consequent damages, the entire area is largely understudied, mainly due to the difficult logistics and the large distances involved. This work is aimed at applying the potential use of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) for landslide identification and investigation for the Hunza-Nagar Region. Sentinel-1 images covering a period of more than two years (February 2017-August 2019) were used and processed by adopting the small baseline subset (SBAS) method. The obtained deformation rate measured along the line of sight (V-LOS) varies from -114 to 20 mm/year. The downslope velocity deformation rates (V-slope) range from 0 to -300 mm/year. The V(slope)stability threshold for our study area was calculated to be -14 mm/year from the V(slope)standard deviation. Four active landslides with V(slope)exceeding 14 mm/year were recognizable and have been confirmed by field inspection. The identified landslides listed from the most active to least active are the Humarri, Mayoon, Khai, and Ghulmet landslides, respectively. V(LOS)exceeding 114 mm/year was observed in the Humarri landslide, which posed a threat of damming a lake on the Hispar River and was also a risk to the Humarri Village located below the landslide. The maximum mean deformation detected in the Ghulmet, and Mayoon landslide was in the order of 30 mm/year and 20 mm/year, respectively. More importantly, it was found that in places, the slope deformation time series showed a patchy correlation with precipitation and seismic events in the area. This may indicate a complex, and possibly uncoupled, relationship between the two controlling agents promoting the deformation. However, the collective impact of the two factors is evident in the form of a continuously descending deformation curve and clearly indicates the ground distortion. The results indicate a potentially critical situation related to the high deformation rates measured at the Humarri landslide. On this specific slope, conditions leading to a possible catastrophic failure cannot be ruled out and should be a priority for the application of mitigation measures.

TI  - Technique for Concurrent Internal Calibration during Data Acquisition for SAR Systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, stringent requirements for the quality of SAR data products exist. The radiometric and image quality requirements can only be fulfilled by knowing the disturbances caused by the radar hardware itself. The internal calibration is a mechanism to estimate these disturbances from the real hardware. Unfortunately, most of the current internal calibration schemes interrupt the SAR data acquisition during internal calibration and hence cause a loss of azimuth samples and a degradation of the image quality. The calibration is thus often performed only before and after a data take. However, these two calibration events are hardly sufficient to estimate the instrument parameters during the whole acquisition especially for long data takes, which will become more common in future SAR system. In this paper, an internal calibration scheme is introduced which allows performing the internal calibration during nominal data acquisition by injecting a coded calibration signal into the receiver with very low power. This signal causes only minor degradation of the SAR image but can be retrieved from the data using adequate signal processing. This technique is described, the theoretical performance estimated, and finally demonstrated on real data from the TerraSAR-X mission. A selection of possible coding scheme is also analyzed with respect to their suitability for the proposed internal calibration scheme.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Grassland Production and Management-A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Grasslands cover one third of the earth's terrestrial surface and are mainly used for livestock production. The usage type, use intensity and condition of grasslands are often unclear. Remote sensing enables the analysis of grassland production and management on large spatial scales and with high temporal resolution. Despite growing numbers of studies in the field, remote sensing applications in grassland biomes are underrepresented in literature and less streamlined compared to other vegetation types. By reviewing articles within research on satellite-based remote sensing of grassland production traits and management, we describe and evaluate methods and results and reveal spatial and temporal patterns of existing work. In addition, we highlight research gaps and suggest research opportunities. The focus is on managed grasslands and pastures and special emphasize is given to the assessment of studies on grazing intensity and mowing detection based on earth observation data. Grazing and mowing highly influence the production and ecology of grassland and are major grassland management types. In total, 253 research articles were reviewed. The majority of these studies focused on grassland production traits and only 80 articles were about grassland management and use intensity. While the remote sensing-based analysis of grassland production heavily relied on empirical relationships between ground-truth and satellite data or radiation transfer models, the used methods to detect and investigate grassland management differed. In addition, this review identified that studies on grassland production traits with satellite data often lacked including spatial management information into the analyses. Studies focusing on grassland management and use intensity mostly investigated rather small study areas with homogeneous intensity levels among the grassland parcels. Combining grassland production estimations with management information, while accounting for the variability among grasslands, is recommended to facilitate the development of large-scale continuous monitoring and remote sensing grassland products, which have been rare thus far.

TI  - A New Algorithm for Daily Sea Ice Lead Identification in the Arctic and Antarctic Winter from Thermal-Infrared Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of sea ice leads in the sea ice cover represents a key feature in polar regions by controlling the heat exchange between the relatively warm ocean and cold atmosphere due to increased fluxes of turbulent sensible and latent heat. Sea ice leads contribute to the sea ice production and are sources for the formation of dense water which affects the ocean circulation. Atmospheric and ocean models strongly rely on observational data to describe the respective state of the sea ice since numerical models are not able to produce sea ice leads explicitly. For the Arctic, some lead datasets are available, but for the Antarctic, no such data yet exist. Our study presents a new algorithm with which leads are automatically identified in satellite thermal infrared images. A variety of lead metrics is used to distinguish between true leads and detection artefacts with the use of fuzzy logic. We evaluate the outputs and provide pixel-wise uncertainties. Our data yield daily sea ice lead maps at a resolution of 1 km(2)for the winter months November- April 2002/03-2018/19 (Arctic) and April-September 2003-2019 (Antarctic), respectively. The long-term average of the lead frequency distributions show distinct features related to bathymetric structures in both hemispheres. Dataset:10.1594/PANGAEA.917588 Dataset License:CC-BY

TI  - Convolutional Neural Network Detection of Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis Using Standard Clinical Breast MRI
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used an supervised deep learning algorithm, the convolutional neural network, to detect axillary lymph node metastasis on standard clinical breast magnetic resonance imaging scans. Data consisted of 66 abnormal nodes and 193 normal nodes from Stony Brook Hospital patients. The model yielded an accuracy of 84.8% +/- 2.4% and a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.91 +/- 0.02.Background: Axillary lymph node status is important for breast cancer staging and treatment planning as the majority of breast cancer metastasis spreads through the axillary lymph nodes. There is currently no reliable noninvasive imaging method to detect nodal metastasis associated with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were those from the peak contrast dynamic image from 1.5 Tesla MRI scanners at the pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy stage. Data consisted of 66 abnormal nodes from 38 patients and 193 normal nodes from 61 patients. Abnormal nodes were those determined by expert radiologist based on (18)Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography images. Normal nodes were those with negative diagnosis of breast cancer. The convolutional neural network consisted of 5 convolutional layers with filters from 16 to 128. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate prediction performance. For comparison, an expert radiologist also scored the same nodes as normal or abnormal. Results: The convolutional neural network model yielded a specificity of 79.3% +/- 5.1%, sensitivity of 92.1% +/- 2.9%, positive predictive value of 76.9% +/- 4.0%, negative predictive value of 93.3% +/- 1.9%, accuracy of 84.8% +/- 2.4%, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.91 +/- 0.02 for the validation data set. These results compared favorably with scoring by radiologists (accuracy of 78%). Conclusion: The results are encouraging and suggest that this approach may prove useful for classifying lymph node status on MRI in clinical settings in patients with breast cancer, although additional studies are needed before routine clinical use can be realized. This approach has the potential to ultimately be a noninvasive alternative to lymph node biopsy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Novel Vegetation Indices for Cotton Boll Opening Status Estimation Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of chemical harvest aids to defoliate leaves and ripen bolls plays a significant role in the once-over machine harvest of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fields. The boll opening rate (BOR) is a key indicator for the determination of harvest aid spraying times. However, the most commonly used method to determine BOR is manual investigation, which is subjective and cannot have a holistic judgment of the entire area. Remote sensing can be employed to overcome these limitations, due to a wide field of vision, acceptably spatial and temporal resolution, and rich spectral information beyond the perception of the human eye. The reflectance of open cotton bolls is relatively high in the visible and near-infrared bands. High reflectance of open bolls has a great influence on the reflectance of the mixed pixels on remote sensing imagery. Therefore, it is an effective method to detect boll opening status by constructing vegetation indices with the sensitive spectral bands of imagery. In this study, we proposed two new vegetation indices based on Sentinel-2 remote sensing data, namely, the boll area ratio index (BARI) and the boll opening rate index (BORI), in order to estimate the boll opening status on a regional scale. The proposed indices were strongly correlated with the boll area ratio (BAR) and BOR. In particular, BARI exhibited the most accurate and robust performance with BAR in the prediction (R-2 = 0.754, RMSE = 2.56%) and validation (R-2 = 0.706, RMSE = 5.00%) among all the indices, including published indices we chose. Furthermore, when comparing to all other indices, BORI demonstrated the best and satisfactory estimation with BOR in the prediction (R-2 = 0.675, RMSE = 7.96%) and validation (R-2 = 0.616, RMSE = 2.79%). Meanwhile, an exponential growth relationship between BOR and BAR was identified, and the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon were discussed. Overall, through our study, we provided convenient and accurate vegetation indices for the investigation of boll opening status in a cotton-producing area by accessible and free Sentinel-2 imagery.

TI  - Quantifying Uncertainty and Bridging the Scaling Gap in the Retrieval of Leaf Area Index by Coupling Sentinel-2 and UAV Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) estimates can inform decision-making in crop management. The European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite, with observations in the red-edge spectral region, can monitor crops globally at sub-field spatial resolutions (10-20 m). However, satellite LAI estimates require calibration with ground measurements. Calibration is challenged by spatial heterogeneity and scale mismatches between field and satellite measurements. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), generating high-resolution (cm-scale) LAI estimates, provide intermediary observations that we use here to characterise uncertainty and reduce spatial scaling discrepancies between Sentinel-2 observations and field surveys. We use a novel UAV multispectral sensor that matches Sentinel-2 spectral bands, flown in conjunction with LAI ground measurements. UAV and field surveys were conducted on multiple dates-coinciding with different wheat growth stages-that corresponded to Sentinel-2 overpasses. We compared chlorophyll red-edge index (CIred-edge) maps, derived from the Sentinel-2 and UAV platforms. We used Gaussian processes regression machine learning to calibrate a UAV model for LAI, based on ground data. Using the UAV LAI, we evaluated a two-stage calibration approach for generating robust LAI estimates from Sentinel-2. The agreement between Sentinel-2 and UAV CIred-edge values increased with growth stage-R-2 ranged from 0.32 (stem elongation) to 0.75 (milk development). The CIred-edge variance between the two platforms was more comparable later in the growing season due to a more homogeneous and closed wheat canopy. The single-stage Sentinel-2 LAI calibration (i.e., direct calibration from ground measurements) performed poorly (mean R-2 = 0.29, mean NRMSE = 17%) when compared to the two-stage calibration using the UAV data (mean R-2 = 0.88, mean NRMSE = 8%). The two-stage approach reduced both errors and biases by >50%. By upscaling ground measurements and providing more representative model training samples, UAV observations provide an effective and viable means of enhancing Sentinel-2 wheat LAI retrievals. We anticipate that our UAV calibration approach to resolving spatial heterogeneity would enhance the retrieval accuracy of LAI and additional biophysical variables for other arable crop types and a broader range of vegetation cover types.

TI  - Prediction of Yield Productivity Zones from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A/B and Their Evaluation Using Farm Machinery Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yield is one of the primary concerns for any farmer since it is a key to economic prosperity. Yield productivity zones-that is to say, areas with the same yield level within fields over the long-term-are a form of derived (predicted) data from periodic remote sensing, in this study according to the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The delineation of yield productivity zones can (a) increase economic prosperity and (b) reduce the environmental burden by employing site-specific crop management practices which implement advanced geospatial technologies that respect soil heterogeneity. This paper presents yield productivity zone identification and computing based on Sentinel-2A/B and Landsat 8 multispectral satellite data and also quantifies the success rate of yield prediction in comparison to the measured yield data. Yield data on spring barley, winter wheat, corn, and oilseed rape were measured with a spatial resolution of up to several meters directly by a CASE IH harvester in the field. The yield data were available from three plots in three years on the Rostenice Farm in the Czech Republic, with an overall acreage of 176 hectares. The presented yield productivity zones concept was found to be credible for the prediction of yield, including its geospatial variations.

TI  - Canopy Adjustment and Improved Cloud Detection for Remotely Sensed Snow Cover Mapping
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Maps of snow cover serve as early indicators for hydrologic forecasts and as inputs to hydrologic models that inform water management strategies. Advances in snow cover mapping have led to increasing accuracy, but unsatisfactory treatment of vegetation's interference when mapping snow has led to maps that have limited utility for water forecasting. Vegetation affects snow mapping because ground surfaces not visible to the satellite produce uncertainty as to whether the ground is snow covered. At nadir, the forest canopy obscures the satellite view below the canopy. At oblique viewing angles, the forest floor is obscured by both the canopy and the projection of tree profiles onto the forest floor. We present a canopy correction method based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery validated with field observations that mitigates geometric and georegistration issues associated with changing satellite acquisition angles in forested areas. The largest effect from a variable viewing zenith angle on the viewable gap fraction in forested areas occurs in moderately forested areas with 30-40% tree canopy coverage. Cloud cover frequently causes errors in snow identification, with some clouds identified as snow and some snow identified as cloud. A snow-cloud identification method utilizes a time series of fractional vegetation and rock land-surface data to flag snow-cloud identification errors and improve snow-map accuracy reducing bias by 20% over previous methods. Together, these contributions to snow-mapping techniques could advance hydrologic forecasting in forested, snow-dominated basins that comprise an estimated one fifth of Northern Hemisphere snow-covered areas.Plain Language Summary Mapping snow cover extent informs water resources stored in the winter snowpack, providing important information for planning how and when to utilize available water. Tree canopies shield the forest floor and hinder the determination of snow-covered area in vegetated terrain from above, where satellites view the Earth's surface. Moreover, satellites that scan the surface (like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) are most often not directly overhead, and as the view from the satellite to the surface slants, trees obscure a greater portion of the land surface that a satellite can "see," especially where trees are tall, adding uncertainty to the satellite-based maps. This effect is greatest in forests where 30-40% of the land area is covered by tree canopy and has little effect in very dense forests where most of the forest floor is obscured already. Here we present a method to accommodate the stretched and hidden forest footprint when a satellite is not directly overhead. A new method for identifying snow-mapping errors caused by clouds is also presented by flagging unusually large changes in the non-snow surfaces over sequential images. These methodological advancements are important because snow-melt water comprises a major portion of the water supply in many regions where humans live.

TI  - Assessment of Multi-Date Sentinel-1 Polarizations and GLCM Texture Features Capacity for Onion and Sunflower Classification in an Irrigated Valley: An Object Level Approach
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work is to evaluate the capacity of the C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series imagery, acquired by the European satellite Sentinel-1 (S1), for the agriculture crop classification and its reliability to differentiate onion from sunflower, among others. The work then focused on classifying land cover in intensively cultivated agricultural regions. The study was developed in the Bonaerense Valley of the Colorado River (BVCR), Buenos Aires Province in Argentina, backed up by the field truth of 1634 field samples. In addition to the onion and sunflower crops, there are other crops present in the study area such as cereals, alfalfa, potatoes and maize, which are considered as the image background in the classification process. The field samples database was used for training and supporting a supervised classification with two machine learning algorithms-Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)-obtaining high levels of accuracy in each case. Different S1 SAR time-series features were used to assess the performance of S1 crop classification in terms of polarization VH+VV, Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) image texture and a combination of both. The analysis of SAR data and their features was carried out at OBIA lot level (Object Based Image Analysis) showing an optimal strategy to counteract the effect of the residual and inherent speckle noise of the radar signal. In the process of differentiating onion and sunflower crops, the analysis of the VH+VV stack with the SVM algorithm delivered the best statistical classification results in terms of Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Index, (Kp) when other crops (image background) were not considered (OA = 95.35%, Kp = 0.89). Certainly, the GLCM texture analysis derived from the S1 SAR images is a valuable source of information for obtaining very good classification results. When differentiating sunflower from onion considering also other crops present in the BVCR, the GLCM stack proved to be the most suitable dataset analyzed in this work (OA = 89.98%, Kp = 0.66 for SVM algorithm). This working methodology is applicable to other irrigated valleys in Argentina dedicated to intensive crops. There are also variables inherent to each lot, soil, crop and agricultural producer that differ according to the study area and that should be considered for each case in the future.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for Wildland-Urban Interface Fuelbreak Planning Integrating ALS and UAV-Borne LiDAR Data and Multispectral Images
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Controlling vegetation fuels around human settlements is a crucial strategy for reducing fire severity in forests, buildings and infrastructure, as well as protecting human lives. Each country has its own regulations in this respect, but they all have in common that by reducing fuel load, we in turn reduce the intensity and severity of the fire. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-acquired data combined with other passive and active remote sensing data has the greatest performance to planning Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) fuelbreak through machine learning algorithms. Nine remote sensing data sources (active and passive) and four supervised classification algorithms (Random Forest, Linear and Radial Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks) were tested to classify five fuel-area types. We used very high-density Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data acquired by UAV (154 returns.m(-2) and ortho-mosaic of 5-cm pixel), multispectral data from the satellites Pleiades-1B and Sentinel-2, and low-density LiDAR data acquired by Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) (0.5 returns.m(-2), ortho-mosaic of 25 cm pixels). Through the Variable Selection Using Random Forest (VSURF) procedure, a pre-selection of final variables was carried out to train the model. The four algorithms were compared, and it was concluded that the differences among them in overall accuracy (OA) on training datasets were negligible. Although the highest accuracy in the training step was obtained in SVML (OA=94.46%) and in testing in ANN (OA=91.91%), Random Forest was considered to be the most reliable algorithm, since it produced more consistent predictions due to the smaller differences between training and testing performance. Using a combination of Sentinel-2 and the two LiDAR data (UAV and ALS), Random Forest obtained an OA of 90.66% in training and of 91.80% in testing datasets. The differences in accuracy between the data sources used are much greater than between algorithms. LiDAR growth metrics calculated using point clouds in different dates and multispectral information from different seasons of the year are the most important variables in the classification. Our results support the essential role of UAVs in fuelbreak planning and management and thus, in the prevention of forest fires.

TI  - Can We Use Satellite-Based Soil-Moisture Products at High Resolution to Investigate Land-Use Differences and Land-Atmosphere Interactions? A Case Study in the Savanna
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of soil moisture (SM) measurements from satellites has grown in recent years, fostering the development of new products at high resolution. This opens the possibility of using them for certain applications that were normally carried out using in situ data. We investigated this hypothesis through two main analyses using two high-resolution satellite-based soil moisture (SBSM) products that combined microwave with thermal and optical data: (1) The Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DISPATCH) and, (2) The Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity-Barcelona Expert Center (SMOS-BEC Level 4). We used these products to analyse the SM differences among pixels with contrasting vegetation. This was done through the comparison of the SM measurements from satellites and the measurements simulated with a simple antecedent precipitation index (API) model, which did not account for the surface characteristics. Subsequently, the deviation of the SM from satellite with respect to the API model (bias) was analysed and compared for contrasting land use categories. We hypothesised that the differences in the biases of the varied categories could provide information regarding the water retention capacity associated with each type of vegetation. From the satellite measurements, we determined how the SM depended on the tree cover, i.e., the denser the tree cover, the higher the SM. However, in winter periods with light rain events, the tree canopy could dampen the moistening of the soil through interception and conducted higher SM in the open areas. This evolution of the SM differences that depended on the characteristics of each season was observed both from satellite and from in situ measurements taken beneath a tree and in grass on the savanna landscape. The agreement between both types of measurements highlighted the potential of the SBSM products to investigate the SM of each type of vegetation. We found that the results were clearer for DISPATCH, whose data was not smoothed spatially as it was in SMOS-BEC. We also tested whether the relationships between SM and evapotranspiration could be investigated using satellite data. The answer to this question was also positive but required removing the unrealistic high-frequency SM oscillations from the satellite data using a low pass filter. This improved the performance scores of the products and the agreement with the results from the in situ data. These results demonstrated the possibility of using SM data from satellites to substitute ground measurements for the study of land-atmosphere interactions, which encourages efforts to improve the quality and resolution of these measurements.

TI  - Dendritic cells and the skin environment
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The skin is inhabited by several immune cell populations that serve as a first line of defence against pathogen invasion. Amongst these populations are dendritic cells, which play an essential sentinel function by taking up antigen or infectious agents and transporting them to the lymph node for T cell recognition and the priming of immune responses.In this review, we briefly summarise recent advances showing how skin dendritic cells are connected to a network of epithelial and stromal cells, which provide structural support, growth factors, spatial cues, contact with the external environment and the skin microbiome, and favour interactions with other immune cells. We propose that this network creates a unique skin environment that may condition dendritic cell phenotype and function.

TI  - ALERT: Adversarial Learning With Expert Regularization Using Tikhonov Operator for Missing Band Reconstruction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth observation using remote sensing is one of the most important technologies to assimilate key attributes about the Earth's surface. To achieve tangible consequence, the internal building blocks of such a complex system must operate flawlessly. However, due to a dynamically changing environment, degradation in sensor electronics, and extreme weather condition remotely sensed images often miss essential information. As the sensors operate over several years in space the likelihood of sensor degradation persists. This results in commonly observed issues, such as stripe noise, missing partial data, and missing band. Various ground-based solutions have been developed to address these technological bottlenecks individually. In this article, we devise a method, which we call ALERT, to tackle missing band reconstruction. The proposed method reconstructs the missing band with the sole supervision of spectral and spatial priors. We compare the proposed framework with state-of-the-art methods and show compelling improvement both qualitatively and quantitatively. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence of better performance by regularized adversarial learning as compared to complete supervision. Furthermore, we propose a new residual-dense-block (RDB) module to preserve geometric fidelity and assist in efficient gradient flow. We show that ALERT captures essential features such that the spatial and spectral characteristics of the reconstructed band remains preserved. To critically analyze the generalization we test the performance on two different satellite data sets: Resourcesat-2A and WorldView-2. As per our extensive experimentation, the proposed method achieves 20.72%, 13.81%, 1.05%, 15.91%, and 2.94% improvement in the root mean square error (RMSE), SAM, SSIM, PSNR, and SRE, respectively, over the state-of-the-art model.

TI  - Impact of mining activities on areas of environmental protection in the southwest of the Amazon: A GIS- and remote sensing-based assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The southwest Brazilian Amazon state of Rondonia has a relatively recent non-indigenous occupation, which subsequently develops a variety of human pressures and conflicts of interest presently identified in the region. Given such framework, it is worthwhile to note that there are 57 Conservation Units that must guarantee the biodiversity protection of Amazonia biome. However, due to the need for electricity and the international high demand for minerals, the highlighted scenario has dramatically changed in recent years. Official data from mining processes in the studied area demonstrated the existence of high interest for minerals, especially cassiterite and gold. Mining is indeed an essential activity for the nation mainly due to the generation of jobs and income. On the other hand, it produces several environmental and social impacts that vary accordingly to the peculiarities of the mining and with respect to the type of ore. Therefore, this research work investigated the concentration of mining projects in the state of Rondonia and complementarily evaluated the impact of such activities on areas of environmental protection. Landsat 8 OLI imageries were employed to map the diversity of land covers across the study area and also to evaluate the corresponding impact of mining activities. More than 500 processes have been identified within the Conservation Units. A significant part of the mining areas, covering about 26 km(2), was observed inside one of the three types of evaluated areas (Integral Protection Sustainable Use Conservation Units and Damping Zone), clearly showing the development of the illegal activity, as defined in terms of the National System of Conservation Units. If deforestation is considered in this analysis, the area increases to about 6110 km(2), representing more than 5.2% of the Conservation Units. In addition, we proposed the creation of the Mining Pressure Index (MPI), which allows classifying a Conservation Unit by the degree of pressure from mining activities. The proposed index revealed to be very efficient since it predicted high values over Conservation Units where it was expected a greater vulnerability. The index is a promising tool for public policy formulation and management of protected areas, as well as for enforcement action. The results provide a new horizon in terms of the perspective of importance and applicability of geotechnologies in the evaluation of environmental impacts, not restricted to mining activity.

TI  - Variation in the vegetation fade stage and its relationships with climate and vegetation productivity in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the MODIS NDVI data from 2001 to 2018 , we extracted the fade stage of vegetation in Inner Mongolia and the characteristics of its temporal and spatial changes using the Logistic curve maximum curvature method of the cumulative normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI). We analyzed the responses of fade stage to climatic factors and NDVI at the ecological zone level. The results showed that the fade stage in Inner Mongolia occurred between the day of year (DOY) 260 and 280 during the study period. It was DOY 270-280 in the forest ecological zone, and was delayed from the south to north. The fade stage in the grassland ecological zone was the earliest and ranged between DOY 257 and 273 , and was delayed from the northeast to southwest. The fade stage in the desert ecological zone ranged between DOY 270 and 283, which was delayed from the northeast to southwest. From 2001 to 2018, the fade stage in three ecological zones showed an insignificant delaying trend. Spatially, vegetation productivity decreased from the northeast to southwest, with a larger area of an increasing temporal trend than that of a decreasing trend. The fade stage in the entire Inner Mongolia and three ecological zones was greatly affected by precipitation during the two or three months before the fade stage and was positively correlated with the pre-season average temperature, maximum temperature , and minimum temperature, respectively. The increases/decreases in vegetation productivity in August and September delayed/advanced the fade stage in entire Inner Mongolia and three ecological zones. In contrast, the increases/decreases in vegetation productivity in June and July advanced/delayed the fade stage in the grassland and desert ecological zone.

TI  - Graphene Nanoplatelets-Based Ni-Zeolite Composite Catalysts for Heptane Hydrocracking
T2  - C-JOURNAL OF CARBON RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the effect of incorporating graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) in an Ni-based/Zeolite-Y catalyst on the hydrocracking of heptane fuel at two temperatures, 350 and 400 degrees C. Specifically, reduced GNP/NiO-ZY and NiO-ZY catalysts, each with a 5 wt. % Ni loading, were compared in this study. The results show that the reduced GNP/NiO-ZY enhanced the conversion percentage by 31% at 350 degrees C and by 6% at 400 degrees C as compared with the reduced NiO-ZY, and the GNP/NiO-ZY also showed superior stability, reporting a less than 2% drop in conversion over 20 h of time-on-stream. The enhancement in performance is linked to the surface and texture characteristics of both catalysts. Although the calcined GNP/NiO-ZY possessed a lower Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 458 m(2)/g compared with 536 m(2)/g for the calcined NiO-ZY, it showed a more hydrophobic nature, as deduced from the water adsorption profiles, which corroborates the hypothesis that the increased affinity between the catalyst surface and heptane molecules during the reaction leads to an improved catalytic activity.

TI  - Chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids retrieval and mapping using Sentinel-2A and machine learning for inland waters
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) are both key indicators of the biophysical status of inland waters, and their continued monitoring is essential. Existing conventional methods (e.g., in situ monitoring) have shown that they are impractical due to their time and space limitations. The recently operated Sentinel-2A satellite offers the potential to have higher temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution images with no cost for monitoring water quality parameters of inland waters. The main aim of this study was to develop a semi-empirical model for predicting water quality parameters by combining Sentinel-2A data and machine learning methods using samples collected from several water reservoirs within the southern part of the Czech Republic, Central Europe. A combination of 10 spectral bands of the Sentinel-2A and 19 spectral indices, as independent variables, were used to train prediction models (i.e., Cubist) and then produce spatial distribution maps for both Chl-a and TSS. The results showed that the prediction accuracy based on Sentinel-2A was adequate for both Chl-a (R-2 = 0.85, RMSEp = 48.572) and TSS (R-2 = 0.80, RMSEp = 19.55). The spatial distribution maps derived from Sentinel-2A performed well where Chl-a and TSS were relatively high. The temporal changes in both Chl-a and TSS could be seen in the distribution maps. The temporal changes are showing that The values of TSS dramatically changed in fishponds compared to sand lakes over time which might be due to indifferent management practices. Overall, it can be concluded that Sentinel-2A, when coupled with machine learning algorithms, could be employed as a reliable, inexpensive, and accurate instrument for monitoring the biophysical status of small inland waters like fishponds and sandpit lakes.

TI  - Developing Vulnerability Index to Quantify Urban Heat Islands Effects Coupled with Air Pollution: A Case Study of Camden, NJ
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme heat events at urban centers in combination with air pollution pose a serious risk to human health. Among these are financially distressed cities and neighborhoods that are facing enormous challenges without the scientific and technical capacity for planning and mitigation. The city of Camden is one of those economically distressed areas with a predominantly minority population, a high unemployment rate, high poverty rates, and poor air quality (PM(2.5)and ozone), and it remains vulnerable to heat events. This paper focuses on studying a coupled effect of Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) and Ozone-PM(2.5)pollution at the neighborhood-scale in the city of Camden, using fine scale remotely sensed land-surface temperature and air quality data from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Modelling System in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) platform. To assess the impact of urban microclimate on the city of Camden, NJ, residents' health, we identified several environmental and social parameters as the root causes of vulnerability imposed by extreme-heat and poor air quality. Vulnerability in terms of environment and social wellbeing was spatially quantified as two conceptual vulnerability-index models (i.e., environmental vulnerability index (EVI) and a social vulnerability index (SVI)) using multiple linear regression algorithm. Factors such as remotely sensed earth surface properties, built-environment components, air quality, and socio-economic data were incorporated in a holistic geographic approach to quantify the combined effect. Surface temperature gradient and Proportional Vegetation (P-v) generated from 30 m resolution Landsat 8 were sampled along with other variables in the city of Camden, NJ. Models incorporating P(v)suggest better fit than models with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Water fraction (33.5%, 32.4%), percentage imperviousness (32.5%, 32%), P-v(20.5%, 19.6%), and digital elevation model (DEM) (9%, 8%) have the highest contributions in both models. Two output maps identified the vulnerable neighborhoods in the city through comprehensive GIS analysis: Lanning Square, Bergen Square, Central Waterfront, Gateway, Liberty Park, and Parkside. This can provide useful information for planners and health officials in targeting areas for future interventions and mitigations.

TI  - Monitoring inland water quality using remote sensing: potential and limitations of spectral indices, bio-optical simulations, machine learning, and cloud computing
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Given the recent advances in remote sensing analytics, cloud computing, and machine learning, it is imperative to evaluate capabilities of remote sensing for water quality monitoring in the context of water resources management and decision-making. The objectives of this review were to analyze recent advances in water quality remote sensing and determine limitations of current systems, estimation methods, and suggest future improvements. To that end, we collected over 200 sets of water quality data including blue-green algae phycocyanin (BGA-PC), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), dissolved oxygen (DO), specific conductivity (SC), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), turbidity, and pollution-sediments from 2016 to 2018. The water quality data, generated from laboratory analysis of grab samples and in situ real-time monitoring sensors distributed in eight lakes and rivers in Midwestern United States, were paired with synchronous proximal spectra, tripod-mounted hyperspectral imagery, and satellite data. The results showed that both proximal and satellite-based sensors have great potential to provide accurate estimate of optically active parameters, and remote sensing of non-optically active parameters may be indirectly estimated but still remains a challenge. Data-driven empirical approaches, i.e., deep learning outperformed the other competing methods, providing promising possibility for operational use of remote sensing in water quality monitoring and decision-making. As the first-time review of deep neural networks for water quality estimation, the paper concludes that anomaly detection utilizing multi-sensor data fusion and virtual constellation in cloud-computing is the most promising means for predicting impending water pollution outbreaks such as algal blooms.

TI  - Findings from the 2017 HIV estimation round & trend analysis of key indicators 2010-2017: Evidence for prioritising HIV/AIDS programme in India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background & objectives: The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and the ICMR-National Institute of Medical Statistics, the nodal agency for conducting HIV estimations in India, have been generating HIV estimates regularly since 2003. The objective of this study was to describe India's biennial HIV estimation 2017 process, data inputs, tool, methodology and epidemiological assumptions used to generate the HIV estimates and trends of key indicators for 2010-2017 at national and State/Union Territory levels. Methods: Demographic Projection (DemProj) and AIDS Impact Modules (AIM) of Spectrum 5.63 software recommended by the United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS Global Reference Group on HIV Estimates, Modelling and Projections, were used for generating HIV estimations on key indicators. HIV sentinel surveillance, epidemiological and programme data were entered into Estimation Projection Package (EPP), and curve fitting was done using EPP classic model. Finally, calibration was done using the State HIV prevalence of two rounds of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) -3 and -4 and Integrated Biological and Behavioural Surveillance (IBBS), 2014-2015. Results: The national adult prevalence of HIV was estimated to be 0.22 per cent in 2017. Mizoram, Manipur and Nagaland had the highest prevalence over one per cent. An estimated 2.1 million people were living with HIV in 2017, with Maharashtra estimated to have the highest number. Of the 88 thousand annual new HIV infections estimated nationally in 2017, Telangana accounted for the largest share. HIV incidence was found to be higher among key population groups, especially people who inject drugs. The annual AIDS-related deaths were estimated to be 69 thousand nationally. For all indicators, geographic variation in levels and trends between States existed. Interpretation & conclusions: With a slow decline in annual new HIV infections by only 27 per cent from 2010 to 2017 against the national target of 75 per cent by 2020, the national target to end AIDS by 2030 may be missed; although at the sub-national level some States have made better progress to reduce new HIV infection. It calls for reinforcement of HIV prevention, diagnosis and treatment efforts by geographical regions and population groups.

TI  - Cryosphere dynamic study of Hunza Basin using remote sensing, GIS and runoff modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is currently a dangerous phenomenon that has deleterious economic, social and environmental impacts. Climatic fluctuations directly affect the hydrology of an area, which in turn plays a significant role in economy of any country. In Pakistan, River Indus serves as a major fresh water resource, the flow of this river is fed by glaciated ice and snow present in Karakorum, Himalayas and Hindukush ranges. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the cryosphere dynamics of the area in order to determine the impact of climate change so that the water resources will be managed efficiently. To this end, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery of 2010 was used for cryosphere study of Hunza Basin. Daily runoff discharge of Hunza Basin, meteorological parameters, remotely sensed data and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were analyzed synergically in the Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM). Finally, computed runoff was compared with measured runoff for model calibration. Analysis revealed high glacial melting during simulation period. This indicated that regional warming (caused due to climatic fluctuations which were primarily caused by anthropogenic activities) has affected the hydrology of the area. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Estimation of Potato Yield Using Satellite Data at a Municipal Level: A Machine Learning Approach
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop growth modeling and yield forecasting are essential to improve food security policies worldwide. To estimate potato (Solanum tubersum L.) yield over Mexico at a municipal level, we used meteorological data provided by the ERA5 (ECMWF Re-Analysis) dataset developed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, satellite imagery from the TERRA platform, and field information. Five different machine learning algorithms were used to build the models: random forest (rf), support vector machine linear (svmL), support vector machine polynomial (svmP), support vector machine radial (svmR), and general linear model (glm). The optimized models were tested using independent data (2017 and 2018) not used in the training and optimization phase (2004-2016). In terms of percent root mean squared error (%RMSE), the best results were obtained by the rf algorithm in the winter cycle using variables from the first three months of the cycle (R-2= 0.757 and %RMSE = 18.9). For the summer cycle, the best performing model was the svmP which used the first five months of the cycle as variables (R-2= 0.858 and %RMSE = 14.9). Our results indicated that adding predictor variables of the last two months before the harvest did not significantly improved model performances. These results demonstrate that our models can predict potato yield by analyzing the yield of the previous year, the general conditions of NDVI, meteorology, and information related to the irrigation system at a municipal level.

We investigated the effect of measurement error in the prediction of particulate matter with diameter <10 mu m (PM10) and <2.5 mu m (PM2.5) concentrations on the estimation of health effects.Methods: We sampled 1,000 small administrative areas in London, United Kingdom, and simulated the "true" underlying daily exposure surfaces for PM10 and PM2.5 for 2009-2013 incorporating temporal variation and spatial covariance informed by the extensive London monitoring network. We added measurement error assessed by comparing measurements at fixed sites and predictions from spatiotemporal land-use regression (LUR) models; dispersion models; models using satellite data and applying machine learning algorithms; and combinations of these methods through generalized additive models. Two health outcomes were simulated to assess whether the bias varies with the effect size. We applied multilevel Poisson regression to simultaneously model the effect of long- and short-term pollutant exposure. For each scenario, we ran 1,000 simulations to assess measurement error impact on health effect estimation.Results: For long-term exposure to particles, we observed bias toward the null, except for traffic PM2.5 for which only LUR underestimated the effect. For short-term exposure, results were variable between exposure models and bias ranged from -11% (underestimate) to 20% (overestimate) for PM10 and of -20% to 17% for PM2.5. Integration of models performed best in almost all cases.Conclusions: No single exposure model performed optimally across scenarios. In most cases, measurement error resulted in attenuation of the effect estimate.

TI  - The Problems of the Absence of an Inner Self and of Moral Education in Contemporary Japan Echoed in <i>Convenience Store Human</i>
T2  - FORUM FOR WORLD LITERATURE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The limitations of humanism have emerged, and the absence of an inner self in contemporary human beings has also become a genuine concern these days. Will the role of literature, which has mirrored human life and the inner self, be terminated? How can a human being make ethical judgments in literature, an expression of ethics, if a human being has no inner self? To answer these questions, in this article, I focused on Sayaka Murata's Convenience Store Human, especially on Keiko Furukura, the protagonist, who lacks an inner self and figures out that this absence has an effect on ethical matters. I also considered the one part of development of humanism into post-humanism in literature, during the analysis of the novel, examining the symptom of the "internal empty cave," a phrase used to describe the "minds" of young people, which is seen as a pathology of modern Japanese society and a problem of the moral education proscribed by the Japanese government. Furthermore, I reviewed the role and ethics of literature through an analysis of the Convenience Store Human, concluding that it warns and implicates contemporary society as it is aiming to move from a humanist to a post-humanist worldview.

TI  - LAND COVER CHANGE ANALYSIS TO SEDIMENTATION RATE OF RAWAPENING LAKE
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rawapening Lake has specific biogeophysical form, biodiversity potential and socioeconomic also ecological functions which are very important for people's lives and the surrounding environment. Even so, the facts showed that the activities of the population around Rawapening are growing so that problems arise in the form of environmental degradation that has continued to the present. This study aims to determine the development of land cover in the Rawapening River catchment starting from 2000, 2010 and 2019 on the sedimentation rate that occurred in Rawapening Lake. This study applies a Spatial-ecological approach by using multi-temporal remote sensing image data accompanied by field surveys and secondary data from related agencies. The tools used in this study are image processing software and Global Positioning System (GPS), while the data used utilizes RBI maps, Landsat 7 Satellite Images in 2010 and Landsat 8 in 2019. The results showed an increase in the area of developed land by 1,520.54 ha in the period 2000 - 2010 and experienced an increase again in 2019 amounting to 1,330.96 ha. The increase in the area of land developed was due to land conversion, which was largely derived from vegetation cover in the water catchment area (DTA) of Rawapening, where the impact caused by the change in land cover increased the rate of sedimentation that occurred in Rawapening Lake. Therefore, it is necessary to limit the transfer of land functions in the DTA of Rawapening so that it does not cause siltation in Rawapening Lake in the future.

TI  - High-resolution mapping of ash (<i>Fraxinus</i> spp.) in bottomland hardwoods to slow Emerald Ash Borer infestation
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ash (Fraxinus spp.) species are under serious threat by an invasive insect named the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB), already spreading across 35 states in the USA. To track the dramatic progression for effective implementation of ash conservation plans, information on the spatial distribution of host resources is essential. This study aimed at delineating ash trees at the crown level in a mature bottomland hardwood forest under a remote sensing mapping framework. We employed five-band Worldview-3 imagery at 31 cm spatial resolution acquired in the spring and conducted the mapping activity using geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA). Because the training samples and features play important roles in classification, we tested the effects of training sample size and the textural features on the mapping performance. A set of segments that were optimized through a series of test-andtrials in the multiresolution segmentation were used as the basic mapping unit. By testing against field samples, the largest average overall accuracy 82%, was achieved through the random forest classifier. Our findings suggest that the classification accuracy is improved with increased training sample size. The combination of spectral and textural features improved the classification accuracy significantly (p-value <0.05) for two large sample sizes (i.e. n = 200 and n = 230). The GEOBIA framework we demonstrated may guide the future ash tree mapping endeavors regarding the selection of segmentation parameters, sample sizes, and classification features.

TI  - INTEGRATION OF NDVI IMAGERY AND CROP COVERAGE REGISTRATION SYSTEM FOR APIARY SCHEDULE
T2  - JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Beekeepers need to establish migratory apiaries to benefit from pollen and nectar source plants as in order to increase honey yield. Thus, following the flowering seasons of honey source plants has vital importance when deciding the route of migration. In this study, MODIS imagery was used to generate weekly NDVI data between 1st April to 31st August 2018, when beekeeping activities start and end in the study area. Although MODIS images have high temporal resolution, low spatial resolution (250 meters) makes them insufficient when deciding the crop types and plants. While detecting plants in natural plant areas requires high spatial resolution NDVI, Crop Coverage Registration System (CCRS) parcel-based crop coverage records can enrich the NDVI data without increasing spatial resolution in agricultural lands. Thus, the CCRS data were integrated with NDVI images for migratory beekeeping in agricultural areas as an innovation. To generate both high temporal and spatial resolution, NDVI and CCRS data were integrated together with a beekeeping suitability map to generate the apiary schedule. The results were verified with 176 existing apiary locations and production dates retrieved from field studies which revealed the existence of three seasons in the study area as early and late apiaries (in natural plant areas) and apiaries in agricultural lands. Accuracy analysis showed that 82% of the apiaries intersected with suitable locations and that apiaries in agricultural areas were detected five days earlier than in field studies and obtained more accurately than natural plant apiaries.

TI  - A bio-physicochemical perspective of the Bay of Bengal
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of bio-physicochemical variables is essential to better understand the functioning of tropical marine ecosystems, which are rich in biodiversity and provide nutrition and livelihoods to billions of people in the developing countries. This study analysed the spatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton and zooplankton with chlorophyll, primary productivity, temperature, salinity, oxygen and nutrients in the Bay of Bengal (BoB), collecting data from the World Ocean, and COPEPOD and Aqua MODIS records. The results indicated a strong gradient in bio-physicochemical conditions of the BoB, from the coast to the open sea. Specifically, the spatial variability in chlorophyll was negatively correlated (R-2= 0.59) with temperature and zooplankton, while a positive correlation (R-2= 0.70) was noted between chlorophyll and silicate, nitrate, phosphate, dissolved oxygen and salinity. All the variables exhibited a strong vertical gradient at depths up to 500 m. Temperature, nutrients, zooplankton and to a lesser extent salinity and rainfall had an influence on the annual abundance of phytoplankton. Over the long term, a significant positive trend in temperature and a significant negative trend in primary productivity were observed in the BoB. The findings of this study will be useful to draw insights on the state of fisheries habitats and the overall environmental conditions of the BoB in response to future climate changes.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the characteristics of upwelling events during the northeast monsoon, as well as El-Nino impacts towards upwelling in the northwest Sabah, which is located in southern part of the South China Sea by combining remote sensing, reanalysis, and modeling data. The data used in this study obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua satellite for the sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a concentration data, Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) for the vertical cross section of temperature and salinity data, and European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim) for the wind data, as well as Ekman transport and Ekman pumping analysis during December to April 2003-2016. The monthly mean of the climatological data were analyzed and the results showed that the MODIS-Aqua satellite indicates the presence of cooler sea surface temperature (SST) and higher chlorophyll-a concentration along the inshore region of northwest Sabah during the northeast monsoon, indicating the existence of upwelling. Cross-sectional temperature profiles obtained from the HYCOM further confirmed the existence of upwelling as the thermohaline was uplifted from the deeper layer and reached the surface during the northeast monsoon. Ekman transport and Ekman pumping derived from the ECMWF showed an upwelling favorable condition during the northeast monsoon. Comparison between climatological data and El-Nino year in 2016 represented that El-Nino events somehow increase the upwelling intensity due to the intensification of Ekman transport and Ekman pumping.

TI  - Hyperrealism as an Artistic Phenomenon in French Literature of the 20th-21st Centuries
T2  - TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the concept of hyperrealism in the projection on a fictional work of the 20th-21st centuries. The study is focused on the features and techniques of hyperrealism, inherent in different types of art, which have been reflected in literature, in particular French literature. The period of powerful development of digital technologies made scientists wonder about the essence of reality, and taking into account the fact that the latter can create their own reality, their attitude towards it acquires different, modified features: what I see may be or may not be reality. Thus, the dominant philosophy of this period is the attempt to manipulate reality in various forms of art, both verbal and fine art. Hyperrealism in painting, sculpture, and cinema uses similar techniques. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to find out the techniques and means of hyperrealism in the French literature of the 20th-21st centuries. Works of French writers whose creativity is consonant with the techniques of creating/reproducing excessive reality in a literary text were selected as the illustrative base of the research. The methods of component and linguostylistic analysis, as well as elements of communicative-pragmatic and descriptive analyzes were applied to achieve the desired objective. Thus, in the article the narrative technique of detailing the image is positioned as the dominant technique of hyperrealism in French prose works, functioning at the compositional, linguistic, and syntactic levels of the literary text. It is found out that this technique is accompanied by a detailed description of the photograph as a reflection of the development of photorealism precisely in this period and by a realistic description of the city acquiring forms of working with the map. Detailing that runs through the whole content and structure of a fictional work of art is aimed at the reader, in particular at gaining his/her confidence in the events and/or actions depicted. Herewith, the text has a minimum of evaluative characteristics that could simulate the reader's opinion regarding events and/or actions, since all the detailing is directed to the free judgment of the reader. Therefore, the detail is the key element by which you can "grab" the reality, because changing the detail gives rise to a new spiral of reality. The content of the article can serve for further studies of modifications of the concept of reality, its dependence on the worldview of a man, and its multidimensionality on the material of works of fiction or other arts from the perspective of psycho or sociolinguistics.

TI  - Comparative analysis of the pysebal model and lysimeter for estimating actual evapotranspiration of soybean crop in Adana, Turkey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is an important factor in water management, especially in irrigated agriculture. Accurate irrigation scheduling requires accurate estimation of ET. The objective of this study was to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) by the pySEBAL model and to compare it with the actual evapotranspiration measured by the lysimeter method of soybean crop in Adana, Turkey. Five Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images and weather data were used for this study to estimate actual evapotranspiration by the pySEBAL model. The results showed a good relationship between ETa estimated by the pySEBAL model and ETa measured by the lysimeter method, with an R-2 of 0.73, an RMSE of 0.51 mm.day(-1), an MBE of 0.04 mm.day(-1) and a Willmott's index of agreement (d) of 0.90. Based on this study, there is a good relationship between the actual evapotranspiration estimated by the pySEBAL model and the actual evapotranspiration measured by the lysimeter method. Consequently, ETa of soybean crop can be estimated with high accuracy by the pySEBAL model in Adana, Turkey.

M3  - Article
AB  - National monitoring of forestlands and the processes causing canopy cover loss, be they abrupt or gradual, partial or stand clearing, temporary (disturbance) or persisting (deforestation), are necessary at fine scales to inform management, science and policy. This study utilizes the Landsat archive and an ensemble of disturbance algorithms to produce maps attributing event type and timing to >258 million ha of contiguous Unites States forested ecosystems (1986-2010). Nationally, 75.95 million forest ha (759,531 km(2)) experienced change, with 80.6% attributed to removals, 12.4% to wildfire, 4.7% to stress and 2.2% to conversion. Between regions, the relative amounts and rates of removals, wildfire, stress and conversion varied substantially. The removal class had 82.3% (0.01 S.E.) user's and 72.2% (0.02 S.E.) producer's accuracy. A survey of available national attribution datasets, from the data user's perspective, of scale, relevant processes and ecological depth suggests knowledge gaps remain.

TI  - Entomological investigations on sporadic Japanese encephalitis sero-positivity in Tamil Nadu, India
T2  - Entomon
M3  - Article
AB  - In India, Japanese Encephalitis (JE) continues to be a public health issue in some parts of our country. JE surveillance includes early reporting of clinical cases, sentinel sero-surveys and vector surveillance in the endemic areas. In the present study, JE longitudinal vector surveillance and epidemiological investigations were carried out for the first time during two consecutive years in the endemic district of Tamil Nadu. 22,538 mosquitoes were collected, species identified and screened for JE virus by RT-PCR. Predominant was Culex tritaeniorhynchus (60%) and followed by it Anopheles subpictus (23%), Culex quinquefasciatus (8%) and Culex gelidus (3%). It suggests that Culex tritaeniorhynchus may act as major vector and An. subpictus may act as secondary vector. Monsoon and post-monsoon seasons favour breeding of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus leading to vector abundance. Preferential resting sites for Cx. tritaeniorhynchus were pig and cattle shed. Although clinical cases have been reported seasonally in the three blocks, the presence of virus among field caught mosquitoes could not be established by RT-PCR. It may be due to the low titre value of JE virus in mosquitoes. This is the first report of JE investigations in the endemic district of Tamil Nadu and it helps to formulate the effective control strategies for JE virus transmission.

TI  - Mapping and Monitoring Urban Environment through Sentinel-1 SAR Data: A Case Study in the Veneto Region (Italy)
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Focusing on a sustainable and strategic urban development, local governments and public administrations, such as the Veneto Region in Italy, are increasingly addressing their urban and territorial planning to meet national and European policies, along with the principles and goals of the 2030 Agenda for the Sustainable Development. In this regard, we aim at testing a methodology based on a semi-automatic approach able to extract the spatial extent of urban areas, referred to as "urban footprint", from satellite data. In particular, we exploited Sentinel-1 radar imagery through multitemporal analysis of interferometric coherence as well as supervised and non-supervised classification algorithms. Lastly, we compared the results with the land cover map of the Veneto Region for accuracy assessments. Once properly processed and classified, the radar images resulted in high accuracy values, with an overall accuracy ranging between 85% and 90% and percentages of urban footprint differing by less than 1%-2% with respect to the values extracted from the reference land cover map. These results provide not only a reliable and useful support for strategic urban planning and monitoring, but also potentially identify a solid organizational dataflow process to prepare geographic indicators that will help answering the needs of the 2030 Agenda (in particular the goal 11 "Sustainable Cities and Communities").

TI  - Analysis of terrain attributes in different spatial resolutions for digital soil mapping application in southeastern Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrain attributes are used as auxiliary variables in spatial prediction of soil classes and properties, due to their important role in the pedogenetic process and the increasing availability of digital elevation models (DEMs) in different resolutions. This work analyzed the effect of the different spatial resolutions of the DEMs and attributes derived from terrain and their implications for application in DSM predictive models. We used three spatial resolutions from different DEMs: (1) LIDAR - 2 m; (2) ALOS PALSAR - 12.5 and 30 m; (3) SRTM - 30 m; and (4) ASTER GDEM - 30 m. Multivariate analyses were performed determined by the Pearson linear correlation coefficient (r), the K-means cluster analysis, and the principal component analysis (PCA). The prediction of soil classes was performed using the terrain attributes grouped as to sensitivity to resolution, for different spatial resolutions, applying the machine learning algorithms Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The cluster analysis indicated that most attributes remained within the same group of resolution sensitivity with changes in the cell size of reference DEM. The attributes of the terrain grouped low sensitive to resolution derived from the SRTMDEM showed better precision and the main advantage was the low cost and facilitating computational processing for application in the DSM.

Over the past 44 years, the warming trend of the lake's surface waters (0.52 degrees C decade(-1)) and the cooling trend of its deep waters (-0.66 degrees C decade(-1)) during summer (July-September) have resulted in an increased degree of stratification. Furthermore, the stratification period is currently double that of the 1970s. Meanwhile, over the past two decades, lake surface turbidity has remained constant in summer. Although turbidity did decrease during winter, it still remained higher than in the summer months. This reduction in turbidity is likely associated with the decrease in groundwater input into the lake, which has been caused by a significant decrease in rainfall in the aquifer recharge area that feeds the lake through groundwater sources. As a unique freshwater sentinel lake under the influence of the climate change, Lake Banyoles provides evidence that global warming in the western Mediterranean boosts the strength and duration of the lake's stratification and, in response, the associated decrease in the turbidity of its epilimnion.

TI  - New discoveries at Mokarta, a Bronze Age hilltop settlement in western Sicily
T2  - ANTIQUITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive settlement activity at the Bronze Age site of Mokarta in western Sicily has previously been inferred, but the extent and condition of its subsurface remains have never been established. The authors use geophysical prospection, historical and modern remote-sensing data and soil chemistry to identify previously undocumented structures and activity areas extending beyond those exposed by previous excavations. This exercise not only has implications for the multifaceted social organisation of Late Bronze Age communities in Sicily, but, more generally, demonstrates how minimally invasive investigative techniques combined with existing data can reveal subsurface archaeological sites and the impact of post-depositional processes.

TI  - RiMARS: An automated river morphodynamics analysis method based on remote sensing multispectral datasets
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment and monitoring of river morphology own an important role in river engineering; since, changes in river morphology including erosion and sedimentation affect river cross-sections and flow processes. An approach for River Morphodynamics Analysis based on Remote Sensing (RiMARS) was developed and tested on the case of Mollasadra dam construction on the Kor River, Iran. Landsat multispectral images obtained from the open USGS dataset are used to extract river morphology dynamics by the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). RiMARS comes with a river extraction module which is independent of threshold segmentation methods to produce binary-level images. In addition, RiMARS is equipped with developed indices for assessing the morphological alterations. Five characteristics of river morphology (spatiotemporal Sinuosity Index (SI), Absolute Centerline Migration (ACM), Rate of Centerline Migration (RCM), River Linear Pattern (RLP), and Meander Migration Index (MAC)), are applied to quantify river morphology changes. The results indicated that the Kor River centerline underwent average annual migration of 40 cm to the southwest during 1993-2003 (pre-construction impact), 20 cm to the northeast during 2003-2011, and 40 cm to the south-west during 2011-2017 (post-construction impact). Spatially, as the Kor River runs towards the Doroudzan dam, changes in river morphology have increased from upstream to downstream; particularly evident where the river flows in a plain instead of the valley. Based on SI values, there was a 5% change in the straight sinuosity class in the pre-construction period, but an 18% decrease in the straight class during the post-construction period.Here we demonstrate the application of RiMARS in assessing the impact of dam construction on morphometric processes in Kor River, but it can be used to assess other riverine changes, including tracking the unauthorized water consumption using diverted canals. RiMARS can be applied on multispectral images. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparison of Multi-Temporal PlanetScope Data with Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Data for Estimating Airborne LiDAR Derived Canopy Height in Temperate Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing accurate methods for estimating forest structures is essential for efficient forest management. The high spatial and temporal resolution data acquired by CubeSat satellites have desirable characteristics for mapping large-scale forest structural attributes. However, most studies have used a median composite or single image for analyses. The multi-temporal use of CubeSat data may improve prediction accuracy. This study evaluates the capabilities of PlanetScope CubeSat data to estimate canopy height derived from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) by comparing estimates using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data. Random forest (RF) models using a single composite, multi-seasonal composites, and time-series data were investigated at different spatial resolutions of 3, 10, 20, and 30 m. The highest prediction accuracy was obtained by the PlanetScope multi-seasonal composites at 3 m (relative root mean squared error: 51.3%) and Sentinel-2 multi-seasonal composites at the other spatial resolutions (40.5%, 35.2%, and 34.2% for 10, 20, and 30 m, respectively). The results show that RF models using multi-seasonal composites are 1.4% more accurate than those using harmonic metrics from time-series data in the median. PlanetScope is recommended for canopy height mapping at finer spatial resolutions. However, the unique characteristics of PlanetScope data in a spatial and temporal context should be further investigated for operational forest monitoring.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of the present study was to evaluate and analyze the dieback-affected areas of middle Zagros oak forests in Lorestan, Iran. For this purpose, using programming tools, dieback indices, such as DVI, GEMI, IPVI, MSAVI2, NDVI, EVI, OSAVI, Sarvi2, SR, and VHI, were derived from 110 points of oak forests in the underlying area, between 2001 and 2015. Finally, a 23 x 110 matrix (for each year) and a 345 x 110 matrix (for the total period) were developed as a database to detect the dieback areas. Also, we applied cluster analysis to detect the dieback areas and discriminant function analysis was subsequently used to validate the results of cluster analysis. After detecting dieback areas, regression analysis was used for trend analysis of dieback indices, followed with harmonic spectrum analysis for the identification of dominant fluctuations on these indices. The results showed that middle Zagros oak forest could be divided into four zones in terms of dieback incidence, including areas without dieback and small coefficient of variation, areas with moderate dieback and large coefficient of variation, areas with very high dieback rate and large coefficient of variation, and areas with very low dieback rate and small coefficient of variation. According to the results obtained from trend analysis, dieback indices demonstrated a significant downward trend in dieback areas. Also, spectrum analysis revealed that dominant fluctuations on dieback indices of middle Zagros oak forest were mostly short term (2-4 years).

TI  - Cost-effectiveness evaluation for pricing medicines and devices: A new value-based price adjustment system in Japan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. In Japan, a new cost-effectiveness evaluation system for medicine and medical device pricing was employed in April 2019 after a trial implementation. This study describes the discussions held from April 2016 to March 2019 concerning the newly introduced system.Methods. Using published government documents, discussions with stakeholders, and the minutes of the Chuikyo committee meetings, the following issues are addressed: (i) the results of the trial implementation and (ii) an overview of the newly introduced system.Results. During the trial implementation, thirteen products were evaluated and their prices adjusted. The process of the new system-which was to be implemented in FY 2019-takes about 15-18 months to complete after listing of the target products by the National Health Insurance. The target products are selected principally based on sales volume, degree of innovation (premium), and disclosure of rationale for price setting. First, a manufacturer submits the cost-effectiveness data, which is then reviewed by the Center for Outcomes Research and Economic Evaluation for Health (C2H) in collaboration with academics. The results of the cost-effectiveness evaluation are not considered during the decision-making process concerning the product's listing. The price adjustment system is similar to value-based pricing (VBP); hence, the new system can be considered as VBP adjustment.Conclusion. Cost-effectiveness evaluation can help promote both technological innovation and sustainability of the healthcare system. We need to create a greater capacity for enhancing this academic review system.

TI  - Sentinel Node Biopsy in Early Breast Cancer Patients with Palpable Axillary Node.
T2  - Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a reliable method for evaluation of the axillary lymph node status in early stage breast cancer patients with non-palpable lymph nodes. The present study evaluated the status of sentinel and non-sentinel lymph nodes in T1T2 patients with palpable axillary lymph nodes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and two women with early breast cancer were investigated in this study. Patients were selected for axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy and then surgery .Then the rates of false negative and true positive, and diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph nodes biopsy were evaluated. In addition, the hormone receptors status of the tumor was determined through IHC and data was analyzed in SPSS21.RESULTS: In this study, the mean age of the patients was 49 years, 85% had invasive ductal carcinoma in their pathology reports, 77% were ER/PR positive, 30% HER2 positive and 9.8% triple negative and 69% had KI67<14%. In frozen pathology, 15.7 and 84.3% were sentinel positive and negative, respectively, and in the final pathology, 41 and 58.8% were sentinel positive and negative, respectively. This difference arises from the false negative rate of the frozen pathology, which was about 31.3%. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of the frozen section were 24, 90 and 43%, respectively. Lymphovascular invasion is an important effective factor in the involvement of sentinel and non-sentinel lymph nodes. Statistical analysis showed that the probability of sentinel and non-sentinel lymph nodes involvement was higher in receptor positive patients and those with KI67>14% (p<0.002) whereas the rate of involvement was lower in triple negative patients.CONCLUSION: Sentinel node biopsy can be used in a significant percentage of breast cancer patients with palpable and reactive axillary lymph nodes.

TI  - GIS Data as a Valuable Source of Information for Increasing Resolution of the WRF Model for Warsaw
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is commonly associated with meteorological data, but its algorithms may also use geographical data. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact of the high resolution CORINE Land Cover (CLC) data and the SRTM topography on the estimation accuracy of the weather model parameters in the WRF microscale simulations (200 x 200 m) for Warsaw. In the presented studies, the authors propose their own method of attaching the CLC data to the WRF microscale modeling for the CLC border areas, where first calculational domains reach beyond areas of CLC coverage. As a part of the research, the adaptation of the proposed method was examined by the assessment of the WRF microscale modeling simulations for Warsaw. The modified IGBP MODIS land use/land cover (LULC) and USGS GMTED2010 terrain elevation geographical data (30 arc seconds) was applied for the WRF simulations as default. As higher resolution geographical data (100 m), the LULC from CORINE Land Cover (CLC) 2018 data, and the SRTM topography were adopted. In this study the forecasts of air temperature and relative humidity at 2 m, and wind (speed and direction) at 10 m above ground level obtained using the WRF model for particular simulations were evaluated against measurements made at the Warsaw airports: Chopin (EPWA) and Babice (EPBC). The research has indicated that for microscale calculation fields there are noticeable changes in the meteorological parameter values when the CLC and the SRTM data are integrated into the WRF model, which in most cases yielded more accurate values of temperature and relative humidity at 2 m. This has also proved the correctness of the proposed methodology of the CLC data adoption. The improvement in the forecasted meteorological parameters is different for the particular locations and depends on the degree of the LULC and topography data change after higher resolution data adoption.

TI  - Monitoring Agricultural Fields Using Sentinel-1 and Temperature Data in Peru: Case Study of Asparagus (<i>Asparagus officinalis</i> L.)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the analysis and a methodology for monitoring asparagus crops from remote sensing observations in a tropical region, where the local climatological conditions allow farmers to grow two production cycles per year. We used the freely available dual-polarisation GRD data provided by the Sentinel-1 satellite, temperature from a ground station and ground truth from January to August of 2019 to perform the analysis. We showed how particularly the VH polarisation can be used for monitoring the canopy formation, density and the growth rate, revealing connections with temperature. We also present a multi-output machine learning regression algorithm trained on a rich spatio-temporal dataset in which each output estimates the number of asparagus stems that are present in each of the pre-defined crop phenological stages. We tested several scenarios that evaluated the importance of each input data source and feature, with results that showed that the methodology was able to retrieve the number of asparagus stems in each crop stage when using information about starting date and temperature as predictors with coefficients of determination (R-2) between 0.84 and 0.86 and root mean squared error (RMSE) between 2.9 and 2.7. For the multitemporal SAR scenario, results showed a maximum R-2 of 0.87 when using up to 5 images as input and an RMSE that maintains approximately the same values as the number of images increased. This suggests that for the conditions evaluated in this paper, the use of multitemporal SAR data only improved mildly the retrieval when the season start date and accumulated temperature are used to complement the backscatter.

TI  - Monitoring of Surface Temperature on Parco delle Biancane (Italian Geothermal Area) Using Optical Satellite Data, UAV and Field Campaigns
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the surface temperature and the distribution of thermal signatures on Tuscany's geothermal districts using data obtained through three separate surveys via satellite and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The analysis considers the highest available spatial resolution ranging from hundreds of meters per pixel of the satellite thermal images and the tenths/hundreds of centimeters per pixel of the thermal images acquired by the UAV. The surface temperature maps obtained by satellite data acquired at suitable spatial resolution and the thermal measurements obtained by the thermal camera installed on the UAV were orthorectified and geocoded. This allowed, for example, following the evolution of thermal anomalies, which may represent a modification of the current state of the geothermal field and a possible hazard for both the population and industrial assets. Here, we show the results obtained in three field campaigns during which the simultaneous acquisition of Landsat 8 satellite and UAV (FlyBit octocopter, IDS, Rome, Italy) thermal data were analyzed. By removing the atmosphere contribution from Landsat 8 data, we have produced three surface temperature maps that are compared with the ground field measurements and the surface temperature maps elaborated by FLIR VUE PRO-R on the UAV.

AB  - Recently, many studies have been conducted on the changing phenology on the Korean Peninsula due to global warming. However, because of the geographical characteristics, research on plant season in autumn, which is difficult to measure compared to spring season, is insufficient. In this study, all leaves that maple and fallen leaves were defined as 'Decay leaves' and decay leaf detection was performed based on the Landsat-8 satellite image. The first threshold value of decay leaves was calculated by using NDVI and the secondary threshold value of decay leaves was calculated using by NDWI and the difference of spectral characteristics with green leaves. POD, FAR values were used to verify accuracy of the dry leaf detection algorithm in this study, and the results showed high accuracy with POD of 98.619 and FAR of 1.203.

TI  - Assessing the impact of soil moisture and land surface temperature on grasslands in Bundelkhand region of India
T2  - RANGE MANAGEMENT AND AGROFORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study evaluated the physical as well as chemical vulnerability of the grasslands in the Bundelkhand region using a comprehensive approach. The study revealed a significant decrease in grassland cover from 2014 to 2019 and a conforming effect on the moisture content of the soil, especially in the northern region, where it depeleted considerably. Avery large part of the region is vulnerable to soil acidification, with existance of mild alkaline conditions, which might further change the cation exchange capacity in terms of nutrient retention. The dominanace of kaolinite as a clay mineral increased the possibility of in-congruent silicate weathering of plagioclase and feldspar, if further acidification of soil occurs. To relate the sensitivity of the active processes with the moisture avaliability in the region, downscaling of soil moisture was done at a spatial resolution of 1 km using LST and NDVI. The study outlined the importance of proper soil managmenet and prevention of sodic conditions, as a necessary step towards mitigating the harsh physical environment, for the sustenance of grasslands in the region.

T2  - RANGE MANAGEMENT AND AGROFORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study highlights the application of multi-temporal Landsat-8 imageries to identify and discriminate fodder crops from food crops and estimate the area utilized for fodder cultivation in three districts of Haryana during 2016 in Rabi season. Atmospherically, corrected NDVI based spectral-temporal profiles showed that the time of sowing plays an important role to differentiate fodder crops from other crops. ISODATA unsupervised classification approach was used to image classification. Accuracy assessment was carried out between four classes (fodder crops, plantation, forest and other crops) and 91.49% as overall accuracy of classification was observed. The total area under fodder cultivation was estimated as 6.37 per thousand hectares (ha) with 3.60 per thousand hectares in Kurukshetra, 1.94 per thousand hectares in Ambala and 0.83 per thousand hectares in Yamunanagar. Thus it covered an area of approximately 4855 square kilometers which included Ambala, Krukshetra and Yamunanagar districts of Haryana.

T2  - CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Everywhere around the globe, the hot topic of discussion today is the ongoing and fast-spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). Earlier detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, in China in December 2019, the deadly virus engulfed China and some neighboring countries, which claimed thousands of lives in February 2020. The proposed hybrid methodology involves the application of discreet wavelet decomposition to the dataset of deaths due to COVID-19, which splits the input data into component series and then applying an appropriate econometric model to each of the component series for making predictions of death cases in future. ARIMA models are well known econometric forecasting models capable of generating accurate forecasts when applied on wavelet decomposed time series. The input dataset consists of daily death cases from most affected five countries by COVID-19, which is given to the hybrid model for validation and to make one month ahead prediction of death cases. These predictions are compared with that obtained from an ARIMA model to estimate the performance of prediction. The predictions indicate a sharp rise in death cases despite various precautionary measures taken by governments of these countries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Agreement Index for Burned Area Mapping: Integration of Multiple Spectral Indices Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying fire-affected areas is of key importance to support post-fire management strategies and account for the environmental impact of fires. The availability of high spatial and temporal resolution optical satellite data enables the development of procedures for detailed and prompt post-fire mapping. This study proposes a novel approach for integrating multiple spectral indices to generate more accurate burned area maps by exploiting Sentinel-2 images. This approach aims to develop a procedure to combine multiple spectral indices using an adaptive thresholding method and proposes an agreement index to map the burned areas by optimizing omission and commission errors. The approach has been tested for the burned area classification of four study areas in Italy. The proposed agreement index combines multiple spectral indices to select the actual burned pixels, to balance the omission and commission errors, and to optimize the overall accuracy. The results showed the spectral indices singularly performed differently in the four study areas and that high levels of commission errors were achieved, especially for wildfires which occurred during the fall season (up to 0.93) Furthermore, the agreement index showed a good level of accuracy (minimum 0.65, maximum 0.96) for all the study areas, improving the performance compared to assessing the indices individually. This suggests the possibility of testing the methodology on a large set of wildfire cases in different environmental conditions to support the decision-making process. Exploiting the high resolution of optical satellite data, this work contributes to improving the production of detailed burned area maps, which could be integrated into operational services based on the use of Earth Observation products for burned area mapping to support the decision-making process.

TI  - A Methodology for Comparing the Surface Urban Heat Island in Selected Urban Agglomerations Around the World from Sentinel-3 SLSTR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieval of land surface temperature (LST) from satellite data allows to estimate the surface urban heat island (SUHI) as the difference between the LST obtained in the urban area and the LST of its surroundings. However, this definition depends on the selection of the urban and surroundings references, which translates into greater difficulty in comparing SUHI values in different urban agglomerations across the world. In order to avoid this problem, a methodology is proposed that allows reliable quantification of the SUHI. The urban reference is obtained from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover and three surroundings references are considered; that is, the urban adjacent (Su), the future adjacent (Sf), and the peri-urban (Sp), which are obtained from mathematical expressions that depend exclusively on the urban area. In addition, two formulations of SUHI are considered: SUHI(MAX)and SUHIMEAN, which evaluate the maximum and average SUHI of the urban area for each of the three surrounding references. As the urban population growth phenomenon is a world-scale problem, this methodology has been applied to 71 urban agglomerations around the world using LST data obtained from the sea and land surface temperature radiometer (SLSTR) on board Sentinel-3A. The results show average values of SUHI(MEAN)of (1.8 +/- 0.9) degrees C, (2.6 +/- 1.3) degrees C, and (3.1 +/- 1.7) degrees C for Su, Sf, and Sp, respectively, and an average difference between SUHI(MAX)and SUHI(MEAN)of (3.1 +/- 1.1) degrees C. To complete the study, two additional indices have been considered: the Urban Thermal Field Variation Index (UFTVI) and the Discomfort Index (DI), which proved to be essential for understanding the SUHI phenomenon and its consequences on the quality of life of the inhabitants.

TI  - Methylene Blue Absorption in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Early Breast Cancer after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.
T2  - Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chemotherapy is claimed to cause lymphatic drainage damage because of the tumor cell's apoptosis process. This event might cause decreased marker (radioactive solution and/or blue dye) absorption on sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). In this study, the researchers used methylene blue only and wished to evaluate the methylene blue absorption of the SLNB procedure on early-stage breast-cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The method used was the historical cohort study conducted from 2016-2019 in Indonesia. Samples were collected from 117 patients of stage I and II breast cancer with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, who were then grouped into post-NAC and no-NAC (control group), in which SLNB procedures were conducted on the two groups by using single-method methylene blue. The results of methylene blue absorption were then analyzed by the Chi-square hypothesis test.RESULTS: From the total of 564 early-stage patients who were referred to surgical oncologists, 117 patients were found to meet criteria of inclusion, consisting of the control group (52 patients) and the post-NAC group (65 patents). Of 65 patients who had undergone NAC treatment and SLNB procedure, it was found that 40 patients (61.5%) showed positive blue SLN. Of 52 pre-NAC breast-cancer patients, it was found that 47 patients (90.4%) showed methylene blue absorption on SLN with the p-value of 0.000 (P<0.05, significant). The relative risk value amounted to 0.522. Post-NAC patients had a tendency of decreased absorption of methylene blue.CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can cause the decrease of methylene blue absorption on SLNB procedure.

TI  - A tie-point zone group compaction schema for the geolocation data of S-NPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS SDRs to reduce file sizes in memory-sensitive environments
T2  - APPLIED COMPUTING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) disseminates weather and climate-related satellite data to its users via satellite broadcast. As part of this, the EUMETSAT Advanced Retransmission Service (EARS) provides Sensor Data Records (SDR) from the United States satellites Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) and NOAA-20. Due to bandwidth constraints and for cost-reduction reasons for the upload to the disseminating satellite, a near-lossless compaction method has been developed for the geolocation data of the data capturing satellites' Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument. The geolocation data are compacted by storing only the data representation for so called tie-points which form tie-point zones and are grouped in tie-point zone groups. Compression factors of 120 for M-Band, 479 for I-Band, and 154 for Day/Night Band, not using HDF5 internal compression on neither the input nor the output, and 56 for M-Band, 210 for I-Band, and 89 for Day/Night Band, using HDF5 internal compression on both the input and output, respectively, are reached. The compaction process introduces an error of about 1 m RMSE for the position in latitude/longitude and of about 0.001 degrees RMSE for the angular data. The concept of the tie-point zones and the quadratic interpolation schema with coefficients analytically derived from the scanning geometry forms the main elements of the method presented. The full algorithm and mathematical background needed are presented, and the algorithm can be highly parallelized. The method can likely be applied to any cross-track scanning sensor.

TI  - Oncological outcome of videoscopic groin dissection for lymph node metastasis from melanoma
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Videoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy (VIL) represents an innovative approach for patients with melanoma lymph node (LN) metastases, mainly aimed at lowering wound-related morbidity. However, long-term data on oncologic safety are still lacking. The aim of this study is to review the oncologic outcome of videoscopic groin dissection in a single institution caseload. Methods Data were prospectively gathered on patients with inguinal melanoma metastasis who underwent VIL. Clinical data included age, race, sex, tumor histology, node counts and number of metastatic nodes. Disease-free survival and overall survival were monitored based on an institutional follow-up schedule. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Video-SIIO II study). Results We analyzed 48 videoscopic groin dissections performed in 50 patients (2 patients underwent bilateral VIL). Median age was 54.5 years. Female/male ratio was 15/33. Indication for surgery was positive inguinal sentinel biopsy and cytological confirmed clinical disease in 40 and 10 cases, respectively. Median LN retrieval count was 19. After a median follow-up of 28 months, groin recurrence (lymphatic basin) was observed in one single case. Conclusions VIL for melanoma LN metastases is associated with a favorable oncologic outcome. In particular, LN yield and locoregional recurrence rate obtained with videoscopic dissection are comparable to those reported with the open technique. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these results in a larger cohort of patients.

TI  - Effects of building density on land surface temperature in China: Spatial patterns and determinants
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of building density on land surface temperature (LST) and its spatial patterns remain poorly understood over large areas. Using Landsat 8 satellite imagery, we quantified the effects of building density on land surface temperature (K) across 21 cities in China and analysed their spatial patterns, possible factors, and mechanisms. Results showed that the effects of building density on LST were more significant in areas with dry climates compared to humid climates. The spatial variability in the effects of building density on LST was closely related to climate conditions, soil type, and vegetation. The results from stepwise regression analysis showed that precipitation (climate) controlled the spatial variability, indicating that there is a complex mechanism underlying these potential factors. Furthermore, the results from climatic zoning statistics revealed that the K-values of northern Chinese cities were positively correlated with the areas of local water bodies. However, the K-values of southern Chinese cities were significantly and positively correlated with the mean annual temperature and aridity and were negatively correlated with population density. Stepwise regression results further indicated that the mean annual temperature may be the most influential factor for southern cities. These results highlight the spatial variance and different determinants of K and suggest that climate-adapted urban design and planning standards are needed in different climate zones.

TI  - Estimating reed loss caused by <i>Locusta migratoria manilensis</i> using UAV-based hyperspectral data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Locusta migratoria manilensis has caused major damage to vegetation and crops. Quantitative evaluation studies of vegetation loss estimation from locust damage have seldom been found in traditional satellite-remote-sensing-based research due to insufficient temporal-spatial resolution available from most current satellite-based observations. We used remote sensing data acquired from an unmanned aerial vehide (UAV) over a sim-ulated Locusta migratoria manilensis damage experiment on a reed (Phragmites =strolls) canopy in Kenli District, China during July 2017. The experiment was conducted on 72 reed plots, and included three damage duration treatments with each treatment including six locust density levels. To establish the appropriate loss estimation models after locust damage, a hyperspectral imager was mounted on a UAV to collect reed canopy spectra. Loss components of six vegetation indices (RVI, NDVI, SAVI, MSAVI, GNDVI, and IPVI) and two "red edge" parameters (D-r and SDr) were used for constructing the loss estimation models. Results showed that: (1) Among the six selected vegetation indices, loss components of NDVI, MSAVI, and GNDVI were more sensitive to the variation of dry weight loss of reed green leaves and produced smaller estimation errors during the model test process, with RMSEs ranging from 8.8 to 9.1 g/m;. (2) Corresponding model test results based on loss components of the two selected red edge parameters yielded RMSEs of 27.5 g/m(2) and 26.1 g/m(2) for D r and SD r respectively, suggesting an inferior performance of red edge parameters compared with vegetation indices for reed loss estimation. These results demonstrate the great potential of UAV-based loss estimation models for evaluating and quantifying degree of locust damage in an efficient and quantitative manner. The methodology has promise for being transferred to satellite remote sensing data in the future for better monitoring of locust damage of larger geographical areas. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Health effects from contaminant exposure in Baltic Sea birds and marine mammals: A review
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Here we review contaminant exposure and related health effects in six selected Baltic key species. Sentinel species included are common eider, white-tailed eagle, harbour porpoise, harbour seal, ringed seal and grey seal. The review represents the first attempt of summarizing available information and baseline data for these bio-monitoring key species exposed to industrial hazardous substances focusing on anthropogenic persistent organic pollutants (POPs). There was only limited information available for white-tailed eagles and common eider while extensive information exist on POP exposure and health effects in the four marine mammal species. Here we report organ-tissue endpoints (pathologies) and multiple biomarkers used to evaluate health and exposure of key species to POPs, respectively, over the past several decades during which episodes of significant population declines have been reported. Our review shows that POP exposure affects the reproductive system and survival through immune suppression and endocrine disruption, which have led to population-level effects on seals and white-tailed eagles in the Baltic. It is notable that many legacy contaminants, which have been banned for decades, still appear to affect Baltic wildlife. With respect to common eiders, changes in food composition, quality and contaminant exposure seem to have population effects which need to be investigated further, especially during the incubation period where the birds fast. Since new industrial contaminants continuously leak into the environment, we recommend continued monitoring of them in sentinel species in the Baltic, identifying possible effects linked to climate change, and modelling of population level effects of contaminants and climate change.

TI  - Study on the Coastline Evolution in Sopot (2008-2018) Based on Landsat Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastline is the boundary between the water surface in a reservoir or watercourse and the land, which is characterised by high instability and functional diversity. For these reasons, research on coastal monitoring has been conducted for several decades. Currently, satellite images performed with synthetic aperture radars (SARs) are used to determine its course and variability together with high-resolution multispectral imagery from satellites such as IKONOS, QuickBird, and WorldView, or moderate-resolution multispectral images from Landsat satellites. This paper analysed the coastline variability in Sopot (2008-2018) based on Landsat satellite imagery. Furthermore, based on multispectral images obtained, it was determined how the beach surface in Sopot changed. Research has shown that the coastline keeps moving away from the land every year. This was particularly noticeable between 2008 and 2018 when the coastline moved on average 19.1 m towards the Baltic Sea. Moreover, it was observed that the area of the sandy beach in Sopot increased by 14 170.6 m(2), which translates into an increase of 24.7% compared to 2008. The probable cause of the continuous coastline shift towards the sea and the increase of the beach surface is the oceanographic phenomenon called tombolo, which occurred in this area as a result of the construction of a yacht marina near the coast.

TI  - Influence of Satellite Sensor Pixel Size and Overpass Time on Undercounting of Cerrado/Savannah Landscape-Scale Fire Radiative Power (FRP): An Assessment Using the MODIS Airborne Simulator
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The fire radiative power (FRP) of active fires (AFs) is routinely assessed with spaceborne sensors. MODIS is commonly used, and its 1 km nadir pixel size provides a minimum per-pixel FRP detection limit of similar to 5-8 MW, leading to undercounting of AF pixels with FRPs of less than around 10 MW. Since most biomes show increasing AF pixel frequencies with decreasing FRP, this results in MODIS failing to detect many fires burning when it overpasses. However, the exact magnitude of the landscape-scale FRP underestimation induced by this type of AF undercounting remains poorly understood, as does its sensitivity to sensor pixel size and overpass time. We investigate these issues using both 1 km spaceborne MODIS data and 50 m MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) observations of the Brazilian cerrado, a savannah-like environment covering 2 million km(2) (>20%) of Brazil where fires are a frequent occurrence. The MAS data were collected during the 1995 SCAR-B experiment, and are able to be spatially degraded to simulate data from sensors with a wide variety of pixel sizes. We explore multiple versions of these MAS data to deliver recommendations for future satellite sensor design, aiming to discover the most effective sensor characteristics that provide negligible pixel-area related FRP underestimation whilst keeping pixels large enough to deliver relatively wide swath widths. We confirm earlier analyses showing 1 km MODIS-type observations fail to detect a very significant number of active fires, and find the degree of undercounting gets worse away from the early afternoon diurnal fire cycle peak (similar to 15:00 local time). However, the effect of these undetected fires on the assessment of total landscape-scale FRP is far less significant, since they are mostly low FRP fires. Using two different approaches we estimate that the MODIS-type 1 km data underestimates landscape scale FRP by around a third, and that whilst the degree of underestimation worsens away from the diurnal fire cycle peak the effect of this maybe less important since there are far fewer fires present. MAS data degraded to a 200 m spatial resolution provides landscape-scale FRP totals almost indistinguishable from those calculated with the original 50 m MAS observations, and still provides a pixel size consistent with a wide swath imaging instrument. Our work provides a potentially useful guide for future mission developers aiming at active fire and FRP applications, and we conclude that such missions need operate at spatial resolutions no higher than 200 m if they rely on cooled, low-noise IR detectors. Further work confirming this for fire-affected biomes beyond the savannah-type environments studied here is recommended.

TI  - Association of modeled PM<sub>2.5</sub> with aerosol optical depth: model versus satellite
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matters < 2.5 mu m (i.e., PM2.5) are very important for health as well as radiative forcing studies. But over Indian continent, there is scarcity of the observation for PM2.5 concentration which gets measured over only few locations with very coarse resolution. Limitations on resolution in space and time posed by the real-time measurements caused requirement of other measurements with high resolution in space and time. In this regard, satellite observations and model came up as good alternative as they can produce information with high resolution. Satellites and chemical transport models play a significant role and give wider option to study spatial and temporal patterns of particulate matter, especially for finer mode. In the present work, we have simulated the particulate matters (PM2.5) over the Indian continent from 4-29.5 degrees N and 67-88.5 degrees E with the help of a chemical transport model 'CHIMERE.' We found its connection with satellite estimate aerosol optical depth (AOD) from MODIS and MISR sensors. Modeled results can be set for higher resolution than satellite data, so in the absence of satellite data, these relations can be useful. Particulate matters with aerodynamic radius < 2.5 are a contributor to total aerosol load which causes columnar aerosol optical depth. In this work, we took PM2.5 concentration as an indicator of aerosol loading and thus compared it with columnar aerosol optical depth. Both approaches are coherent for various seasons on the year except monsoon as in the monsoon season availability of data from satellite was not consistent.

TI  - Environmental influences on <i>Aedes aegypti</i> catches in Biogents Sentinel traps during a Californian "rear and release" program: Implications for designing surveillance programs
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - As Aedes aegypti continues to expand its global distribution, the diseases it vectors (dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever) are of increasing concern. Modern efforts to control this species include "rear and release" strategies where lab-reared mosquitoes are distributed throughout the landscape to replace or suppress invasive populations. These programs require intensive surveillance efforts to monitor their success, and the Biogents Sentinel (BGS) trap is one of the most effective tools for sampling adult Ae. aegypti. BGS trap catches can be highly variable throughout landscapes, so we investigated the potential impacts of environmental factors on adult Ae. aegypti capture rates during a "rear and release" program in California to better understand the relative contributions of true variability in population density across a landscape and trap context. We recorded male and female Ae. aegypti catches from BGS traps, with and without CO2, throughout control sites where no mosquitoes were released and in treatment sites where males infected with Wolbachia were released. BGS trap catches were positively influenced by higher proportions of shade or bushes in the front yard of the premises as well as the presence of potential larval habitats such as subterranean vaults. In contrast, an increase in residential habitat within a 100 m radius of trap locations negatively influenced BGS trap catches. For male Ae. aegypti, increased visual complexity of the trap location positively influenced capture rates, and the presence of yard drains negatively affected catch rates in control sites. Lastly, for BGS traps using CO2, higher catch rates were noted from traps placed greater than one meter from walls or fences for both male and female mosquitoes. These results have important implications for surveillance programs of Ae. aegypti throughout the Californian urban environment including adult monitoring during "rear and release" programs.

M3  - Article
AB  - The subject of the study is the specialized sculpture parks. At present, they are extremely popular objects of landscape and monumental-decorative arts synthesis with the functions of public spaces and artistic experiments exposition sites. For the modern cities image, the presence of such parks is considered as guarantee of tourist attractiveness, an attribute of dynamic growth and social tone. The article describes the initial period of their autonomy. Sculpture parks formal and informative diversity of the 1940s - 1960s is correlated with the diversity of their artistic concepts as aesthetically expressed ideological programs with their own logic, language, tendencies. The problematization of this correlation is substantiated by the decisive role of artistic concepts for the development of the art synthesis sphere in the second half of the 20th - early 21st century. A range of mono-author and collective concepts is developed through an analysis of regional, territorial, space-planning, formal-compositional, artistic, stylistic, semantic features in the most authoritative synthesis objects of the designated period. Comparison of plastic and space-planning structures nature in the Gustav Vigeland, Carl Milles, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Anton Martin, Edward James, Bunley Sulilat works and the open-air expositions, representing the many authors works, is showed the interpretation of different worldview priorities with positioning a person with his history, mythology, religion, etc. This comparison, in addition, is possible to assess the relevance of artistic concepts, their real efficacy, which is due by the aesthetic and ethical resonance of the sculptures meanings, the meanings of the connections between the sculptures and with nature, and not the size and quantity parameters of the collections. An observation about the primary relevance of sculpture parks with permanently developing, fundamentally incomplete collections of visual and abstract plastics is made. Itself device of these parks based on multiple contrasting of independent authors works on the subject, style, material, size, color, texture is provided a constant increase of the current time meanings. The fact that such parks appeared almost simultaneously in different parts of the world, is given the right to position them as a format of universal and unlimited metaphorical ideas about the infinitely complex and controversial modern world.

TI  - Predicting Soybean Yield at the Regional Scale Using Remote Sensing and Climatic Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield modeling at the regional level is one of the most important methods to ensure the profitability of the agro-industrial economy and the solving of the food security problem. Due to a lack of information about crop distribution over large agricultural areas, as well as the crop separation problem (based on remote sensing data) caused by the similarity of phenological cycles, a question arises regarding the relevance of using data obtained from the arable land mask of the region to predict the yield of individual crops. This study aimed to develop a regression model for soybean crop yield monitoring in municipalities and was conducted in the Khabarovsk Territory, located in the Russian Far East. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, an arable land mask, the meteorological characteristics obtained using the VEGA-Science web service, and crop yield data for 2010-2019 were used. The structure of crop distribution in the Khabarovsk District was reproduced in experimental fields, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) seasonal variation approximating functions were constructed (both for total district sown area and different crops). It was found that the approximating function graph for the experimental fields corresponds to a similar graph for arable land. The maximum NDVI forecast error on the 30th week in 2019 using the approximation parameters according to 2014-2018 did not exceed 0.5%. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.054. The maximum value of the NDVI, as well as the indicators characterizing the temperature regime, soil moisture, and photosynthetically active radiation in the region during the period from the 1st to the 30th calendar weeks of the year, were previously considered as parameters of the regression model for predicting soybean yield. As a result of the experiments, the NDVI and the duration of the growing season were included in the regression model as independent variables. According to 2010-2018, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the regression model was 6.2%, and the soybean yield prediction absolute percentage error (APE) for 2019 was 6.3%, while RMSE was 0.13 t/ha. This approach was evaluated with a leave-one-year-out cross-validation procedure. When the calculated maximum NDVI value was used in the regression equation for early forecasting, MAPE in the 28th-30th weeks was less than 10%.

TI  - Beyond the Myth of Idealism: North Korea's Marxist-Leninist Materialism and Its Place in the Global Intellectual History of the Cold War
T2  - SEOUL JOURNAL OF KOREAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the conventional understanding, by the 1980s North Korean ideology had little to do with Marxism-Leninism, not to mention Marxist-Leninist materialism. Scholars typically highlight the ideology's uniqueness and liken its philosophical worldview to an idealism. From the perspective of intellectual history, the resultant image resembles a disconnect between North Korean ideology and intellectual developments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. This study aims to begin a process of reconnecting these locales into a global intellectual history by demonstrating the deep-seated Marxist-Leninist materialism inherent in North Korean ideology. Through a careful examination of political dictionaries, theoretical journals, and archival documents, this study offers the following reevaluation of North Korean ideology: Even in the 1980s, at the height of North Korean ideology's particularity during the Cold War, Marxist-Leninist materialism remained a fundamental component, crucial to the rationalization of human willpower and North Korea's leadership conception.

T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF STATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, computation for the purpose of spatial visualization is presented in the context of understanding the variability in global environmental processes. Here, we generate synthetic but realistic global data sets and input them into computational algorithms that have a visualization capability; we call this a simulation-visualization system. Visualization is key here, because the algorithms which we are evaluating must respect the spatial structure of the input. We modify, augment, and integrate four existing component technologies: statistical conditional simulation, Discrete Global Grids (DGGs), Array Set Addressing, and a visualization platform for displaying our results on a globe. The internal representation of the data to be visualized is built around the need for efficient storage and computation as well as the need to move up and downresolutions in a mutually consistent way. In effect, we have constructed a Geographic Information System that is based on a DGG and has desirable data storage, computation, and visualization capabilities. We provide an example of how our simulation-visualization system may be used, by evaluating a computational algorithm called Spatial Statistical Data Fusion that was developed for use on big, remote-sensing data sets.

TI  - Spatial monitoring of grassland management using multi-temporal satellite imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial monitoring of grassland management is crucial for ecosystem assessment and the establishment of sustainable agriculture. Switzerland is covered by large areas of small structured grassland parcels differing in management practices and use intensities, making the mapping of grassland management challenging. We present a monitoring tool to map grassland management, distinguishing between mowing- and grazing practice, and between different use intensities for Swiss agroecosystems. By analyzing pixelwise spectral time series of 2015, derived from satellite imagery of the Landsat archive, we estimated the number of management events and biomass productivity. Both estimates were used to map classes of dominant management practices and use intensities following a stepwise clustering approach. The grassland management (GM) classes were evaluated relative to established spectral and topographical patterns of grassland use intensity, and in terms of spatial conformity with available regional land use data. The GM classes were also analyzed with respect to management related vegetation plot data on species diversity, as well as on indicator values for nutrient supply and management tolerance. The stepwise clustering gave three use intensity classes for each dominant management practice of grazing (pasture) and mowing (meadow). Use intensity was higher for meadows than pastures with a distinct intensity gradient for each grassland practice. The GM classes reproduced established spectral and topographical patterns of grassland use intensity, indicated by increased standard deviations (SD) of spectral time series profiles (e.g. mean SD of 0.048 for pastures and 0.054 for meadows) and lower slopes (e.g. mean slopes of 10 degrees for pastures and 7 degrees for meadows). The averaged spatial conformity of the GM classes with a cantonal land use map was 82% for meadows and 97% for pastures. The GM classes spatially matched with land use patterns of three subregions, e.g. with an areal proportion of 73% pasture classes for a subregion dominated by grazing. Moreover, the GM classes reproduced established vegetation patterns of grassland use intensity along the GM intensity gradient, showing a mean decrease in species richness (33%), as well as a mean increase in indicator values for nutrient supply (5%), grazing tolerance (4%), and mowing tolerance (6%).

TI  - Inversion Research on Dust Distribution of Urban Forests in Beijing in Winter Based on Spectral Characteristics
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forests affect the filtration and adsorption of airborne particulate matter, which can minimize the harmful effects on human health caused by airborne particulate pollution. Evergreen plants in urban forests play a major role in absorbing dust and purifying the air, especially in winter. In this study, Euonymus japonicus , the main evergreen vegetation in winter in Beijing, was used as the research object. Three types of sampling space were set up, and 1 410 leaves were collected to measure the hyperspectral data before and after cleaning and the amount of dust absorption (ADA) on the surface of the leaf. The sensitive band was determined by analyzing the response of spectral reflectance to the amount of dust retention, and the regression model was established between the vegetation index ratio and ADA before and after cleaning. The Sentinel-2 remote sensing image was used to obtain the dust distribution of the evergreen vegetation, and the inversion results were verified. The result showed that in the range of 510 similar to 700 and 758 similar to 1 480 nm, the average spectral reflectance of the blade before dust removal is less than that of the clean blade. The change of average spectral reflectance before and after cleaning in the closed zone is less than that in the semi-closed zone, and the change in the open zone is the largest. And the red band and nearinfrared band are most sensitive to dust. The inversion model established using the Normalized Difference Phenology Index (NDPI) is : x=0. 939 69 y (0.)(145)( )(04) (x represents the value of R-NDPI , and y represents the amount of dust retention), and the determination coefficient (R-2) reached 0. 879. The inversion results show that the mean ADA in the enclosed area is smaller than that in semi-enclosed and open areas, and the regional distribution of high ADA in the urban area of Beijing was higher in the south with a tendency of the ADA to decrease from city centre to the surrounding area. Study the spatial distribution of leaf dust retention and provide a reference for rapid monitoring of dust pollution intensity and distribution in urban areas, and exploring the dust retention effect of evergreen shrubs are important for scientifically guiding urban forest construction and improving the living environment of cities in winter.

TI  - Land-Cover and Elevation-Based Mapping of Aboveground Carbon in a Tropical Mixed-Shrub Forest Area in West Java, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon sequestration and storage are among the most important ecosystem services provided by tropical forests. Improving the accuracy of the carbon mapping of tropical forests has always been a challenge, particularly in countries and regions with limited resources, with limited funding to provide high-resolution and high-quality remote sensing data. This study aimed to examine the use of land-cover and elevation-based methods of aboveground carbon mapping in a tropical forest composed of shrubs and trees. We tested a geostatistical method with an ordinary kriging interpolation using three stratification types: no stratification, stratification based on elevation, and stratification based on land-cover type, and compared it with a simple mapping technique, i.e., a lookup table based on a combination of land cover and elevation. A regression modelling with land cover and elevation as predictors was also tested in this study. The best performance was shown by geostatistical interpolation without stratification and geostatistical interpolation based on land cover, with a coefficient of variation (CV) of the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.44, better than the performance of lookup table techniques (with a CV of the RMSE of more than 0.48). The regression modeling provided a significant model, but with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of only 0.29, and a CV of the RMSE of 0.49. The use of other variables should thus be further investigated. We discuss improving aboveground carbon mapping in the study area and the implications of our results for forest management.

TI  - The dog as a sentinel species for environmental effects on human fertility
T2  - REPRODUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite the vast body of evidence that environmental toxicants adversely affect reproductive development and function across species, demonstrating true cause and effect in the human remains a challenge. Human meta-analytical data, showing a temporal decline in male sperm quality, are paralleled by a single laboratory study showing a similar 26-year decline in the dog, which shares the same environment. These data are indicative of a common cause. Environmental chemicals (ECs) detected in reproductive tissues and fluids induce similar, short term, adverse effects on human and dog sperm. Both pre- and post-natal stages of early life development are sensitive to chemical exposures and such changes could potentially cause long term effects in the adult. The environmental 'pollutome' (mixtures of ECs) is determined by industrialisation, atmospheric deposition and bioaccumulation and characterises real-life exposure. In Arctic ecosystems, dietary and non-dietary chemical contaminants are detectable in biological tissues and linked with adverse health effects in both dogs and their handlers. In the female, such exposure could contribute to disorders such as ovarian insufficiency, dysregulated follicle development, ovarian cancer, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. In the dog, ovarian chemical concentrations are greater in the testis. In addition, preliminary studies indicate that dietary exposures may influence the sex ratio in the offspring in favour of females. Within this article, we review current knowledge on chemical effects on human reproduction and suggest that the dog, as a sentinel species for such effects, is an essential tool for addressing critical data gaps in this field.

TI  - Assessing Snow Phenology over the Large Part of Eurasia Using Satellite Observations from 2000 to 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow plays an important role in meteorological, hydrological and ecological processes, and snow phenology variation is critical for improved understanding of climate feedback on snow cover. The main purpose of the study is to explore spatial-temporal changes and variabilities of the extent, timing and duration, as well as phenology of seasonal snow cover across the large part of Eurasia from 2000 through 2016 using a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud-free snow product produced in this study. The results indicate that there are no significant positive or negative interannual trends of snow cover extent (SCE) from 2000 to 2016, but there are large seasonal differences. SCE shows a significant negative trend in spring (p= 0.01) and a positive trend in winter. The stable snow cover areas accounting for 78.8% of the large part of Eurasia, are mainly located north of latitude 45 degrees N and in the mountainous areas. In this stable area, the number of snow-covered days is significantly increasing (p< 0.05) in 6.4% of the region and decreasing in 9.1% of the region, with the decreasing areas being mainly located in high altitude mountain areas and the increasing area occurring mainly in the ephemeral snow cover areas of northeastern and southern China. In central Siberia, Pamir and the Tibetan Plateau, the snow onset date tends to be delayed while the end date is becoming earlier from 2000 to 2016. While in the relatively low altitude plain areas, such as the West Siberian Plain and the Eastern European Plain region, the snow onset date is tending to advance, the end date tends to be delayed, but the increase is not significant.

TI  - Mapping high-resolution percentage canopy cover using a multi-sensor approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate representations of canopy cover are essential for directing natural resource management efforts targeted at issues such as carbon storage, habitat modeling, fire spread, water resources, and ecosystem services. A two-phase classification approach utilizing an iterative classification of high-resolution aerial imagery to develop training data for a regional-scale classification of percentage woody canopy cover (PWCC) using Sentinel-2 imagery is presented in this study, and is tested for a large portion of South Texas (9,200,000 ha). The modeled PWCC for the study area belonged to the respective classes as follows, PWCC0 = 26%, PWCC90 = 14%, PWCC10 = 12%, PWCC80 = 8%, PWCC20 = 7%, PWCC30 = 7%, PWCC70 = 6%, PWCC50 = 5%, PWCC40 = 5%, and PWCC60 = 5%. Statistics indicated that the overall weighted accuracy for the mapped PWCC classes (A(ow)) was 0.82 and that the overall weighted kappa ((k) over cap (w)) was 0.49. To demonstrate the usefulness of the PWCC mapping approach to produce reasonable canopy cover estimates, the relative accuracies of modeled PWCC and other similar canopy cover products (LANDFIRE, NLCD) for the study area were summarized. MAE and RSS values were calculated based on five sample areas of directly measured LiDAR canopy cover estimates. The PWCC mapping approach presented here exhibited significantly MAE values for 5 out of 5 sample areas, and lower RSS values for 4 of 5 sample areas. By class MAE and RSS values were lower for all percentage cover classes. Overall, comparisons of the mapping result with high-resolution aerial imagery and the quantitative assessments indicated that the approach presented here was effective for developing highly detailed canopy cover estimates that can be used for planning and modeling at multiple scales (e.g. regional or local). Additionally, this approach can be employed by individual researchers and is less time and resource consumptive when compared to other large scale approaches. To date, only a limited number of existing studies have focused on approaches that can be used to map tree canopy cover for large areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the problem. In the works of S.A. Yesenin the theme of childhood is not considered as a priority in modern research. At the same time, within the framework of this phenomenon, the most productive is the philological and cultural analysis of the concept of "orphanhood" (both social and spiritual), which is associated with "vagrancy", which determines the relevance of this research.The novelty of the solution. First, the study of the concept of "orphanhood" in the works of S.A. Yesenin is preceded by the study of the poet's life, in which events related to the phenomenon could take place, directly or indirectly influenced the poet's worldview. The 13 most important positions are singled out. Second, the solution of the problem in the framework of one model of understanding of orphanhood is impossible, which is why the existence of two models, the chronological boundary of which is determined by the revolution of 1917, is proved.Substantial aspect. S.A. Yesenin with great attention, sympathy for orphans, which is reflected in his work.The first model of orphanhood, somewhat romanticized, is shown in the works "Orphan" and "Beggar". It reflects in General the behavior of such disadvantaged children, their attitude to society. Orphanhood before 1917 more or less, sacreligious as foolishness. On the one hand, they sought to help, and on the other, they exploited their work with impunity. In a new, non-native family, they usually did all the dirty work.The second model of orphanhood is reflected in the works of "Cigarettes" and "Homeless Russia". If before the revolution, orphanhood was not of a mass character, it was not an organized community with destructive aspirations, now the situation has changed. But the poet does not turn away from them, he is looking for ways to help them. His work is inseparable from reality: " Homeless Russia" was written after a visit to the collector for street children. However, his own children grew up as orphans.

TI  - Landsat-Based Indices Reveal Consistent Recovery of Forested Stream Catchments from Acid Deposition
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Central European forests suffered from severe, large-scale atmospheric depositions of sulfur and nitrogen due to coal-based energy production during the 20th century. High deposition of acid compounds distorted soil chemistry and had negative effects on forest physiology and growth. Since 1994, continuous data on atmospheric deposition and stream runoff fluxes have provided evidence of ecosystem recovery from acidification. In this study, we combined for the first time mass budget data (sulfur deposition and total dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) export) from the GEOMON monitoring network of headwater catchments with annual trajectories of vegetation indices derived from Landsat remote sensing observations. Time series of selected vegetation indices was constructed from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 using Google Earth Engine. Linear regression between the field data and vegetation indices was analyzed using R software. Biogeochemical responses of the forested catchment to declining acid deposition (driven by SO(2)emission reduction) were consistent across all catchments covering various forest stands from different regions of the Czech Republic. Significant correlations were found with total sulfur depositions, suggesting that the forests are continuously and consistently prospering from reductions in acid deposition. Disturbance index (DI) was the only vegetation index that was well-related to changes in forest cover associated with salvage loggings (due to the forest decline) during the 1980s and 1990s. A significant relationship (R-2= 0.82) was found between the change in DI and DIN export in stream water. Regrowth of young forests in these highly affected areas tracks the most pronounced changes in total DIN export, suggesting a prominent role of vegetation in nitrogen retention. With the Landsat-derived DI, we could map decennial changes in forest disturbances beyond the small scale of the catchments to the regional level (demonstrated here for two protected landscape areas). This analysis showed the peak in forest disturbances to have occurred around the mid-1990s, followed by forest recovery and regrowth. Despite the improvement in forest ecosystem functioning over the past three decades in mountainous areas, emerging threats connected to changing climate will shape forest development in the near future.

TI  - Movement of St. Louis encephalitis virus in the Western United States, 2014-2018
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is a flavivirus that circulates in an enzootic cycle between birds and mosquitoes and can also infect humans to cause febrile disease and sometimes encephalitis. Although SLEV is endemic to the United States, no activity was detected in California during the years 2004 through 2014, despite continuous surveillance in mosquitoes and sentinel chickens. In 2015, SLEV-positive mosquito pools were detected in Maricopa County, Arizona, concurrent with an outbreak of human SLEV disease. SLEV-positive mosquito pools were also detected in southeastern California and Nevada in summer 2015. From 2016 to 2018, SLEV was detected in mosquito pools throughout southern and central California, Oregon, Idaho, and Texas. To understand genetic relatedness and geographic dispersal of SLEV in the western United States since 2015, we sequenced four historical genomes (3 from California and 1 from Louisiana) and 26 contemporary SLEV genomes from mosquito pools from locations across the western US. Bayesian phylogeographic approaches were then applied to map the recent spread of SLEV. Three routes of SLEV dispersal in the western United States were identified: Arizona to southern California, Arizona to Central California, and Arizona to all locations east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Given the topography of the Western United States, these routes may have been limited by mountain ranges that influence the movement of avian reservoirs and mosquito vectors, which probably represents the primary mechanism of SLEV dispersal. Our analysis detected repeated SLEV introductions from Arizona into southern California and limited evidence of year-to-year persistence of genomes of the same ancestry. By contrast, genetic tracing suggests that all SLEV activity since 2015 in central California is the result of a single persistent SLEV introduction. The identification of natural barriers that influence SLEV dispersal enhances our understanding of arbovirus ecology in the western United States and may also support regional public health agencies in implementing more targeted vector mitigation efforts to protect their communities more effectively.Author summary Following the detection of West Nile virus in the United States, evidence of the historically endemic and closely related virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), dropped nationwide. However, in 2014, a novel genotype of SLEV, previously restricted to Argentina, was identified as the etiological agent of an outbreak of neurological disease in Arizona, United States. Since that time, the genotype has expanded throughout the Western United States, including into California, Nevada, Texas, Idaho, and Oregon. In this study, samples containing SLEV, provided by public health and mosquito abatement agencies, were sequenced and used in phylogenetic analyses to infer patterns of SLEV movement. Three independent routes of SLEV dispersal were identified: Arizona to Southern California, Arizona to Central California, and Arizona to all locations east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. The Sierra Nevada mountains and the Transverse Ranges appear to separate the three routes of SLEV movement, suggesting that geographic features may act as barriers to virus dispersal. Identification of patterns of SLEV dispersal can support regional public health agencies in improving vector mitigation efforts to protect their communities more effectively.

TI  - WaterNet: A Convolutional Neural Network for Chlorophyll-a Concentration Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations relies on empirical or analytical analyses, which generally experience difficulties from the diversity of inland waters in statistical analyses and the complexity of radiative transfer equations in analytical analyses, respectively. Previous studies proposed the utilization of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to alleviate these problems. However, ANNs do not consider the problem of insufficient in situ samples during model training, and they do not fully utilize the spatial and spectral information of remote sensing images in neural networks. In this study, a two-stage training is introduced to address the problem regarding sample insufficiency. The neural network is pretrained using the samples derived from an existing Chl-a concentration model in the first stage, and the pretrained model is refined with in situ samples in the second stage. A novel convolutional neural network for Chl-a concentration retrieval called WaterNet is proposed which utilizes both spectral and spatial information of remote sensing images. In addition, an end-to-end structure that integrates feature extraction, band expansion, and Chl-a estimation into the neural network leads to an efficient and effective Chl-a concentration retrieval. In experiments, Sentinel-3 images with the same acquisition days of in situ measurements over Laguna Lake in the Philippines were used to train and evaluate WaterNet. The quantitative analyses show that the two-stage training is more likely than the one-stage training to reach the global optimum in the optimization, and WaterNet with two-stage training outperforms, in terms of estimation accuracy, related ANN-based and band-combination-based Chl-a concentration models.

T2  - Deep-Sea Research Part I Oceanographic Research Papers
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Ocean is a vast net sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), with marine phytoplankton playing a crucial role in CO2 fixation. We assessed how changes in the dominant phytoplankton community and net primary productivity (NPP) affected variations in the partial pressure of CO2 in surface water (pCO2sw) in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean during austral summer. pCO2sw was negatively correlated with total phytoplankton and diatom abundances, as estimated from pigment signatures, in the zone south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current; however, pCO2sw was not correlated with haptophyte abundance. Additionally, a stronger correlation was found between pCO2sw and total phytoplankton NPP than between chlorophyll a concentration and pCO2sw. We reconstructed pCO2sw at inter-annual scale using satellite data and assessed the inter-annual variability of air-sea CO2 flux. Over the period from 1997 to 2007, the integrated CO2 fluxes over the study region showed very large variations from a small source to a strong sink. Variations in the integrated CO2 fluxes were also correlated with changes in satellite-derived phytoplankton community in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean and changes in the dominant phytoplankton community may control CO2 dynamics in the marginal ice zone.

TI  - Google Earth Engine for geo-big data applications: A meta-analysis and systematic review
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based geospatial processing platform for large-scale environmental monitoring and analysis. The free-to-use GEE platform provides access to (1) petabytes of publicly available remote sensing imagery and other ready-to-use products with an explorer web app; (2) high-speed parallel processing and machine learning algorithms using Google's computational infrastructure; and (3) a library of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with development environments that support popular coding languages, such as JavaScript and Python. Together these core features enable users to discover, analyze and visualize geospatial big data in powerful ways without needing access to supercomputers or specialized coding expertise. The development of GEE has created much enthusiasm and engagement in the remote sensing and geospatial data science fields. Yet after a decade since GEE was launched, its impact on remote sensing and geospatial science has not been carefully explored. Thus, a systematic review of GEE that can provide readers with the "big picture" of the current status and general trends in GEE is needed. To this end, the decision was taken to perform a meta-analysis investigation of recent peer-reviewed GEE articles focusing on several features, including data, sensor type, study area, spatial resolution, application, strategy, and analytical methods. A total of 349 peer-reviewed articles published in 146 different journals between 2010 and October 2019 were reviewed. Publications and geographical distribution trends showed a broad spectrum of applications in environmental analyses at both regional and global scales. Remote sensing datasets were used in 90% of studies while 10% of the articles utilized ready-to-use products for analyses. Optical satellite imagery with medium spatial resolution, particularly Landsat data with an archive exceeding 40 years, has been used extensively. Linear regression and random forest were the most frequently used algorithms for satellite imagery processing. Among ready-to-use products, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used in 27% of studies for vegetation, crop, land cover mapping and drought monitoring. The results of this study confirm that GEE has and continues to make substantive progress on global challenges involving process of geo-big data.

TI  - Anticipations for and Perceived Barriers of Development among the Sarawak's Highlanders
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a renewed interest of the Sarawak government to develop the highlands in the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (SCORE). However, studies on the perception of the highlanders towards development are scanty. To understand the anticipations of the highlanders and the perceived barriers of development, this study adopted a quantitative approach involving a questionnaire survey among 236 households in the Upper Baram and Mulu. The survey shows that the participants generally welcomed development but were unsure of the modes of development to adopt. In terms of the type of development, most participants preferred rice cultivation and handicraft-making. Most participants in Mulu desired to engage as entrepreneurs while those in Bario and IHAS area were keen on employment. A lack of capital and manpower was perceived as the major barrier of development at individual level. At the community level, the major barriers are remoteness of the settlements and the lack of basic infrastructure and facilities. To optimize the outcomes of development, this study calls for an in-depth understanding of the highlanders' worldview.

TI  - Verification of Fractional Vegetation Coverage and NDVI of Desert Vegetation via UAVRS Technology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification control and scientific evaluation of desert ecosystem sustainability are important issues for countries along the Silk Road Economic Belt. Fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) is used as a quantitative indicator to describe the vegetation coverage of desert ecosystems. Although satellite remote sensing technology has been widely used to retrieve FVC at the regional and global scale, the authenticity evaluation of the inversion results has been flawed. To gain insight into the composition, structure and changes of desert vegetation, it is important to assess the accuracy of FVC and explore the relationship between FVC and meteorological factors. Therefore, we adopted unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing (UAVRS) technology to verify the inversion results and analyse the practicability of MODIS-NDVI (where NDVI = normalized difference vegetation index) products in desert areas. To provide a new method for the estimation of vegetation coverage in the natural state, the relationships between vegetation coverage and four meteorological factors, namely, land surface temperature, temperature, precipitation and evaporation were analysed. The results showed that using the original MODIS-NDVI data product with a spatial resolution of 250 m to invert vegetation coverage is practical in desert areas (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.83, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.052, normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) = 42.94%, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.007) but underestimates vegetation coverage in the study area. MODIS-NDVI data products are different from the real NDVI in the study area. Correcting MODIS-NDVI data products can effectively improve the accuracy of the inversion. When extracting vegetation coverage in this area, the scale has little effect on the results. There is a significant correlation between precipitation, evaporation and FVC in the area, but the interaction of temperature and land surface temperature with precipitation and evaporation also has a considerable impact on FVC, and evaporation has a substantial impact on FVC values inverted from MODIS-NDVI data (FVCM), When exploring the relationship between vegetation coverage and meteorological elements, if vegetation coverage is retrieved from MODIS-NDVI data products or MODIS-NDVI data, when considering temperature and precipitation, the effect of evaporation should also be considered. In addition, meteorological factors can be used to predict FVC (R-2 = 0.7364, RMSE = 0.0623), which provides a new method for estimating FVC in areas with less manual intervention.

TI  - Progress in Remote Sensing Monitoring for Pine Wilt Disease Induced Tree Mortality: A Review
T2  - Forest Research
M3  - Article
AB  - [Objective] To survey the recent developments and summarize the urgent research problems on remote sensing monitoring for pine wilt disease (PWD) induced tree mortality, then to put forward a research idea of monitoring the attacked pine trees via scheme of satellite-airborne-ground collaboration which can meet the complex terrain conditions of south China. [Method] The characteristics of physio-ecology and canopy spectra of affected pine trees were analyzed. The acquisition of remote sensing images, the location and counting of affected pine trees in the past decades were investigated. In addition, some research problems on remote sensing monitoring for PWD induced tree mortality were discussed, and the prospects of future studies were expected. [Result] Each monitoring platform of remote sensing for attacked pine trees has its own advantage. For example, high reliability for ground survey, multi-temporal for remote sensing satellite platform, high spatial resolution and flexibility for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing platform. Of which, the technologies of UAV and high resolution satellite have made a great progress, as well as the interpretation algorithm of remote sensing images. Those two aspects provide a new idea to the quick monitoring of PWD induced pine trees. However, when monitoring the PWD induced tree mortality using the new technologies, there exist some problems, such as the single monitoring means, large position deviation, and low recognition precision and efficiency. [Conclusion] In the future, with the ever-increasing satellites platform and ever-lower cost of UAV, the quick locating of individual affected pine trees and evaluate the damage levels based on multi-source remote sensing data will become a new perspective.

TI  - Chaos-Based Anytime-Reliable Coded Communications
T2  - IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Anytime-reliable communication systems are needed in contexts where the property of vanishing error probability with time is critical. This is the case of unstable real-time systems that have to be controlled through the transmission and processing of remotely sensed data. The most successful anytime-reliable transmission systems developed so far are based on channel codes and channel coding theory. In this paper, another focus is proposed, placing the stress on the waveform level rather than just on the coding level. This alleviates the coding and decoding complexity problems faced by other proposals. To this purpose, chaos theory is successfully exploited in order to design two different anytime-reliable alternatives. The anytime-reliability property is formally demonstrated in each case for the AWGN channel, under given conditions. The simulation results shown validate the theoretical developments, and demonstrate that these systems can achieve anytime reliability with affordable resource expenditure.

TI  - Education of Thinking as a Path to Virtue and Happiness in <i>Qutadghu Bilig</i>
T2  - TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Thinking is one of the most distinguishing characteristics of humans. Man/woman can understand through thinking, find his/her way through thinking, and solve inherent problems after giving some thought. Any educational activity, regardless of its type, initially aims to train the ability of our thinking. Thus although there are relatively new definitions such as "education of thinking", "philosophy with kids", "critical and creative thinking skills" education of thinking is in reality as ancient as the roots of humanity. The reason activities such as knowing, understanding, living, and creating value collectively delineate man's main mission on the earth. Scholars, philosophers, ethicists, scientists, and educators are those who contribute to the development of thinking ability. Currently, training of the mind within the frameset of goodness values, to create a culture of living and worldview, and eventually liberating and improving the person is among the key objectives of education of thinking.Education of thinking does not merely consist of philosophy or pedagogy; it is the combination of both. According to philosophical tradition, activity such as 'education of thinking' and 'philosophy for children' are structured related with philosophers Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, Kant, and Dewey. Through this approach, which enables reconstructing Western philosophers' views with respect to 'education of thinking', 'philosophy for children' is similarly viable to reconstruct the works of Eastern philosophers. One of these works is Qutadghu Bilig written by Yousuf Khass Khajib. Qutadghu Bilig is an outstanding literary work that aims to educate thinking ability and discipline emotions, behaviours and personality through highlighted values. This work attempts to answer the question of how to make qut, a coincidental and luck-based condition, which means 'gizmo, fate, fortune, happiness' and represents a state of goodness of people who have a temporary existence. Qutadghu Bilig asks whether qut can become a permanent entity in human, social and political life and whether it is achievable at all. This literary work attributes the continuity of qut to virtues such as knowledge, justice, forgiveness, compassion, generosity, tenderness, patience and perseverance. To ensure the continuity of qut requires such a higher mental state and spiritual dignity. That is only viable through educating and activating one's thinking ability.

TI  - Mapping Forest Fire Risk and Development of Early Warning System for NW Vietnam Using AHP and MCA/GIS Methods
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires constitute a major environmental problem in tropical countries, especially in the context of climate change and increasing human populations. This paper aims to identify the causes of frequent forest fires in Son La Province, a fire-prone and forested mountainous region in northwest Vietnam, with a view to constructing a forest fire-related database with multiple layers of natural, social and economic information, extracted largely on the basis of Landsat 7 images. The assessment followed an expert systems approach, applying multi-criteria analysis (MCA) with an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to determine the weights of the individual parameters related to forest fires. A multi-indicator function with nine parameters was constructed to establish a forest fire risk map at a scale of 1:100,000 for use at the provincial level. The results were verified through regression analysis, yielding R-2= 0.86. A real-time early warning system for forest fire areas has been developed for practical use by the relevant government authorities to provide more effective forest fire prevention planning for Son La Province.

TI  - Snowmelt-Driven Streamflow Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques (LSTM, NARX, GPR, and SVR)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Although machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly popular in water resource studies, they are not extensively utilized in modeling snowmelt. In this study, we developed a model based on a deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM) for snowmelt-driven discharge modeling in a Himalayan basin. For comparison, we developed the nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model (NARX), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and support vector regression (SVR) models. The snow area derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow images along with remotely sensed meteorological products were utilized as inputs to the models. The Gamma test was conducted to determine the appropriate input combination for the models. The shallow LSTM model with a hidden layer achieved superior results than the deeper LSTM models with multiple hidden layers. Out of seven optimizers tested, Adamax proved to be the aptest optimizer for this study. The evaluation of the ML models was done by the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), modified Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE'), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and root-mean-squared error (RMSE). The LSTM model (KGE' = 0.99) enriched with snow cover input achieved the best results followed by NARX (KGE' = 0.974), GPR (KGE' = 0.95), and SVR (KGE' = 0.949), respectively. The outcome of this study proves the applicability of the ML models, especially the LSTM model, in predicting snowmelt driven discharge in the data-scant mountainous watersheds.

TI  - Development of spectral-phenological features for deep learning to understand <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> invasion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), a native riparian species in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, has led to serious degradation to the ecosystem and biodiversity as well as economic losses since it was introduced to China in 1979. Although multi-temporal remote sensing offers unique capability to monitor S. alterniflora over large areas and long time periods, three major hurdle exist: (1) in the coastal zone where S. alterniflora occupies, frequent cloud coverage reduces the number of available images that can be used; (2) prominent spectral variations exist within the S. alterniflora due to phonological variations; (3) poor spectral separability between S. alterniflora and its co-dominant native species is often presented in the territories where S. alterniflora intruded in. To articulate these questions, we proposed a new pixel-based phenological feature composite method (PpfCM) based on Google Earth Engine. The Ppf-CM method was brainstormed to battle the aforementioned three hurdles as the basic unit for extracting phonological feature is individual pixel in lieu of an entire image scene. With the Ppf-CM-derived phenological feature as inputs, we took a step further to investigate the performance of the latest deep learning method as opposed to that of the conventional support vector machine (SVM); Lastly, we strive to understand how S. alterniflora has changed its spatial distribution in the Beibu Gulf of China from 1995 to 2017. As a result, we found (1) the developed Ppf-CM method can mitigate the phonological variation and augment the spectral separability between S. alterniflora and the background species regardless of the significant cloud coverage in the study area; (2) deep learning, compared to SVM, presented better potentials for incorporating the new phenological features generated from the Ppf-CM method; and (3) for the first time, we discovered a S. alterniflora invasion outbreak occurred during 1996-2001.

TI  - Sampling Uncertainties of Long-Term Remote-Sensing Suspended Sediments Monitoring over China's Seas: Impacts of Cloud Coverage and Sediment Variations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based ocean color sensors have provided an unprecedentedly large amount of information on ocean, coastal and inland waters at varied spatial and temporal scales. However, observations are often adversely affected by cloud coverage and other poor weather conditions, like sun glint, and this influences the accuracy associated with long-term monitoring of water quality parameters. This study uses long-term (2013-2017) and high-frequency (eight observations per day) datasets from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), the first geostationary ocean color satellite sensor, to quantify the cloud coverage over China's seas, the resultant interrupted observations in remote sensing, and their impacts on the retrieval of total suspended sediments (TSS). The monthly mean cloud coverage for the East China Sea (ECS), Bohai Sea (BS) and Yellow Sea (YS) were 62.6%, 67.3% and 69.9%, respectively. Uncertainties regarding the long-term retrieved TSS were affected by a combination of the effects of cloud coverage and TSS variations. The effects of the cloud coverage dominated at the monthly scale, with the mean normalized bias (P-bias) at 14.1% (+/- 2.6%), 7.6% (+/- 2.3%) and 12.2% (+/- 4.3%) for TSS of the ECS, BS and YS, respectively. Cloud coverage-interfering observations with the Terra/Aqua MODIS systems were also estimated, with monthly P(bias)ranging from 6.5% (+/- 7.4%) to 20% (+/- 13.1%) for TSS products, and resulted in a smaller data range and lower maximum to minimum ratio compared to the eight GOCI observations. Furthermore, with approximately 16.7% monthly variations being missed during the periods, significant "missing trends" effects were revealed in monthly TSS variations from Terra/Aqua MODIS. For the entire region and the Bohai Sea, the most appropriate timeframe for sampling ranges from 12:30 to 15:30, while this timeframe was narrowed to from 13:30 to 15:30 for observations in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea. This research project evaluated the effects of cloud coverage and times for sampling on the remote sensing monitoring of ocean color constituents, which would suggest the most appropriate timeframe for ocean color sensor scans, as well as in situ data collection, and can provide design specification guidance for future satellite sensor systems.

TI  - The Estimation of Surface Albedo from DSCOVR EPIC
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is an important parameter in climate models. The main way to obtain continuous surface albedo for large areas is satellite remote sensing. However, the existing albedo products rarely meet daily-scale requirements, which has a large impact on climate change research and rapid dynamic changes of surface analysis. The Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) on the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) platform, which was launched into the Sun-Earth's first Lagrange Point (L1) orbit, can provide spectral images of the entire sunlit face of Earth with 10 narrow channels (from 317 to 780 nm). As EPIC can provide high-temporal resolution data, it is beneficial to explore the feasibility of EPIC to estimate high-temporal resolution surface albedo. In this study, hourly surface albedo was calculated based on EPIC observation data. Then, the estimated albedo results were validated by ground-based observations of different land cover types. The results show that the EPIC albedo is basically consistent with the trend of the ground-based observations in the whole time series variation. The diurnal variation of the surface albedo from the hourly EPIC albedo exhibits a "U" shape curve, which has the same trend as the ground-based observations. Therefore, EPIC is helpful to enhance the temporal resolution of surface albedo to diurnal. Surfaces with a three-dimensional structure that casts shadows display the hotspot effect, producing a reflectance peak in the retro-solar direction and lower reflectance at viewing angles away from the solar direction. DSCOVR observes the entire sunlit face of the Earth, which is helpful to make up for the deficiency in the observations of traditional satellites in the hotspot direction in bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) research, and can help to improve the underestimation of albedo in the direction of hotspot observation.

TI  - Evapotranspiration variations in the Yangtze River Basin from multi-satellite remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) variations in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) are influenced by environmental and climate changes related to planting of crops, forest vegetation, water use and other human activities. However, it is difficult to measure ET variations and analyse influencing factors in the YRB due to lack of in-situ measurements. In the present study, the ET variations were estimated and investigated in the whole, the upper, middle and lower reaches of the YRB using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), optical remote sensing data and hydrological models based on a water balance method, which was validated by MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations and models. Furthermore, GRACE-ET verified the drought events in 2006 and 2011. The long-term variation rate of GRACE-ET is 0.79 mm/yr. The spatial distribution of seasonal ET variations indicates that ET is highest in summer and lowest in autumn-winter. It also shows that the completion of the Three Gorges Project has certainly increased ET. Precipitation and temperature have the largest impact on the ET variations; radiation and soil moisture have moderate effects. ET variations in the middle and lower reaches are greatly affected by precipitation, and temperature plays a more important role in the upper YRB reaches.

TI  - Parasitism and predation of sentinel eggs of the invasive brown marmorated stink bug, <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), in the southeastern US
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasive brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, is present in the Piedmont and expanding into the Coastal Plains Regions of the southeastern US. Consequently, this study was conducted to evaluate parasitism and predation of H. halys sentinel egg masses by native parasitoids and predators in woodland habitats and orchard, vineyard, row, and vegetable crops alongside these habitats in Alabama and Georgia in 2017 and 2018. Ten primary parasitoid species, including two new records, and one hyperparasitoid emerged from eggs. Trissolcus japonicus was not detected. Ooencyrtus sp. was the prevalent parasitoid species in vegetables while Telenomus podisi was the predominant species in row crops. Anastatus reduvii, An. mirabilis, Tr. brochymenae, and Tr. euschisti were the prevalent species in woodland and orchard habitats. Trissolcus edessae Fouts occurred primarily in orchards. Trissolcus basalis and Gyron obesum were observed in vegetable habitats. Percentage successful development to adults, sex ratio, and percentage of parasitism per egg mass was highest for Tr. edessae. Predation damage included complete and incomplete chewing, stylet sucking, puncture sucking, and removal of whole eggs from egg masses. Hole and non-stylet sucking damage were discovered. Chewing and piercing-sucking predation constituted the majority of predation in woodlands, plum, blueberry, tomato, pecan, peach, and okra. Mainly chewing predation and egg removal occurred in soybean, cotton, and strawberry. Piercing-sucking predation was common in wine grape and apple. There was no difference between fresh and frozen eggs in the proportion of parasitism and predation both years. In 2017, overall percent parasitism was higher for blueberry compared to other crops except peach and apple. No differences were detected in 2018. Peak parasitism (72.3%) in apple at a site in 2017 represented the highest parasitism rate. Predation was highest in soybean and cotton. Indeed, predation in soybean reached very high levels in 2017 (96.3%) and 2018 (90.3%). In conclusion, native natural enemies parasitize and prey on H. halys egg masses in the southeastern US.

TI  - Investigating the Effects of Land Use and Land Cover on the Relationship between Moisture and Reflectance Using Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand the Earth system, it is important to investigate the interactions between precipitation, land use/land cover (LULC), and the land surface, especially vegetation. An improved understanding of these land-atmosphere interactions can aid understanding of the climate system and modeling of time series satellite data. Here, we investigate the effect of precipitation and LULC on the reflectance of the land surface in the northern U.S. Great Plains. We utilize time series satellite data from the 45 year Landsat archive. The length of the Landsat record allows for analysis of multiple periods of drought and wet conditions (reflecting climate, as well as weather), such that the precipitation-reflectance relationship can be investigated robustly for every individual pixel in the study area. The high spatial resolution of Landsat (30 m) allows for investigation of spatial patterns in weather (i.e., precipitation extremes) interactions with land surface reflectance at the scale of individual fields. Weather history is represented by a drought index that describes effective moisture availability, the Standardized Precipitation and Evaporation Index (SPEI). We find that effective moisture has a robust and consistent effect on reflectance over many types of land cover, with similar to 90% of all pixels having significantly (p<0.01) higher visible reflectance during dry periods than during wet, occurring in nearly all regional, temporal, and LULC categories investigated. In grassland, the relationship is especially strong; there is an average reflectance increase of more than a third between very wet and very dry conditions (red band), and similar to 99% of pixels have a significant relationship. In cropland, the effective moisture-reflectance relationship is more variable, suggesting that management decisions are an important factor in cropland-reflectance relationships.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Sea Surface Artificial Floating Plastic Targets with Sentinel-2 and Unmanned Aerial Systems (Plastic Litter Project 2019)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is a promising tool for the detection of floating marine plastics offering extensive area coverage and frequent observations. While floating plastics are reported in high concentrations in many places around the globe, no referencing dataset exists either for understanding the spectral behavior of floating plastics in a real environment, or for calibrating remote sensing algorithms and validating their results. To tackle this problem, we initiated the Plastic Litter Projects (PLPs), where large artificial plastic targets were constructed and deployed on the sea surface. The first such experiment was realised in the summer of 2018 (PLP2018) with three large targets of 10 x 10 m. Hereafter, we present the second Plastic Litter Project (PLP2019), where smaller 5 x 5 m targets were constructed to better simulate near-real conditions and examine the limitations of the detection with Sentinel-2 images. The smaller targets and the multiple acquisition dates allowed for several observations, with the targets being connected in a modular way to create different configurations of various sizes, material composition and coverage. A spectral signature for the PET (polyethylene terephthalate) targets was produced through modifying the U.S. Geological Survey PET signature using an inverse spectral unmixing calculation, and the resulting signature was used to perform a matched filtering processing on the Sentinel-2 images. The results provide evidence that under suitable conditions, pixels with a PET abundance fraction of at least as low as 25% can be successfully detected, while pinpointing several factors that significantly impact the detection capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, the 2018 and 2019 Plastic Litter Projects are to date the only large-scale field experiments on the remote detection of floating marine litter in a near-real environment and can be used as a reference for more extensive validation/calibration campaigns.

TI  - Sensitivity of Modeled CO<sub>2</sub>Air-Sea Flux in a Coastal Environment to Surface Temperature Gradients, Surfactants, and Satellite Data Assimilation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work evaluates the sensitivity of CO(2)air-sea gas exchange in a coastal site to four different model system configurations of the 1D coupled hydrodynamic-ecosystem model GOTM-ERSEM, towards identifying critical dynamics of relevance when specifically addressing quantification of air-sea CO(2)exchange. The European Sea Regional Ecosystem Model (ERSEM) is a biomass and functional group-based biogeochemical model that includes a comprehensive carbonate system and explicitly simulates the production of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon and organic matter. The model was implemented at the coastal station L4 (4 nm south of Plymouth, 50 degrees 15.00'N, 4 degrees 13.02'W, depth of 51 m). The model performance was evaluated using more than 1500 hydrological and biochemical observations routinely collected at L4 through the Western Coastal Observatory activities of 2008-2009. In addition to a reference simulation (A), we ran three distinct experiments to investigate the sensitivity of the carbonate system and modeled air-sea fluxes to (B) the sea-surface temperature (SST) diurnal cycle and thus also the near-surface vertical gradients, (C) biological suppression of gas exchange and (D) data assimilation using satellite Earth observation data. The reference simulation captures well the physical environment (simulated SST has a correlation with observations equal to 0.94 with ap> 0.95). Overall, the model captures the seasonal signal in most biogeochemical variables including the air-sea flux of CO(2)and primary production and can capture some of the intra-seasonal variability and short-lived blooms. The model correctly reproduces the seasonality of nutrients (correlation > 0.80 for silicate, nitrate and phosphate), surface chlorophyll-a (correlation > 0.43) and total biomass (correlation > 0.7) in a two year run for 2008-2009. The model simulates well the concentration of DIC, pH and in-water partial pressure of CO2(pCO(2)) with correlations between 0.4-0.5. The model result suggest that L4 is a weak net source of CO2(0.3-1.8 molCm(-2)year(-1)). The results of the three sensitivity experiments indicate that both resolving the temperature profile near the surface and assimilation of surface chlorophyll-a significantly impact the skill of simulating the biogeochemistry at L4 and all of the carbonate chemistry related variables. These results indicate that our forecasting ability of CO(2)air-sea flux in shelf seas environments and their impact in climate modeling should consider both model refinements as means of reducing uncertainties and errors in any future climate projections.

TI  - Mapping Submerged Aquatic Vegetation along the Central Vietnamese Coast Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the Khanh Hoa (Vietnam) coastal area plays an important role in coastal communities and the marine ecosystem. However, SAV distribution varies widely, in terms of depth and substrate types, making it difficult to monitor using in-situ measurement. Remote sensing can help address this issue. High spatial resolution satellites, with more bands and higher radiometric sensitivity, have been launched recently, including the Vietnamese Natural Resources, Environment, and Disaster Monitoring Satellite (VNREDSat-1) (V1) sensor from Vietnam, launched in 2013. The objective of the study described here was to establish SAV distribution maps for South-Central Vietnam, particularly in the Khanh Hoa coastal area, using Sentinel-2 (S2), Landsat-8, and V1 imagery, and then to assess any changes to SAV over the last ten years, using selected historical data. The satellite top-of-atmosphere signals were initially converted to radiance, and then corrected for atmospheric effects. This treated signal was then used to classify Khanh Hoa coastal water substrates, and these classifications were evaluated using 101 in-situ measurements, collected in 2017 and 2018. The results showed that the three satellites could provide high accuracy, with Kappa coefficients above 0.84, with V1 achieving over 0.87. Our results showed that, from 2008 to 2018, SAV acreage in Khanh Hoa was reduced by 74.2%, while gains in new areas compensated for less than half of these losses. This is the first study to show the potential for using V1 and S2 data to assess the distribution status of SAV in Vietnam, and its outcomes will contribute to the conservation of SAV beds, and to the sustainable exploitation of aquatic resources in the Khanh Hoa coastal area.

TI  - Marking time on the way to democracy in Ukraine: A causal layered analysis
T2  - NEW PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - The establishment of a democratic political system has been declared as one of the main priorities of Ukraine since gaining independence in 1991. Yet, three decades on, Ukraine's democracy remains ineffective and superficial. It is thus productive-and apposite-to seek an alternative method for studying such a complicated and multidimensional problem. This article employs "causal layered analysis" (CLA), developed in Futures Studies to gain additional insight into the reasons for Ukraine's incomplete and halting democratization. CLA aims to get to the underlying causes of problems and involves analysis at four "layers": litany, system, worldview, and myth/metaphor. As we demonstrate here, this method can be fruitfully applied to better understand Ukraine's democratization-or, rather, its lack of it. At the layer of litany, the main facts and data concerning democracy in Ukraine are summarized. The second-systemic layer-is related to the study of democratic transition based on the approaches of various academic disciplines and theories. The research at the third layer is concerned with interpretation of the problem within the framework of five worldviews. At the deepest layer, we identify and characterize some of the myths underlying the aforementioned worldviews. Based on these analyses, key problems are identified and prospects for the future democratization of Ukraine are outlined.

TI  - Differential SAR Interferometry Using Sentinel-1 Imagery-Limitations in Monitoring Fast Moving Landslides: The Case Study of Cyprus
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyprus, being located on the Mediterranean fault zone, exhibits a unique geodynamic regime since its tectonic evolution is driven by the interaction of the Eurasian and African plate. Besides its seismological interest, many active landslides and slope instabilities in areas of steep topography occur in Cyprus, having substantial impact on the built environment, by posing an imminent threat for entire settlements and critical infrastructure. Moreover, extreme meteorological events occur rarely, like severe rainfall and thunderstorms, that combined with the geological properties in some areas and the seismically stressed ground, can lead to landslides, causing severe damages to critical infrastructure. In the present study, the DInSAR methodology is applied for the detection of two individual landslide events that were triggered by heavy rainfall in Limassol and Paphos Districts in February 2019. Six co-event interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) pairs were used to produce displacement maps in vertical and east-west directions to study the resulting slope deformations. The above are carried out using Sentinel-1 imagery that are freely provided under the Copernicus umbrella. The limitations that arise from the speed and complexity of the deformations under study and the adverse residing meteorological conditions that caused these phenomena are investigated, as found in literature. Indeed, the sparse vegetation at the slopes affected by the landslides, the residing meteorological conditions, the heavy rainfall that triggered the two landslides, and the temporal phase aliasing effect due to the speed of the ground deformation were found to be the main limitations for the application of DInSAR methodology, resulting in the underestimation of the ground deformation that occurred.

TI  - Advances in Smart Environment Monitoring Systems Using IoT and Sensors
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Air quality, water pollution, and radiation pollution are major factors that pose genuine challenges in the environment. Suitable monitoring is necessary so that the world can achieve sustainable growth, by maintaining a healthy society. In recent years, the environment monitoring has turned into a smart environment monitoring (SEM) system, with the advances in the internet of things (IoT) and the development of modern sensors. Under this scenario, the present manuscript aims to accomplish a critical review of noteworthy contributions and research studies on SEM, that involve monitoring of air quality, water quality, radiation pollution, and agriculture systems. The review is divided on the basis of the purposes where SEM methods are applied, and then each purpose is further analyzed in terms of the sensors used, machine learning techniques involved, and classification methods used. The detailed analysis follows the extensive review which has suggested major recommendations and impacts of SEM research on the basis of discussion results and research trends analyzed. The authors have critically studied how the advances in sensor technology, IoT and machine learning methods make environment monitoring a truly smart monitoring system. Finally, the framework of robust methods of machine learning; denoising methods and development of suitable standards for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), has been suggested.

TI  - Satellite Based Interpretation of Stability Parameters on Convective Systems over India and Srilanka
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - India is frequently exposed to convective systems (CS) during the hot period of pre-monsoon season. Huge thunderstorms are more often over India in the recent years. To analyze these systems, the stability parameters considered as good precursors for understanding the physics of the convective systems in prior to their occurrence. The present study is concerned about the analysis of stability parameters such as K Index (KI), Lifted Index (LI), Total Totals Index (TTI), Humidity Index (HI), Convective available potential energy (CAPE), Convective Inhibition (CIN), Lifting Condensation Level (LCL) and Level of free Convection (LFC) associated with severe convective systems over India and Srilanka during April, 2015. First, INSAT-3D satellite based brightness temperature (BT) product was used for analyzing the initial, mature and dissipation stages of the convective system at every 30 min interval. The data products from MODIS Terra satellite, MODIS Aqua satellite, Era-Interim ECMWF reanalysis satellite data and IASI satellite were used for understanding the thermodynamics related to the occurrence of these convective systems. The results of stability parameters that were derived from MODIS Terra and Aqua satellite's data products indicated the favorable threshold values for the occurrence of convective systems. Results from Era-Interim ECMWF reanalysis satellite data also helps us to understand the dynamics involved behind the convective system. The results from IASI satellite also helped us to understand the severity of convective systems during cloudy situations. The results of this study impulse the need of satellites for analyzing the convective systems prior to their occurrence.

TI  - The Inauthenticity Problem of Human Being in Russian Philosophy
T2  - TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study discusses the problem of inauthentic human being (existence) in modern world based on Russian religious philosophy works included in the curriculum. The study uses a comparative and analytical approach, on the basis of which the ideas of European philosophy are compared with the thoughts of Russian authors. This comparison helps to create a discussion field where the problem of human inauthenticity can be clarified and verified. According to Russian philosophers, there are certain provisions in Western philosophy, which state that the perception of a human as a separate kind of being among other beings leads to the loss of traits that are decisive in many aspects of the human existence. The study aims to justify these provisions.The study presents all stages of comparing Russian and Western philosophy's understanding of a human, which are related to the formation of a concept that underlies the anthropology of ideal-realism. This concept establishes in great detail that human can be considered only from the standpoint of an organic worldview and outside of an abstract approach that exaggerates one of the aspects of human being. The research results are novel and have a practical significance for a detailed analysis of human being and the inauthenticity problem. The study defines the problem, its semantic boundaries, and the set of concepts and categories, within which the problem is outlined. The study also determines that the problem can be solved at the level of statements and intuitions. The statement of the purpose is heuristic and may contain forecasts and perspective conclusions based on the analysis of human being, the relevance of which today is all too clear. The identification of the human being's essential features will help us understand why many concepts interpret the existence one-sidedly, abstractly, without considering other important aspects.

TI  - En los matorrales del ensueno, voy entonando khaswas": <i>the Domesticated Modernism of Gamaliel Churata</i>
T2  - MITOLOGIAS HOY-REVISTA DE PENSAMIENTO CRITICA Y ESTUDIOS LITERARIOS LATINOAMERICANOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The work follows the presence of the 19th century modernism in the work of Gamaliel Churata, from his avowedly modernist beginnings to his last poetic works, to verify that it does not diminish regularly after El pez de oro (1957): it disappears in Resurreccion de los muertos, but it returns in later works such as Khirkhilas de la sirena and other poetry books. However, these forms change their meaning as the author abandons the decadent worldview in favor of an Andean philosophy that denies death by opposing it to the germination of life. Modernist forms serve as a channel for some contents found in its code, but above all they become indigenous in order to create an unusual encounter and debate with Andean thought, and are part of the elaboration of the concept of khaswa, which refers to the new Andean writing.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN APPLIED LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th International Conference on Applied Linguistics Issues (ALI)
CL  - Saint Petersburg, RUSSIA
AB  - The article investigates the relationship between East and West, which is a part of an essential area in literary criticism - the study of national, cultural, political self-identification, and language of the person and people as a whole. In this work, the influence of Sufism on Orhan Pamuk's work, as well as its linguistic features, are investigated. The material is O. Pamuk's novel The New Life. The work of a modern writer is related to the genre of a family-household chronicle and a detective novel. The transformation of one of the prominent motifs of Sufism - the motive of search - into the detective motive in modern, postmodern literature is studied. The article reveals the complexity of the ideological and aesthetic worldview of the author, formed under the influence of East and West. Allusions and reminiscences associated with Western culture are revealed in the work of the Turkish writer. The authors analyse the central plot motifs, postmodern artistic techniques in the context of the whole artistic works of the writer.

TI  - Performance and Applicability of Water Column Correction Models in Optically Complex Coastal Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maps of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) are of primary importance for the sustainable management of coastal areas and serve as a basis for fundamental ecological studies. Various water column correction (WCC) models are successfully applied in clear Case-1 waters to compensate for the variable water depth effect. The performance of the WCC in less clear Case-2 waters is rarely assessed. In this study, the performance and applicability of model-based WCC algorithms in the complex Baltic Sea were analyzed. The bottom reflectance was retrieved from the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) water surface reflectance by applying the Maritorena and Lee WCC algorithms. The Maritorena model retrieved bottom spectra that showed large variations in reflectance magnitudes. The Lee model was more successful in retrieving reasonable spectral magnitudes, although only in a rather narrow wavelength region (550-600 nm). Shorter and longer spectral regions were significantly overcorrected, resulting in unrealistic spectral shapes. Sensitivity analysis indicated that slight under- or overestimation of water depth and water column constituents affect retrieval of correct bottom spectra in Case-2 waters. To assess the performance of WCC models in improving the SAV quantification, the surface reflectance, as well as the retrieved bottom reflectance, were correlated with the corresponding in situ estimated SAV percent cover (%SAV). Although the quality of the Lee WCC model was not considered high, the spectral region least affected by the input parameters variations (550-600 nm) can be used for the SAV quantification. Application of the Lee model provided better results in %SAV assessment than not performing the WCC correction.

TI  - The role of narratives in human-environmental relations: an essay on elaborating win-win solutions to climate change and sustainability
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of sustainability and devising win-win solutions to socio-environmental challenges, this paper discusses various aspects of the fundamental role narratives play in grounding our values and institutions, impacting on our decisions and actions, and slowing down or accelerating change. Narratives are created to integrate particular events or trends in the worldview of the societies experiencing them. They anchor a linear story or timeline to underlying multidimensional "Gestalts" that characterize the society involved. Depending on the particular context involved, narratives can therefore "fix" existing assumptions, attitudes, and opinions, or they can open the way for change. When different narratives are conflated, results may emerge that have not been expected-as in the case of different perspectives on the relationship between humans and their environment. Narratives and the values they represent are articulated in the networks that each individual or group is part of. As such, they are at the root of the "imagined futures" that, according to Beckert, drive our societies' economies. Changing narratives and thus changing imagined futures can transform ideas, attitudes, and institutions and are thus essential to effectuate societal change.

T2  - The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics changes over time. Knowledge of the susceptibility is important for antibiotic treatment guidelines in general practices.AIM: To determine the antibiotic-susceptibility of E. coli from uncomplicated UTI among women in general practices in the Netherlands and to compare the results with those collected in 2004 and 2009.METHOD: Urine samples were collected from women with symptoms of uncomplicated UTI, in 30 sentinel GP practices of the Nivel Primary Care database. Patient characteristics, E. coli susceptibility and ESBL prevalence were analysed.RESULTS: In total, 689 samples were collected. E. coli was the most isolated uropathogen (83%). Antibiotic susceptibility was stable over time except for ciprofloxacin (96%, 97% and 94% in 2004, 2009 and 2014, respectively; P<0.05). The susceptibility to co-amoxiclav was 88%, 87% and 92% in 2004, 2009 and 2014, respectively. The prevalence of ESBL producing E. coli increased from 0.1% in 2004, to 2.2% in 2014 (P<0.05). Susceptibility for co-trimoxazole was the highest in the West (88%) and the lowest in the North (72%, P = 0.021). Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was related to antibiotic use in the past 3 months (97% no use versus 90% use, P = 0.002) and those aged >70 years (P = 0.005). In 2014, prescription of fosfomycin increased compared to 2009 (14.3% versus 5.6%) at the expense of co-amoxiclav, co-trimoxazole and ciprofloxacin (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: The antibiotic susceptibility percentages to the agents tested were stable over the 10-year period, except for ciprofloxacin as was the prevalence of ESBL producing E. coli. Surveillance with regular intervals is warranted.

TI  - Ductal Carcinoma in situ after Core Needle Biopsy: In Which Cases Is a Sentinel Node Biopsy Necessary?
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction:In some hospitals it is still common practice to carry out a sentinel node biopsy (SNB) if ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is determined in preoperative staging, although this is against international guidelines. The reason for this is because an infiltrative component can be demonstrated frequently in the final pathohistological examination. In this study, we wanted to investigate possible predictors for infiltrative growth, to select patients to do an SNB or to omit it.Material and Methods:All patients with DCIS in the core needle biopsy (CNB), who were treated with surgery including an SNB, were included in a prospective data registry. Patient characteristics were collected through physical examination, mammography and ultrasonography. All characteristics of the DCIS were noted. After surgery, the pathological results were collected.Results:From the 287 patients, 39 (13.6%) had an infiltrative component in the definitive pathological examination despite only DCIS in preoperative CNB. In total, there were only 14 (4.9%) positive SNBs, of which 11 patients had infiltrative growth in the breast tumor and 3 (1.2% of patients with DCIS alone in the final pathology) did not. In addition, characteristics of the CNB, including microcalcifications and comedonecrosis, did not show a statistically significant higher risk for infiltration.Discussion:Considering the low rates of positive SNBs in our population, we think that an SNB should not be performed in advance when DCIS is diagnosed, because if infiltrative growth is found in the final biopsy, an SNB could always be performed afterwards. Only if an SNB cannot be performed afterwards is an SNB indicated.

T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - People can polarize into various ideologies, including tendencies towards political left- and right-wing extremism, and religious fundamentalism. Here we compare polarization in these different ideologies in a US online sample (N = 424). Building on significance quest theory, we specifically investigate how individual tendencies towards political extremism and religious fundamentalism are associated with grievance and worldview variables within the same study. As grievance variables we measured personal and fraternal deprivation, and socio-economic fear. As worldview variables we measured belief significance, dogmatic intolerance, and parochial altruism. Results revealed that political extremism and religious fundamentalism were similarly associated with the worldview variables but not with the grievance variables. We conclude that independent of content, ideological polarization is associated with a common worldview characterized by the feeling that one supports a meaningful cause, intolerance of alternative ideologies, and a willingness to make personal sacrifices for ones ideals.

TI  - Importance of Detailed Soil Information for Hydrological Modelling in an Urbanized Environment
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil information is critical in watershed-scale hydrological modelling; however, it is still debated which level of complexity the soil data should contain. In the present study, we have compared the effect of two levels of soil data on the hydrologic simulation of a mesoscale, urbanised watershed (630 km(2)) in central South Africa. The first level of soil data, land type (LT) data, is currently the best, readily available soil information that covers the whole of South Africa. In the LT database, the entire study area is covered by only two soil types. The second level of soil data (DSM) was created by means of digital soil mapping based on hydropedological principles. It resulted in six different soil types with different hydrological behaviour (e.g., interflow, recharge, responsive). The two levels of soil data were each included in the revised version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT+). To compare the effects of different complexity of soil information on the simulated water balance, the outputs of the uncalibrated models were compared to the three nested gauging stations of the watershed. For the LT scenario, the simulation efficiencies calculated with the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) for the three nested gauging stations (640 km(2), 550 km(2), 54 km(2)) of 0, 0.33 and -0.23 were achieved, respectively. Under the DSM scenario, KGE increased to 0.28, 0.44 and 0.43 indicating an immediate improvement of the simulation by integrating soil data with detailed information on hydrological behaviour. In the LT scenario, actual evapotranspiration (aET) was clearly underestimated compared to MODIS-derived aET, while surface runoff was overestimated. The DSM scenario resulted in higher simulated aET compared to LT and lower surface runoff. The higher simulation efficiency of DSM in the smaller headwater catchments can be attributed to the inclusion of the interflow soil type, which covers the governing runoff generation process better than the LT scenario. Our results indicate that simulations benefit from more detailed soil information, especially in smaller areas where fewer runoff generation processes dominate.

TI  - Suitability of the MODIS-NDVI Time-Series for a Posteriori Evaluation of the<i>Citrus Tristeza Virus</i>Epidemic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The technological advances of remote sensing (RS) have allowed its use in a number of fields of application including plant disease depiction. In this study, an RS approach based on an 18-year (i.e., 2001-2018) time-series analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and processed with TIMESAT free software, was applied in Sicily (insular Italy). The RS approach was carried out in four orchards infected byCitrus tristeza virus(CTV) at different temporal stages and characterized by heterogeneous conditions (e.g., elevation, location, plant age). The temporal analysis allowed the identification of specific metrics of the NDVI time-series at the selected sites during the study period. The most reliable parameter which was able to identify the temporal evolution of CTV syndrome and the impact of operational management practices was the "Base value" (i.e., average NDVI during the growing seasons, which reached R(2)values up to 0.88), showing good relationships with "Peak value", "Small integrated value" and "Amplitude", with R(2)values of 0.63, 0.70 and 0.75, respectively. The approach herein developed is valid to be transferred to regional agencies involved in and/or in charge of the management of plant diseases, especially if it is integrated with ground-based early detection methods or high-resolution RS approaches, in the case of quarantine plant pathogens requiring control measures at large-scale level.

TI  - Making surgery safer by centralization of care: impact of case load in penile cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Penile cancer is a rare but aggressive disease, often requiring a rapid and extensive surgical treatment of the primary tumor and staging or treatment of the inguinal lymph node basins. Current management and guidelines of the disease are mainly based on retrospective data, as there is a lack of controlled trials or large series. The purpose of this work is to review contemporary data on the impact of centralization and formation of rare disease networks on penile cancer care and outcomes. Methods This narrative, non-systematic review is based on publications retrieved by a PubMed and EMBASE search and on the current guidelines of the European Association of Urology, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and the National Comprehensive Cancer network. Results The low case load, particularly in non-specialized centres, combined with limited evidence regularly results in a disparity between the treatment strategy and the guidelines. The suboptimal guideline adherence is specifically the case for organ-sparing surgery and surgical staging of the groin areas in selected cases. Treatment of the disease in high-volume referral centres has been shown to improve the use of organ-sparing surgery, the utilization of invasive lymph node staging in high-risk patients, and finally has resulted in increased survival rates. Conclusions The management of penile cancer in disease networks and in countries where centralized healthcare is offered positively influences functional and oncological outcomes. We propose that governments and health care providers should be encouraged to centralize healthcare for rare tumors such as penile cancer.

Applications such as environmental monitoring, natural resource management, and change detection require more accurate, detailed, and constantly updated land-cover type mapping. These needs are fulfilled by newer sensors with high spatial and spectral resolution along with modern data processing algorithms. Sentinel-2 sensor provides data with high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution for the in classification of highly fragmented landscape. This study applies six traditional data classifiers and nine ensemble methods on multitemporal Sentinel-2 image datasets for identifying land cover types in the heterogeneous Mediterranean landscape of Lesvos Island, Greece. Support vector machine, random forest, artificial neural network, decision tree, linear discriminant analysis, and k-nearest neighbor classifiers are applied and compared with nine ensemble classifiers on the basis of different voting methods. kappa statistic, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient metrics were used in the assembly of the voting methods. Support vector machine outperformed the base classifiers with kappa of 0.91. Support vector machine also outperformed the ensemble classifiers in an unseen dataset. Five voting methods performed better than the rest of the classifiers. A diversity study based on four different metrics revealed that an ensemble can be avoided if a base classifier shows an identifiable superiority. Therefore, ensemble approaches should include a careful selection of base-classifiers based on a diversity analysis.

TI  - The 29 March 2017 Yuzhno-Ozernovskoe Kamchatka Earthquake: Fault Activity in An Extension of the East Kamchatka Fault Zone as Constrained by InSAR Observations
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent earthquakes off the northeastern Kamchatka coast reveal that this region is seismically active, although details of the locations and complexity of the fault system are lacking. The northern part of Kamchatka has poor coverage by permanent seismic stations and ground geodetic instruments. Here, we exploit the Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique to characterize the fault geometry and kinematics associated with the 29 March 2017 M-w 6.6 Yuzhno-Ozernovskoe earthquake. The aim is to contribute to identifying the active fault branches and to better understanding the complex tectonic regime in this region using the DInSAR technique, which has never before been applied to the analysis of coseismic offsets in Kamchatka. We produced coseismic deformation maps using Advanced Land Observation Satellite-2 ascending and descending and Sentinel-1A descending Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) scenes and detected a predominant uplift up to 20 cm and a westward motion of approximately 7 cm near the shoreline. We jointly inverted the three geodetic datasets using elastic half-space fault modeling to retrieve source geometry and fault kinematics. The best-fit solution for the nonlinear inversion suggests a north-west-dipping oblique reverse fault with right-lateral rupture. The model fault geometry is not only generally consistent with the seismic data but also reveals that a hitherto unknown fault was ruptured. The identified fault structure is interpreted as the northern extension of the east Kamchatka fault zone, implying that the region is more complex than previously thought. Important implications arise for the presence of unknown faults at the edges of subduction zones that can generate earthquakes with magnitudes greater than M-w 6.

TI  - RiceSAP: An Efficient Satellite-Based AquaCrop Platform for Rice Crop Monitoring and Yield Prediction on a Farm- to Regional-Scale
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced technologies in the agricultural sector have been adopted as global trends in response to the impact of climate change on food sustainability. An ability to monitor and predict crop yields is imperative for effective agronomic decision making and better crop management. This work proposes RiceSAP, a satellite-based AquaCrop processing system for rice whose climatic input is derived from TERRA/MODIS-LST and FY-2/IR-rainfall products to provide crop monitoring and yield prediction services at regional-scale with no need for weather station. The yield prediction accuracy is significantly improved by our proposed recalibration algorithm on the simulated canopy cover (CC) using Sentinel-2 NDVI product. A developed mobile app provides an intuitive interface for collecting farm-scale inputs and providing timely feedbacks to farmers to make informed decisions. We show that RiceSAP could predict yields 2 months before harvest with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 14.8%, in the experimental field. Further experiments on randomly selected 20 plots with various soil series showed comparable results with an average MAPE of 16.7%. Thus, this work is potentially applicable countrywide; and can be beneficial to all stakeholders in the entire rice supply chain for effective adaptation to climate change.

TI  - Application of Landsat-derived vegetation trends over South Africa: Potential for monitoring land degradation and restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring vegetation change is important because the nature, extent and rate of change in key measures, such as plant biomass, cover and species composition, provides critical insight into broader environmental and land use drivers and leads to the development of appropriate policy. We used Landsat data between 1984 and 2018 to produce a map of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) change over South Africa at 30 m resolution and an interactive web application to make the analysis both globally applicable and locally meaningful. We found an increase in EVI of 0.37 +/- 0.59% yr(-1) (mean +/- standard deviation), confirming global vegetation greening trends observed with lower-resolution satellites. Mesic, productive biomes including the Albany Thicket and Savanna, exhibited the largest greening trends while browning trends were dominant in more arid biomes, such as the Succulent Karoo and Desert. Although overall EVI trends correspond to vegetation index trends derived from the Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (8 km resolution), the relative scarcity of Landsat data availability during the 1980 s is a potential source of error. Using repeat very-high-resolution satellite (ca. 3 m resolution) imagery and ground-based photography as reference, we found good correspondence with EVI trends, revealing patterns of degradation (e.g. woody plant encroachment, desertification), and restoration (e.g. increased rangeland productivity, alien clearing) over selected landscapes. The utility of the EVI trend layer to government and industry for monitoring ecosystem changes will be enhanced by the ability to distinguish climatic from anthropogenic drivers of change. This may be partially achieved though interactive exploration of the EVI trends using the application found here: http://evitrend.zsv.co.za

TI  - Hyperlocal mapping of urban air temperature using remote sensing and crowdsourced weather data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of climate change such as extreme heat waves are exacerbated in cities where most of the world's population live. Quantifying urbanization impacts on ambient air temperatures (Tair) has relevance for human health risk, building energy use efficiency, vector-borne disease control and urban biodiversity. Remote sensing of urban climate has been focused on land surface temperature (LST) due to a scarcity of data on Tair which is usually interpolated at 1 km resolution. We assessed the efficacy of mapping hyperlocal Tair (spatial resolutions of 10-30 m) over Oslo, Norway, by integrating Sentinel, Landsat and LiDAR data with crowd-sourced Tair measurements from 1310 private weather stations during 2018. Using Random Forest regression modelling, we found that annual mean, daily maximum and minimum Tair can be mapped with an average RMSE of 0.52 degrees C (R-2 = 0.5), 1.85 degrees C (R-2 = 0.05) and 1.46 degrees C (R-2 = 0.33), respectively. Mapping accuracy decreased sharply with < 250 weather stations (approx. 1 station km(-2)) and remote sensing data averaged within a 100-500 m buffer zone around each station maximized accuracy. Further, models performed best outside of summer months when the spatial variation in temperatures were low and wind velocities were high. Finally, accuracies were not evenly distributed over space and we found the lowest mapping errors in the local climate zone characterized by compact lowrise buildings which are most relevant to city residents. We conclude that this method is transferable to other cities given there was little difference (0.02 degrees C RMSE) between models trained on open- (satellite and terrain) vs closed-source (LiDAR) remote sensing data. These maps can provide a complement to and validation of traditional urban canopy models and may assist in identifying hyperlocal hotspots and coldspots of relevance to urban planners.

TI  - Monitoring and Assessment of Water Level Fluctuations of the Lake Urmia and Its Environmental Consequences Using Multitemporal Landsat 7 ETM<SUP>+</SUP>Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The declining water level in Lake Urmia has become a significant issue for Iranian policy and decision makers. This lake has been experiencing an abrupt decrease in water level and is at real risk of becoming a complete saline land. Because of its position, assessment of changes in the Lake Urmia is essential. This study aims to evaluate changes in the water level of Lake Urmia using the space-borne remote sensing and GIS techniques. Therefore, multispectral Landsat 7 ETM(+)images for the years 2000, 2010, and 2017 were acquired. In addition, precipitation and temperature data for 31 years between 1986 and 2017 were collected for further analysis. Results indicate that the increased temperature (by 19%), decreased rainfall of about 62%, and excessive damming in the Urmia Basin along with mismanagement of water resources are the key factors in the declining water level of Lake Urmia. Furthermore, the current research predicts the potential environmental crisis as the result of the lake shrinking and suggests a few possible alternatives. The insights provided by this study can be beneficial for environmentalists and related organizations working on this and similar topics.

TI  - An object-based image analysis approach to assess irrigation-water consumption from MODIS products in Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient water-resource management is essential with regard to food security, growing populations and climate change. This is especially important for low- and middle-income (LMC) countries where food is often locally produced by traditional smallholder farming. Detailed knowledge of the spatio-temporal distribution of irrigation-water consumption provides valuable information to anticipate local food shortages and water scarcity as a result of climate variability. Yet, adequate techniques to quantify irrigation-water consumption at field level over large areas are lacking. Irrigation estimates generally have a coarse resolution making them inadequate for field-level assessments.This study developed a remote-sensing-based approach to quantify spatio-temporal patterns of irrigation-water consumption at field level using the MODIS evapotranspiration product (MOD16A2) and existing land-use maps on the spatio-temporal distribution of irrigated agriculture. Object-based image analysis was used to establish local evapotranspiration differences between irrigated and rainfed fields on a monthly basis, which are the irrigation-water consumption rates of the irrigated fields. This novel method was applied to a study area in the Central Rift Valley in Ethiopia where smallholder farming is dominant and only a few large-scale farms are present. Comparison with irrigation-water-consumption values of a local irrigation scheme showed that the monthly temporal dynamics were captured quite well, but lower values were calculated compared to the scheme's field data. Comparison with two validated remote-sensing based studies in Africa showed good agreement as irrigation-water-consumption estimates were in the same order of magnitude. Irrigation-water consumption follows the temporal rainfall pattern, i.e. irrigation practices intensify with increased water availability. Surface water is commonly used for irrigation in the study area.Our study shows that smallholder practices have a lower irrigation-water consumption compared to modern large-scale farms by approximately a factor 3. Irrigation-water consumption in the area is considerable, especially during the dry season. On average 32 % of excess water (precipitation - evapotranspiration) is consumed for irrigation. For smallholder irrigation and large-scale irrigation specifically this is 28 % and 63 % respectively.The object-based approach presented here is an operational mapping method for field-level irrigation-water consumption over large areas. MOD16A2 is a global open-source readily-available evapotranspiration product used here although an evapotranspiration product with a higher spatial resolution might be preferred. Our approach can provide irrigation-water-consumption estimates over large areas in data-poor regions, which will increase the understanding of spatio-temporal patterns of smallholder irrigation and provide information to optimize water use.

TI  - Angular-Based Radiometric Slope Correction for Sentinel-1 on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article provides an angular-based radiometric slope correction routine for Sentinel-1 SAR imagery on the Google Earth Engine platform. Two established physical reference models are implemented. The first model is optimised for vegetation applications by assuming volume scattering on the ground. The second model is optimised for surface scattering, and therefore targeted at urban environments or analysis of soil characteristics. The framework of both models is extended to simultaneously generate masks of invalid data in active layover and shadow affected areas. A case study, using openly available and reproducible code, exemplarily demonstrates the improvement of the backscatter signal in a mountainous area of the Austrian Alps. Furthermore, suggestions for specific use cases are discussed and drawbacks of the method with respect to pixel-area based methods are highlighted. The radiometrically corrected radar backscatter products are overcoming current limitations and are compliant with recent CEOS specifications for SAR backscatter over land. This improves a wide range of potential usage scenarios of the Google Earth Engine platform in mapping various land surface parameters with Sentinel-1 on a large scale and in a rapid manner. The provision of an openly accessible Earth Engine module allows users a smooth integration of the routine into their own workflows.

TI  - Temperature and ice regimes of waterbodies under the impacts of global warming and a hydropower plant
T2  - METEOROLOGY HYDROLOGY AND WATER MANAGEMENT-RESEARCH AND OPERATIONAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Based on the results of regular monitoring and remote sensing data the patterns of water temperature and ice regime of the Dnipro River within Kyiv, as affected by global warming and a hydropower plant, were identified. The characteristic features of this stretch of the river are increasing water temperature, and the decreasing thickness and duration of ice cover. The largest water temperature increase is in summer, with a somewhat smaller increase in autumn. The increase of water temperature in spring is much less than the increase in air temperature. In summer, the gradient of water temperature increase is a little bit less than that of air temperature. In autumn, the gradient of water temperature increase is larger than the gradient of air temperature increase. From April to August the lowest water temperature is usually observed near the Kyivska hydropower plant (HPP), which is located upstream. During this period the water temperature downstream from HPP increases. The uneven daily operation of HPP causes the alternation of areas with different temperature along the Dnipro River. In the cold season the water temperature in the Dnipro River is usually higher than in other nearby urban water bodies. Freezing of the water area usually starts from the small and shallow lakes and ponds. The main branch of the Dnipro River freezes last. On the whole, the sequence of ice melting on the waterbodies is the reverse of the freezing process. The longest ice cover duration in spring is observed in the bays with small water exchange, mainly located at a large distance from Kyivska HPP.

TI  - Past and Present Practices of Topographic Base Map Database Update in Nepal
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic Base Maps (TBMs) are those maps that portray ground relief as the form of contour lines and show planimetric details. Various other maps like geomorphological maps, contour maps, and land use planning maps are derived from topographical maps. In this constantly changing world, the update of TBMs is indispensable. In Nepal, their update and maintenance are done by the Survey Department (SD) as a national mapping agency. This paper presents the history of topographical mapping and the reasons for the lack of updates. Currently, the SD is updating the TBM database using panchromatic and multispectral images from the Zi Yuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite with a resolution of 2.1 and 5.8 m, respectively. The updated methodology includes the orthorectification of images, the pansharpening of images, field data collection, digitization, change detection, and updating, the overlay of vector data and field verification, data quality control, and printing map production. A TBM in the Dang district of Nepal is presented as casework to show the changes in the area and issues faced during the update. Though the present digitizing procedure is time-consuming and labor-intensive, the use of high-resolution imagery has made mapping accurate and has produced high-quality maps. However, audit and automation can be introduced from the experiences of other countries for accurate and frequent updates of the TBM database in Nepal.

TI  - Night-sky imaging as a potential tool for characterization of total lumen output from small and medium-sized cities
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, the asymptotic formula developed in past work and applied to predict skyglow due to distant sourceswas evolved, with the objective of characterizing small and medium-sized cities in the observer's surroundings. To enable this, a combination of theoretical computations and in situ measurements is needed, aiming to distinguish between dominant and smaller light-emitting sources, with the latter usually being camouflaged when measuring the night sky. Furthermore, for numerical modelling of skyglow, few of the most important parameters, specifically the amount of total lumens installed and radiated to the upward hemisphere, can be derived. Astronomical observatories, in particular, can profit from this concept, since they are usually situated far away from large cities but can still be surrounded by smaller villages and towns. We present a detailed description of how theoretical computations are combined with all-sky photometry in order to obtain the properties mentioned. Results are compared with satellite data, showing that, regarding approximations undertaken for processing, they are comparable, underlining the functionality of our approach. The idea of including in situ observations enables us to quantify the impact of small and medium-sized cities globally and independent of location, as long as measurements were conducted outside light domes. In addition, the presented work may be of major interest to the light-pollution community if conducting long-term observations of cities, since the quality of commonly used satellite data is going to decrease in the future, due to blindness in short wavelengths and upcoming conversions of public lighting systems to blue-enlightened LEDs.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) has been developed for more than 20 years for historical surface deformation reconstruction. In particular, the onboard Sentinel-1/A/B satellite, newly planned NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR), and Germany Tandem-L will continue to provide unprecedented SAR data with an increased number of acquisitions. However, processing of real-time SAR data has been experiencing challenges regarding the InSAR deformation parameter estimation over a long time with the small baseline subsets (SBAS) InSAR technology. We use sequential adjustment for the estimation of the deformation parameters, which uses Bayesian estimation theory under the least square criteria to inverse long time-series deformation dynamically. Finally, both simulated and real Sentinel-1A SAR data verify the performance of the sequential estimation. It can be regarded as an effective data processing tool in the coming era of SAR big data.

T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake evaporation can influence basin-wide hydrological cycles and is an important factor in loss of water resources in endorheic lakes of the Tibetan Plateau. Because of the scarcity of data, published lake evaporation values are inconsistent, and their spatial distribution has never been reported. Presenting a plausible hypothesis of energy balance during the ice-free seasons, we explored the multiyear (2003-2016) average ice phenology and evaporation amounts of 75 large dimictic lakes by using a combination of meteorological and satellite data. Evaporation amounts show large variability in spatial distribution, with a pattern of higher values in the south. Lakes with higher elevation, smaller area, and higher latitude are generally associated with a shorter ice-free season and lower evaporation. The total evaporated water amounts have values of approximately 29.4 +/- 1.2 km(3) year(-1) for the 75 studied lakes and 51.7 +/- 2.1 km(3) year(-1) for all plateau lakes included.

TI  - Comparison and Validation of TROPOMI and OMI NO<sub>2</sub>Observations over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The new-generation sensor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel 5 precursor (S5P) satellite is promising for monitoring air pollutants with greater spatial resolution, especially for China, which suffers from severe pollution. As tropospheric NO(2)vertical column densities (VCDs) from TROPOMI have become available since February 2018, this study presents the comparisons of NO(2)data measured by TROPOMI and its predecessor Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) over China, together with validation against ground Multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements. At the nationwide scale, we used two different filters performed for the TROPOMI data (named TROPOMI50 and TROPOMI75), and the TROPOMI50 yielded larger values than TROPOMI75. The TROPOMI NO(2)datasets from different filters show consistent spatial patterns with OMI, and the correlation coefficient values were both above 0.93. However, linear regression indicates that NO(2)loadings in TROPOMI is about 2/3 to 4/5 of those in OMI, which is presumably due to a different cloud mask and uncertainties of air mass factors. The absolute difference is prominent over the high pollution areas such as Jing-Jin-Ji region and during winter and autumn, exceeding 0.6 x 10(16)molecules cm(-2)(molec cm(-2)). However, the NO(2)concentrations retrieved from TROPOMI50 in the southern China may be somewhat higher than OMI. When it comes to the local-scale Jing-Jin-Ji hotspot, the analysis focuses on a comparison to TROPOMI75. TROPOMI manifests high quality and exhibits a significantly better performance of representing spatial variability. In contrast, OMI shows fewer effective pixels and does a poor job of capturing local details due to its row anomaly and low resolution. The absolute difference between two datasets shows the same seasonal behavior with NO(2)variation, which is most striking in the winter (0.31 x 10(16)molec cm(-2)) and is lowest in the summer (0.05 x 10(16)molec cm(-2)). Furthermore, the ground MAX-DOAS instrument in Xianghe station, the representative site in Jing-Jin-Ji, is used to assess the skill of satellite retrievals. It turns out that both OMI and TROPOMI underestimate the observations, ranging from 30% to 50%, with OMI being less biased. In spite of the negative drift, the temporal structures of changes derived from OMI and TROPOMI closely match the ground-based records, since the correlation coefficients are above 0.8 and 0.95 for daily and monthly scales, respectively. Overall, TROPOMI NO(2)retrievals are better suited for applications in China as well as the Jing-Jin-Ji hotspot due to its higher spatial resolution, although some improvements are also needed in the near future.

TI  - Estimating snow depth by combining satellite data and ground-based observations over Alaska: A deep learning approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover plays a vital role in the climate system because it is related to climate, hydrological cycle, and ecosystem. On this basis, deriving a long-term and large-scale snow depth (SD) time series and monitoring its temporal and spatial variations are crucial. Passive microwave remote sensing data in combination with in-situ SD data have long been used to retrieve SD. However, the retrieval accuracy is limited in case of sparse meteorological stations, and the high-quality applications of retrieval results are hindered in specific areas. The ground-based global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) method is currently a potential way to monitor SD variations with a high degree of accuracy but has a limited spatial coverage. In this study, a deep learning-based approach, which displays a stronger nonlinear expressiveness capability than conventional neural networks, was applied to estimate SD by combining satellite observations, in-situ data, and GNSS-R estimates. The model was trained and tested with data obtained in Alaska between 2008 and 2017. Results show that the proposed deep belief network model performs better than linear methods and conventional neural network models and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining GNSS-R estimation with increased cross-validation R of 0.85 and decreased RMSE of 15.40 cm. The predicted SD distribution indicates that the variations in mean SD in Alaska for March and April between 2008 and 2017 were associated with the climate anomalies and air temperature. Overall, the proposed deep learning-based method is a promising approach in the satellite-retrieved SD field.

TI  - Using 250-m MODIS Data for Enhancing Spatiotemporal Fusion by Sparse Representation
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion is an important technique to solve the problem of incompatibility between the temporal and spatial resolution of remote sensing data. In this article, we studied the fusion of Landsat data with fine spatial resolution but coarse temporal resolution and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with coarse spatial resolution but fine temporal resolution. The goal of fusion is to produce time-series data with the fine spatial resolution of Landsat and the fine temporal resolution of MODIS. In recent years, learning-based spatiotemporal fusion methods, in particular the sparse representation-based spatiotemporal reflectance fusion model (SPSTFM), have gained increasing attention because of their great restoration ability for heterogeneous landscapes. However, remote sensing data from different sensors differ greatly on spatial resolution, which limits the performance of the spatiotemporal fusion methods (including SPSTFM) to some extent. In order to increase the accuracy of spatiotemporal fusion, in this article we used existing 250-m MODIS bands (i.e., red and near-infrared bands) to downscale the observed 500-m MODIS bands to 250 m before SPTSFM-based fusion of MODIS and Landsat data. The experimental results show that the fusion accuracy of SPTSFM is increased when using 250-m MODIS data, and the accuracy of SPSTFM coupled with 250-m MODIS data is greater than the compared benchmark methods.

TI  - A Coarse-to-Fine Deep Learning Based Land Use Change Detection Method for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, high-resolution (HR) remote sensing images have shown considerable potential for providing detailed information for change detection. The traditional change detection methods based on HR remote sensing images mostly only detect a single land type or only the change range, and cannot simultaneously detect the change of all object types and pixel-level range changes in the area. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a new coarse-to-fine deep learning-based land-use change detection method. We independently created a new scene classification dataset called NS-55, and innovatively considered the adaptation relationship between the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the scene complexity by selecting the CNN that best fit the scene complexity. The CNN trained by NS-55 was used to detect the category of the scene, define the final category of the scene according to the majority voting method, and obtain the changed scene by comparison to obtain the so-called coarse change result. Then, we created a multi-scale threshold (MST) method, which is a new method for obtaining high-quality training samples. We used the high-quality samples selected by MST to train the deep belief network to obtain the pixel-level range change detection results. By mapping coarse scene changes to range changes, we could obtain fine multi-type land-use change detection results. Experiments were conducted on the Multi-temporal Scene Wuhan dataset and aerial images of a particular area of Dapeng New District, Shenzhen, where promising results were achieved by the proposed method. This demonstrates that the proposed method is practical, easy-to-implement, and the NS-55 dataset is physically justified. The proposed method has the potential to be applied in the large scale land use fine change detection problem and qualitative and quantitative research on land use/cover change based on HR remote sensing data.

TI  - Vegetation cover changes and sand -fixing service responses in the sandstorm source control area
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation cover and related ecosystem services are key indicators for ecological restoration efforts. We simulated the dynamic changes of vegetation coverage and sand-fixing service in the Beijing-Tianjin sandstorm source control project area (BTSSCPA) in the period of 2000-2015 on the basis of long-term satellite data and the revised wind erosion equation. The response levels of sand-fixing service to vegetation coverage change were also analyzed. Results showed that the vegetation coverage in the BTSSCPA increased with fluctuation at an average rate of 0.34%/year, and the sand-fixing service was correspondingly enhanced with the average annual rate of 0.71%. Furthermore, the responsive levels of sand-fixing service to vegetation coverage change increased from 70% to 91%. We conclude that the vegetation restoration measures on sand-fixing gradually prevail and progress in the BTSSCPA. However, approximately 13% of the BTSSCPA still has poor responsivity and needs additional restoration measures for implementation. This research will contribute to quantify the effectiveness of vegetation restoration on ecosystem service enhancement, and identify the key implementation areas for further ecological restoration measures.

TI  - Winter Wheat Yield Prediction at County Level and Uncertainty Analysis in Main Wheat-Producing Regions of China with Deep Learning Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate forecasting of crop yields is crucial to food security and sustainable development in the agricultural sector. However, winter wheat yield estimation and forecasting on a regional scale still remains challenging. In this study, we established a two-branch deep learning model to predict winter wheat yield in the main producing regions of China at the county level. The first branch of the model was constructed based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with inputs from meteorological and remote sensing data. Another branch was constructed using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) to model static soil features. The model was then trained using the detrended statistical yield data during 1982 to 2015 and evaluated by leave-one-year-out-validation. The evaluation results showed a promising performance of the model with the overall R-2 and RMSE of 0.77 and 721 kg/ha, respectively. We further conducted yield prediction and uncertainty analysis based on the two-branch model and obtained the forecast accuracy in one month prior to harvest of 0.75 and 732 kg/ha. Results also showed that while yield detrending could potentially introduce higher uncertainty, it had the advantage of improving the model performance in yield prediction.

TI  - Investigating multiple aerosol optical depth products from MODIS and VIIRS over Asia: Evaluation, comparison, and merging
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The first purpose of this paper is to evaluate and compare four aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) during 2013-2018 in Asia. In our study, a total of 81 AERONET sites are considered and land cover maps are utilized as well. The results show that the AOD product of deep blue from VIIRS (DB_V) achieves the best performance in the study areas, with the R of 0.91 and the RMSE of 0.14. Meanwhile, the deviations for the AOD products of deep blue from MODIS (DB_M), dark target (DT), DB_V, and environmental data record (EDR) periodically fluctuate with different levels as time moves forward. In general, DB_V overcomes others with the smallest overall deviation, while the largest positive and negative deviations are observed in DT and EDR, respectively. The performance of each AOD product is different in the regions with diverse land cover types. Especially, all AOD products will generally underestimate the AOD values in forest, DB_V performs better than DB_M in croplands and urban, while the overestimation of DB_V is larger than that of DB_M in arid lands. The distribution of high AOD values for DT and EDR shows difference in four seasons, which is dominated by multiple factors. With regard to DB_M and DB_V, apart from the seasonal variations, the high AOD values also distribute in arid lands from March to August. For the coverage of valid AOD values, the annual AOD completeness of DB_M and DB_V tends to be large in the Southwest (arid lands). As for DT and EDR, the large annual AOD completeness principally distributes in India, where the primary land cover type is croplands. Next, a novel grid-based merging framework (SL-SGW) is proposed to acquire the AOD product with the best performance and the largest AOD completeness of DB_M, DT, DB_V, and EDR as much as possible. The experiment results (2017-2018) show that the R and the RMSE for the merged AOD product are 0.904 and 0.13, respectively. It's believed that the merging framework could effectively absorb the strengths of DB_M, DT, DB_V, and EDR. In the meantime, the underestimations of the AOD values for all AOD products in forest and the overestimations for DB_M and DB_V in arid lands are both mitigated after merging. The AOD completeness of the merged exceeds those of other AOD products for all land cover types, particularly in croplands and urban.

TI  - Spatio-temporal evolution of surface urban heat islands in the Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban agglomeration has become increasingly important over recent decades; however, little is known about the spatiotemporal patterns and evolution of the surface urban heat islands (SUHI) that have arisen in urban areas. The objective of this study was to monitor the spatiotemporal patterns of such SUHI in the urban agglomeration using dense Landsat time series. Landsat images were collected in the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan (CZT) region from 2000 to 2017. The land surface temperatures were calculated using the Google Earth Engine and investigation of SUHI phenomenon. The Mann Kendall test (M-K), Theil Sen Median trend analysis (Sen), Standard Deviational Ellipse, and mean center analysis were applied to analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of SUHI. Results indicated that: 1) SUHI was always more obvious in summer than in the three other seasons. Additionally, the SUHI was always higher in Zhuzhou than in Changsha or Xiangtan. 2) The mean center of the SUHI in the three cities has begun to converge, together with the connectivity of SUHI in the CZT urban agglomeration, which is also gradually increasing. 3) There are spatial disparities in the changes to SUHI. The SUHI in the areas surrounding urbanization and the urban core is increasing and decreasing, respectively. The change in the direction of the increase in the SUHI of the three cities shows movement towards the core of the neighboring city. 4) The main reason for causing this variation is the change of landcover type. 77.103% of all the pixels with an obvious growing SUHI trend has changed to impervious areas. The active factory may influence the changed pattern of SUHI. This study suggests that the SUHI in the urban agglomeration is undergoing aggregation, together with the increasing variation in the urban agglomeration.

TI  - Tropical Peatland Forest Biomass Estimation Using Polarimetric Parameters Extracted from RadarSAT-2 Images
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper was aimed at estimating the forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in the Central Kalimantan tropical peatland forest, Indonesia, using polarimetric parameters extracted from RadarSAT-2 images. Six consecutive acquisitions of RadarSAT-2 full polarimetric data were acquired and polarimetric parameters were extracted. The backscattering coefficient (sigma(o)) for HH, HV, VH, and VV channels was computed respectively. Entropy (H) and alpha (alpha) were computed using eign decomposition. In order to understand the scattering behavior, Yamaguchi decomposition was performed to estimate surface scattering (gamma(surf)) and volume scattering (gamma(vol)) components. Similarly following polarimetric indices were computed; Biomass Index (BMI), Canopy Structure Index (CSI), Volume Scattering Index (VSI), Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and Pedestal Height (ph). The PolSAR parameters were evaluated in terms of their temporal consistency, inter-dependence, and suitability for forest aboveground biomass estimation across rainy and dry conditions. Regression analysis was performed between referenced biomass measurements and polarimetric parameters; VSI, H, RVI, p(h), and gamma(vol) were found significantly correlated with AGB. Biomass estimation was carried out using significant models. Resultant models were validated using field-based AGB measurements. Validation results show a significant correlation between measured and referenced biomass measurements with temporal consistency over the acquisition time period.

TI  - Prediction of Socio-Economic Indicators for Urban Planning Using VHR Satellite Imagery and Spatial Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ongoing urbanization leads to steady growth of urban areas. In the case of highly dynamic change of municipalities, due to the rates of change, responsible administrations often are challenged or struggle with capturing present states of urban sites or accurately planning future urban development. An interest for urban planning lies on socio-economic conditions, as consumption and production of disposable goods are related to economic possibilities. Therefore, we developed an approach to generate relevant parameters for infrastructure planning by means of remote sensing and spatial analysis. In this study, the single building defines the spatial unit for the parameters. In the case city Belmopan (Belize), based on WorldView-1 data we manually define a city covering building dataset. Residential buildings are classified to eight building types which are locally adapted to Belmopan. A random forest (RF) classifier is trained with locally collected training data. Through household interviews focusing on household assets, income and educational level, a socio-economic point (SEP) scaling is defined, which correlates very well with the defined building typology. In order to assign socio-economic parameters to the single building, five socio-economic classes (SEC) are established based on SEP statistics for the building types. The RF building type classification resulted in high accuracies. Focusing on the three categories to describe residential socio-economic states allowed high correlations between the defined building and socio-economic points. Based on the SEP we projected a citywide residential socio-economic building classification to support supply and disposal infrastructure planning.

TI  - Australian general practitioners' attitudes and knowledge of sentinel lymph node biopsy in melanoma management
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectiveIn Australia, the uptake of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) appears low despite clinical practice guideline recommendations. The aim of this study was to describe the knowledge and attitudes of general practitioners (GPs) to SLNB.MethodsGPs were recruited at an annual conference and a skin cancer skills workshop, and using GP professional communications. A mixed methods approach comprised a cross-sectional questionnaire and, for a subset of participants, semi-structured interviews.ResultsOverall, 231 GPs completed the questionnaire, of whom 23 were interviewed. One-third (32%) described themselves as quite or very familiar with the guidelines, and two-thirds (68%) thought that SLNB had an important role in the management of patients with melanoma. Of GPs who would discuss SLNB with eligible patients, <40% correctly identified that SLNB is recommended for patients with an invasive melanoma >1 mm thick.ConclusionsGPs were generally supportive of SLNB. Familiarity with the guidelines was low, particularly regarding which patients should be considered for SLNB.

TI  - Routine laboratory surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in community-acquired urinary tract infections adequately informs prescribing policy in England
T2  - JAC-ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To assess whether resistance estimates obtained from sentinel surveillance for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) differ from routinely collected laboratory community UTI data.Methods: All patients aged >= 18 years presenting to four sentinel general practices with a suspected UTI, from 13 November 2017 to 12 February 2018, were asked to provide urine specimens for culture and susceptibility. Specimens were processed at the local diagnostic laboratory. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was conducted using automated methods. We calculated the proportion of Escherichia coli isolates that were non-susceptible (according to contemporaneous EUCAST guidelines) to trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, cefalexin, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, overall and by age group and sex, and compared this with routine estimates.Results: Sentinel practices submitted 740 eligible specimens. The specimen submission rate had increased by 28 specimens per 1000 population per year (95% CI 21-35). Uropathogens were isolated from 23% (169/740) of specimens; 67% were E. coli (113/169). Non-susceptibility of E. coli to trimethoprim was 28.2% (95% CI 20.237.7) on sentinel surveillance (33.4%; 95% CI 29.5-37.6 on routine data) and to nitrofurantoin was 0.9% (95% CI 0-5.7) (1.5%; 95% CI 0.7-3.0 on routine data).Conclusions: Routine laboratory data resulted in a small overestimation in resistance (although the difference was not statistically significant) and our findings suggest that it provides an adequate estimate of non-susceptibility to key antimicrobials in community-acquired UTIs in England. This study does not support the need for ongoing local sentinel surveillance.

TI  - Cultural worldview and cultural experience in natural tourism sites
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cultural worldview (CW) refers to people's underlying general attitudes such as basic beliefs and perceptions of a culture. The cultural experience (CE) in tourism is multi-dimensional, but little research has paid attention to the relationship between CW and CE in cultural tourism, especially with regard to nature sites. This paper explores the scales of CW and CE in the Chinese context in order to examine their relationship and compare the difference between high and low self-cultivation groups. Taking Huangshan Mountain as the study area, 253 usable questionnaire forms from 2016 to 322 usable questionnaire forms from 2017 were collected. Through exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), structural equation modeling (SEM) and multi-group analysis, the following results were obtained: 1) the scales of CW and CE in the Chinese context were identified; 2) the cultural linkages, cultural protection and Chinese traditional culture of nature in CW positively affected most dimensions of CE (conservation education, scientific knowledge, person-valuing and high culture); and 3) for the high self-cultivation group, the relationships between CW and CE were stronger and most of the latent mean scores were greater than those of the low self-cultivation group. This study contributes to the research in both cultural and nature tourism and social psychology, and has practical implications for destinations.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node detection for gastric cancer: Promise or pitfall?
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Review
AB  - At present, optimal surgery for gastric cancer is still under debate, especially the extent of lymph node dissection. Gastrectomy with D1/D2 lymphadenectomy is standard treatment for resectable advanced gastric cancer. However, in early gastric cancer without lymph node metastasis, gastrectomy with D1/D2 lymphadenectomy may not be unnecessary, which could increases morbidity and mortality and reduces the quality of life (QOL). Therefore, the concept of sentinel lymph node could be applied in gastric cancer. But due to the complexity of gastric lymphatic drainage, there are still many issues under debate, such as suitable tracers, the method of mapping and collecting and the oncologic safety of sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS). In addition, skip metastasis and unreliability of intraoperative pathological diagnosis are two main reasons for false negative cases. In this review, we summarize the current status and controversy of sentinel lymph node detection in gastric cancer, attempting to help with practical application. Further, we hold opinion that we should be cautious about performing sentinel lymph node detection in gastric cancer before an accurate and effective method occurs.

TI  - Natural versus anthropogenic sources and seasonal variability of insoluble precipitation residues at Laohugou Glacier in northeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study employs the grain size distributions and the concentrations and isotopic compositions of Sr, Nd, and Pb in the precipitation samples collected from the Laohugou Glacier (LHG) in northeastern Ti-betan Plateau (TP) during August 2014-2015 to investigate seasonal variability in the insoluble precipitation particle sources. Fine dust particle (0.57-27 mu m) depositions dominated in autumn and winter, whereas both fine and coarse dust particle (27-100 mu m) depositions were found in spring and summer. Furthermore, the concentrations of Sr, Nd, and Pb also varied seasonally-the highest and lowest Sr and Nd concentrations were recorded in spring and autumn, respectively, whereas the highest and lowest Pb concentrations were recorded in winter and summer, respectively. The Sr and Nd isotopes revealed that the dust in the winter precipitation originated predominately from the Taklimakan Desert and that in spring originated from the Badain Jaran and Qaidam deserts. The precipitation residues in summer were derived from a complex mixture of dust sources from the Gobi and other large deserts in northwest China. Autumn residues were predominately sourced from local soil near the LHG as well as from the Qaidam Basin and the northern TP surface soil. The Taklimakan, long suspected as a major source of long-range transported dust, was an insignificant contributor to the precipitation over LHG during spring, summer, and autumn. Further, the Pb isotopic ratios indicated a primary impact of anthropogenic pollutants for most part of the year (except spring). Meteorological data and the MODIS AOD model are in good agreement with the results from the analyses of the Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopes for the LHG particle source, and further clarify the source regions. Thus, this study thus provides new evidence on the seasonal variability of the sources of the residual particles in remote glaciers in Central Asia. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Active Fires over China during 2003-2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a common circumstance in the world. It causes direct casualties and economic losses, and also brings severe negative influences on the atmospheric environment. In the background of climate warming and rising population, it is important to understand the fire responses regarding the spatio-temporal changes. Thus, a long-term change analysis of fires is needed in China. We use the remote sensed MOD14A1/MYD14A1 fire products to analyze the seasonal variations and long-term trends, based on five main land cover types (forest, cropland, grassland, savannas and urban areas). The fires are found to have clear seasonal variations; there are more fires in spring and autumn in vegetated lands, which are related to the amount of dry biomass and temperature. The fire numbers have significantly increased during the study period, especially from spring to autumn, and those have decreased in winter. The long-term fire trends are different when delineated into different land cover types. There are significant increasing fire trends in grasslands and croplands in North, East and Northeast China during the study period. The urban fires also show increasing trends. On the contrary, there are significant decreasing fire trends in forests and savannas in South China where it is most densely vegetated. This study provides an overall analysis of the spatio-temporal fire changes from satellite products, and it may help to understand the fire risk in the changing climate for a better risk management.

TI  - Spatial and semantic effects of LUCAS samples on fully automated land use/land cover classification in high-resolution Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we test the use of Land Use and Coverage Area frame Survey (LUCAS) in-situ reference data for classifying high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery at a large scale. We compare several pre-processing schemes (PS) for LUCAS data and propose a new PS for a fully automated classification of satellite imagery on the national level. The image data utilizes a high-dimensional Sentinel-2-based image feature space. Key elements of LUCAS data pre-processing include two positioning approaches and three semantic selection approaches. The latter approaches differ in the applied quality measures for identifying valid reference points and by the number of LU/LC classes (7-12). In an iterative training process, the impact of the chosen PS on a Random Forest image classifier is evaluated. The results are compared to LUCAS reference points that are not pre-processed, which act as a benchmark, and the classification quality is evaluated by independent sets of validation points. The classification results show that the positional correction of LUCAS points has an especially positive effect on the overall classification accuracy. On average, this improves the accuracy by 3.7%. This improvement is lowest for the most rigid sample selection approach, PS2, and highest for the benchmark data set, PS0. The highest overall accuracy is 93.1% which is achieved by using the newly developed PS3; all PS achieve overall accuracies of 80% and higher on average. While the difference in overall accuracy between the PS is likely to be influenced by the respective number of LU/LC classes, we conclude that, overall, LUCAS in-situ data is a suitable source for reference information for large scale high resolution LC mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery. Existing sample selection approaches developed for Landsat imagery can be transferred to Sentinel-2 imagery, achieving comparable semantic accuracies while increasing the spatial resolution. The resulting LC classification product that uses the newly developed PS is available for Germany via DOI: https://doi.org/10.15489/1ccmlap3mn39.

TI  - Considerations for transferring an operational dynamic ocean management tool between ocean color products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing data are critical for assessing ecosystem state and evaluating long-term trends and shifts in ecosystem components. Many operational tools rely on continuous streams of remote sensing data, and when a satellite sensor reaches the end of its designed lifespan, these tools must be transferred to a more reliable data stream. Transferring between data streams can produce discontinuities in tool products, and it is important to quantify these downstream impacts and understand the mechanisms that cause discontinuity. To illustrate the complexities of tool transfer, we compare five products for ocean chlorophyll-a, which is a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and an important input for tools that monitor marine biophysical processes. The five chlorophyll-a products included three blended products and two single sensor products from MODIS and VIIRS. We explored the downstream impacts of tool transfer using EcoCast: an operational dynamic ocean management tool that combines real-time predictions from target and bycatch species distribution models to produce integrated surfaces of fishing suitability. EcoCast was operationalized using MODIS chlorophyll-a, and we quantify the impacts of transferring to the intended replacement of MODIS, VIIRS, and test if impacts can be minimized by using a blended chlorophyll-a product instead. Differences between chlorophyll products did not linearly propagate through to the species model predictions and the integrated fishing suitability surfaces. Instead, differences in species model predictions were determined by the shape of chlorophyll-a response curves in the species models relative to chlorophyll-a differences between sensors. However, differences in the integrated fishing suitability surfaces were reduced by canceling of differences from individual species model predictions. Differences in the integrated fishing suitability surfaces were not reduced by transferring to a blended product, highlighting the complexity of transferring operational tools between different remote sensing data products. These results contribute to our general understanding of the mechanisms by which transferring between data streams impacts downstream products. To aid decision-making regarding tool transfer, we developed an interactive web application that allows end-users to explore differences in chlorophyll products within times period and regions of interest.

TI  - Rainfall, groundwater, and surface water isotope data from extreme tropical cyclones (2016-2019) within the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean basins
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Under a changing climate, projections estimate that over the next thirty years, extreme Tropical Cyclones (TCs) will increase in frequency, with two to three times more Category 4 and 5 hurricanes in the Atlantic basin between 20 degrees N and 40 degrees N. In recent years, the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean basins have experienced several extreme TCs, resulting in extensive human, ecological, and economic damage [1-3]. To improve understanding of TCs and their potential impacts in the face of climate change, physically based understanding of past climate and modern TC dynamics is necessary. Despite the well-known Atlantic hurricane season, surface observations of the isotopic evolution of TC's moisture and the propagation of isotopically distinct pulses across surface and subsurface water reservoirs are lacking. In this data article, we provide novel high frequency sampling of surface rainfall isotope compositions (delta O-18, delta H-2, and d-excess in parts per thousand) for Hurricanes Otto (Costa Rica, 2016), Nate (Costa Rica, 2017), Irma (Cuba and The Bahamas, 2017), Maria (Cuba and The Bahamas, 2017), and Dorian (The Bahamas, 2019). These five TCs were characterized by unprecedented impacts during continental and maritime landfalls and passages. In total, 161 surface rainfall samples were collected in passive devices [4] with event-based and daily frequencies, resulting in the first surface isotopic tempestology anatomy across the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean basins to date. Derived rainfall from TCs often results in large input amounts of isotopically distinct water over an area from few hours to several days, and therefore this unique isotope composition is propagated through surface and shallow subsurface reservoirs. Our data also include spring (N=338) and surface water (N= 334) isotope compositions following the impact of Hurricane Otto and Tropical Storm Nate in central Costa Rica. As this region is well-known for its diverse rainfall dynamics and as a climate change `hot spot' [5-7], our data provide an opportunity to improve and complement modern and past climate interpretations often derived from satellite products and calcite-delta O-18 paleoclimatic archives in light of climatic forcing, TC rainfall amounts and recharge rates, and the hypothesized climatic-induced decline of past Mesoamerican civilizations.

TI  - Bottom-Up Perspectives on the Re-Greening of the Sahel: An Evaluation of the Spatial Relationship between Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) and Tree-Cover in Burkina Faso
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Re-Greening of the West African Sahel has attracted great interdisciplinary interest since it was originally detected in the mid-2000s. Studies have investigated vegetation patterns at regional scales using a time series of coarse resolution remote sensing analyses. Fewer have attempted to explain the processes behind these patterns at local scales. This research investigates bottom-up processes driving Sahelian greening in the northern Central Plateau of Burkina Faso-a region recognized as a greening hot spot. The objective was to understand the relationship between soil and water conservation (SWC) measures and the presence of trees through a comparative case study of three village terroirs, which have been the site of long-term human ecology fieldwork. Research specifically tests the hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between SWC and tree cover. Methods include remote sensing of high-resolution satellite imagery and aerial photos; GIS procedures; and chi-square statistical tests. Results indicate that, across all sites, there is a significant association between SWC and trees (chi-square = 20.144, p <= 0.01). Decomposing this by site, however, points out that this is not uniform. Tree cover is strongly associated with SWC investments in only one village-the one with the most tree cover (chi-square = 39.098, p <= 0.01). This pilot study concludes that SWC promotes tree cover but this is heavily modified by local contexts.

TI  - Pathways to the revitalization of Indigenous food systems: Decolonizing diets through Indigenous-focused food guides
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The 2019 Canadian Food Guide (CFG) was launched in January 2019 with a promise to be inclusive of multicultural diets and diverse perspectives on food, including the food systems of Indigenous communities. Some scholars argue that federally designed standard food guides often fail to address the myriad and complex issues of food security, well-being, and nutritional needs of Canadian Indigenous communities while imposing a dominant and westernized worldview of food and nutrition. In a parallel development, Indigenous food systems and associated knowledges and perspectives are being rediscovered as a hope and ways to improve current and future food security. Based on a review of relevant literature and our long-term collaborative learning and communitybased research engagements with Indigenous communities from Manitoba, we propose that Indigenous communities should develop their food guides considering their contexts, needs, and preferences. We discuss the scope and limitations of the most recent Canadian food guide and opportunities to decolonize it through Indigenous food guides, including their potential benefits in enhancing food security and well-being for Indigenous communities. We propose to design and pilot test such Indigenous food guides in communities Fisher River Cree Nation in Manitoba as community-based case study research that supports Indigenous-led and community-based resurgence and decolonization of food guides.

TI  - Tracking the phenology of photosynthesis using carotenoid-sensitive and near-infrared reflectance vegetation indices in a temperate evergreen and mixed deciduous forest
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Photosynthetic phenology is an important indicator of annual gross primary productivity (GPP). Assessing photosynthetic phenology remotely is difficult for evergreen conifers as they remain green year-round. Carotenoid-based vegetation indices such as the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI) are promising tools to remotely track the invisible phenology of photosynthesis by assessing carotenoid pigment dynamics. PRI, CCI and the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) index may act as proxies of photosynthetic efficiency (e), an important parameter in light-use efficiency models, or direct proxies of photosynthesis.To understand the physiological mechanisms reflected by PRI and CCI and the ability of vegetation indices to act as proxies of photosynthetic activity for estimating GPP, we measured leaf pigment composition, PRI, CCI, NIRV and photosynthetic activity at the leaf and canopy scales over 2 years in an evergreen and mixed deciduous forest.PRI and CCI captured the large seasonal carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio changes and good relationships were observed between PRI-e and CCI-photosynthesis and NIRV-photosynthesis.PRI-, CCI- and NIRV-based models effectively tracked observed seasonal GPP. We propose that carotenoid-based and near-infrared reflectance vegetation indices may provide useful proxies of photosynthetic activity and can improve remote sensing-based models of GPP in evergreen and deciduous forests.

TI  - FY-3D HIRAS Radiometric Calibration and Accuracy Assessment
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The High-Spectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS) is a Fourier transform spectrometer onboard the fourth polar-orbiting FengYun 3D satellite (FY-3D). The FY-3D HIRAS provides interferogram measurements of Earth view radiance spectra in three infrared spectral bands at 29 crosstrack positions, each with a 2 x 2 array of field of views (FOVs). The HIRAS level 1 radiance data cover the spectral bands from 650 to 1135 cm(-1) [long-wave (LW) band], 1210 to 1750 cm(-1) [mid-wave (MW) band], and 2155 to 2550 cm(-1) [short-wave (SW) band] with a spectral resolution of 0.625 cm(-1). The radiometric calibration algorithm and the methods of refining the nonlinearity (NL) and the polarization correction coefficients on orbit are summarized in this article. The NL correction coefficients are derived by minimizing the spread of the responsivity functions derived from the measurements of the internal calibration target with varying temperatures. The polarization correction coefficients are derived from the cold space observations and the routine Earth scene measurements. The radiometric accuracy is assessed by comparing the HIRAS measurements to the collocated Cross-track Infrared Sounder ( CrIS) observations and radiance simulations. The results show that, compared to CrIS, the radiometric differences are about 0.3 and 0.7 K for the LW and MW bands, respectively, and 0.5 K for the CO absorption and window regions in the SW band. The consistency of the radiometric calibration among the four FOVs is estimated to be within 0.2 K for most of the spectral domain. Some remaining issues for the FY-3D HIRAS are also discussed.

TI  - Study on the Spatial Pattern of an Extreme Heat Event by Remote Sensing: A Case Study of the 2013 Extreme Heat Event in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity and frequency of extreme heat events are increasing globally, which has a great impact on resident health, social life, and ecosystems. Detailed knowledge of the spatial heat pattern during extreme heat events is important for coping with heat disasters. This study aimed to monitor the characteristics of the spatial pattern during the 2013 heat wave in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China, based on the remote sensing estimated gridded air temperature (Ta). Based on the land surface temperature (Ts), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), built-up area, and elevation derived from multi-source satellite data, the daily maximum air temperature (Ta_max) during the heat wave was mapped by the random forest (RF) algorithm. Based on the remotely sensed Ta, heat intensity index (HII) was calculated to measure the spatial pattern of heat during this heat wave. Results indicated that most areas in the YRD suffered from extreme heat, and the heat pattern also exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity. Cities located in the Taihu Plain and the Hangjiahu Plain generally had high HII values. The northern plain in the YRD showed relatively lower HII values, and mountains in the southern YRD showed the lowest HII values. Heat proportion index (HPI) was calculated to qualify the overall heat intensity of each city in the YRD. Wuxi, Changzhou, and Shanghai showed the highest HPI values, indicating that the overall heat intensities in these cities were higher than others. Yancheng, Zhoushan, and Anqing ranked last. This study provides a good reference for understanding the pattern of heat during heat waves in the YRD, which is valuable for heat wave disaster prevention.

TI  - Main active faults and seismic activity along the Yangtze River Economic Belt: Based on remote sensing geological survey
T2  - CHINA GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) spans three terrain steps in China and features diverse topography that is characterized by significant differences in geological structure and present-day crustal deformation. Active faults and seismic activity are important geological factors for the planning and development of the YREB. In this paper, the spatial distribution and activity of 165 active faults that exist along the YREB have been compiled from previous findings, using both remote-sensing data and geological survey results. The crustal stability of seven particularly noteworthy typical active fault zones and their potential effects on the crustal stability of the urban agglomerations are analyzed. The main active fault zones in the western YREB, together with the neighboring regional active faults, make up an arc fault block region comprising primarily of Sichuan-Yunnan and a "Sichuan-Yunnan arc rotational-shear active tectonic system " strong deformation region that features rotation, shear and extensional deformation. The active faults in the central-eastern YREB, with seven NE-NNE and seven NW-NWW active faults (the "7-longitudinal, 7-horizontal " pattern), macroscopically make up a "chessboard tectonic system" medium-weak deformation region in the geomechanical tectonic system. They are also the main geological constraints for the crustal stability of the YREB. (C) 2020 China Geology Editorial Office.

AB  - For effective mangrove forest mapping, it is valuable to develop vegetation indices from remote-sensing imagery that can characterize the unique characteristics of mangrove forests and differentiate them from other land cover types (especially other vegetation types). In addition to diverse range of vegetation indices derived from single-phase, remote-sensing imagery that has been applied to mangrove forest classifications, recently a submerged mangrove recognition index (SMRI for short) that considers multi-tidal, high-resolution, remote-sensing imagery, and which is based on the differential spectral signature of mangrove forests under high and low tides, was proposed for use in mangrove forest classifications (Xia et al., 2018). However, to date SMRI has not been compared with existing vegetation indices that are often applied in mangrove forest classifications based on remote-sensing imagery in detail. In this study, the SMRI values obtained from medium- and high-resolution images (i.e., Landsat 8 OIL/TIRS and GF-1 respectively) are compared with four vegetation indices widely used in mangrove forest classifications (i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index, ratio vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, and soil adjusted vegetation index). One more vegetation index, which was only available for remote-sensing imagery with visible bands, a short-wave infrared band, and a mid-wave infrared band, i.e., Landsat 8 OIL/TIRS images, was also compared with the SMRI obtained from the medium-resolution images. The results from experiments with medium- and high-resolution images of Yulin City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China show that the SMRI can distinguish submerged mangrove forests more effectively than the compared vegetation indices, especially in areas between high- and low-tide levels. Furthermore, the SMRI results obtained from high-resolution images perform better than those obtained from medium-resolution images.

AB  - Aim: To describe the factors affecting distant metastasis of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and the prognosis of metastatic MCC. Materials & methods: The MCC patient information was downloaded from the SEER database. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were conducted to screen for significant factors. Results: A total of 3449 patients were enrolled. Surgery and chemotherapy were significantly correlated with the occurrence of distant metastasis. In the cause-specific survival rate of MCC, regional lymph node removal, sentinel lymph node biopsy, radiation and chemotherapy can significantly reduce the prognostic risk of patients with distant metastases. Conclusion: Our study screened out the factors affecting the distant metastasis and prognosis of MCC and more prospective studies are needed to verify our findings.

TI  - MITIGATION OF URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT WITH SMALL-SCALE PARKS - AN EMPIRICAL STUDY ON COMMUNITY PARKS IN NANJING, JIANGSU PROVINCE
T2  - LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities have suffered from urban heat island (UHI) effect due to rapid urbanization, which can be effectively adjusted by urban green space. Taking the community parks in central area of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province as an example, this paper explored the size and shape of small-scale parks to mitigate the UHI effect. Land surface temperature was retrieved from Landsat 8-OLI remote-sensing image of 2019. The 52 studied community parks were identified with ArcGIS 10.4, and classified by kernel building density. The threshold-size and optimal shape of community parks to mitigate UHI effect were then discussed. The results showed that 1) with the increase of buffer ring distance around the community parks, the cooling intensity decreased and the cooling extent were mostly less than 180 m; 2) the area, shape, and the NDVI of the parks were important factors affecting the cooling intensity; 3) the cooling intensity of community parks under a high kernel building density was better, with a higher threshold-size (0.848 hm(2)) than that of the low ones (0.384 hm(2)); and 4) the optimal cooling intensity would occur when the park in a shape of circle or square. In conclusion, it is suggested that small green space should be planned in the areas under a high building density. Through renewal design and refined management measures in the urban green space system planning, giving full play to the ecological benefits of urban green spaces in mitigating the local UHI effect can also be expected.

TI  - Detection of Water Cloud Microphysical Properties Using Multi-scattering Polarization Lidar
T2  - CURRENT OPTICS AND PHOTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiscattering occurs when a laser transmits into dense atmosphere targets (e.g. fogs, smoke or clouds), which can cause depolarization effects even though the scattering particles are spherical. In addition, multiscattering effects have additional information about microphysical properties of scatterers. Thus, multiscattering can be utilized to study the microphysical properties of the liquid water cloud. In this paper, a Monte Carlo method was used to simulate multi-scattering transmission properties of Lidar signals in the cloud. The results showed the slope of the degree of linear polarization (SLDLP) can be used to invert the extinction coefficient, and then the cloud effective size (CES) and the liquid water content (LWC) may be easily obtained by using the extinction coefficient and saturation of the degree of linear polarization (SADLP). Based on calculation results, a microphysical properties inversion method for a liquid cloud was presented. An innovative multiscattering polarization Lidar (MSPL) system was constructed to measure the LWC and CES of the liquid cloud, and a new method based on the polarization splitting ratio of the Polarization Beam Splitter (PBS) was developed to calibrate the polarization channels of MSPL. By analyzing the typical observation data of MSPL observation in the northern suburbs of Nanjing, China, the LWC and CES of the liquid water cloud were obtained. Comparisons between the results from the MSPL, MODIS and the Microwave radar data showed that, the microphysical properties of liquid cloud could be retrieved by combining our MSPL and the inversion method.

TI  - Dynamic Trends of Urban Flooding Mitigation Services in Shenzhen, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is characterized by population agglomeration and the expansion of impervious land surfaces. As a result of ongoing urbanization, rain and flood events have increasingly affected the well-being of residents in cities across the world. This should draw attention to the role of urban ecosystems in providing runoff retention/flood mitigation services. Focusing on Shenzhen, a major city in southern China, we used a hydrologic model based on the Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) model to evaluate this flood reduction ecosystem service and its dynamic trends based on long-term remote sensing data from 1980 to 2018. We find that Shenzhen's capacity for flood reduction gradually decreased due to changes in land use. The spatial distribution showed strong reduction capacity in the eastern part of the city and weak capacity in the western part. Additionally, the city's total flood reduction capacity decreased by over 1.88 x 10(8) m(3) over the past two decades. This loss of ecosystem-based flood reduction capacity undermines Shenzhen's resilience against extreme weather events. Due to climate change, Shenzhen should advance its plan to build a "Sponge City" rooted in the conservation, restoration, and construction of urban ecological spaces.

TI  - Spatial-feature data cube for spatiotemporal remote sensing data processing and analysis
T2  - COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development in Earth observation technology, a variety of satellite sensors have provided large and open sets of remote sensing data. However, traditional methods of analysis are no longer available for time-serial remote sensing data analysis that typically handles multidimensional spatio-temporal data models. Moreover, researchers have found it trivial and tedious to obtain ready-to-analyze data for Earth science models from regular Earth observation data. For an easy and efficient timeserial remote sensing data analysis, a spatial-featured data cube analysis tool based on multidimensional data model is proposed for time-serial remote sensing data processing and analysis. For the performance consideration, a distributed execution enginewas also used for efficient implementation of large-scale tasks in parallel. Finally, through experiments on both normalized difference vegetation index product and water detection within a 20-year period, we confirmed that our approach is efficient and scalable for a long time-series analysis.

TI  - Mapping Winter Wheat with Combinations of Temporally Aggregated Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Data in Shandong Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat is one of the major cereal crops in China. The spatial distribution of winter wheat planting areas is closely related to food security; however, mapping winter wheat with time-series finer spatial resolution satellite images across large areas is challenging. This paper explores the potential of combining temporally aggregated Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data available via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for mapping winter wheat in Shandong Province, China. First, six phenological median composites of Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI reflectance measures were generated by a temporal aggregation technique according to the winter wheat phenological calendar, which covered seedling, tillering, over-wintering, reviving, jointing-heading and maturing phases, respectively. Then, Random Forest (RF) classifier was used to classify multi-temporal composites but also mono-temporal winter wheat development phases and mono-sensor data. The results showed that winter wheat could be classified with an overall accuracy of 93.4% and F1 measure (the harmonic mean of producer's and user's accuracy) of 0.97 with temporally aggregated Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data were combined. As our results also revealed, it was always good to classify multi-temporal images compared to mono-temporal imagery (the overall accuracy dropped from 93.4% to as low as 76.4%). It was also good to classify Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI imagery combined instead of classifying them individually. The analysis showed among the mono-temporal winter wheat development phases that the maturing phase's and reviving phase's data were more important than the data for other mono-temporal winter wheat development phases. In sum, this study confirmed the importance of using temporally aggregated Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data combined and identified key winter wheat development phases for accurate winter wheat classification. These results can be useful to benefit on freely available optical satellite data (Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI) and prioritize key winter wheat development phases for accurate mapping winter wheat planting areas across China and elsewhere.

TI  - Indication of the Two Linear Correlation Methods Between Vegetation Index and Climatic Factors: An Example in the Three River-Headwater Region of China During 2000-2016
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The within-growing-season correlations (WGSC) and the inter-growing-season correlations (IGSC) are widely used linear correlation analysis methods between vegetation index and climatic factors (such as temperature, precipitation, and so on). The WGSC method usually calculates the linear correlation coefficient between vegetation index and climatic factors of each month in all the growing seasons, for instance, whether vegetation index or temperature had data of 204 months (12 months x 17 years) during 2000-2016 to get the WGSC. The IGSC calculates the linear correlation coefficient between the vegetation index and climatic factors in the same month of each growing season among all the years, for example, only 17 couples' data of vegetation index and temperature during 2000-2016 were used to get the linear correlation of IGSC. What is the difference between the results of the two methods and why do the results show that difference? Which is the more suitable method for the analysis of the relationship between the vegetation index and climatic conditions? To clarify the difference of the two methods and to explore more about the relationship between the vegetation index and climatic factors, we collected the data of 2000-2016 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) 13A1 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the meteorological data-temperature and precipitation, then calculated WGSC and IGSC between NDVI and the climatic factor in three river-headwater regions of China. The results showed that: (1) As for WGSC, the more of the years included, the higher the correlation coefficient between NDVI and the temperature/precipitation. The correlation coefficient of WGSC is dependent on how many years' the data were included, and it was increased with the more year's data included, while the correlation coefficients of IGSC are relatively independent on the amount of the data; (2) the WGSC showed a pseudo linear correlation between NDVI and climatic conditions caused by the accumulation of data amount, while the IGSC can more accurately indicate the impact of climatic factors on vegetation since it did not rely on the data amount.

TI  - Regime shifts in shallow lakes observed by remote sensing and the implications for management
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow lakes are one of the most complex aquatic systems and are known to shift between a macrophyte-dominated clear-water state and a phytoplankton-dominated turbid state. We developed a decision-tree classification based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to classify the major vegetation cover types in shallow lakes and documented the vegetation in Gehu Lake using Landsat time series images from 1984 to 2018. The area of aquatic vegetation in Gehu Lake (a large shallow lake in China) showed a significant decreasing trend (R-2 = 0.839, p < 0.001) from 1984 to 2018, which was significantly positively correlated with water clarity (R-2 = 0.864, p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations (R-2 = 0.704, p < 0.001; R-2 = 0.724, p < 0.001, respectively). A complete regime shift from a clear macrophyte-dominated state to a turbid phytoplankton-dominated state was observed in 2004. Our results revealed that regime shifts in shallow lakes can be divided into two stages: changes in important variables make the lake ecosystems more susceptible and into a critical stage; in the critical stage, any shock events or actions by external drivers may induce a regime shift. Abnormal and large-area changes in aquatic vegetation may be used as early warning signals of the degradation of ecosystem resilience and impending regime shifts. Remote sensing is powerful for monitoring the dynamics of ecosystems and understanding the regime shifts in shallow lakes. Strengthening long-term ecological monitoring and developing new monitoring technologies may improve ecosystem management and conservation in shallow lakes.

TI  - Causes of domestic livestock ?wild herbivore conflicts in the alpine of the Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the causes of human-wildlife conflicts is important for reducing these conflicts. Human-wildlife conflicts can be divided into wild carnivore- and wild herbivore-related conflicts. Compared with carnivore-related conflicts, herbivore-related conflicts such as domestic livestock-wild herbivore conflicts (LHCs) have not been adequately studied, and there is scarce information on LHC intensity, causes, and impacts. LHCs frequently and extensively occur in the alpine ecosystem of the Chang Tang Plateau, China. Herbivorous wildlife competes with livestock for forage and habitat, which degrades the ecosystem, influences community livelihood, and decreases residents' tolerance of wildlife. This study analyzed LHC causes in this plateau by focusing on forage competition, wild herbivore habitat and grazing land overlap using a comprehensive carrying capacity analysis method and niche Maxent model by integrating field surveys, statistical data, and remote sensing data. By integrating the domestic livestock with herbivorous wildlife into carrying capacity analysis, the stocking rate was 110%, which was 10% over the carrying capacity threshold. Overlap between wild herbivore habitat and domestic livestock grazing land was high, with Tibetan antelope ranging in 88% of the grazing land and domestic livestock grazing activities in 39.2% of Tibetan antelope habitat. Pasture fencing aggravated LHCs by fragmenting herbivore habitats and obstructing Tibetan antelope migration routes. LHCs in this plateau could be mitigated by extending the existing wildlife-related damage compensation scheme to cover wild herbivore-related damages, optimizing pasture fencing layout, diversifying community livelihood, and popularizing community-based wildlife management.

AB  - Polarimetry synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (PolInSAR) is a promising technology for globalscale forest-height mapping. Many PolInSAR space missions have been proposed or are under development. To ensure the performance of forest-height estimation, a critical study of the required system and platform parameters for the planned mission must be carried out. This involves theoretical modeling of wave scattering of the forest canopy, SAR imaging-simulation of polarimetric interferometry, implementation of a parameter-inversion algorithm, and errorbudget analysis of forest-height retrieval.

TI  - An improved inversion algorithm for spatio-temporal retrieval of soil moisture through modified water cloud model using C- band Sentinel-1A SAR data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - An approach to incorporate vegetation fraction into Modified Water Cloud Model (MWCM) and the evaluation of potential of multi-target random forest regression (MTFER) were done for the retrieval of spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture (SM) in Varanasi district of Uttar Pradesh, India. The Sentinel-1A SAR images were acquired for three different dates (19/12/2016, 05/02/2017 and 25/03/2017) for two types of spatial regions covered with vegetated and sparse vegetated soil field for SM retrieval. The vegetation fraction (f(ve)(g)), computed from Landsat - 8 satellite data, was inserted into the modified water cloud model (MWCM) as a modification factor. Leaf area index (LAI) was used as a vegetation descriptor parameter (V) in the MWCM. Subsequently, a machine learning based MTRFR algorithm with a regularization routine was used for stable and optimum solution for complex problems related to the inversion of the MWCM for the accurate estimation of SM. The coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE) and nash sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) indicated significantly better results in the region-2 for all the temporal changes occurred than those of region-1. The results showed that incorporation of f(veg) to the MWCM provided high potential to retrieve spatio-temporal SM in the region-2 where soil fields were mostly covered with wheat and barley crops rather than in region-1 having sparse vegetated soil field. The overall accuracy of spatio-temporal retrieval of SM after incorporating vegetation factor to MWCM showed significantly better R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 3.18 (%) and NSE = 0.85. The inversion results proximate that the MTRFR techniques applied to the MWCM, including vegetation factor, has great a capability for an accurate SM retrieval in the vegetated soil field.

TI  - CRInSAR Using Two-Step LAMBDA Algorithm for Nonlinear Deformation Estimation: Case Study of Monitoring Xiangtan Converter Station, China
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deformation monitoring of a converter station of an electrical power transmission system will help to prevent potential damages to power facilities and properties. Corner reflector InSAR (CRInSAR) enables local deformation measurements in low coherence areas like construction-engineering projects. However, the accuracy of CRInSAR will be degraded by the phase unwrapping errors, especially when the deformation is large or dominated by nonlinear component. This letter reports a study that employs CRInSAR technique to monitor the deformations of ten CRs installed in Xiangtan converter station, China, with seven TerraSAR-X Spotlight images. A two-step phase unwrapping tactics is proposed based on the least squares ambiguity decorrelation adjustment (LAMBDA) algorithm to focus on estimating nonlinear deformation without being affected by unwrapping errors. The results reveal that the two-step LAMBDA algorithm can achieve an accuracy of less than 2 mm for CRInSAR deformation monitoring regardless of small- or large-scale deformations, as validated by the trigonometric leveling measurements.

TI  - Effects of Spring-Neap Tidal Cycle on Spatial and Temporal Variability of Satellite Chlorophyll-A in a Macrotidal Embayment, Ariake Sea, Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the spatio-temporal variability of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) associated with spring-neap tidal cycles in the Ariake Sea, Japan. Our study relied on significantly improved, regionally-tuned datasets derived from the ocean color sensor Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua over a 16-year period (2002-2017). The results revealed that spring-neap tidal variations in Chl-a and TSM within this macrotidal embayment (the Ariake Sea) are clearly different regionally and seasonally. Generally, the spring-neap tidal variability of Chl-a in the inner part of the Ariake Sea was controlled by TSM for seasons other than summer, whereas it was controlled by river discharge for summer. On the other hand, the contribution of TSM to the variability of Chl-a was not large for two areas in the middle of Ariake Sea where TSM was not abundant. This study demonstrates that ocean color satellite observations of Chl-a and TSM in the macrotidal embayment offer strong advantages for understanding the variations during the spring-neap tidal cycle.

T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Poyang Lake wetland of China, with designated national nature reserves, is one of the most important habitats for waterfowl in the world. During the wintering season, it is home to various rare and endangered species with abundant plant resources. However, extensive disturbances from both global climate change and human activities, such as the construction of hydroelectric dams, have exerted severe impacts on the hydrological regime and the vegetation dynamics in this region. To evaluate the suitability of the habitat for wintering waterfowl, it is necessary to monitor the spatio-temporal changes of vegetation over the protected wetland, and explore the potential environmental driving factors of the changes during the past decades. In this study, the time-series MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data from 2000 to 2018, were used to analyze the seasonal dynamics and interannual tendencies of vegetation coverage over the wintering period from October to January. The results showed that the largest monthly mean EVI generally occurred in November, and was related to the quantity of wintering waterfowl in Poyang Lake wetland. The mean EVI in November had a lagged response to both temperature and accumulated precipitation. Long-term trend analysis revealed that the average EVI of the reserve increased significantly in the winters since the new millennium. Over the past 18 years, the hydrological regime, particularly the water area, is recognized as the dominant environmental factor determining the interannual variation of EVI. From 2010 onwards there was also an increasing influence of temperature. These analyses would help in the creation of appropriate management strategies to protect the habitat of wintering waterfowl in Poyang Lake wetland. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Water depth retrieval models of East Dongting Lake, China, using GF-1 multi-spectral remote sensing images
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution satellite technology is playing an increasingly important role in environmental monitoring. As the first high-resolution satellite for earth observation in China, GaoFen-1 (GF-1) has great potential for collecting water depth data. Multispectral images from GF-1 (16 m) combined with water depth data from long-term monitoring at a hydrological station were used with the normalized difference waterbody index, density segmentation, band combination, models (single-band, multi-band, and dual-band ratio) to invert the water depth of East Dongting Lake in the dry season and to provide important references for remote sensing of water depth. The experimental results are as follows. (1) Red, green, blue, and combined bands had higher correlation with the measured data. Consequently, the green band was chosen as the factor in the single-band model; blue, green, and red bands in the multi-band model and the ratio of green to red bands in the dual-band ratio model. (2) The correlation coefficients of measured data and single-, multi, and dual-band models were 0.848, 0.867, and 0.925, respectively. (3) The inversion results showed that average water level in East Dongting Lake was approximately 20 m in the dry season during the period 2013-2016 and it was highest in southern area, intermediate in eastern area, and lowest in the western area.

TI  - Interannual Variability of Carbon Uptake of Secondary Forests in the Brazilian Amazon (2004-2014)
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical secondary forests (SF) play an important role in the global carbon cycle as a major terrestrial carbon sink. Here, we use high-resolution TerraClass data set for tracking land use activities in the Brazilian Amazon from 2004-2014 to detect spatial patterns and carbon sequestration dynamics of secondary forests (SF). By integrating satellite lidar and radar observations, we found the SF area in the Brazilian Amazon increased from approximately 22 Mha (10(6) ha) in 2004 to 28 Mha in 2014. However, the expansion in area was also accompanied by a dynamic land use activity that resulted in about 50% recycling of SF area annually from frequent clearing and abandonment. Consequently, the average age of SF remained less than 10 years (age similar to 8.2 with one standard deviation of 3.2 spatially) over the period of the study. Estimation of changes of carbon stocks shows that SF accumulates approximately 8.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) aboveground biomass during the first 10 years after clearing and abandonment, 4.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) for the next 10 years followed by a more gradual increase of 3 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) from 20 to 30 years with much slower rate thereafter. The effective carbon uptake of SF in Brazilian Amazon was negligible (0.06 +/- 0.03 PgC year(-1)) during this period, but the interannual variability was significantly larger (+/- 0.2 PgC year(-1)) If the SF areas were left to grow without further clearing for 100 years, it would absorb about 0.14 PgC year(-1) from the atmosphere, partially compensating the emissions from current rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - A Tile-Based Framework with a Spatial-Aware Feature for Easy Access and Efficient Analysis of Marine Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine remote sensing (MRS) data provide an important tool for advancing global change research. However, the existing product service practices are insufficient for meeting the needs of a full-experience online application. This paper introduces a framework named SatANA, which is unified by a data tiling method with a spatial-aware feature, for integrated and intelligent improvements in visualization, storage and computing. The SatANA framework is supported by a hybrid database storage ideal for the cloud storage of massive MRS data. The raw data are displayed and roamed on a virtual globe through the Internet as tiles, enhancing their spatial awareness, that can be intelligently used for visualization result tuning, data storage preloading and distributed computing optimized indexing. To verify its feasibility and effectiveness, we applied this framework to a platform called SatCO2, which is devoted to providing convenient access to and the efficient utilization of MRS data.

TI  - A N0 Predicting Model for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Omission in Early Breast Cancer Upstaged From Ductal Carcinoma in Situ
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Approximately one-quarter of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ are upstaged to invasive cancer after surgery; however, less than 5% have axillary nodal involvement. In these patients, additional axillary surgery can be omitted after accurate estimation of negative axillary involvement. Using a nationwide cohort database, we developed and validated a scoring system for prediction of axillary lymph node metastasis. The application of this system in this clinic will reduce unnecessary axillary surgeries in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ.Background: A prediction model with high sensitivity for the detection of negative axillary involvement can reduce additional axillary surgery in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) upstaged to invasive cancer while saving patients with pure DCIS from unnecessary axillary surgeries. Using a nationwide database, we developed and validated a scoring system for guidance in selective sentinel lymph node biopsy omission. Patients and Methods: A total of 41,895 patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer from the Korean Breast Cancer Registry were included. The study cohort was randomly divided for the development and validation of the prediction model. Missing data were filled in using multiple imputation. Factors that were significantly associated with axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis in > 50% of datasets were included in the final prediction model. Results: The frequency of ALN metastasis in the total cohort was 24.5%. After multivariable logistic regression analysis, variables that were associated with ALN metastasis were palpability, multifocality, location, size, histologic type, grade, lymphovascular invasion, hormone receptor expression, and Ki-67 level. A scoring system was developed using these factors. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the scoring system was 0.750 in both training and validating sets. The cutoff value for performing sentinel lymph node biopsy was determined as a score of 4 to obtain prediction sensitivity higher than 95%. Conclusions: A scoring system to predict the probability of ALN metastasis was developed and validated. The application of this system in the clinic may reduce unnecessary axillary surgeries in patients with DCIS and minimize additional axillary surgery for upstaged patients with invasive cancer.

TI  - Conserving the lymphatics from the arm using fluorescence imaging in patients with breast cancer at high risk of postoperative lymphedema: a pilot study
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Postoperative lymphedema in breast cancer survivors is a serious complication that develops from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) was recently introduced to reduce lymphedema. This pilot study aimed to investigate the feasibility of preserving the ARM node using fluorescence imaging for patients at high risk of lymphedema.Methods: We prospectively screened patients with breast cancer who had pathologic node-positive disease at diagnosis and were scheduled for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). The sentinel lymph node (SLN) was identified using blue dye and radioisotope, while the ARM node was traced using indocyanine green (ICG). In cases in which SLN was negative on the intraoperative frozen section examination, the ARM node and lymphatics were preserved.Results: Of the 20 screened patients, six whose metastatic axillary lymph node (ALN) was converted to clinically node-negative disease after NCT were enrolled. No patients experienced recurrence at 24 months postoperative. Four patients who had a preserved ARM node did not develop lymphedema. One patient whose ARM node was not preserved due to SLN identification failure did not develop postoperative lymphedema. One patient who underwent ALND without ARM node conservation because of metastatic SLN on frozen section examination developed postoperative lymphedema.Conclusions: ARM is oncologically safe, decreases the incidence of postoperative lymphedema, and allows for the early detection of postoperative lymphedema in patients who underwent ALND. Ultimately, ARM may help improve the quality of life of patients with pathologic node-positive breast cancer.

TI  - Contribution of Different Land Evaluation Systems to Assess Land Capability and Suitability of Some Coastal Soils in Egypt
T2  - Indian Journal of Agricultural Research
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this study were to assess the land capability using Storie Index and Cervatana model and to assess the land suitability by LUSET and Almagra model for some coastal soils in Egypt. Twenty-seven soil profiles were dug and morphologically described to represent all physiographic units. Landsat image, DEM, geological map, field and laboratory work were used to create physiographic-soil map relationship. Based on the modified Storie Index, soils were classified into four land capability grades (grade 2, 3, 4 and 5). The Cervatana model classified these soils into three capability classes, S2, S3 and N. Almagra model indicated that 4.71% of the area is highly suitable (S2) for wheat and citrus and 14.82% of the area is S2 for olives. About 31.78% of the soils is moderately suitable (S3) for wheat and citrus where-as 52% are S3 for olives. Based on LUST, about 5.85, 3.73 and 2.11% of soils are highly suitable (S1) for wheat, cotton and olives respectively. About 31% of the area is moderately suitable (S2) for citrus and peach where-as 63.86% is S2 for alfalfa and 85% of the area is S2 for wheat. Soil salinity, calcium carbonate, drainage and soil texture were the most common limiting factors of the soils. The study revealed that the MicroLEIS application either Cervatana or Almagra is not suited to predict the land suitability and land capability while the LUSET and Modified Storie index is recommended for Egyptian pedoenvironment.

TI  - Sinkholes induced by uncontrolled groundwater withdrawal for agriculture in arid Saudi Arabia. Integration of remote-sensing and geophysical (ERT) techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, an increasing number of sinkholes related to cavernous karst bedrock has been documented in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). One of the most hazardous areas is Al Jouf region, with an average annual rainfall below 35 mm. Here, crop fields irrigated with groundwater have experienced a very rapid expansion. Limited hydrogeological data indicate that the over-exploitation of the aquifers with very low recharge have caused a decline of around 50 m in the groundwater level. Landsat images acquired in 2002, 2015, and 2018 were utilized to automatically map and assess the expansion of agricultural activities in the area, as a proxy for groundwater withdrawal. The data indicate a rising expansion rate, from 57 km(2)/yr in the period 2002-2015, to 123 km(2)/yr during the 2015-2018 interval. The recent sinkhole spate is attributed to the growth of irrigated crops and the associated groundwater level decline, as supports the temporal and spatial correlation. It is proposed that the water level drawdown entails an increase in the effective weight of the roof of relict cavities formed in the past. This interpretation is substantiated at a specific sinkhole investigated by ERT. The geophysical investigation provides information of the position of the underlying cavity and indicates that its roof has been affected by buoyancy loss related to the anthropogenic water level decline.

TI  - Temporal areal changes of wetlands in the lower reaches of the Tarim River and their responses to ecological water conveyance
T2  - Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Ecological water conveyance is of great importance for desert riparian wetland ecosystem. However, few studies have been focused on the quantitative evaluation of water conveyance to wetland restoration due to a lack of continous observation data. This paper analyzed the temporal wetland area changes between Yengisu and Alagan in the lower reach of Tarim River based on time series remote sensing data during 2000-2018, and evaluated the effects of ecological water conveyance on wetland restoration, so as to guide the ecological water conveyance and maintain the stability of the desert wetland ecosystem.Methods About 354 Landsat ETM+/TM/OLI, Sentinel 2 images during 2000-2018 were used to map the monthly wetland area changes in the lower reach of Tarim River, then their annual, seasonal and spaital areal changes were analyzed. The correlation between wetland area changes and ecological water conveyance, underground water levels were also evaluated based on Pearson correlation and cross-correlation methods.Important findings The wetland area has steadly increased in the last 19 years. The areal change rate was minor before 2011 while rapidly increased after 2011. The wetland expanded at a high rate during 2011-2013 and 2017-2018. Different ecological water volumes and water conveyance patterns (single channel or dual channel) can explain different areal changing rates at different stages. The correlation analysis between wetland area changes and ecological water volumes showed that the accumulative ecological water volume is the primary reason causing wetland expansion in recent years. In order to maintain a steady improvement of wetland vegetation, more than 350 million square meters of ecological water are conveyed to the downstream of the Tarim River through dual channel When the groundwater depth is maintained between -5.0-3.5 m, the wetland vegetation can sustain a good growth condition.

TI  - A Precipitation Detection Method for MWTS-II Radiance Assimilation in Typhoon Simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - FY-3C Microwave Temperature Sounder II (MWTS-H) lacks observations at 23.8 GHz, 31 GHz and 89 GHz, making it difficult to remove the data contaminated by precipitation in assimilation. In this paper, a fast forward operator based on the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) was used to analyze the relationship between the observation minus background simulation (O-B) and the cloud fractions in different MWTS-II channels. In addition, based on the community Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system, the radiation brightness temperature of the MWTS-II was assimilated in the regional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model. In the process of assimilation, Visible and Infrared Radiometer (VIRR) cloud detection products were matched to MWTS-II pixels for precipitation detection. For typhoon No. 18 in 2014, impact tests of MWTS-II data assimilation was carried out. The results show that, though the bias observation minus analysis (O-A) of assimilated data can be reduced by quality control only with vertical bar O-B vertical bar < 3K; however, the O-A becomes much smaller while the precipitation detection is performed with F-virr < 0.9 (VIRR cloud fraction threshold of 0.9). Besides, the change of the environmental field around the typhoon is more conducive to make the simulated track closer to the observation. The 72-hour typhoon track simulation error also shows that, after the precipitation detection, the error of simulated typhoon track is significantly reduced, which reflects the validity of a precipitation detection method based on a double criterion of vertical bar O-B vertical bar < 3K and F-virr < 0.9.

TI  - Monitoring the Water Stress of an Indoor Living Wall System Using the "Triangle Method"
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Living walls are important vertical greening systems with modular prevegetated structures. Studies have suggested that living walls have many social benefits as an ecological engineering technique with notable potential for reconciliation ecology. Despite these benefits, there are currently no mature workflows or technologies for monitoring the health status and water stress of living wall systems. To partially fill the current knowledge gap related to water stress, we acquired thermal, multispectral, and hyperspectral remote sensing data from an indoor living wall in the Cloud Forest of the Gardens by the Bay, Singapore. The surface temperature (Ts) and a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were obtained from these data to construct a Ts-NDVI space for applying the "triangle method". A simple and effective algorithm was proposed to determine the dry and wet edges, the key components of the said method. The pixels associated with the dry and wet edges were then selected and highlighted to directly display the areas under water-stress conditions. Our results suggest that the proposed algorithm can provide a reasonable overview of the water-stress information of the living wall; therefore, our method can be simple and effective to monitor the health status of a living wall. Furthermore, our work confirms that the triangle method can be transferred from the outdoors to an indoor environment.

TI  - Phenomenon of Sound Synesthesia in the Development of Students' Creative Thinking
T2  - TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in social, political and economic life, which have taken place very rapidly in recent years, are causing radical changes in various social spheres, in particular in higher education, the priority of which is the development of human subjective qualities that allow living in a changing world, changing oneself in it. In the modern educational paradigm, focused on meeting the needs of the individual, a special place is occupied by the problems of self-development, self-realization of a student. Therefore, it is advisable to use the phenomenon of synesthesia in the educational process. Today, the study of the phenomenon of synesthesia allows identifying the characteristics, to explain its potential in the development of human creativity. The relevance of the theory, methodology, and genesis of synesthesia is confirmed by changes in science itself, which again addressed the problem of person. The burst of research attention to the problem of synesthesia is due to the desire to find out the general principles of different ways of obtaining knowledge about the world, the desire to understand why such values can be realized in verbal, graphic, musical forms, awareness of the holistic nature of human thinking, which ultimately forms aesthetic worldview in representatives of different national and ethnic communities. One of the priority areas for the development of modern linguistics is the analysis of the sound organization of the text. In the framework of the proposed article, we focus on understanding the problem of the phenomenon of sound synesthesia in the creative thinking of students, which is a kind of additional mechanism for the perception and development of skills and abilities to analyze the sound and color relations in poetic text. The system-activity approach was applied in the work, which ensured the integrity, complexity, structure, and purposefulness of the research. With the help of appropriate methods synesthesia representations can be developed and used in the processes of learning and self-education, in learning foreign languages, creative activities and to compensate for disorders in sensory systems in people with psychophysical disorders. As a result of the study, it was found that the symbolism of sounds supports the semantic core of the meaning of language signs. Accordingly, sound synesthesia in the development of creative thinking of students will help to respond more quickly to the rapid changes taking place in the modern world.

AB  - The urgency of the problem under investigation is conditioned by the need to study religious philosophy as a school of thought, without which it is impossible to develop a humanistic worldview in the global world. The purpose of the study is to contribute to the further development of the international academic community that can stimulate the critical transition to global governance in the world of the humanistic, progressive interests of the majority of people with the help of the best achievements of Islamic science. The authors use the axiological approach to the study of the subtlest links between religion, philosophy, science, as well as art, where the basis of the interrelashionship are the sacral texts of al-Quran and Sunnah, reflected through the ideas of Sufism. According to al-Ghazali, "The criterion of true Sufism is the absence of contradictions with the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad". The most important results of the study include the solution of the problem of meaning and contexts of definitions of Sufism; the problem of spiritual knowledge and ethics in Sufism; the connection of Sufism and science through the problem of information; the place of Sufism in the context of world culture.

TI  - A Synthesizing Land-cover Classification Method Based on Google Earth Engine: A Case Study in Nzhelele and Levhuvu Catchments, South Africa
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study designed an approach to derive land-cover in the South Africa with insufficient ground samples, and made a case demonstration in Nzhelele and Levhuvu catchments, South Africa. The method was developed based on an integration of Landsat 8, Sentinel-1, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Random forest classifier with 300 trees is employed as land-cover classification model. In order to overcome the defect of insufficient ground data, the stratified sampling method was used to generate the training and validation samples from the existing land-cover product. Likewise, in order to recognize different land-cover categories, the percentile and monthly median composites were employed to expand input metrics of random forest classifier. Results showed that the overall accuracy of the land-cover of Nzhelele and Levhuvu catchments, South Africa in 2017-2018 reached to 76.43%. Three important results can be drawn from our research. 1) The participation of Sentinel-1 data can slightly improve overall accuracy of land-cover while its contribution on land-cover classification varied with land types. 2) Under-fitting problem was observed in the training of non-dominant land-cover categories using the random sampling, the stratified sampling method is recommended to make sure the classification accuracy of non-dominant classes. 3) When related reflectance bands participated in the training process, individual Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) have little effect on final land-cover classification result.

TI  - Fourier Spectrum Guidance for Stripe Noise Removal in Thermal Infrared Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) imaging has been an indispensable tool in surveillance and remote sensing fields due to the characteristic of this spectrum that enables the sensing system to detect relatively warm targets, especially in low-light conditions. However, the acquired TIR images often suffer from observable stripe noise, which reduces the target detectability to some extent. To remove the noise and keep the image details, this letter proposes a novel method that combines the spectral processing technology with the image-guidance mechanism. Specifically, the frequency band contaminated by stripe noise is corrected with the corresponding Fourier coefficients of a guided image, which can be estimated by existing smoothing methods. Various experiments on the simulated and real TIR images show high performance and efficiency of the proposed method. In addition, in the application of small target detection, it is demonstrated that local contrast between the target and its background is well maintained and the signal-to-clutter ratio is increased when our method is performed.

TI  - Responses of Cloud-Radiative Forcing to Strong El Nino Events over the Western Pacific Warm Pool as Simulated by CAMS-CSM
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud-radiative forcing (CRF) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) over the western Pacific warm pool (WP) shows unique characteristics in response to El Nino events. In this region, the responses of CRF to El Nino events have been a useful metric for evaluating climate models. Satellite data are used to analyze the CRF anomalies to El Nino events simulated by the new and old versions of the Climate System Model of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS-CSM), which has participated in the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP). Here, simulations for super El Nino years, El Nino years, and normal years are compared with observations. The results show that the mean values of both longwave CRF (LWCRF) and shortwave CRF (SWCRF) in CAMS-CSM are weaker than the observations for each category of El Nino events. Compared with the old version of CAMS-CSM, the decrease in LWCRF during El Nino events is well simulated by the new version of CAMS-CSM. However, both new and old models cannot reproduce the anomalous SWCRF in El Nino events. The biases in the CRF response to El Nino events are attributed to the biases in the cloud vertical structure because of a weaker crash of the Walker circulation in CAMS-CSM. Due to the modification of the conversion rate from cloud droplets to raindrops in the cumulus convection scheme, the new version of CAMS-CSM has better CRF skills in normal years, but biases in El Nino events still exist in the new version. Improving the response of the Walker circulation to El Nino events is key to higher skills in simulating the cloud radiative responses.

TI  - Using an improved SWAT model to simulate hydrological responses to land use change: A case study of a catchment in tropical Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change is one of the dominant driving factors of watershed hydrological change. Thus, hydrological responses to land use changes require detailed assessments to ensure sustainable management of both water resources and natural ecosystems. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model has been widely used to simulate the impacts of land use change on water balance. However, the original SWAT model has poor performance in estimating the leaf area index (LAI) of different vegetation types for tropical areas. The objective of this study was to simulate the impact of different land use change scenarios (deforestation, afforestation and urbanization) on the water balance, using an improved SWAT model with vegetation growth calibrated from MODIS LAI data. The North Johnstone River catchment in wet tropical eastern Australia was selected as the case study area. Results showed that the modified SWAT model was able to reproduce smoothed MODIS LAI with NSE >= 0.59 (NSE < 0 for default SWAT), R-2 >= 0.70 (R-2 <= 0.66 for default SWAT), and vertical bar PBIAS vertical bar <= 2.5% (vertical bar PBIAS vertical bar >= 42% for default SWAT), and to predict monthly streamflow well with NSE >= 0.92 (NSE >= 0.90 for default SWAT), R-2 >= 0.94 (R-2 >= 0.90 for default SWAT). It is noted that SWAT-T had vertical bar PBIAS vertical bar <= 10% while vertical bar PBIAS vertical bar <= 5% for default SWAT. Land use change impacted all hydrological variables, with the impact on surface runoff being the most notable at yearly scale (8.9%, 5.7%, - 9.5% and 15.9% for scenario 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). Absolute changes of surface runoff under land use change scenarios differed across months, with the most notable absolute change occurring during the wet season (December to May) (1.2 similar to 6.6 mm, 1.0 similar to 3.5 mm, - 7.3 similar to -1.1 mm and 3.0 similar to 9.0 mm for scenario 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). Urbanization increased surface runoff (5.7% and 15.9% for scenario 2 and 4, respectively) and decreased lateral runoff (- 0.7% and - 1.3%) and groundwater (-0.9% and - 3.5%), but produced no clear change in total runoff (0.2% and 0.2%), actual evapotranspiration (- 0.3% and - 0.3%), and soil water (0.5% and 0.7%) at the annual time scale. Furthermore, afforestation could decrease surface runoff (- 9.5% for scenario 3) and soil water (- 2.0%), increase evapotranspiration (1.7%), and lead to slight changes (absolute values <= 0.8%) in other hydrological variables at the annual time scale. A strong positive correlation (r >= 0.94) was observed between annual rainfall and total runoff for forest-evergreen, range-grasses, and urban land use. Forest-evergreen generally produced less total runoff than range-grasses and urban land use under conditions of the same rainfall, terrain slope, and soil texture. In addition, urban land use generally produced more surface runoff and less lateral runoff and groundwater than forest-evergreen and range-grasses under the same conditions. These results contribute important information for development of effective adaptation strategies and future policy plans for sustainable water management in tropical eastern Australia.

TI  - Estimation of Surface Soil Moisture during Corn Growth Stage from SAR and Optical Data Using a Combined Scattering Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an indispensable ecological parameter, surface soil moisture (SSM) is of great significance for understanding the growth status of vegetation. The cooperative use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data has the advantage of considering both vegetation and underlying soil scattering information, which is suitable for SSM monitoring of vegetation areas. The main purpose of this paper is to establish an inversion approach using Terra-SAR and Landsat-7 data to estimate SSM at three different stages of corn growth in the irrigated area. A combined scattering model that can adequately represent the scattering characteristics of the vegetation coverage area is proposed by modifying the water cloud model (WCM) to reduce the effect of vegetation on the total SAR backscattering. The backscattering from the underlying soil is expressed by an empirical model with good performance in X-band. The modified water cloud model (MWCM) as a function of normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) considers the contribution of vegetation to the backscattering signal. An inversion technique based on artificial neural network (ANN) is used to invert the combined scattering model for SSM estimation. The inversion method is established and verified using datasets of three different growth stages of corn. Using the proposed method, we estimate the SSM with a correlation coefficient R >= 0.72 and root-mean-square error RMSE <= 0.043 cm(3)/cm(3) at the emergence stage, with R >= 0.87 and RMSE <= 0.046 cm(3)/cm(3) at the trefoil stage and with R >= 0.70 and RMSE <= 0.064 cm(3)/cm(3) at the jointing stage. The results suggest that the method proposed in this paper has operational potential in estimating SSM from Terra-SAR and Landsat-7 data at different stages of early corn growth.

TI  - Remote-Sensing Image Superresolution Based on Visual Saliency Analysis and Unequal Reconstruction Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing images (RSIs) generally have strong spatial characteristics for surface features. Various ground objects, such as residential areas, roads, forests, and rivers, differ substantially. According to this visual attention characteristic, regions with complicated texture features require more realistic details to reflect a better description of the topography, while regions such as farmlands should be smooth and have less noise. However, most existing single-image superresolution (SISR) methods fail to fully utilize these properties and therefore apply a uniform reconstruction strategy to the whole image. In this article, we propose a novel saliency-driven unequal single-image reconstruction network in which the demands of various regions in the superresolution (SR) process are distinguished by saliency maps. First, we design a new gradient-based saliency analysis method to produce more accurate saliency maps with imagewise annotations. The method utilizes the superiority of a multireception field to extract both high-level features and low-level features. Second, we propose a novel saliency-driven gate conditional generative adversarial network, where the saliency map is regarded as a medium during the training procedure of the whole network. The saliency map is regarded as a pixelwise condition in a generator to enhance the training capability of the network. Additionally, we design a new loss function that combines normalized content loss, saliency-driven perceptual loss, and gate-control adversarial loss to further refine details of texture-complex areas for RSIs. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm and compare it with many other state-of-the-art SR methods using a remote-sensing data set. The experimental results show that our approach achieves the optimal outcome in salient areas. Our method attains the best effect on global quality and visual performance.

TI  - Creating New Near-Surface Air Temperature Datasets to Understand Elevation-Dependent Warming in the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau has been undergoing accelerated warming over recent decades, and is considered an indicator for broader global warming phenomena. However, our understanding of warming rates with elevation in complex mountain regions is incomplete. The most serious concern is the lack of high-quality near-surface air temperature (Tair) datasets in these areas. To address this knowledge gap, we developed an automated mapping framework for the estimation of seamless daily minimum and maximum Land Surface Temperatures (LSTs) for the Tibetan Plateau from the existing MODIS LST products for a long period of time (i.e., 2002-present). Specific machine learning methods were developed and linked with target-oriented validation and then applied to convert LST to Tair. Spatial variables in retrieving Tair, such as solar radiation and vegetation indices, were used in estimation of Tair, whereas MODIS LST products were mainly focused on temporal variation in surface air temperature. We validated our process using independent Tair products, revealing more reliable estimates on Tair; the R-2 and RMSE at monthly scales generally fell in the range of 0.9-0.95 and 1-2 degrees C. Using these continuous and consistent Tair datasets, we found temperature increases in the elevation range between 2000-3000 m and 4000-5000 m, whereas the elevation interval at 6000-7000 m exhibits a cooling trend. The developed datasets, findings and methodology contribute to global studies on accelerated warming.

TI  - Assessing the Effects of Photovoltaic Powerplants on Surface Temperature Using Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of photovoltaic (PV) powerplants in the world has drawn attention on their climate and environmental impacts. In this study, we assessed the effects of PV powerplants on surface temperature using 23 largest PV powerplants in the world with thermal infrared remote sensing technique. Our result showed that the installation of the PV powerplants had significantly reduced the daily mean surface temperature by 0.53 degrees C in the PV powerplant areas. The cooling effect with the installation of the PV powerplants was much stronger during the daytime than the nighttime with the surface temperature dropped by 0.81 degrees C and 0.24 degrees C respectively. This cooling effect was also depended on the capacity of the powerplants with a cooling rate of -0.32, -0.48, and -0.14 degrees C/TWh, respectively, for daily mean, daytime, and nighttime temperature. We also found that the construction of the powerplants significantly decreased the surface albedo from 0.22 to 0.184, but significantly increased the effective albedo (surface albedo plus electricity conversion) from 0.22 to 0.244, suggesting conversion of solar energy to electrical energy is a major contributor to the observed surface cooling. Our further analyses showed that the nighttime cooling in the powerplants was significantly correlated with the latitude and elevation of the powerplants as well as the annual mean temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This means the temperature effect of the PV powerplants depended on regional geography, climate and vegetation conditions. This finding can be used to guide the selection of the sites of PV powerplants in the future.

TI  - Evaluating the Performance of Sentinel-3A OLCI Land Products for Gross Primary Productivity Estimation Using AmeriFlux Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable estimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) is of great significance in monitoring global carbon cycles. The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) and vegetation index products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are currently the most widely used data in evaluating GPP. The launch of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel-3 satellite provides the FAPAR and the OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI) products with higher temporal resolution and smoother spatial distribution than MODIS, having the potential to monitor terrain GPP. OTCI is one of the red-edge indices and is particularly sensitive to canopy chlorophyll content related to GPP. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the performance of OLCI FAPAR and OTCI for the estimation of GPP across seven biomes in 2017-2018. To this end, OLCI FAPAR and OTCI products in combination with insitu meteorological data were first integrated into the MODIS GPP algorithm and in three OTCI-driven models to simulate GPP. The modeled GPP (GPP(OLCI-FAPAR)and GPP(OTCI)) were then compared with flux tower GPP (GPP(EC)) for each site. Furthermore, the GPP(OLCI-FAPAR)and GPP derived from the MODIS FAPAR (GPP(MODIS-FAPAR)) were compared. Results showed that the performance of GPP(OLCI-FAPAR)was varied in different sites, with the highest R(2)of 0.76 and lowest R(2)of 0.45. The OTCI-driven models that include APAR data exhibited a significant relationship with GPP(EC)for all sites, and models using only OTCI provided the most varied performance, with the relationship between GPP(OTCI)and GPP(EC)from strong to nonsignificant. Moreover, GPP(OLCI-FAPAR)(R-2= 0.55) performed better than GPP(MODIS-FAPAR)(R-2= 0.44) across all biomes. These results demonstrate the potential of OLCI FAPAR and OTCI products in GPP estimation, and they also provide the basis for their combination with the soon-to-launch Fluorescence Explorer satellite and their integration with the Sentinel-3 land surface temperature product into light use models for GPP monitoring at regional and global scales.

TI  - Tracking Changing Evidences of Water in Wetland Using the Satellite Long-Term Observations from 1984 to 2017
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands have been degrading and reducing under the influences of human activity and climate change. Landsat long-term observations can help us better track the changing evidences of wetland habitats that would be valuable for guiding the restoration and conservation of wetland. In this study, we demonstrated the results of tracking the changing evidence of wetland habitats using Landsat observations from 1984 to 2017 through the case study of Baiyangdian wetland in China. We extracted the open water and classified the wetland habitats using collected 190 scenes from Landsat observations. As a result, we found that the yearly variations of wetland present phasic changes in three phases: 1988-1998, 1999-2011 and 2013-2017. The landscape of wetland habitats presented during 1989-1999 mostly show us the natural spatial pattern with less human disturbance traces compared to that during 2013-2017. The water environment, moreover, changed for the better after the 2010s, which indicated the encouraging effects of the environmental restoration project implemented from the year 2010. The current landscapes of wetland habitats, however, present lots of linear belts that are blocking the water cycles and ecological channels of aquatic plants and animals in the wetland. The areas in the northwestern wing and around the northeastern edge of the wetland are changing to be drier due to cropping activities and are at risk of wetland loss. These historical changing evidences could be a guideline for planning and designing restoration for the wetland.

TI  - Assessment of the Number of Valid Observations and Diurnal Changes in Chl-a for GOCI: Highlights for Geostationary Ocean Color Missions
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The first geostationary ocean color satellite mission (geostationary ocean color imager, or GOCI) has provided eight hourly observations per day over the western Pacific region since June 2010. GOCI imagery has been widely used to track the short-term dynamics of coastal and inland waters. Few studies have been performed to comprehensively assess the advantages of GOCI images in obtaining valid observations and estimating diurnal changes within the water column. Using the entire mission dataset between 2011 and 2017, these knowledge gaps were filled by comparing the daily percentages of valid observations (DPVOs) between GOCI and MODIS Aqua (MODISA) and by examining the diurnal changes in Chl-a over the East China Sea. The mean DPVOs of GOCI was 152.6% over the clear open ocean, suggesting that a daily valid coverage could be expected with GOCI. The GOCI DPVOs were similar to 26 times greater than the MODISA DPVOs; this pronounced difference was caused by the combined effects of their different observational frequencies and the more conservative quality flag system for MODISA. Diurnal changes in the GOCI-derived Chl-a were also found, with generally higher Chl-a in the afternoon than the morning and pronounced heterogeneities in the temporal and spatial domains. However, whether such diurnal changes are due to the real dynamics of the oceanic waters or artifacts of the satellite retrievals remains to be determined. This study provides the first comprehensive quantification of the unparalleled advantages of geostationary ocean color missions over polar orbiters, and the results highlights the importance of geostationary ocean color missions in studying coastal and inland waters.

TI  - Simulation and construction of the glacier mass balance in the Manas River Basin, Tianshan, China from 2000 to 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The glacier mass balance (GMB) is an important link between climate and water re-sources and has remarkable regulatory functions in river runoff. To simulate changes of the GMB and to analyze the recharge rates of glacier meltwater to runoff in the Manas River Basin (MRB) during 2000-2016, MOD11C3, TRMM 3B43 and other multi-source remote sensing data were used to drive the degree-day model. The results showed that: (1) the accuracy of the remote sensing meteorological data can be corrected effectively by constructing the temperature and precipitation inversion models, and the characteristics of glacial climate can be finely described through downscaling. The average annual temperature was -7.57 degrees C and the annual precipitation was 410.71 mm in the glacier area of the MRB. The zone at an altitude of about 4200 m was a severe climate change zone, and above and below that zone, the temperature drop rates were -0.03 degrees C/100 m and -0.57 degrees C/100 m, respectively, while precipitation gradients were -2.66 mm/100 m and 4.89 mm/100 m, respectively. (2) The overall GMB was negative with a cumulative GMB of up to -9811.19 mm w.e. and the average annual GMB fluctuated between -464.85 and -632.19 mm w.e. Besides, the glacier melted slowly during 2000-2002 and 2008-2010, but rapidly for 2002-2008 Sand 2010-2016, while the most serious loss of the glacier occurred in 2005-2009. Moreover, the vertical changes of the GMB increased at 244.83 mm w.e./100 m in the ablation zone but only at 18.77 mm w.e./100 m in the accumulation zone. (3) The intraannual runoff strongly responded to the change of the GMB especially in July and August when the loss of the GMB accounted for 75.4% of the annual loss, and when runoff accounted for 55.1% of the annual total. Due to differences in the annual precipitation and snow meltwater outside the glacier, the interannual glacier meltwater recharge rates fluctuated between 19% and 31%. The recharge rate of glacier meltwater to runoff in the MRB was close to that for other basins in the Tianshan Mountains, which may be used as a basis to confirm the reliability of the estimated GMB results. Furthermore, based on the present findings, it is recommended that the research community pursue studies on the GMB in other alpine river basins.

TI  - The change of cloud top height over East Asia during 2000-2018
T2  - ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to know how regional averaged cloud top height (CTH) responded to the past climatic change, the spatial and temporal variations of CTH based on MODIS data (MOD03_08_v6.0) from March 2000 to February 2018 are analyzed. The results show that the CTH in East Asia was higher in the southwest and lower in the northeast. The annual mean CTH was found to increase in East Asia at the rate of 0.020 km per year, of which, 0.035 km per year over the eastern land and 0.034 km per year over the eastern sea. The CTH changes statistically correlated with the sea surface temperature changes over the eastern sea (r = 0.68), which indicates that the CTH changes may be affected by the underlying surface. Statistically significant increasing trend of annual mean CTH was found in the latitude zone of 30 degrees-40 degrees N. Furthermore, CTH showed decreasing trends of about -0.030 km per year in the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Basin, Tarim Basin, Turpan Basin and northeastern Sichuan Basin in summer since more low cloud formations benefited to the decrease of CTH. In winter, the decreasing trend of CTH was found over the north of 40 degrees N, whereas the increasing trend was found over the south of 40 degrees N in East Asia.

TI  - Efficient Classification Method of Marine GIS Remote Sensing Database Under Dynamic Complex Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the traditional marine GIS database of remote sensing classification process, the classification accuracy is low, and the classification effect is not ideal. Therefore, an effective classification method based on relevant evidence for remote sensing database of marine GIS is proposed. The n-grain algorithm is used to calculate the GIS remote sensing data records, and the n-gram values representing the attributes of each record are obtained. The similarity of remote sensing data records is calculated, and the similar and repeated remote sensing data records are removed by sorting and merging. According to the theory of evidence and the relevant evidence synthesis method, the marine remote sensing data of GIS is applied to neural network classifier, and the classification is performed based on the results. The experimental results show that this method has the advantages of good performance, high classification accuracy, high recall rate, and high data-cleaning precision.

TI  - Estimation of Hourly near Surface Air Temperature Across Israel Using an Ensemble Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of near-surface air temperature (Ta) at high spatio-temporal resolution is essential for unbiased assessment of human health exposure to temperature extremes, not least given the observed trend of urbanization and global climate change. Data constraints have led previous studies to focus merely on daily Ta metrics, rather than hourly ones, making them insufficient for intra-day assessment of health exposure. In this study, we present a three-stage machine learning-based ensemble model to estimate hourly Ta at a high spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km(2), incorporating remotely sensed surface skin temperature (Ts) from geostationary satellites, reanalysis synoptic variables, and observations from weather stations, as well as auxiliary geospatial variables, which account for spatio-temporal variability of Ta. The Stage 1 model gap-fills hourly Ts at 4 x 4 km(2) from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI), which are subsequently fed into the Stage 2 model to estimate hourly Ta at the same spatio-temporal resolution. The Stage 3 model downscales the residuals between estimated and measured Ta to a grid of 1 x 1 km(2), taking into account additionally the monthly diurnal pattern of Ts derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. In each stage, the ensemble model synergizes estimates from the constituent base learners-random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-by applying a geographically weighted generalized additive model (GAM), which allows the weights of results from individual models to vary over space and time. Demonstrated for Israel for the period 2004-2017, the proposed ensemble model outperformed each of the two base learners. It also attained excellent five-fold cross-validated performance, with overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.8 and 0.9 degrees C, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.6 and 0.7 degrees C, and R-2 of 0.95 and 0.98 in Stage 1 and Stage 2, respectively. The Stage 3 model for downscaling Ta residuals to 1 km MODIS grids achieved overall RMSE of 0.3 degrees C, MAE of 0.5 degrees C, and R-2 of 0.63. The generated hourly 1 x 1 km(2) Ta thus serves as a foundation for monitoring and assessing human health exposure to temperature extremes at a larger geographical scale, helping to further minimize exposure misclassification in epidemiological studies.

TI  - Gastroprotective effect of gallic acid against ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rats: Involvement of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and anti-apoptosis role
T2  - BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid, GA) is a phenolic compound found in many medicinal plants traditionally used in China or patent medicine such as Feiyangchangweiyan capsule (FY capsule) for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases for decades. However, the evidence for the gastroprotective effect of GA is deficient and the pharmacological mechanisms remain limited. The present investigation was initiated to demonstrate the gastroprotective effect and to understand potential underlying mechanism of GA on ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rats. Gastric ulcers were induced by absolute ethanol (5 mL/kg, i.g.) in male Sprague-Dawley rats, GA (10, 30, and 50 mg/kg), FY capsule (0.4 g/kg) and 30 mg/kg Lansoprazole was administered orally. Physiological saline and lansoprazole were used as negative and positive control, respectively. Induction of rats with ethanol resulted in a significant rise in ulcer index, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines markers (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha), TBARS, protein expression of Bax and Caspase-3 and a significant reduction in the activities or levels of endogenous antioxidants (SOD, CAT and GSH), gastric mucosal protective factors (PGE2 and NO) and protein expression of Bcl-2. Pretreatment with GA showed a remarkable decrease in ulcer index, inflammatory cytokines markers, TBARS, protein expression of Bax and Caspase-3 and a significant increase in the activities of endogenous antioxidants, levels of PGE2 and NO, and protein expression of Bcl-2, Nrf2 and HO-1 when compared with ethanol treated groups. This study demonstrated the gastroprotective effect of Gallic acid and FY capsule on ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rats. The underlying mechanism of GA and FY capsule against gastric ulcer in rats caused by ethanol might be involved in Nrf2/HO-1 anti-oxidative pathway and ultimately played an anti-apoptotic role through regulating Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3.

T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - With the ecological environment problems being increasingly prominent and globalized , more and more attention is paid to environmental protection. Remote sensing technology is important in monitoring and evaluating ecological environment. In this study , based on the Landsat image data of 1992, 2000, 2008 and 2017, the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) was constructed to monitor and evaluate the quality of ecological environment in Hangjin Banner, Inner Mongolia, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for local ecological environment protection. The results showed that from 1992 to 2017, the quality of ecological environment in Hangjin Banner was generally poor, with RESI grades of poor and inferior. The mean value of RESI increased from 0.31 (1992) to 0.37 (2008) and then decreased to 0.30 (2017 ). During the period , the change range was mainly from one grade to the next. In terms of spatial distribution, the regions with poor ecological environment quality were mainly in the desert plains of the central and western regions, that with good ecological quality mainly along the Yellow River and in the southeast, and that with large fluctuation of ecological quality grade mainly in the desert edge along the Yellow River and in the hilly and gully regions in the east. During the research period , the center of gravity of each ecological grade in Hangjin Banner substantially shifted, with spatiotemporal fluctuations. Our results suggest that ecological environment of Hangjin Banner was fragile and unstable. Ecological construction can promote the quality of ecological environment, but resources and land use should also be reasonably allocated.

TI  - Spatio-temporal characteristics of vegetation water use efficiency and their relationships with climatic factors in alpine and subalpine area of southwestern China
T2  - Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator for understanding the coupling and trade-off relationships between ecosystem water and carbon cycles. In order to reveal the response and adaptation characteristics of different vegetation types to climate change regionally, we examined the trends, altitudinal distributions, and spatial variations of WUE in nine vegetation types in the alpine and subalpine area of southwestern China during the period of 2000-2014.Methods We estimated the vegetation WUE using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (El) products, and the gridded climate data interpolated from Aunsplin. Trend analysis and correlation analysis were conducted to examine the relationships between vegetation WUE and other factors, including air temperature, precipitation, and elevation.Important findings The results showed that: (1) The average annual WUE in the study region was 0.95 g.m(-2).mm(-1) with a significantly increasing trend at 0.011 g.m(-2).mm(-1).a(-1) from 2000 to 2014. The average WUE showed a pattern of higher in the southeast region but lower in the northwest region, and the WUE was found increased in 85.84% of study area. (2) The average WUEs were increasing in all vegetation types, and the WUEs showed a gradient of evergreen needleleaf forest > savannas > evergreen broadleaf forest > woody savannas > cropland > deciduous broadleaf forest > mixed forest > closed shrublands > grassland. (3) The WUE was positively correlated with air temperature in 89.56% of the study area, but it was negatively correlated with precipitation in 92.54% of the study area. The highest correlation between WUE and air temperature was found in grassland, while the highest correlation between WUE and precipitation was identified in woody savannas. (4) As the regional climax vegetation type in southwestern China, the evergreen needleleaf forest's WUE has high adaptation abilities to both altitudinal change and climate change.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports a five-year computer-mediated intercultural exchange project between Chinese and American university students that explores the use of various social media tools with WeChat application as the main medium in collaborative intercultural assignments. The study combines quantitative and qualitative approaches by using questionnaires and action research, to investigate how Chinese EFL and American CFL learners increase their intercultural communication competence by assessing their knowledge, awareness, attitudes, and skills of discovery and awareness. The findings reveal their changes and progress in the following variables: knowledge about the variety and subtlety of both the home and target cultures, a different worldview, and cultural study methods; awareness of the importance of differences and similarities between the home and target cultures, their negative reactions to these differences (e.g., fear, ridicule, disgust, feeling of superiority, etc.) and therefore, critical evaluation of the target and home cultures; attitudes from excitement or blind admiration of the target culture to confusion, anxiety or frustration about the cultural differences, later to toleration and appreciation of cultural differences, adaptation to the target culture, and eventually to openness and readiness to suspend disbelief about other cultures and belief about one's own; skills to contrast the target culture with their own, to demonstrate a capacity to interact appropriately in a variety of different social situations in the target culture and resolve cross-cultural conflicts and misunderstandings. This research will serve as a valuable reference for computer-mediated intercultural communication teaching and open up new possibilities to extend classroom teaching by bridging the gap between second-hand knowledge and hands-on experience.

TI  - RFI Source Localization in Microwave Interferometric Radiometry: A Sparse Signal Reconstruction Perspective
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Microwave Interferometric Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) is the payload of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission led by the European Space Agency. Although the MIRAS operates at the protected L-band, it is perturbed by radio frequency interferences (RFIs) that contaminate the acquired remote sensing data and further deteriorate the total performance of SMOS mission. Accurate location information of these sources is crucial for switching off illegal RFI emitters or mitigating RFI impacts from contaminated data. This article addresses the localization of SMOS RFI sources from a perspective of sparse signal reconstruction (SSR), which exploits the sparsity of RFI sources in the spatial domain. Such an SSR strategy possesses superior (at least comparable) performances over existing RFI localization methods [e.g., discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) inversion and subspace-based direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation] using only SMOS measurements and even under situations in the presence of data missing due to correlator failures.

TI  - Estimation of the Restored Forest Spatial Structure in Semi-Arid Mine Dumps Using Worldview-2 Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest monitoring is critical to the management and successful evaluation of ecological restoration in mined areas. However, in the past, available monitoring has mainly focused on traditional parameters and lacked estimation of the spatial structural parameters (SSPs) of forests. The SSPs are important indicators of forest health and resilience. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of estimating the SSPs of restored forest in semi-arid mine dumps using Worldview-2 imagery. We used the random forest to extract the dominant feature factor subset; then, a regression model and mind evolutionary algorithm-back propagation (MEA-BP) neural network model were established to estimate the forest SSP. The results show that the textural features found using 3 x 3 window have a relatively high importance score in the random forest model. This indicates that the 3 x 3 texture factors have a relatively strong ability to explain the restored forest SSPs when compared with spectral factors. The optimal regression model has anR(2)of 0.6174 and an MSRE of 0.1001. The optimal MEA-BP neural network model has anR(2)of 0.6975 and an MSRE of 0.0906, which shows that the MEA-BP neural network has greater accuracy than the regression model. The estimation shows that the tree-shrub-grass mode with an average of 0.7351 has the highest SSP, irrespective of the restoration age. In addition, the SSP of each forest configuration type increases with the increase in restoration age except for the single grass configuration. The increase range of SSP across all modes was 0.0047-0.1471 after more than ten years of restoration. In conclusion, the spatial structure of a mixed forest mode is relatively complex. Application cases show that Worldview-2 imagery and the MEA-BP neural network method can support the effective evaluation of the spatial structure of restored forest in semi-arid mine dumps.

TI  - Modeling and Performance Analysis for Satellite Data Relay Networks Using Two-Dimensional Markov-Modulated Process
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite Data Relay Networks (SDRNs) play an important role in the data relay from User Satellites (USs) to ground stations by Tracking Data Relay Satellites (TDRSs). For better exploitation of SDRNs, the development of the systematic model and accurate system analysis is essential. To describe the end-to-end data transmission in SDRNs, we construct an MMOO/MMSP/1/K-G/G/1 tandem queuing model where the two parts depict the traffic arrival and transmission service of USs and TDRSs, respectively. Because the active and inactive periods of the data transmission are determined by the visibility between two satellites, classical buffer state based vacation policies become imprecise. Moreover, these two kinds of periods appear alternatively and their duration varies over time so that it is hard to model such intermittent transmission by existing service models. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo based Markov Modulated Service Process (MMSP) which can tightly match the distributions of the active and inactive periods. In this process, we propose two algorithms to calculate the service state transition probability and the number of the sub-states in each service state, respectively, which guarantees the alternative transition between the active and inactive states as well as the sojourn time spent in each state. For the quality of service analysis, we find the different features of the queue variation under different arrival and service rate conditions. By separately calculating the related mean queue lengths and emergence probabilities, we first derive the expressions of the system loss probability, mean queue length, and mean delay. Finally, we conduct numerous simulations to verify the accuracy of our system model and performance evaluation, which provides the guidance to the buffer design and transmission resource allocation.

AB  - Accurate methods to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) of mangroves are required to monitor the subtle changes over time and assess their carbon sequestration. The AGB of forests is a function of canopy-related information (canopy density, vegetation status), structures, and tree heights. However, few studies have attended to integrating these factors to build models of the AGB of mangrove plantations. The objective of this study was to develop an accurate and robust biomass estimation of mangrove plantations using Chinese satellite optical, SAR, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data based digital surface models (DSM). This paper chose Qi'ao Island, which forms the largest contiguous area of mangrove plantation in China, as the study area. Several field visits collected 127 AGB samples. The models for AGB estimation were developed using the random forest algorithm and integrating images from multiple sources: optical images from Gaofen-2 (GF-2), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from Gaofen-3 (GF-3), and UAV-based digital surface model (DSM) data. The performance of the models was assessed using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and relative RMSE (RMSEr), based on five-fold cross-validation and stratified random sampling approach. The results showed that images from the GF-2 optical (RMSE = 33.49 t/ha, RMSEr = 21.55%) or GF-3 SAR (RMSE = 35.32 t/ha, RMSEr = 22.72%) can be used appropriately to monitor the AGB of the mangrove plantation. The AGB models derived from a combination of the GF-2 and GF-3 datasets yielded a higher accuracy (RMSE = 29.89 t/ha, RMSEr = 19.23%) than models that used only one of them. The model that used both datasets showed a reduction of 2.32% and 3.49% in RMSEr over the GF-2 and GF-3 models, respectively. On the DSM dataset, the proposed model yielded the highest accuracy of AGB (RMSE = 25.69 t/ha, RMSEr = 16.53%). The DSM data were identified as the most important variable, due to mitigating the saturation effect observed in the optical and SAR images for a dense AGB estimation of the mangroves. The resulting map, derived from the most accurate model, was consistent with the results of field investigations and the mangrove plantation sequences. Our results indicated that the AGB can be accurately measured by integrating images from the optical, SAR, and DSM datasets to adequately represent canopy-related information, forest structures, and tree heights.
